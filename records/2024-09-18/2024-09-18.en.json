    "commentBody": "Apple mobile processors are now made in America by TSMC (timculpan.substack.com)1367 points by colinprince 17 hours agohidepastfavorite656 comments epistasis 16 hours agoAfter all the wailing and rending of clothes, the industrial policy worked out great and we have top tier production here in the US, transferring knowledge from TSMC to a US workforce. This is a significant win for the US, and just the beginning of the amazing industrial policy passed over the past few years. US manufacturing is about to be reinvigorated, and we in the US are going to be building our own future both for chips and for energy security. This is great news, and we should celebrate. reply mlyle 16 hours agoparent> US manufacturing is about to be reinvigorated One thing that I think that frequently eludes people in this discussion is that US manufacturing has pretty much been constantly growing for the past century; just its share of GDP has fallen as other sectors have grown faster. And the share of the workforce has fallen even faster, as the actual manufacturing has moved towards higher value items and greater degrees of automation. I think the actual outcome of this policy is mixed. I think it was a big case of corporate welfare that will result in somewhat increased chip production in the US. I think this is a win for national security. I don't think the government applying such levers to change how the market allocates capital probably won't be a win for economic output or quality of life. reply AnthonyMouse 5 hours agorootparent> One thing that I think that frequently eludes people in this discussion is that US manufacturing has pretty much been constantly growing for the past century; just its share of GDP has fallen as other sectors have grown faster. And the share of the workforce has fallen even faster, as the actual manufacturing has moved towards higher value items and greater degrees of automation. The last part is missing something important though. If we're measuring \"output\" in dollars and the US is doing the parts (like aircraft manufacturing) that globally don't have a lot of competitors, the high \"output\" is from high prices rather than high production, and then what we're doing is surviving in the markets where there isn't a lot of competition and getting killed in the markets where there is. There are three problems with this. The first is that it implies the US isn't competitive in competitive markets, which is a sign that something is very messed up. The second is that the markets where other countries aren't competitive tend to get eroded over time. The US essentially had a lock on the auto market in the mid-20th century; not anymore. What happens when China starts making globally competitive aircraft? And the third is that supply chains matter. If you give up on the low margin stuff instead of figuring out how to make it competitively domestically (e.g. via automation) then foreign competitors have a leg up when it comes to making the high margin stuff for which the commodities are inputs. > I don't think the government applying such levers to change how the market allocates capital probably won't be a win for economic output or quality of life. Relying on \"free markets\" actually requires free markets. If other countries are willing to subsidize their industries until they drive manufacturing out of the US, that's not a free market. It's the equivalent of a monopolist using dumping and tying to leverage their existing monopoly into new markets, but with a country acting as the monopolist and therefore being exempt from antitrust enforcement. Doing the same thing in return is not likely to be an efficient strategy, but neither is the status quo. The main alternative would be to realize that the thing we've been calling \"free trade\" is not actually that and a country that subsidizes its industries until its US competitors exit the market has to be dealt with as an abusive monopolist, e.g. via tariffs and similar policy levers, since antitrust laws don't apply to foreign governments. reply bluGill 4 hours agorootparentWe are not only measuring in dollars. We measure tons of steel, number of cars produced and so on. Not all of those measures are growing, but many are. While market share has gone down, total production is up. Take cars - https://www.bts.gov/content/annual-us-motor-vehicle-producti... US production is up greatly in 2019 (that is before Covid - the chart doesn't have after Covid numbers to work with). US production is up by a lot since 1960. However in 1960 the US population was lower, and your typical family only had one car (women often didn't even have a drivers license). Thus you see market share is down while production is up. reply _heimdall 1 hour agorootparentThe ratio of domestic sales and domestic production has widened over the same period. In 1970 the ratio of domestic production to domestic sales was .933, in 2019 that ratio is .796. Though we are making more total cars, were making a smaller percentage of all cars sold. As another commenter pointed out, the cars we make today are amalgamation of parts and design work done overseas. That isn't necessarily a bad thing if you view globalization favorably, but it is another factor when considering the value created in the US with regards to vehicle production. reply treis 3 hours agorootparentprevEh this is bending the word \"produced\". In 1960 all the parts were made in the US likely from raw materials mined & refined in the US. That's very different from today. reply johnmaguire 4 hours agorootparentprevCan you explain how tariffs are an effective tool against foreign governments subsidizing industries? It has been my understanding that tariffs typically end up being tit-for-tat and relatively zero-sum. reply tivert 4 hours agorootparent> Can you explain how tariffs are an effective tool against foreign governments subsidizing industries? It has been my understanding that tariffs typically end up being tit-for-tat and relatively zero-sum. They neutralize the subsidy's effect on pricing and prevent the subsidizer from taking over your market, at least. > It has been my understanding that tariffs typically end up being tit-for-tat and relatively zero-sum. The subsidy is already a tit, the tariff is tat. Zero-sum is at least better than just taking the blow and having a negative-sum outcome for yourself. reply saint_fiasco 3 hours agorootparent> The subsidy is already a tit, the tariff is tat Why is someone else subsidizing the price of a thing you buy bad? The subsidy is doing you a favor by reducing your input costs, or freeing up your work and capital to produce something else. reply kranke155 2 hours agorootparentBecause they are doing so to erode your manufacturing base through unfair competition. From a national security standpoint this can be deadly in a hot conflict. From an industrial strategy standpoint, it’s the same as any other monopolist practice - they will erode your base, take over your market, then raise prices to fleece your population’s wealth while increasing their own. Industrial bases are economic strongholds that shouldn’t be lost, particularly not to great power competitors. reply saint_fiasco 2 hours agorootparent> From a national security standpoint this can be deadly in a hot conflict. What about a cold conflict? How much do the tariffs and protectionist policies cost in the middle to long run?

How many additional aircraft carriers and submarines and so on could the US have bought with that money? reply kranke155 2 hours agorootparentTariffs and protectionist policies are unfairly maligned. They are effectively the only way countries build and rebuild industries. The idea that they are bad is an invention of bad economists who don't study history. See the book \"How Asia Works\" for an accurate economic history of the growth of industrial power in Asia, how it was based on Germany's ascension before it, and how it was al built on the RIGHT kind of policies. https://www.gatesnotes.com/How-Asia-Works Successful Asian powers studied history, not Milton Friedman. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_school_of_economics reply trashtester 17 minutes agorootparentTariffs that merely offset subsidies in the other country has zero net effect on competition, and doesn't harm producers on either side unduely. The net effect is merely a net transfer from the foreign government to the domestic one. Tariffs that go BEYOND the subsidies in the foreign country has a net protectionist effect. This CAN cause stagnation in the industry in question. But less so if there is still healthy domestic competition. Subsidies are potentially the most destructive measure. This is especially true for protectionist subsidies, and less so for export subsidies. But in general, subsides sets up a cash transfer facility between a government and local industry, often removing incentives to innovate. In turn, this means that the subsidies need to increase year by year to have the desired effect. This can lead to the subsidized industry dying a sudden death once public patience for the growing subisides (and so the subisides themselves) come to an end. saint_fiasco 1 hour agorootparentprevI don't disagree, you can definitely build more industries with tariffs and protectionism. I just don't see the point. I'm a consumerist at heart. As long as consumers get to consume, it does not matter to me whose industry is doing the producing. I get that your foreign suppliers can turn on you and raise prices. I think the money you make during peacetime by not putting tariffs will let you buy more weapons and bribe more allies so that the foreign suppliers don't try anything too awful with the supply chains. Stockpiles can buy a lot of time to restart industry in an emergency or at least find a different foreign supplier. Take a look at Russia, they are sanctioned by half the planet and they still keep going on a reduced industry because they had huge stockpiles of tanks, artillery and so on. Imagine something like that but with a military that doesn't suck. Nobody would even dare try a sanction. reply kranke155 37 minutes agorootparentThe point is that unfortunately geopolitics ends up in an eternal competitive state. Losing your industrial base and giving it away to a geopolitical competitor is almost certainly an error in the long run. Large industrial bases also are correlated with healthier middle class societies, according to Vaclav Smil, and in my experience, he’s exactly right. So losing the industrial base is fine for you, a service sector worker, but it’s bad for the country and it’s bad for society, if you want it to have a healthy middle class. reply saint_fiasco 18 minutes agorootparentMost of the country works in the service sector. It's not like I'm some kind of out of touch elite. The ones who are most hurt by tariffs, most affected by higher prices, are the working class. Sure, the workers of the specific industries that are lucky enough to be protected, the ones with the most persuasive lobbies, will certainly benefit. But every other worker will be a little worse off. If you are concerned about the people who got hurt by globalization, maybe the government should collect money from people like us and spend it on people like them. They can set up the tax in such a way that rich people pay the most. But if you use tariffs to help the people who got hurt by globalization, you cannot set it up in such a careful way. It's a blunt instrument that hurts productivity across the board and increases the prices to the end consumer. It becomes an implicit tax that poor people pay the most. An actual explicit tax would hurt much less.

That doesn't mean manufacturing doesn't exist in the US, though, and there are still very large EMS firms with significant presence domestically, like Jabil, Flex, Celestica, Sanmina, and plenty of others. The difference between now and 25 years ago is that it hasn't been cost effective to manufacture high volume, low complexity electronics in the US for a full generation. But, the majoarity of high complexity, low volume (NPI, very large PCBs, PCBs with many complex layers) stuff is still made in the west, and there will always be meaningful demand for high tech manufacturing in regulated industries (defense, medical), too. For example, CGMs are made in Alabama & Ireland, avionics for Apache helicopters are made in Alabama, data center server racks for Meta are assembled in Finland, Germany & San Jose. Same for Netflix CDN racks. It goes on and on. The majority of what has been outsourced to China (and Taiwan and Singapore and India and Vietnam) is the \"face\" of high tech electronics, and the majority of electronic piece parts components, but not final assembly and not much of the tricky stuff.

The main thesis of the book is that honest and competent civil servants are the most rare and precious resource a country has, especially a poor one, so policies should economies on their labour. So eg you should privatise a state-owned company by auctioning it off in one piece to the highest cash-bidder open to all comers from anywhere, no questions asked.

It should also be pointed out that economic goodness is not and should not be the be-all end-all reason for government spending. Governments building parks, for example, is a social good with little economic value (or at very least hard to quantify benefits). In the case of things like medicine, government spending there has a social good of limiting communicable disease which is more important than how much money a drug company can make off a drug. For something like TSMC putting plants in the US, even if it's somewhat economically disadvantageous we are still talking about bringing onshore more jobs and training for US citizens which will generally increase our capabilities here and the satisfaction of those employees. Trying to get onshore development of electronics, the government basically has 2 levers to pull, either subsidizing building new manufacturing or applying tariffs to incoming tech goods. One of those levers has the negative consequence of raising prices on tech goods for everyone while we wait for manufacturing to build out. reply trashtester 7 minutes agorootparentThe main reason for TSMC to build plants in the US is as a hedge against a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.

We could try and incentivize a company like Apple to fabricate in the US, but the simple fact is that (until recently with the new TSMC fabs) we did not have the fabrication capabilities in the US needed to make apple silicon. Apple does not have the capabilities to make these fabs either. You can cut taxes to 0 for US fabrication plants, but there are simple overhead costs that are hard to get away from. That's why an actual subsidy is needed.

Per-dollar, I think the average American taxpayer is probably very happy with the government’s investment in, for example, the Heavy Press Program (= modern airplane airframes) and resilient packet switched networking (= the Internet). Or more directly: it’s hard to even imagine a contemporary national or international industry without the economic interventions that produced those things. reply eru 3 hours agorootparentI know, imagining things is hard. But that's not much evidence either way. Yes, there might be some government programs that look like a good deal in retrospect. Just like some lottery tickets are winners. The heavy press program even turned a profit, if I remember right. Though private enterprise is usually pretty good at funding these kinds of projects, even with long lead times. (See eg how Amazon or Tesla or even Microsoft took ages to return capital to investors, but still had enthusiastic shareholders.) I don't know specifically about packet switching, but you hear similar arguments about the invention of the computer. In our reality, programmable electronic computers owe a lot to government and specifically military funding. But as a thought exercise, perhaps you can imagine an alternative history without WW2: IBM already made computing devices for business long before the war, and it's relatively easy to see how they would have eventually come up with a programmable electronic computer. Compare also Konrad Zuse's work in Germany: > After graduation, Zuse worked for the Ford Motor Company, using his artistic skills in the design of advertisements.[14] He started work as a design engineer at the Henschel aircraft factory in Schönefeld near Berlin. This required the performance of many routine calculations by hand, leading him to theorize and plan a way of doing them by machine.[21] > Beginning in 1935, he experimented in the construction of computers in his parents' flat on Wrangelstraße 38, moving with them into their new flat on Methfesselstraße 10, the street leading up the Kreuzberg, Berlin.[22]: 418 Working in his parents' apartment in 1936, he produced his first attempt, the Z1, a floating-point binary mechanical calculator with limited programmability, reading instructions from a perforated 35 mm film.[14] Zuse Z1 replica in the German Museum of Technology in Berlin > In 1937, Zuse submitted two patents that anticipated a von Neumann architecture. In 1938, he finished the Z1 which contained some 30,000 metal parts and never worked well due to insufficient mechanical precision. On 30 January 1944, the Z1 and its original blueprints were destroyed with his parents' flat and many neighbouring buildings by a British air raid in World War II.[22]: 426 > Zuse completed his work entirely independently of other leading computer scientists and mathematicians of his day. Between 1936 and 1945, he was in near-total intellectual isolation.[23] In our real history, the US and UK armed forces came first, but a world with more resources in the hands of the private sector (and also with less war) would have surely accelerated some of these private computing experiments (IBM or Konrad Zuse or someone else), and we would have seen computers at roughly the same time as in ours, or perhaps even sooner. Similarly, the real history of packet switching is heavily intertwined with some US government projects. But even just browsing Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching tells you about other attempts and projects going on around the same time. So the government's investment probably did not speed up things by that much, even before you consider that in our counter-factual the private sector would have more resources. reply woodruffw 3 hours agorootparent> I know, imagining things is hard. But that's not much evidence either way. Imagining is easy; \"hard to imagine\" is an English idiom for \"that seems implausible\" :-) You're providing examples that counter the impact of government innovation, but it's unclear to me whether these are true counterexamples. The history for IBM, for example, is almost entirely intertwined with IBM's role as a defense contractor. Zuse's second computer (the Z2) was funded directly by the German government, presumably because it aligned with Nazi military interests. (As a whole, these things are impossible to extricate: it's clear that the government doesn't create every possible idea, and there are an infinite number of innovations that can't be assigned back to government sponsorship. But I think there's general academic consensus that computing, aerospace, and biotech all progressed at rates beyond their equivalent private sector capacity due to government investment, and that the resulting progress was \"worth it\" in terms of returned economic and social value.) reply eru 2 hours agorootparentYes, that's why I talked about Zuse's earlier work.

It depends on your counterfactual. If government had taxed the same funds, but spent it on something else, yes, we would have had less progress in these specific sectors. If they had taxed and intervened less, perhaps we would have had more? And, of course, we picked these sectors out after the fact.

Possibly, if the government hadn’t subsidized them, but instead had had lower taxation, other industry segments would have blossomed, and gotten better benefits for society. As an example, US government support for the Internet may have led to larger automation, making labor relatively more expensive, and because of that decreasing the size of the middle class. Opinions will differ on whether that’s a net positive. reply woodruffw 4 hours agorootparentI think there’s too many layers of counterfactuals here: much of the government’s economic intervention stems from a (perceived) need that transcends ordinary economic concerns.

This is thousands of sliders that we adjust for each industry. You always have to consider the opportunity cost. Sure, perhaps we've ended greater security and have also ended up with vibrant industry A at the end of it; but we maybe had to pay by hurting industries B, C, and D.

But this is exactly what Econ 101 tells you to expect to happen (and I teach Econ 101 ;) . Countries specialize to maximize comparative advantage. If you are the US and can manufacture high value items at a lower opportunity cost (or high value services at a lower opportunity cost), you will, but this means giving up on doing other things you could use the resources for. The net result is that US manufacturing output in real dollars has increased 4x, in the past 70 years. At the same time, its share of the economy has shrunk (because other sectors have outgrown it), and many lower value manufacturing subsectors have been largely abandoned. reply mitthrowaway2 15 hours agorootparentMaybe our economic policy should go deeper than 101-level economics then! Because comparative advantage is a dynamic quantity which changes over time, and while some advantages (like geography) are fixed, others are built by investment. Here's a video [1] which explains why, in 1955, manufacturing household goods was cheaper to make in the US than in China (and why, at the time, they thought this manufacturing dominance was the thing that backed the US position as a global superpower). It's not because Americans worked more cheaply than Chinese workers, it's because American factories had a well-developed tool-and-die expertise, which meant that when anyone in the world wanted to make something, they were well-advised to travel the US to get it made. Econ 101's comparative advantage is true at an instantaneous point in time, which is a good start, but if perhaps it's just \"knowing enough to be dangerous\". Economic policymakers (and company leaders) would do well to think about comparative advantage as planning an optimal trajectory over time, which can mean sacrificing a short-term optimum in exchange for a long-term optimum, and if there even is a textbook solution for that, it's going to look less like a 101-level intersection of straight lines, and more like an iterative optimization over nonlinear differential equations.

And, sure, there are absolutely network effects with related goods and industries that have steepened that movement.

It is all about estimating gradients and plotting trajectories in dynamical economic systems. reply mitthrowaway2 15 hours agorootparentThe feeling of misunderstanding is mutual! I agree that there was more profit to be made elsewhere. But I'm arguing that those profits were short-term profits which may well have come at long-term expense. If you follow the local gradient of profitability, you'll always find great short-term returns selling off your seed corn. Unlike what Econ 101 asserts about maximizing comparative advantage being the most profitable strategy, there is absolutely no guarantee that following a locally-optimal comparative-advantage strategy is globally optimal over a long-term window, where advantages are path-dependent. Manufacturing is the core example of path-dependent advantages, because (unlike what any econ 101 textbook teaches), marginal costs decline with increasing production quantity in the manufacturing sector. This means the more you make, the better you are at making more things! reply ta_1138 13 hours agorootparentFun fact: You should sell your seed corn, because the best hybrid seeds, crossed from especially made inbreds that you'd never want to use for yield, are so much better than the second generation crossing that you'll always lose money replanting. There is never any guarantee that profits are long term or short term, or that your manufacturing specialization is going to remain useful, instead of being a dead end. Retaining specialization on, say, cathod tubes wasn't exactly profitable. See all the camera manufacturers that zigged when they should have zagged, and used their manufacturing strength to unprofitability. All of this is hidden by talking about 'manufacturing' in very large terms, but the real world doesn't work like that. Specifically, semiconductors were a very nice place to keep expertise in, and paid off. Internal combustion engines, and filaments for incandescent lighbulbs probably not. Even in cases where we are looking at the same kind of manufacturing in multiple places, competitive advantages are lost. There are parts of Europe taht still have metallurgy and never attempted to divest, but lost comparative advantages because better technology came in at the wrong time in the capital depreciation curve: They invested heavily at the slightly wrong time, still had expensive labor, so they became far less competitive, at least for a while. Did they not pray enough to the manufacturing god? Did the Netherlands get lucky, or was sufficient dedication to manufacturing that led them to have ASML in their borders? Is the fact that Novo Nordisk found the most important pharmaceutical in the world a matter of Danish superior industrial policy, or did they just get lucky compared to the many other places with large investments in pharma that didn't get anywhere near that lucky?

Like I said in my previous comment, though, this doesn't mean the capability to build has left the US (or Europe).

Do you really feel otherwise? Of course, economic assessments and the behavior of markets generally assumes free choice by participants. So there's always: 1. Geopolitical risks: state leverage can turn a local absolute advantage in e.g. producing war materiel into other advantages. 2. Sure, we could back ourselves into a corner, ultimately, by not being able to provide a key part of the value chain by following that gradient. (Geopolitics can be related, too, in that states can gather together lots of small advantages and use them in coordinated ways against other states). So our state, of course, needs to focus on countering those actions of other parties. And maintaining some diversity beyond what is economically optimal can add resilience. (One point I make in class: our textbook pretty much says that price controls are always dumb... but that there are plenty of reasons that a country might desire to have a surplus of food or to not be dependent upon another country). The track record of those who would seek to centrally plan and optimize for some future outcome instead of following that profit gradient has been very poor. Not to say that it's never worked: but generally following the profit gradient has yielded better outcomes. > because of (unlike what any econ 101 textbook teaches), marginal costs decline with production quantity in the manufacturing sector.

The behavior of markets assumes free choices by participants that rewards the participants who make those choices. I do not dispute that the CEOs who were responsible for shipping supply chains to China were following their incentives, and it worked out well for them. I would argue that there are alterations to regulations on corporate governance which would increase long-term profitability of those corporations overall, but that the key people in the corporations aren't properly incentivized to pass them, nor are shareholders sufficiently informed or coordinated. > Talking about LRATC, returns to scale, etc, is a big part of my unit 3 In your unit 3, do you draw LRATC curve as a parabola?

Incentives can be, and often are misaligned. However, the context of our discussion is talking about large overall economic growth that has outpaced manufacturing growth, even though it is still positive. This isn't evidence of misaligned incentives. > In your unit 3, do you draw LRATC curve as a parabola? Because that's the wrong shape for manufactured goods. It's absolutely a bathtub. It's steep-downward sloping, mostly flat for a loooooonnnggg time, and then upward sloping. Indeed, this understanding of the shape of LRATC originally comes from study of manufactured goods. At some point coordination gets hard and further increases in quantity require using resources that are not well suited for the task. Of course, the quantity at which costs slope upwards may be at an impractically large quantity for any industry-- in which case that industry is likely to be a natural monopoly. And there are some recent arguments that coordination is easier thanks to information technology and that it is even harder to reach diseconomies of scale. reply mitthrowaway2 14 hours agorootparent> It's absolutely a bathtub. I endeavour to convince you that you are teaching your students a falsehood. Natural resource industries have bathtub-shaped average costs. Average costs fall strictly monotonically for manufacturing, and marginal costs either fall or remain constant. Constant marginal costs are what you get if you don't even bother to solve coordination problems, and just copy-and-paste your whole assembly line instead (except even then you can't help but gain economies of scale, if only from your tooling suppliers). The misconception that it's a bathtub does not come from the study of manufactured goods, it comes from thought experiments about manufactured goods done by people who never managed quote requests at a real factory. Empirical studies done on actual firms almost never show rising marginal costs at any quantity. That this error has permeated introductory economics is a very, very big problem. reply mlyle 14 hours agorootparent> Constant marginal costs are what you get if you don't even bother to solve coordination problems You still have coordination problems on the supply and distribution side. > Average costs fall strictly monotonically for manufacturing This is an extraordinary claim that is easy to refute with simple thought experiments. e.g. You think that if I want 103% of the units that a set of equipment from ASML can deliver, that average costs will be lower than producing 100%? Or do you mean \"strictly monotonically\" in some other sense? Being able to vary your capital in the long run doesn't mean that you can have 10.3 sets of photolithography apparatus. > and just copy-and-paste your whole assembly line instead If you copy and paste and have everything truly independent, without the need for any coordination of resources, what you effectively have is multiple firms. In practice, firms still need to allocate scarce resources among lines. > The misconception that it's a bathtub does not come from the study of manufactured goods , it comes from thought experiments about manufactured goods This is a falsehood. Bain conducted reams of real-world research on manufacturing, plant size, firm size, and returns to scale, and this informs today's idea of LRAC. Of course, this research is 70 years old, and recent data is more ambiguous.

He wrote a book called the “Harmony of Interests” about the need for state policy + markets (to contrast with purely free markets). Lots of data and rigorous argumentation.

If your factory can make N widgets per year, and you want to make N+1 widgets, the marginal cost of the N+1th widget is vastly greater than the Nth widget. reply hyeonwho4 4 hours agorootparentI think the parent comment was talking about building factories and amortizing their costs over your unit production, whereas you assume the factory is a fixed cost with fixed capacity and looking at the marginal cost to produce a unit, which is really rare in many real world situations. For most goods, the factory doesn't run anywhere near N, and the fixed costs are 6 or more orders of magnitude higher than the marginal widget costs, so your business is well served just by finding any method to use that plant more effectivly. As an example, I was quoted $60,000 for a mold which would have produced parts at $0.005. (Very small plastic widgets.) At that ratio, any amount of scale will increase my profit, since the marginal costs, even if they increase by a factor of 10 or 100, are negligible to the cost of the tooling. (And the global market for this widget is measured in hundreds of units.) Any amount of reusing the mold is going to save me money. Sure we have problems if we need N+1 widgets in less than 1/N more time, but if we expected to need 2N widgets, we could reuse the tooling design at a second factory, and marginal costs actually do keep dropping. reply mitthrowaway2 3 hours agorootparentprevBut in real life, by the time you received orders for N/2 widgets, you were already breaking ground on your next factory. And if you get an order for 100N, you smile because now you can switch to a higher productivity manufacturing method, like stamping instead of machining; at 10000N you can invest in mass-producing the machines-that-make-the-machines. This is how we end up being able to make even complex products like cars so cheaply that we have more cars than people. reply corimaith 9 hours agorootparentprevYou know, part of the problem with the massive youth unemployment in China is that the Chinese, just like most people, don't want to work in blue collar advanced manufacturing.

What about the other corporate departments that are being outsource? The company I previously worked for not only outsourced product manufacturing to South Korea with assembly in the USA, after I left. They also outsourced customer service (CSR) to south Asia. Texas VCs bought the company and are trying to maximize all returns on their investment. Companies like American, that produce branded products, have a whole department that helps their sales reps with moving customer support, be it email, physical letter, and or phone, to south Asia to reduce office management costs in the USA. They also could just be outsourcing invoicing while CSR is a local provider. Manufacturing is a simple concept that is heavily politically pushed. The other departments that are needed to support products seem to be ignored. ML has a great likelihood of perpetuating this with real-time vocal transitioning. The CSR in India can sound like some person from New Jersey and break the accent barrier. This would put the customer at ease when sharing the same vocal tones.

I grew up in the rust belt and tons/most of my friend's parents worked at one of the many factories that were, and are still around. Think dog food, plastic molding, car part manufacturing, and glue. Not the big stuff that people think of when they think of manufacturing though. I think if you start to deep dive into the industries that left, you'll find the reasons were often more complicated than simple labor costs. American companies did get out-competed by foreign firms in a lot of key areas. America is large, but they can't expect to be the best in the world at every industry. If an entire country focuses on a specific niche for long enough, it's possible they will become the best. Samsung and TSMC are incredible companies that didn't happen by accident. And yeah, the USA might not compete at that level on the global stage, but the American economy is also not so completely dominated by one megacorp either. Also, a lot of manufacturing, especially the high tech stuff, is highly automated. So these massive factories don't generate the same number of jobs they once did. And the jobs they do generate are often technical. More maintenance and calibration of machinery, and less putting bottle caps on. reply themaninthedark 1 hour agorootparentTell me specificly which niche that Samsung focuses on: >Product: Clothing, automotive, chemicals, consumer electronics, electronic components, medical equipment, semiconductors, solid-state drives, DRAM, flash memory, ships, telecommunications equipment, home appliances >Services: Advertising, construction, entertainment, financial services, hospitality, information and communications technology, medical and health care services, retail, shipbuilding, semiconductor foundry https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung Samsung is also very closely tied to the Korean government. >I think if you start to deep dive into the industries that left, you'll find the reasons were often more complicated than simple labor costs Care to share any of the reasons?

Sell a single doll for $46,000? reply ddingus 2 hours agorootparentprevLet me tell you a story: Tektronix lifted the Portland Oregon region right up. Was called silicon forest. At that time, Tek was funding startups its employees thought up after working for Tek, getting great education provided directly by the company as well as through college partnerships. Tek also literally trained a workforce here by educating any of its employees and by doing programs with suppliers to do the same. I am a product of that time. A drive through this region in the 80's and early 90's was awesome! Shops of all kinds, Tek itself had COMTEK which could make damn near anything, and opportunities abounded! Howard Vollem died and the MBA took over. COMTEK was torn down, work was sent overseas, education stopped, startup funding stopped, and soon a drive through this region looked very different: hair nails and laundry. While large scale manufacturing has grown, the rest has suffered huge! Our military can't find the capacity it needs! And they, along with aerospace, are the best customers there are, with auto in some parts too. The rest has been gutted. That is what we need to fix. It matters. If companies won't do what Tek did, and that is invest in the region and it's people, and they won't because getting max dollars at any cost matters more than sustainable business does, then we must have robust small to mid sized manufacturing. Where else will our future skilled labor come from? And I left for higher end professional work and software. I can make anything I can draw, it was damn good at it too. Saw way too many places close and there's no way I can raise a family on that and I quit ... tons of us did. The skills I have are rare and in high demand. Young people today can't get them like I did, and that adds right the hell up. You think your arguments make sense. And you are not wrong. They do, but that is not the problem. The problem is for your argument to make sense, a ton of people and manufacturing potential is lost and nobody seems to recognize the massive opportunity costs in all that. And frankly if large companies aren't going to do it and get a return on that investment, then our government damn well should. We do really put our national security at risk doing otherwise. reply mlyle 2 hours agorootparent> Our military can't find the capacity it needs! This has a lot more to do with the stance of the past 30 years to manufacture defense materiel at relatively constant, small rates. There was no capital investment, because why pay to have a huge line that isn't being used. We spent our military dollars on wonder-weapons that would probably win a direct war quickly, but that we can't give to allies in a proxy conflict. Going so far was a strategic mistake. > And they, along with aerospace, are the best customers there are, Military are terrible customers, especially if you're a subcomponent manufacturer. Gravy might pour, it might not; it's very unpredictable. You spend a lot of effort and business just evaporates. > Howard Vollem died and the MBA took over. On the flip-side, can you imagine being the high-cost Tek of old in today's test equipment marketplace? Tek already struggles to compete against cheaper, adequate solutions. So much of that market has commoditized out. > nobody seems to recognize the massive opportunity costs in all that. Actually, that's exactly what I'm talking about, in both directions.

I'd like to suggest that what Tek did worked back then, and the same insightful leadership wouldn't simply copy the solutions from 20 years ago. Thus the problem is \"there was no capital investment, because there was no visionary leadership,\" and the problem is also that the short-sighted leadership simply saw \"a huge line that isn't being used,\" instead of a workforce ready to take your company into the next century. > Military are terrible customers ...

I was specifically talking about war materiel. The US is not doing great at making things like low-tech artillery shells, because we've not had a large line running for them for quite some time. In retrospect, it would have been better to have a bigger stockpile and to be paying for more line capacity. Things are steadily ramping, but it's taken a good year and a half to get to the quantities we now want. > > Military are terrible customers ...

Nah, vision or not: political winds change and projects get killed.

It would be even worse if Tek had higher costs. > This actually sounds like the kind of visionary leadership that Tek or the larger Portland metro needs.

    "originBody": "Why wordfreq will not be updated The wordfreq data is a snapshot of language that could be found in various online sources up through 2021. There are several reasons why it will not be updated anymore. Generative AI has polluted the data I don't think anyone has reliable information about post-2021 language usage by humans. The open Web (via OSCAR) was one of wordfreq's data sources. Now the Web at large is full of slop generated by large language models, written by no one to communicate nothing. Including this slop in the data skews the word frequencies. Sure, there was spam in the wordfreq data sources, but it was manageable and often identifiable. Large language models generate text that masquerades as real language with intention behind it, even though there is none, and their output crops up everywhere. As one example, Philip Shapira reports that ChatGPT (OpenAI's popular brand of generative language model circa 2024) is obsessed with the word \"delve\" in a way that people never have been, and caused its overall frequency to increase by an order of magnitude. Information that used to be free became expensive wordfreq is not just concerned with formal printed words. It collected more conversational language usage from two sources in particular: Twitter and Reddit. The Twitter data was always built on sand. Even when Twitter allowed free access to a portion of their \"firehose\", the terms of use did not allow me to distribute that data outside of the company where I collected it (Luminoso). wordfreq has the frequencies that were built with that data as input, but the collected data didn't belong to me and I don't have it anymore. Now Twitter is gone anyway, its public APIs have shut down, and the site has been replaced with an oligarch's plaything, a spam-infested right-wing cesspool called X. Even if X made its raw data feed available (which it doesn't), there would be no valuable information to be found there. Reddit also stopped providing public data archives, and now they sell their archives at a price that only OpenAI will pay. And given what's happening to the field, I don't blame them. I don't want to be part of this scene anymore wordfreq used to be at the intersection of my interests. I was doing corpus linguistics in a way that could also benefit natural language processing tools. The field I know as \"natural language processing\" is hard to find these days. It's all being devoured by generative AI. Other techniques still exist but generative AI sucks up all the air in the room and gets all the money. It's rare to see NLP research that doesn't have a dependency on closed data controlled by OpenAI and Google, two companies that I already despise. wordfreq was built by collecting a whole lot of text in a lot of languages. That used to be a pretty reasonable thing to do, and not the kind of thing someone would be likely to object to. Now, the text-slurping tools are mostly used for training generative AI, and people are quite rightly on the defensive. If someone is collecting all the text from your books, articles, Web site, or public posts, it's very likely because they are creating a plagiarism machine that will claim your words as its own. So I don't want to work on anything that could be confused with generative AI, or that could benefit generative AI. OpenAI and Google can collect their own damn data. I hope they have to pay a very high price for it, and I hope they're constantly cursing the mess that they made themselves. — Robyn Speer",

While it sucked for other reasons, it seemed fine for measuring basic word frequencies in human-written text. The frequencies are probably biased in some ways, but this is true for most text. A textbook on carburetor maintenance is going to have the word \"carburetor\" at way above the baseline. As long as you have a healthy mix of varied books, news articles, and blogs, you're fine. In contrast, LLM content is just a serpent eating its own tail - you're trying to build a statistical model of word distribution off the output of a (more sophisticated) model of word distribution. reply weinzierl 38 minutes agorootparentIsn't it the other way around? SEO text carefully tuned to tf-idf metrics and keyword stuffed to them empirically determined threshold Google just allows should have unnatural word frequencies. LLM content should just enhance and cement the status quo word frequencies. Outliers like the word \"delve\" could just be sentinels, carefully placed like trap streets on a map. reply derefr 10 minutes agorootparent1. People don't generally use the (big, whole-web-corpus-trained) general-purpose LLM base-models to generate bot slop for the web. Paying per API call to generate that kind of stuff would be far too expensive; it'd be like paying for eStamps to send spam email. Spambot developers use smaller open-source models, trained on much smaller corpuses, sized and quantized to generate text that's \"just good enough\" to pass muster. This creates a sampling bias in the word-associational \"knowledge\" the model is working from when generating. 2. Given how LLMs work, a prompt is a bias — they're one-and-the-same. You can't ask an LLM to write you a mystery novel without it somewhat adopting the writing quirks common to the particular mystery novels it has \"read.\" Even the writing style you use in your prompt influences this bias. (It's common advice among \"AI character\" chatbot authors, to write the \"character card\" describing a character, in the style that you want the character speaking in, for exactly this reason.) Whatever prompt the developer uses, is going to bias the bot away from the statistical norm, toward the writing-style elements that exist within whatever hypersphere of association-space contains plausible completions of the prompt. 3. Bot authors do SEO too! They take the tf-idf metrics and keyword stuffing, and turn it into training data to fine-tune models, in effect creating \"automated SEO experts\" that write in the SEO-compatible style by default. (And in so doing, they introduce unintentional further bias, given that the SEO-optimized training dataset likely is not an otherwise-perfect representative sampling of writing style for the target language.) reply lbhdc 32 minutes agorootparentprev> LLM content should just enhance and cement the status quo word frequencies. TFA mentions this hasn't been the case. reply bondarchuk 5 hours agoparentprevAt some point though you have to acknowledge that a specific use of language belongs to the medium through which you're counting word frequencies. There are also specific writing styles (including sentence/paragraph sizes, unnecessary repetitions, focusing on other metrics than readability) associated with newspapers, novels, e-mails to your boss, anything really.

A useful Search would ideally send a user to the site with the most signal and the fewest noise. Meanwhile, ads are inherently noise; they're extra pieces of information inserted into a webpage that at best tangentially correlate to the subject of a page. Up until ~5 years ago, Google was able to strike a balance on keeping these two stable; you'd get results with some Ads but the signal generally outweighed the noise. Unfortunately from what I can tell from anecdotes and courtroom documents, the Ad team at Google has essentially hijacked every other aspect of the company by threatening that yearly bonuses won't be given out if they don't kowtow to the Ad teams wishes to optimize ad revenue somewhere in 2018-2019 and has no sign of stopping since there's no effective competition to Google. (There's like, Bing and Kagi? Nobody uses Bing though and Kagi is only used by tech enthusiasts. The problem with Google is that to copy it, you need a ton of computing resources upfront and are going up against a company with infinitely more money and ability to ensure users don't leave their ecosystem; go ahead and abandon Search, but good luck convincing others to give up say, their Gmail account, which keeps them locked to Google and Search will be there, enticing the average user.) Google has absolutely zero incentive to filter out generative AI junk from their search results outside the amount of it that's damaging their PR since most of the SEO spam is also running Google Ads (since unless you're hosting adult content, Google's ad network is practically the only option).

For best cookies, you want to cream the butter with the sugar, then add the eggs, and finally add the flour. If you’re interested and can find one, it’s worth taking a vegan baking class. You learn a lot about ingredient substitutions for baking, about what the different non-vegan ingredients are doing that you have to compensate for…and it does something that I’ve only recently started seeing happen in non-vegan baking recipes: it separates the wet ingredients from the dry ingredients. That is, when baking, you can usually (again, exceptions for creaming the sugar in butter, etc.) take all of your dry ingredients and mix/sift them together, and then you pour your wet ingredients in a well you’ve made in the dry ingredients (these can also usually be mixed together). reply grues-dinner 2 hours agorootparentNo need to cakesplain, that was an example with three ingredients of the top of my head, very, very obviously the exact ingredients and bracket assignments vary depending on what you are making. But for shortbread or fork biscuits those three could indeed all go in the bowl in one go (but that one admittedly doesn't really need a bracket because the recipe is \"put in bowl, mix with hands, bake\"). reply darby_nine 5 hours agorootparentprevOk, but what i said is true regardless of SEO, and that SEO has also fed back into english before LLMs were a thing.

I wonder how much more of this the Internet can take before everyone just abandons it entirely.

For a while I thought email as a medium was doomed, but spammers mostly lost that arms race. One interesting difference is that with spam, the large tech companies were basically all fighting against it. But here, many of the large tech companies are either providing tools to spammers (LLMs) or actively encouraging spammy behaviors (by integrating LLMs in ways that encourage people to send out text that they didn't write). reply jsheard 3 hours agorootparentThe fight against spam email also led to mass consolidation of what was supposed to be a decentralised system though. Monoliths like Google and Microsoft now act as de-facto gatekeepers who decide whether or not you're allowed to send emails, and there's little to no transparency or recourse to their decisions. There's probably an analogy to be made about the open decentralised internet in the age of AI here, if it gets to the point that search engines have to assume all sites are spam by default until proven otherwise, much like how an email server is assumed guilty until proven innocent. reply jerf 4 hours agorootparentprevAnother problem with this arms race is that spam emails actually are largely separable from ham emails for most people... or at least they were, for most of their run. The thousandth email that claims the UN has set aside money for me due to my non-existent African noble ancestry that they can't find anyone to give it to and I just need to send the Thailand embassy some money to start processing my multi-million yuan payout and send it to my choice of proxy in Colombia to pick it up is quite different from technical conversation about some GitHub issue I'm subscribed to, on all sorts of metrics. However, the frontline of the email war has shifted lately. Now the most important part of the war is being fought over emails that look just like ham, but aren't. Business frauds where someone convinces you that they are the CEO or CFO or some VP and they need you to urgently buy this or that for them right now no time to talk is big business right now, and before you get too high-and-mighty about how immune you are to that, they are now extremely good at looking official. This war has not been won yet, and to a large degree, isn't something you necessarily win by AI either. I think there's an analogy here to the war on content slop. Since what the content slop wants is just for you to see it so they can serve you ads, it doesn't need anything else that our algorithms could trip on, like links to malware or calls to action to be defrauded, or anything else. It looks just like the real stuff, and telling that it isn't could require a human rather vast amounts of input just to be mostly sure. Except we don't have the ability to authenticate where it came from. (There is no content authentication solution that will work at scale. No matter how you try to get humans to \"sign their work\" people will always work out how to automate it and then it's done.) So the one good and solid signal that helps in email is gone for general web content. I don't judge this as a winning scenario for the defenders here. It's not a total victory for the attackers either, but I'd hesitate to even call an advantage for one side or the other. Fighting AI slop is not going to be easy. reply pyrale 4 hours agorootparentprev> but spammers mostly lost that arms race. Advertising in your mails isn't Google's. reply ToucanLoucan 5 hours agorootparentprev> but spammers mostly lost that arms race I'm not saying this is impossible but that's going to be an uphill sell for me as a concept. According to some quick stats I checked I'm getting roughly 600 emails per day, about 550 of which go directly to spam filtering, and of the remaining 50, I'd say about 6 are actually emails I want to be receiving. That's an impressive amount overall for whoever built this particular filter, but it's also still a ton of chaff to sort wheat from and as a result I don't use email much for anything apart from when I have to. Like, I guess that's technically usable, I'm much happier filtering 44 emails than 594 emails? But that's like saying I solved the problem of a flat tire by installing a wooden cart wheel. It's also worth noting there that if I do have an email thats flagged as spam that shouldn't be, I then have to wade through a much deeper pond of shit to go find it as well. So again, better, but IMO not even remotely solved. reply dhosek 4 hours agorootparentI’m not sure what you’ve done to get that level of spam, but I get about 10 spam emails a day at most and that’s across multiple accounts including one that I’ve used for almost 30 years and had used on Usenet which was the uber-spam magnet. A couple newer (10–15 year old) addresses which I’ve published on webpages with mailto links attract maybe one message a week and one that I keep for a specialized purpose (fiction and poetry submissions) gets maybe one to two messages per year, mostly because it’s of the form example@example.com so easily guessed by enterprising spammers. Looking at the last days’ spam¹ I have three 419-style scams (widows wanting to give away their dead husbands’ grand piano or multi-million euro estate) and three phishing attempts. There are duplicate messages in each category. About fifteen years ago, I did a purge of mailing list subscriptions and there’s very little that comes in that I don’t want, most notably a writer who’s a nice guy, but who interpreted my question about a comment he made on a podcast as an invitation to be added to his manually managed email list and given that it’s only four or five messages a year, I guess I can live with that. ⸻ 1.

The complaint about pollution of the Web with artificial content is timely, and it's not even the first time due to spam farms intended to game PageRank, among other nonsense. This may just mean there is new value in hand-curated lists of high-quality Web sites (some people use the term \"small Web\"). Each generation of the Web needs techniques to overcome its particular generation of adversarial mechanisms, and the current Web stage is no exception. When Eric Arthur Blair wrote 1984 (under his pen name \"George Orwell\"), he anticipated people consuming auto-generated content to keep the masses from away from critical thinking. This is now happening (he even anticipated auto-generated porn in the novel), but the technologies criticized can also be used for good, and that is what I try to do in my NLP research team.

Every content system seems to get polluted by noise once it hits mainstream usage: IRC, Usenet, reddit, Facebook, geocities, Yahoo, webrings, etc. Once-small curated selections eventually grow big enough to become victims of their own successes and taken over by spam.

Thanks, staff!) I wonder if it is more to do with the community itself. HN users tend to have very intelligent discussions on pretty much anything, and discourages shitty, unnuanced, one-line takes.

It is also, simultaneously, extremely prone to overestimating its own collective competency at understanding technical knowledge outside its domain.

Anytime I see a post about a topic within my area of specialty, I know to expect articulate, lengthy, and completely misguided or inaccurate comments dominating the discussion.

Future models will begin to continue to amplify certain statistical properties from their training, that amplified data will continue to pollute the public space from which future training data is drawn. Meanwhile certain low-frequency data will be selected by these models less and less and will become suppressed and possibly eliminated. We know from classic NLP techniques that low frequency words are often among the highest in information content and descriptive power. Bitrot will continue to act as the agent of Entropy further reducing pre-AI datasets. These feedback loops will persist, language will be ground down, neologisms will be prevented and...society, no longer with the mental tools to describe changing circumstances; new thoughts unable to be realized, will cease to advance and then regress. Soon there will be no new low frequency ideas being removed from the data, only old low frequency ideas. Language's descriptive power is further eliminated and only the AIs seem able to produce anything that might represent the shadow of novelty. But it ends when the machines can only produce unintelligible pages of particles and articles, language is lost, civilization is lost when we no longer know what to call its downfall. The glimmer of hope is that humanity figured out how to rise from the dreamstate of the world of animals once. Future humans will be able to climb from the ashes again.

Just cause, there's a lot less crap on gopher (and no, gopher is not the answer). But... A couple of weeks ago, I had to send a video file to my wife's grandfather, who is 97, lives in another country, and doesn't use computers or mobile phones. Eventually we determined that he has a DVD player, so I turned to x264 to convert this modern 4K HDR video into a form that can be played by any ancient DVD player, while preserving as much visual fidelity as possible. The thing about x264 is, it doesn't have any docs. Unlike x265 which had a corporate sponsor who could spend money on writing proper docs, x264 was basically developed through trial and error by members of the doom9 forum. There are hundreds of obscure flags, some of which now operate differently to what they did 20 years ago. I could spend hours going through dozens of 20 year old threads on doom9 to figure out what each flag did, or I could do what I did and ask a LLM (in this case Claude). Claude wasn't perfect. It mixed up a few ffmpeg flags with x264 ones (easy mistake), but combined with some old fashioned searching and some trial and error, I could get the job done in about half an hour. I was quite happy with the quality of the end product, and the video did play on that very old DVD player. Back in pre-LLM days, it's not like I would have hired a x264 expert to do this job for me. I would have either had to spend hours more on this task, or more likely, this 97 year old man would never have seen his great granddaughter's dance, which apparently brought a massive smile to his face.

But even there I'm not sure how doable that is given the speed at which LLMs are being updated.

It's getting more and more difficult to use tools like Google search to find relevant content. Many of my searches nowadays include suffixes like \"site:reddit.com\" (or similar havens of, hopefully, still mostly human-generated content) to produce reasonably useful results. There's so much spam pollution by sites like Medium.com that it's disheartening. It feels as if the Internet humanity is already on the retreat into their last comely homes, which are more closed than open to the outside. On the positive side: 1. Self-managed blogs (like: not on Substack or Medium) by individuals have become a strong indicator for interesting content. If the blog runs on Hugo, Zola, Astro, you-name-it, there's hope. 2. As a result of (1), I have started to use an RSS reader again. Who would have thought! I am still torn about what to make of Discord. On the one hand, the closed-by-design nature of the thousands of Discord servers, where content is locked in forever without a chance of being indexed by a search engine, has many downsides in my opinion. On the other hand, the servers I do frequent are populated by humans, not content-generating bots camouflaged as users. reply sashank_1509 1 hour agoprevNot to be too dismissive, but is there a worthwhile direction of research to pursue that is not LLM’s in NLP? If we add linguistics to NLP I can see an argument but if we define NLP as the research of enabling a computer process language then it seems to me that LLM’s/ Generative AI is the only research that an NLP practitioner should focus on and everything else is moot.

How to compile that list is left as an exercise for the reader. The result would not be as accurate as a broad sample of the web, but in a world where it's impossible to trust a broad sample of the web, it the option you are left with.

Apart from the near-impossibility of continuing the task in the same way they've always done it, it seems like the other reason they're not updating wordfreq is to stick a thumb in the eye of OpenAI and Google.

And as the author states 'I don't think anyone has reliable information about post-2021 language usage by humans' So I would still state noun-phrase frequency in LLM output would tend to reflect noun-phrase frequency in training data in a similar context (disregarding enforced bias induced through RLHF and other tuning at the moment) I'm sure there will be cross-fertilization from LLM to Human and back, but I'm not seeing the data yet that the influence on word-frequency is that outspoken.

It could also be useful for guessing whether someone might have been trying to do some kind of steganographic or additional encoding in their work, by telling you how abnormal compared to how many people write it is that someone happened to choose a very unusual construction in their work, or whether it's unlikely that two people chose the same unusual construction by coincidence or plagiarism. You might also find statistical models interesting for things like noticing patterns in people for whom English or others are not their first language, and when they choose different constructions more often than speakers for whom it was their first language. I'm not saying you can't use an LLM to do some or all of these, but they also have something of a scalar attached to them of how unusual the conclusion is - e.g. \"I have never seen this construction of words in 50 million lines of text\" versus \"Yes, that's natural.\", which can be useful for trying to inform how close to the noise floor the answer is, even ignoring the prospect of hallucinations. reply donatj 5 hours agoprevI hear this complaint often but in reality I have encountered fairly little content in my day to day that has felt fully AI generated?

If some randomer reached out via email to me doing this big reveal I'd be \"thanks, but into the spam folder with you\". reply vidarh 6 hours agorootparentIt's not really the selling point. The selling point is the interest in the genealogy, and the \"finding the long-lost second cousins\" is a feature that helps you address the genealogy. Concrete example: My grandmother was born in Brooklyn. As it turns out, her half-brother lived a few blocks away. At the time my grandmother was born, he was 9 and living with his grandparents despite the fact his father lived nearby. I still don't know why, but when I found out he even existed - something I didn't know until long after my grandmother died -, I also soon found his daughter was alive and well in New Jersey, and was able to get in touch. I now have pictures, and stories to fill in not just his background, but thanks to that connection I now have pictures of the graves of my great-great-grandfather, and several of his children, and stories about my grandmothers uncles, and aunts she never mentioned while she was alive. I also have pictures of my great-grandfather - my mums grandfather - that I hadn't seen before. Of course, that is reasonably close, but sometimes those things end up passed down one side of a family, with no copies existing, and you can increasingly find relatives far away from you in the tree who has photos of shared ancestors, and that proportion will increase dramatically with each new generation. So every time I find a match, however remote, with an active account, you better believe I'll message them. Not because I care that we're related, but because I care about whether or not they can fill in some bit or other in my ancestry. For me, anyway, it's a fun puzzle more than anything else, when you go beyond the immediate family. Like why is that one ancestor showing up as a widow one moment, and someone with the same name as her husband showing up as married to her sister in the next census with an implausible country of origin? Can I find evidence to corroborate theories? Can I find that notorious \"hat maker from Bremen\" that almost certainly didn't exist but was cover for infidelity, or evidence that he didn't exist (I almost certainly can't) - it'd be funny, because an entire arm of the family took on the supposed, probably invented, last name of the hypothetical hat maker because an ancestor of theirs thought it sounded posh. The \"long-lost second cousins\" are just bit players in that game. reply jkhdigital 11 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think anyone is actually trying to connect with distant cousins for social interaction; rather the shared DNA segments provide hard evidence to confirm distant ancestors. I got into genealogy a couple years ago after thumbing through some old family documents and I’ve been able to confirm 6th cousins (traced via our shared ancestors) using 23andMe data. Now there are probably some who think genealogy is a silly pastime and maybe it is, but researching my family history helps me feel grounded and more connected to humanity so I derive a lot of benefit from it. reply vidarh 6 hours agorootparentI mean, computer games are a \"silly pastime\" too. Whether or not one feels grounded, it can also just simply be fun, and that fine. I've even enjoyed helping strangers solve genealogy problems because piecing together the evidence and ruling out options is just another type of puzzle and one that is often very challenging. For \"close\" relatives, I agree there can also be more to it. E.g. my mums mum never told us that much about her family (we never asked while she was around), and my mum didn't know either, and so uncovering more about that was very fascinating (it helped that there was plenty of drama to uncover) and helped fill in a lot of gaps. reply derriz 9 hours agorootparentprevA first cousin of mine found a (adult) daughter he didn’t know he had through it.

There are tons of websites for different last names in the United States, showing history of the name. Many times the last name be traced back to a singular person, which I find especially cool since you have sprawling families all connected by one guy who made the journey over. Obviously last names like Smith won't be like this, but if you have a unique last name it can actually be quite common that one person coming to the new world connects you and everybody else in the Americas together. I find that super cool to think about and I am glad people are doing the effort to research and find this info out. reply iwishiknewlisp 6 hours agorootparentIn addition, for people who were adopted and didn't know their birth parents, it can be interesting to connect with your biological family through ancestry work. reply percivalPep 6 hours agorootparentMy mother is adopted and 23andMe and Ancestry have both provided me with a way of connecting with relatives as far apart as Canada and Australia. Before “revealing” my connection to them I’ve stated that in doing so I may reveal information about a shared ancestor that doesn’t put that person in the best light (my mum was the result of a short affair between a married man and a much younger woman at the end of World War 2). All have stated they are ok with this and in most cases had no contact to the ancestor involved anyway. reply appendix-rock 10 hours agorootparentprevThat’s a very glib HN take.

She isn’t overly technical but could be taught to use a web interface if she’d gain value from the effort. reply sandos 6 hours agorootparentIn my humble opinion as an amateur genealogist, after a year or so with paid services (Ancestry, Myheritage) I find there is really no good reason not to use a combination of Wikitree and Familysearch, both free, if we ignore DNA tests. Especially familysearch allows private profiles, no need to share. Wikitree has a policy of \"do not add living people\", but it is possible to do and Ive done it for close family. Yes, this means sharing fairly freely, but I do not see a reason not to. Unless you want a fantasy tree, sharing your tree will make it higher quality. We all make mistakes here and there. Wikitree especially requires you add sources to your work, which might feel odd for a personal tree of course. reply sandos 6 hours agorootparentprevIm trying, really trying to understand what BIGFAM is about.

Individual situations range from extramarital affairs, closed adoption, in-familiy adoption (teen gets pregnant, her parents raise the child as a sibling), and those who’s parents chose to conceive with donor gametes. In many of these cases where it is a surprise, the parents have either actively chosen to withhold the information or didn’t know. In cases where the user is trying to find their parent, it’s statistically unlikely that their parent would have taken the test, but 2nd cousin matches are very common. These seem like a huge distance away, but you can work backwards and build a family tree up to their great grandparents and fan out from there. reply greswen 4 hours agorootparentYep, this happened to me.

Intentionally destroying a company you run and own shares in so you can buy more shares seems like a really complicated and high risk strategy compared to just running it well, making a fortune, and getting an even bigger CEO gig. reply svnt 36 minutes agorootparentThe viability and profitability of the strategy depend critically on the ownership and control position of the CEO. Many CEOs do not have all that much stock, in percentage terms. If they have access to resources and sufficient board control they could privatize, reset the cap table, and reorganize. If they were to reorganize first and produce a company worth as much as its competitors, they only get eg 5% of eg 30B, which after taxes makes them maybe a billionaire. Reorg and do the same thing and they could be looking at control and $10-20B.

I don't know their governance structure, but the CEO may have a majority of votes, but not own a majority of the actual shares. Being able to take the company private would give her (and her other investors) full economic control as well as voting control. This is risky ground, of course. Even with voting control, legally the CEO cannot screw over the minority shareholders. reply s1artibartfast 13 hours agorootparentprev>But that brings up a different question: If you have majority voting power, why try to take the company private (as it has been suggested by others here)? voting power dictates control.

Naked shorting and failure to deliver shares have zero relationship to setting a bid price people are willing to buy at. Shortsqueezes are cases of driving prices up because shares are hard to get and shorts need to cover. Again, not related to the best offer being too low. Secrets are also dumb examples because that’s hidden information. What we’re talking about here is the valuation with all of the public information available now. Nobody of any relevant market size seems to agree that it should be $9/share. reply IG_Semmelweiss 6 hours agorootparentI'm willing to grant some leeway on a shortsqueeze. If one is willing to grant that the stock \"price\" for a liquid listing, is the price for a stock at any given time, then you could argue the markets are \"wrong\" insofar that the price quoted in the open market, is absolutely not the correct price - regardless of the excuse of a short squeeze. reply kortilla 3 hours agorootparentThey are not the same because without available shares to short its very easy to recognize there is stuff overpriced in the market and the open market can’t do anything about it because the sellers are limited and they control the ask. This is absolutely not true of a price that’s “too low”. Anyone, including you, can go hit those asking prices and start to load up. There is also capped downsize risk (as opposed to uncontrolled risk in a short). This is all to say that it’s possible that company could be worth $9-10/share, but based on all of the information publicly available today, there are effectively tens of thousands of people each swinging billions in capital than are parking it in stuff providing 5% return rather than the 20000% you suggest is there.

Their failure to secure their customer DNA data with MFA cost them a $30M fine they must pay [4]. My comment you replied to was attempting to communicate that, because the CEO holds most of the control over the company, it is preferable to let it slip into bankruptcy (where equity and their control will be wiped out) vs continuing allowing them the control they have, which is not leading to a favorable outcome for the enterprise.

IMO the hearsay rule is way too biased in favor of the government. Worse! Say you know it's police asking you questions, and the questions are all very harmless, so you answer them, but then you start to get an inkling that you are a suspect, that they like you for some crime, so now you shut up and/or lawyer up, but guess what: your disposition's change from cooperative to non-cooperative can and will be used against you in a court of law!! What, you say? Yes, the SCOTUS in the 2010s (see Salinas vs. Texas, from.. 2014 IIRC) greatly reduced the 5th Amendment's protections in this way. If you're talking then clam up, the fact that you clammed up -and at what particular question- can be used against you. And if you never said a word to them, that too can be used against you! The only thing that works is to tell them very early on that you will only talk to them with your lawyer present [and since you don't have a lawyer yet you might never talk to them] then follow through. If the police are talking to you it's either a) they think your testimony can convict someone else, and/or b) they like you for some crime and want to give you ample opportunity to convict yourself of it even if you didn't commit it (they may not know that, but they may like you so much for it that their bias is too strong to see that you're innocent) and even if you have no idea what the heck they're talking about (because they don't even have to tell you).

Why didn't Amazon send me an email, phone call, text, message through Echo, notification through one of my four Amazon iPhone apps, or airdrop from a drone alerting me that I needed to be there for this package? I also have an Amazon Echo at home so Alexa should have an idea of my schedule and know that the odds of a successful delivery at 4:42pm on a weekday are 1%. Now I'm listening to Alexa play sad songs instead of belting out great new tunes on my Yamaha. Also, why didn't the UPS driver call or text me when he or she was at my building to ask if it was okay to leave the package?

    "originBody": "Warning: DNS encryption in Little Snitch 6.1 may occasionally fail Norbert on Little Snitch, Security — September 17, 2024 UPDATE: Spoke too soon… The problem discussed here turned out to be specific to Little Snitch 6.1 and not a general issue in macOS. It has already been fixed in Little Snitch 6.1.1. See the end of the article for details. DNS Encryption 101 When you enter a hostname in your web browser (e.g., apple.com), that name must first be translated into an IP address so your computer can connect to the server. This lookup is usually performed unencrypted, meaning your Internet provider and other parties monitoring your connection can see which sites you visit. To protect these lookups from prying eyes, Little Snitch 6 offers a new feature: DNS encryption. With DNS encryption enabled, all name lookups are routed through Little Snitch and performed in encrypted form. For this purpose, Little Snitch registers a DNS proxy. macOS then sends all DNS requests to that proxy, which in turn performs the lookup in encrypted form. The key point here is that all requests must be routed through the proxy. But… While investigating a DNS-related issue on macOS 15 Sequoia, we discovered that some DNS requests—particularly those made via certain low-level legacy APIs—were not being received by our proxy! There appears to be a bug in macOS Sequoia causing some requests to bypass the installed DNS proxy and be sent unencrypted to the system’s default name server instead. Note that this bug likely affects any kind of DNS proxy, not just Little Snitch. So, if you rely on the new DNS encryption feature of Little Snitch 6, or if you are using another third-party DNS proxy, be aware that some DNS lookups may bypass the proxy until Apple provides a fix in a future macOS update. Note: DNS lookups performed via higher-level APIs do not appear to be affected by this bug. For example, your web-browsing in Safari or Chrome still fully benefits from encrypted lookups. Firefox, on the other hand, does seem to be affected. How to Reproduce Enable DNS encryption in Little Snitch > Settings. Start Wireshark with a capture filter for port 53. Run the following code in an Xcode playground: import Foundation let domain = \"dnsproxytest.com\" var result: UnsafeMutablePointer? let status = getaddrinfo(domain, nil, nil, & result) You will notice that the lookup for dnsproxytest.com can be seen in Wireshark in unencrypted form on UDP port 53 (the default for unencrypted lookups). Additionally, you will see that Little Snitch Network Monitor does not display any traffic for the lookup because the lookup completely bypasses the network filter! We have reported this bug to Apple and hope for a fix soon. Please stay tuned, we will keep you updated here. Update 2024-09-17, 19:10 After further investigation, we found that this bug has already existed at least since macOS 14.5 Sonoma (maybe even earlier, but we currently don’t have access to an older 14.x system for testing). Update 2024-09-18, 12:05 After further investigation, we found that this bug only affects the DNS proxy of Little Snitch 6.1. It’s not a general problem of DNS proxies in macOS. We will therefore be able to fix this issue at our end and provide an updated version of Little Snitch 6 later today. Update 2024-09-18, 15:52 The issue has been fixed in Little Snitch 6.1.1.",

Maybe things are drastically different on macOS, but getaddrinfo() is the way to resolve names on Linux and I suspect the *BSDs. Sure, I expect most macOS apps will use something in Foundation or some other NetworkKit-type framework to do DNS queries, but it's odd to me that the code there wouldn't then call down to getaddrinfo() or the like to do the dirty work. I guess GAI is blocking, so presumably there's some other low-level non-blocking call? reply krackers 21 hours agoparent>so presumably there's some other low-level non-blocking call Correct, CFNetwork is open source so you can check implementation but last I remember it used some variant like `getaddrinfo_async`. But Apple really doesn't want you (the end-user) to use getaddrinfo (or the async variant CF exposes) to resolve an IP and then directly connect() via that ip, everything is geared towards connect-by-hostname since then Apple's can internally handle the implementation of happy-eyeballs. Edit: You can read https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/72/slides/plenaryw-6.pdf for their thoughts on why they don't like the getaddrinfo() model [there are speaker notes at the bottom of each slide] reply conradev 21 hours agorootparentIf you do need the lower-level control, Apple does still recommend `getaddrinfo`.

If you want to stay at a lower level the recommendation these days is to use Network.framework. If you want something higher level then use CFNetwork (probably through the classes exported by Foundation like NSURLSession). reply conradev 10 hours agorootparentI actually found it linked from here, which seems current: https://developer.apple.com/support/ipv6/ It is not best practice to use `getaddrinfo` for DNS resolution, for sure. But it is best practice to use it before connecting to an IP address directly because that address may need to be translated. reply krackers 21 hours agorootparentprevI'm actually surprised they suggest getaddrinfo() directly over the async CF wrapper. reply Terretta 9 hours agorootparentprevTL;DR: Applications should not use getaddrinfo(). Because for the connect by name, the OS or app SDK can parallelize the entire multi-step lookup and connection process, not just step by step: “Now, I’m not saying that all implementations of these APIs [Java, Apple Foundation, etc., doing connect by name] necessarily do the right thing today, but if applications are using these APIs, then the implementations can be improved over time.” “The difference with getaddrinfo() and similar APIs is that they fundamentally can’t be improved over time. The API definition is that they return you a full list of addresses, so they have to wait until they have that full list to give you. There’s no way getaddrinfo can return you a partial list and then later give you some more.” The deck's position on implementation of happy-eyeballs (which could sound dismissive here but is treated as \"you had one job\" important by the deck), is finding a way to avoid waiting 5 seconds for either side of IPv4 vs. IPv5 stack to timeout before finishing connection setup and serving the user a web page. reply mzs 20 hours agorootparentprevindeed: https://opensource.apple.com/source/Libinfo/Libinfo-222.1/lo... reply matheusmoreira 17 hours agorootparentprevThanks for that link, it's a very convincing presentation that very clearly explains the shortcomings of getaddrinfo. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 17 hours agorootparentYeah, I went in thinking that it was going to be some case of Apple wanting to bend the Unix philosophy to their will for their own desires and steer implementations in their direction, but no - they are simply pointing out a clear flaw in the design of the function in question for a usecase that does not apply only to Apple. Basically all OS vendors need to be doing something like this usecase to support IPv6 adoption. reply marxisttemp 5 hours agorootparentI often find this is the case with Apple on a technical level. For instance, their recent Spatial (stereographic) Video features uses a format that has basically zero current support outside of Apple—which is in fact just standard MV-HEVC [0] (with some extra optional metadata [1]), which is just the H.265 evolution of the standard H.264 MVC that 3D Blu-rays have used for a long time. (AFAIK no 4K 3D Blu-rays have been released, presumably due to space constraints, explaining the lack of usage of MV-HEVC outside Apple). In piracy world, most re-encoded 3D movies just use objectively inferior composited 2D formats like half-side-by-side or over/under. And without diving in you’d just assume Apple was using some bespoke format to be evil, when in fact they are popularizing what should be the canonical, standardized format for 3D video.

Here’s the breakdown: • Mach OS refers to the Mach microkernel, which primarily focuses on low-level system functions such as task scheduling and memory management. It is not a full-fledged operating system, and thus, libraries like libcompat, which are higher-level UNIX compatibility libraries, would not be integrated directly into the Mach kernel itself. • Mac OS (particularly macOS, formerly OS X) is a complete operating system that includes the Mach microkernel, the BSD layer, and various other components. macOS has a strong Unix heritage, and libcompat is part of the broader Unix-like environment included in macOS to support legacy Unix APIs and applications. Thus, libcompat was integrated into macOS (or its predecessor, NeXTSTEP) as part of its Unix compatibility layer, rather than into the Mach kernel directly reply pushupentry1219 20 hours agoparentprev> Maybe things are drastically different on macOS, but getaddrinfo() is the way to resolve names on Linux and I suspect the *BSDs. I'm not sure if this is the case in this case, but it might be worth noting that some system functions with the same name have drastically different internal/implementation differences between Linux/*BSD/MacOS. With there being differences between the *BSDs too. So on some systems one function call is \"the way\", because its been maintained over the years, but then on another it might actually be old and not useful. reply matheusmoreira 18 hours agoparentprev> getaddrinfo() is the way to resolve names on Linux Not at all. That's just a glibc function, it's got nothing to do with Linux. People just assume that glibc is how things are done in Linux user space but it doesn't have to be that way. For example, systemd came up with its own resolved mechanism which turned out to be much better than the glibc stuff. I will probably end up inventing my own at some point as well since I'm working on freestanding software targeting Linux. reply jonhohle 15 hours agorootparentgetaddrinfo is defined by POSIX and UNIX. Where the implementation is doesn’t matter. It’s portable, which is why it’s used. The slide deck referenced above talks about better implementations for various platforms, but they are all platform specific. So OP might not be completely accurate, but getaddrinfo is _the_ way to resolve names if you are writing portable POSIX and/or UNIX code. reply matheusmoreira 13 hours agorootparentLinux and the popular Linux distributions are not POSIX compliant to begin with.

It’s also a libc, musl, uClibc, and Windows Sockets 2 function: because it’s defined in POSIX 1.1 and extended in RFC 3493. I have no opinion on whether it’s good enough (it seems like not if every platform has a connect-by-name implementation), just that calling it a glibc function overly simplifies it’s origin. It’s also false to say only GNU tries to be POSIX compliant. There are 8 commercial UNIXes that meet some POSIX standard, another 8 that are discontinued (at least one of which was a Linux distro), and dozens that are mostly compatible. POSIX doesn’t care if that compatibility comes from the kernel or user space libraries. POSIX isn’t good enough at what? Maybe you don’t understand what it’s goal is/was. POSIX exists for portability. It’s a minimal set of functions developers can target to get things done on any UNIX. Any OS will always have something beyond POSIX to differentiate it. reply yrro 8 hours agorootparentprevYou're probably aware of c-ares, if not then check it out unless you really want to write your own.

Why doesn't an app doing system-wide DNS modifictions just modify the settings for default resolver? reply Terretta 9 hours agorootparentThe Apple deck linked elsewhere in this thread suggests the developer's goal generally isn't \"DNS resolution\", the dev's goal is usually establishing a connection to a host/server/endpoint to start doing something. So, usually devs should use the Java or Apple or whatever higher level OS API gets you connected the fastest, and that API is free to implement the connection however most quickly gets to the point of able to return data to the user (app or end user). The API that returns a list of addresses is stuck doing that, instead of being able to parallize the entire \"get connected\" data flow. reply threeseed 22 hours agorootparentprev> This library wraps around the dnssd framework and the c-ares C library with Swift-friendly APIs and data structures. https://github.com/apple/swift-async-dns-resolver reply josephcsible 22 hours agorootparentIt feels like Embrace, Extend, Extinguish to claim that a portable API is \"legacy\" and that its replacement is Apple-only. reply tpmoney 21 hours agorootparentAs near as I can tell, Apple doesn't call it a legacy API.

That seem in line with Apple's practices as a company even if they are not doing it yet. I feel anything they might do like that might be less likely to extend to what the article refers to as a legacy API. reply tpmoney 3 hours agorootparentIf you were writing a Java application, would you do your own DNS resolution, or would you make a new socket address object and give it a hostname and let the api resolve the hostname for you? If you don’t hand roll your own dns protocol lookups, how do you know the OS, or Java or your socket library aren’t intercepting and modifying request out from under you? Heck, even if you use getaddrinfo directly how do you know your libc implementation isn’t intercepting and modifying the lookups on you? If the threat model you’re coding for is “Apple is a hostile actor intercepting and modifying dns queries” then you really can’t trust their provided posix calls either. reply dwaite 2 hours agorootparentprevI would feel far more concerned that an arbitrary application that decided to do its own DNS resolution would be doing so for nefarious reasons, or might mess up the process (such as not supporting encrypted DNS in this case). If you genuinely cannot trust the OS vendor, you don't try to tinker around in user space but you stay off their platform. Personally, this is why I don't have any machines with a Microsoft OS, and why I don't have a Playstation. reply EraYaN 6 hours agorootparentprevBut you are already on their OS, so they would always be able to do that.

Might as well use the API that gives a better user experience. reply ruthmarx 4 hours agorootparent> so it's a moot point and needless paranoia. No it's not. You are misunderstanding my point. I'm not talking about Apple being able to patch the OS and control everything at that level - of course they can, but it seems unlikely. I'm talking about a developer framework, a high level abstraction, where the method of resolving would be more likely to be intercepted - consider for example something like that on an iPhone with the justification being safety or 'for the children' or whatever. That doesn't seem unlikely or improbably at all, and certainly not moot or any kind of paranoia. reply marksomnian 1 hour agorootparentAssuming arguendo that apple did want to do that kind of messing with DNS though - what's there to stop them from changing getaddrinfo() in the same way? As someone pointed out upthread, if you don't trust your OS vendor to do DNS lookups correctly, your only option is to not usre your OS vendor for DNS lookups, which is in the realm of Byzantine faults. (And further, assuming arguendo that there was DNS meddling happening but somehow getaddrinfo() was exempt - now the user has one app that behaves differently to all their others, which is worse in every practical sense.) reply matheusmoreira 17 hours agorootparentprevIt's not necessarily EEE. Maybe it's just that the old wheel sucks. They want a better wheel and so they reinvented it, hopefully better this time. The corporations making proprietary software are not the only ones who have that attitude. I've resolved to make all my free software Linux-exclusive so that I can use Linux to the fullest. The Linux kernel is packed full of exclusive non-portable features that very few people take advantage of because they're obsessed with portability, POSIX compliance or whatever. I think that's a waste. Portable software is usually sucky lowest common denominator software. We should not limit ourselves to whatever glibc offers. reply threeseed 20 hours agorootparentprevYou actually think that a Swift developer, developing against Cocoa APIs, targeting Mac and iOS devices cares about a portable API.

Changing his resolver at the network level to 1.1.1.1 fixed it.

We built out the site (Thanks to Building Killer Websites of course) and it looked awesome! Only problem was that nobody in my family out of state could see it.

Disgusting behaviour IMO. reply ajross 18 hours agoparentprevYeah, this report seems a little spun.

    "originBody": "Announcing Swift 6 September 17, 2024 Holly Borla We’re delighted to announce the general availability of Swift 6. This is a major new release that expands Swift to more platforms and domains. Many people know of Swift as a language for app development, with a million apps on the App Store. But Swift is great for more than just apps. Swift’s safety, speed, and approachability make it a great choice for many other use cases including libraries, internet-scale services, and the most performance-critical and secure code. Swift 6 scales even further through new low-level programming features, an embedded Swift language subset, expanded Linux and Windows support, new cross-platform APIs including the new Swift Testing library, and more. Read on for a deep dive into changes to the language, standard libraries, debugging, platform support, and next steps for getting started with Swift 6. Language and Standard Library Concurrency Swift has long offered memory safety, ensuring that variables are initialized before they’re used, memory isn’t accessed after it’s been deallocated, and array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors. Swift 6 now includes a new, opt-in language mode that extends Swift’s safety guarantees to prevent data races in concurrent code by diagnosing potential data races in your code as compiler errors. Data-race safety checks were previously available as warnings in Swift 5.10 through the -strict-concurrency=complete compiler flag. Thanks to improved Sendable inference and new compiler analysis for transferring mutable state from one actor to another, Swift 6 warnings about data-race safety have fewer false positives. You can find more information about the Swift 6 language mode and how to migrate at Swift.org/migration. Swift 6 marks the start of the journey to make data-race safety dramatically easier. The usability of data-race safety remains an area of active development, and your feedback will help shape future improvements. Swift 6 also comes with a new Synchronization library for low-level concurrency APIs, including atomic operations and a new mutex API. Typed throws Swift 6 enables functions to specify the type of error that they throw as part of their signature. This feature is useful in generic code that forwards along errors thrown in client code, or in resource-constrained environments that cannot allocate memory, such as in embedded Swift code. For example: func parseRecord(from string: String) throws(ParseError) -> Record { // ... } A call to parseRecord(from:) will either return a Record instance or throw an error of type ParseError. A do..catch block will infer ParseError as the type of the error variable: do { let record = try parseRecord(from: myString) } catch { // 'error' has type 'ParseError' } Typed throws generalizes over throwing and non-throwing functions. A function that is specified as throws (without a specific error type) is equivalent to one that specifies throws(any Error), whereas a non-throwing function is equivalent to one that specifies throws(Never). Calls to functions that are throws(Never) are non-throwing and don’t require error handling at the call site. Typed throws can also be used in generic functions to propagate error types from parameters, in a manner that is more precise than rethrows. For example, the Sequence.map method can propagate the thrown error type from its closure parameter, indicating that it only throws the same type of errors as the closure: extension Sequence { func map(_ body: (Element) throws(E) -> T) throws(E) -> [T] { // ... } } When given a closure that throws ParseError, map will throw ParseError. When given a non-throwing closure, E is inferred to Never and map will not throw. Ownership Swift 5.9 introduced non-copyable types with the ~Copyable syntax for modeling resources with unique ownership, and writing performance-conscious code by eliminating the runtime overhead associated with copying. Swift 6 now supports these types with the generics system, making it possible to write generic code that works with both copyable and non-copyable types. For example: protocol Drinkable: ~Copyable { consuming func use() } struct Coffee: Drinkable, ~Copyable { /* ... */ } struct Water: Drinkable { /* ... */ } func drink(item: consuming some Drinkable & ~Copyable) { item.use() } drink(item: Coffee()) drink(item: Water()) The Drinkable protocol has no requirement that its conforming types are Copyable. This means both the non-copyable type Coffee and copyable type Water can be passed into the generic drink function. Switch statements can now be written to avoid copying within enum pattern-matching operations. This means that switch statements can be used with non-copyable payloads and can also provide performance benefits for copyable payloads, especially those based on copy-on-write containers like Array and Dictionary. Non-copyable types are already used throughout the standard libraries. For instance, the new Atomic type in the Synchronization library is based on ~Copyable, Optional and Result can now wrap non-copyable types, and the unsafe buffer pointer types can now point to non-copyable elements. C++ interoperability also uses non-copyable types to expose C++ move-only types to Swift. C++ interoperability Swift 5.9 introduced bidirectional interoperability with C++ to seamlessly bring Swift to more existing projects. Swift 6 expands interoperability support to C++ move-only types, virtual methods, default arguments, and more standard library types including std::map and std::optional. C++ types that do not have a copy constructor can now be accessed from Swift 6 as non-copyable types with ~Copyable. And for those times when it’s useful to expose a C++ type with a copy constructor as ~Copyable in Swift for better performance, a new SWIFT_NONCOPYABLE annotation can be applied to the C++ type. Swift now also supports calls of C++ virtual methods on types annotated as SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE or SWIFT_IMMORTAL_REFERENCE. When calling C++ functions or methods that have default argument values for some of their parameters, Swift now respects these default values, rather than requiring you to explicitly pass an argument. Embedded Swift Swift 6 includes a preview of Embedded Swift, a language subset and compilation mode suitable for embedded software development, such as programming microcontrollers. The toolchain supports ARM and RISC-V bare-metal targets. Embedded Swift produces small and standalone binaries by relying on generic specialization. Since it doesn’t rely on a runtime or type metadata, Embedded Swift is suitable for platforms with tight memory constraints as well as use in low-level environments with limited runtime dependencies. Embedded Swift remains an experimental feature, with ongoing development before stable support in a future Swift release. 128-bit Integers Swift 6 rounds out the set of low-level integer primitives with the addition of signed and unsigned 128-bit integer types. These are available on all Swift platforms, and provide the same API as other fixed-width integer types in the standard library. Productivity enhancements Swift 6 introduces a number of productivity enhancements, including count(where:) to streamline counting the number of elements in a sequence that satisfy a predicate, pack iteration for writing natural for-loops over the elements in a value parameter pack, access control for imports to keep implementation details from leaking into your public APIs, @attached(body) macros for synthesizing and augmenting function implementations, expression macros as default arguments, and more. You can find a complete list of language proposals that were accepted through the Swift Evolution process and implemented in Swift 6 on the Swift Evolution dashboard. Debugging Custom LLDB summaries with @DebugDescription @DebugDescription section\" href=\"#custom-lldb-summaries-with-debugdescription\"> Swift 6 provides a new debugging macro to easily customize how an object is displayed in LLDB when using the p command, and in the variables view in Xcode and VSCode, by using a formatting scheme that does not run arbitrary code. Types that conform to CustomDebugStringConvertible provide a debugDescription property that returns a string describing the object. In LLDB, the po command calls this computed property on an object. In contrast, the p command uses LLDB’s type summary formatters to directly format the object using its stored property values. @DebugDescription is a new macro in the standard library which lets you specify LLDB type summaries for your own types directly in code. The macro processes the debugDescription property, translating simple string interpolations involving stored properties into LLDB type summaries. This allows LLDB to use your custom formatting even when using p, and also in Xcode or VSCode’s variable display windows. The macro can use an existing conformance to CustomDebugStringConvertible, or you can provide a separate string interpolation only for use in LLDB’s p command. Providing a separate LLDB description string is useful if your CustomDebugStringConvertible implementation doesn’t meet the requirements of the @DebugDescription macro, or if you’re familiar with the LLDB Summary String syntax and you want to use it directly. For example, the following code customizes how po in LLDB displays the Organization type with a conformance to CustomDebugStringConvertible, and the @DebugDescription macro exposes this custom formatting to the p command and the variables view: @DebugDescription struct Organization: CustomDebugStringConvertible { var id: String var name: String var manager: Person // ... and more var debugDescription: String { \"#\\(id) \\(name) [\\(manager.name)]\" } } (lldb) p myOrg (Organization) myOrg = \"`#100 Worldwide Travel [Jonathan Swift]`\" Improved startup performance with explicit modules Swift 6 dramatically improves startup performance in the debugger when you use explicit module builds. When debugging locally-built code, LLDB can now import explicitly-built Swift and Clang modules directly from the project build artifacts. This avoids the need to recompile implicit Clang module dependencies from source, which can take a long time, and it’s very sensitive to issues with header search paths. If the first p or po command in LLDB takes a long time due to Clang module compilation, or if your debugging is frequently blocked by Clang header import problems, consider adopting explicit modules in your project! Libraries Foundation Swift 6 unifies the implementation of Foundation across all platforms. The modern, portable Swift implementation provides consistency across platforms, it’s more robust, and it’s open source. macOS and iOS started using the Swift implementation of Foundation alongside Swift 5.9, and Swift 6 brings these improvements to Linux and Windows. Core types like JSONDecoder, URL, Calendar, FileManager, ProcessInfo, and more have been completely reimplemented in Swift. These types share their implementation with macOS 15 and iOS 18, providing a new level of cross-platform consistency, reliability, and performance. Recently released APIs like FormatStyle, ParseStrategy, Predicate, and JSON5, from past macOS and iOS releases are now available on all Swift platforms. New Foundation APIs like Expression, calendar enumeration improvements, calendar recurrence rules, format style enhancements, and more are available simultaneously on macOS, iOS, Linux, and Windows - and they were built with community involvement. If your Linux or Windows app imports the Foundation library from the Swift toolchain today, you get all of these improvements for free. And if your app is particularly sensitive to binary size, you can now import the FoundationEssentials library, which provides a more targeted subset of Foundation’s features that omits internationalization and localization data. Swift Testing Swift 6 introduces Swift Testing, a new testing library designed from the ground up for Swift. It includes expressive APIs that make it easy to write and organize tests. It provides detailed output when a test fails using macros like #expect. And it scales to large codebases with features like parameterization to easily repeat a test with different arguments. For example: @Test(\"Continents mentioned in videos\", arguments: [ \"A Beach\", \"By the Lake\", \"Camping in the Woods\" ]) func mentionedContinents(videoName: String) async throws { let videoLibrary = try await VideoLibrary() let video = try #require(await videoLibrary.video(named: videoName)) #expect(video.mentionedContinents.count <= 3) } Swift Testing takes full advantage of macros. Its @Test and @Suite attached macros declare test functions and suite types respectively, and they accept arguments (known as traits) to customize various behaviors. The #expect and #require expression macros validate expected behaviors, and capture rich representation of expressions and their sub-values to produce detailed failure messages. Since Swift Testing is included directly in Swift 6 toolchains, you can import Testing without needing to declare a package dependency. This means your tests do not need to build Swift Testing or its dependencies (including swift-syntax), and its macro implementation comes prebuilt. The package manager in Swift 6 automatically builds and runs Swift Testing tests in addition to XCTests (if present), and shows results from both libraries in log output. Swift Testing supports all platforms that Swift officially supports, including all Apple platforms, Linux, and Windows. To learn more about this new open source project, visit the swift-testing repository on GitHub, and get involved with its ongoing development on the forums. Platform Support Swift is designed to support development and execution on all major operating systems, and platform consistency and expansion underpins Swift’s ability to reach new programming domains. Swift 6 brings major improvements to Linux and Windows across the board, including support for more Linux distributions and Windows architectures. Toolchains for all of the following platforms are available for download from Swift.org/install. Fully static SDK for Linux Swift 6 supports building fully statically linked executables for Linux; these have no external dependencies, so they are ideal for situations where you want to copy a program directly onto a system or into a container and run it without installing any extra software. The SDK can also be used to cross-compile to Linux from other platforms. Learn how to get started with the static SDK for Linux on Swift.org. New Linux distributions Swift 6 adds official support and testing for Debian and Fedora, as well as on Ubuntu 24.04. Windows build performance Prebuilt toolchains are now available for the arm64 architecture, which provides improved compiler performance for Windows on ARM hosts. In Swift 6, the Swift package manager also parallelizes builds across multiple cores on Windows by default. On a 10-core machine, this can improve build performance by up to a factor of 10!

Swift is caught between two clans: the Swift Working Group™ open-source community, and the Apple corporate entity who pays most of their salaries. Both have their own incentives and their own imperfections, but you guess who has the majority influence. Ridiculous, permanent, tech debt such as hardcoded compiler exceptions are permanently living in the compiler codebase. Even worse, half-baked concepts such as result builders are pushed through without any real discussion because Apple wants the SwiftUI syntax to look pretty. It's an amazing language still, but I can't see it surviving as nicely in the next 10 years if Apple doesn't learn to let go. reply paperplatter 17 hours agoparentIf I were new to Swift and saw how complicated and version-specific the Stackoverflow answers* are for things that are super simple in other languages, I wouldn't expect things to get much easier from there.

The top answer to your third question gives a pretty good explanation of why Swift string indices work the way they do (as well as showing nicer ways to spell a lot of the operations on them), which mostly addresses the first and third questions. It really seems that your last link is just asking for the `inout` modifier; I'm not sure why that one is especially confusing. Obviously, there's always stuff that can be further improved, but none of these are especially onerous (once you get past the \"string indices are not just integers\" step, at least--for people who really just want to pretend the world uses ASCII or work with UTF8 bytes directly, string.utf8 may be an nicer interface to use). reply paperplatter 16 hours agorootparentThe thing is, each string-related answer ended up extending it with some methods that everyone wanted it to have in the first place, and the top-voted comments are like \"why do we have to do this.\" It also shouldn't have required multiple updates to each answer. The time I was doing a lot of string manipulation in a team Swift project, we had to write our own wrapper that basically stored strings as arrays of printable characters because the native one was too annoying. This also protected us from all the breaking changes Apple made to strings across Swift versions. The inout one is different. It's confusing that arrays and dicts are structs, which have different rules from regular objects, and the syntax takes some getting used to: func addItem(_ localArr: inout [Int]) { localArr.append(4) } reply stephencanon 16 hours agorootparent> It's confusing that arrays and dicts are structs, which have different rules from regular objects As a long-time assembly and C programmer and now Swift programmer, I would say that structs _are_ regular objects, and things with reference semantics are weird. It all depends on your point of view! reply paperplatter 14 hours agorootparentI'm fine with either approach as long as it's consistent. Practical Swift code will have a few \"inout\"s sprinkled around, wherever someone happened to pass in a struct (like array) instead of an object (like NSArray). And that's without bridging and stuff like UnsafePointer involved. Edit: Just remembered that arrays still don't act like regular structs either! https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24450284/conflicting-def... reply stephencanon 7 hours agorootparentThe answer you link to there is from the Swift 1 days in 2014. It was absolutely true then, but array has had true value semantics since shortly after that answer was written. reply paperplatter 31 minutes agorootparentAh, it's coming back to me now. I remember when they fixed that and I was relieved. reply fauigerzigerk 12 hours agorootparentprevI'm fine with either approach if it's easy to know which one I'm using at a any particular call site. C# started the tradition of moving this information to the type level, far away from the call site. Swift has adopted this terrible idea. The philosophy of making code look \"clean\" at the cost of hiding critical information in some far away place is the biggest mistake in programming language design. If code happens to look clean it should be the result of being simple rather than being cleansed for effect. Other bad ideas in the same vein are computed properties and function builders. reply paperplatter 2 hours agorootparentComputed properties are annoying too. More importantly, they're one more inconsequential thing for SWEs to argue over in code review. reply neonsunset 7 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you mean by moving information to the type level? reply fauigerzigerk 6 hours agorootparentIn C and C++ (and many other languages) the distinction between value and reference/pointer is part of the variable declaration. In C# and Swift that information belongs to type definitions (except for inout parameters). Structs are value types and classes are reference types. Type definitions are usually further away from the call site than variable declarations. Also, in C, accessing a member of a struct through a pointer requires the -> operator providing yet another clue as to whether you're using a pointer or a value. In my opinion, this distinction is absolutely key. It should always be obvious at the call site. I don't think there is anything that has caused more bugs in my Swift code than getting this wrong. Change a type from class to struct or vice versa and chances are your code still compiles when it really shouldn't because it's now completely broken. reply kaba0 2 hours agorootparentIf there are identity having classes (reference/pointer) that may be mutable, and value types that are always immutable, then I think it can be an “implementation detail”, part of the type, not changing semantics. If you can’t change a struct’s field, only the whole struct, then I believe it’s fine - and the compiler may decide to copy it or change in-place depending on its available context, is it not the case? reply fauigerzigerk 1 hour agorootparentIn a language without mutability (or perhaps with something like borrow checking?), it would not be a problem. But in Swift, the option of introducing mutability always exists. It's not impossible to impose some sort of discipline to mitigate these issues, but why is it a good idea to make values and references indistinguishable at the call site? I don't get it. But it's not surprising. I don't get a lot of decisions that language designers have been making. The entire drive towards more and more syntactical abstraction in order to make everything look like a DSL is a mistake in my opinion. reply interpol_p 16 hours agorootparentprevThree of those really are very specific to string manipulation, and doing it \"right\" (with all the possible representations of what a string can be) is inherently complex. I think Swift landed on the wrong side of defaults for this API, opting for \"completely safe and correct\" over \"defaults to doing what I expect 99% of the time\" You can get a `utf8` or `utf16` \"view\" of a string, and index it like normal array (`myString.utf8[0]` gets the first utf8 character). But it's not going to work with complicated emoji, or different languages that may have representations into utf16, etc. Again, I think the vast majority of people don't care for complete correctness across all possible string representations, and possibly Swift has gone too far here — as noted by all the Stack Overflow posts and clunky API On the array-pass-by-reference, I'd argue that it's valuable to learn those semantics and they aren't particularly complicated. They offer huge benefits relating to bugs caused by unintentionally shared state. Marking the parameter `inout` is a small price to pay, and really forces you to be explicit about your intentions reply paperplatter 15 hours agorootparentSwift was designed around emojis it seems. First page in the manual shows how you can use emojis as variable names. I get why Apple wants to be clear how there are different ways to index into strings (even if this is motivated 99% by emojis like \"family: man woman boy boy skintone B\"), but still, the API didn't have to be this confusing or have so many breaking changes after GA. About structs and pointers, I'm familiar with them in C/C++ where the syntax is clear and consistent. It's not consistent in Swift.

But, although it says \"can't be changed\", could it not be changed if SwiftUI were changed? An up-to-date compiler would no longer be able to compile projects using older versions of SwiftUI, but is there not a path to get there by updating SwiftUI to not require this exception, then some time later, deprecating the older versions of SwiftUI, either throwing a warning on compilation or putting it behind a compiler flag, and then finally removing it altogether? It would certainly take a while, but could be done if Swift is aiming to be a mainstream, long-term, cross-platform language - unless this kind of thing is just not done, or there is some technical aspect I am missing? reply riscy 20 hours agoparentprevCan you explain how result builders are half-baked? They’ve been used for more than SwiftUI by now. The Regex support since 5.7 uses them: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/swift/5.7/regexes reply cageface 19 hours agorootparentBecause they rely on variadic generics they can make type inference very slow or just fail completely, leading to the infamous and singularly unhelpful compiler error, \"The compiler is unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time; try breaking up the expression into distinct sub-expressions\". reply paperplatter 18 hours agorootparentSwift is the only language where I've had to fight the compiler to do its job. In earlier versions like 1.x and 2.x, it would often segfault. By 3.x it was still really slow to build. I regretted moving a project off ObjC back then. I thought maybe that was all fixed by now, but guess not? reply cageface 17 hours agorootparentOn paper Swift has a lot going for it. In practice it's easily the worst devx out of the modern languages. And SwiftUI is still so full of bugs and performance pitfalls I'm actually quite pessimistic about the future of native apps on Apple platforms. reply seec 3 hours agorootparentTo be honest, the way they are damaging their brand/products/OS just to make a bit more money is enough to be pessimistic about Apple. But it's very true that the state of the language can be felt in their native apps, that tend to suck pretty bad recently. I still can't get over the nightmare that is the split up of iTunes; at least we knew that it was clunky because of old age, the new stuff is just bad. reply paperplatter 17 hours agorootparentprevYeah there's a reason people go to all that effort with React Native to avoid writing Swift code or dealing with Apple's UI frameworks, and it's actually a reasonable approach for the majority of apps. reply pjmlp 9 hours agorootparentPeople go to React Native to stay on their cozy Web skills, it is exactly the same if we would be talking about Microsoft and Google platforms. reply paperplatter 2 hours agorootparentI started using RN when I had 0 web skills and didn't know JS.

Though I remember the concurrency model being confusing, so you could accidentally block your UI thread. reply cageface 15 hours agorootparentUIKit is pretty fast although a major step down in dev velocity. AppKit on the other hand seems to be pretty intrinsically slow and the controls are looking increasingly dated. reply fingerlocks 10 hours agorootparentOdd criticism. UIKit is the iOS counterpart to MacOS’s AppKit and both are implemented as convenience wrappers around CALayers. They are also infinitely customizable. You can overload UI/NSView and draw vector-pen style on a blank canvas or render whatever you want on a GPU frame buffer. This is how MapKit, Safari, and the Camera view is implemented. reply cageface 10 hours agorootparentIt’s a criticism from recent experience trying to build AppKit based UI. The examples you list barely use the stock widgets. There’s decades of accumulated cruft in Cocoa that Apple discarded when implementing iOS. reply cageface 15 hours agorootparentprevYeah I worried about that going in too but in fact I've found it much easier to get good performance with Flutter than SwiftUI, especially for large collection views and especially on the mac. The work the Flutter team did on Impeller seems to have paid off. reply fingerlocks 10 hours agorootparentYou should try to implement the iOS photos.app in flutter and see how that goes. This requires scrolling through gigabytes of photos as fast as your finger can swipe without a single hint of slowdown or a loading spinner. And it’s been that fast since.. iOS 7? Yeah it’s not the language or the SDK that’s slow. Rather it’s inexperienced, lazy, or overworked developers that can’t/won’t write performant software. reply cageface 10 hours agorootparentI’ve been building iOS apps since before Swift existed. Sure like I said if you code directly to UIKit and take a little care performance is good. It’s also very fast in Flutter with even less care. Rendering images in a grid isn’t hard unless your core abstractions are all wrong. Now try that in SwiftUI. You’ll be forced back to UICollectionView. reply fingerlocks 2 hours agorootparentThat’s cool. I’ve been developing on Mac before Objective-C 2.0 and iOS since the AppStore was released. Millions of downloads, featured in the store, worked on dozens of projects from video games to MFi firmware, and have been invited to Cupertino to meet with teams. I’m not defending SwiftUI. I mostly use it as a wrapper around NS/UIKit because it’s still buggy and not as flexible. By the way, SwiftUI is also implemented on top of CALayers just like NS/UIKit. It can be fast in theory, but you have to know exactly where the pain points are and most developers don’t know how to do that. reply kaba0 2 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think it’s impossible with proper caches to smaller dimension versions (that supposedly Apple already generates/has access to - like they are doing a bunch of processing, like object recognition, etc). reply ameliaquining 17 hours agorootparentprevI mean, I figure the more compelling reason to do that is so you can also ship an Android app without writing everything twice. reply paperplatter 17 hours agorootparentSorta, but it's not as easy as they make it sound.

Question is, did the startups regret taking the shortcut upfront, or were they fine paying later for the improved version? Btw, an embarrassing amount of my career has been porting someone's NoSQL backend to SQL, or because some lessons are never learned, SQL to NoSQL. nwienert 10 hours agorootparentprevYou can make a disaster in any framework. SwiftUI is a mess, for example, and slow. React Native took a while to mature, but with the right tooling you can ship amazing UX now. I don’t doubt there’s a ton of crap out there. But you’re wrong if you think you can’t make seriously great stuff with it. It’s matured quite a lot. And the React programming model is untouched, hot reloading and dev tools far ahead, and code share is worth it with something like Tamagui that actually optimizes to each platform. If I never had to touch an ObservableObject again that would be great. reply paperplatter 18 minutes agorootparentIt can get tough with the native dependencies involved. fingerlocks 2 hours agorootparentprevI have made a countless PRs to many of the most popular react-native dependencies because they were a buggy mess.

Something like Idris or Coq would have even more complex messages, though I don't have an example on hand. reply cageface 16 hours agorootparentOk but these are mainly academic research languages. Swift has the backing of the most valuable company in the world and is what they're pushing as the right way to develop for their platform. reply astrange 15 hours agorootparentHaskell is definitely a real industrial language! Many of the other languages in the formally verified/dependent type space are academic, but there's government interest in things like Ada too because they don't want their planes to crash. Couldn't say how good its error messages are though. reply paperplatter 14 hours agorootparentI've seriously used Erlang for a while, and Haskell looks kinda similar. Ingenious ideas there, cool features, but in the end it's cumbersome to use. So I can see why these are niche and wouldn't consider them next to big ones like Swift or C++. reply paperplatter 17 hours agorootparentprevIf Rust is one, yeah I have to fight that compiler but it's because it's doing its job and not letting me do invalid things. Not because the compiler has some feature \"not yet implemented\" or has bugs. reply paperplatter 14 hours agorootparentAlso, is anyone familiar with the weirdness with tuples in Swift? All I remember is they never worked the way I expected, and for some reason something in our code specifically worked for tuples up to size 5. reply plorkyeran 13 hours agorootparentSwift only got variadic generics fairly recently, and before that you couldn’t write code which was generic over tuple size. Instead you had to codegen versions for each size of tuple you needed to support. reply paperplatter 2 hours agorootparentI think that was it. There was also something about tuples inside of dictionaries that Swift 1 or 2's compiler segfaulted on. reply jordanmorgan10 16 hours agoparentprevI get what you’re saying and largely agree, but without result builders SwiftUI wouldn’t exist, let alone “look pretty”.

Just getting good and greasy with Python and JS with all the typical libs has been more rewarding for me.

And some things simply require templating nightmares to work at all. I would also not use \"rock solid\" in comparison to how easy it is to hit undefined behavior. Used all over and easy to find jobs, yes. reply troad 17 hours agorootparentC++ gives you a garage full of tools and lets you decide what to do with them. Ultimately, it does this because the years have shown that different people need different tools for different use cases. Few people need or use them all at once. But when you do need a specific tool, C++ has it ready for you. Some consider that a con, I consider that a pro. I find that a lot of the newlangs take the view that since most programming only uses 20% of the toolkit, they can just dispense with the remaining 80%. Which is great, until you discover that virtually every sophisticated project needed one of those things from that remaining 80%, and they all needed a different one. A nice language for writing 'Hello world's isn't going to cut it. And so either the language insists on its simplicity and stagnates, or it just reinvents all the complexity of C++. At which point, you were better off just taking the garage full of tools that you already had, rather than going all in on some newlang, getting blocked, and stalking a github ticket for years waiting for the lang to get that feature you need. (If you spent the time in C++ instead, its full garage wouldn't look so imposing over time!) What's the famous quote? 'There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.' :P Re generics, aren't C++'s virtually the same as Rust's? Especially now that C++ has 'concepts'? reply Dylan16807 16 hours agorootparentThere's a lot of redundancy and things you probably should never use in C++, though.

There are really no popular patterns that have become \"no, never do that\", poorly written code is sort of version agnostic, and even old code, particularly one like in Mono applications from back in the day, plays really nicely with modern runtimes. And the difference in ways to achieve something is almost always of type \"remember this required to take 4 steps? now it's one shorthand thing that makes sense in retrospect\". reply rand_r 16 hours agorootparentprevSomething I’ve been curious about recently, is how did Linux get away with straight C for so long, considering how complex of a project it is. Did they end up reimplementing a bunch of C++ features? Actually, regarding sophisticated projects, there’s quite some complicated projects that succeed without C++ power, like Postgres and Python. reply troad 16 hours agorootparentI didn't mean to imply, if I have, that C++ is always and in all circumstances the best choice for any given software project. The question was about the first compiled language someone should learn, and for that, C++ is great. It's going to cover most of the use cases for compiled languages, while providing relatively familiar abstractions and semantics. C is fantastic when you need to eke out every single cycle of performance, which is why it's a great choice for Python and Postgres. But you do this by effectively writing assembly instructions, which is why it's a terrible choice for someone coming to compiled languages for the first time. C++ gives you equivalent performance to C, for a fraction of the effort, in about 90% of the use cases. For the remaining use cases, C is a better (and often only) choice, but no one who is only learning compiled languages for the first time is anywhere near being able to write that kind of C code. (After a few years of C++ they'll be in a much better place to do so!) reply cheema33 17 hours agorootparentprev> Tip from a friend - just learn C++. Is that good advice for certain domains only?

I rarely see the issues common to moderately complex SwiftUI views when writing Swift with code-only AppKit/UIKit, for a CLI program, etc. reply hombre_fatal 20 hours agorootparentI jumped directly into SwiftUI for a few macOS apps I published, and the weird performance issues / UI lag / Compose complexity for even simplistic apps were hard to navigate, even after a year. Yet rewriting components in AppKit/UIKit feels regressive since even Apple's docs migrated to SwiftUI, but sometimes that was the right answer to regain some control over what was going on. Though some of that was limited to macOS which seems to get a lot less attention from Apple than iOS, or because you're naturally building more complex layouts on macOS. But it always makes me appreciate how much better the kit is for building web frontends. reply jwells89 20 hours agorootparentMost of the layouts I've built on macOS are actually simpler than their iOS counterparts because the mode of interaction is so different. Getting data onto the screen in a somewhat natural way is usually less of a contorted process because one doesn't need to deal with a software keyboard, a narrow viewport, lots of scrolling, etc. The problem with SwiftUI on macOS in my opinion is that it's just not well-suited to the types of layouts common on desktop and especially macOS. It's best at uniform grids and lists which is more of a mobile thing. On macOS you want things like visually balanced whitespace, optical centering of labels+controls in forms, etc which are often rather arbitrary and exactly the thing that SwiftUI is worst at. reply chrismsimpson 16 hours agorootparentprevAll this magic being baked into the language (as opposed to the libraries/ecosystem) is why I abandoned being a native app developer professionally reply jwells89 16 hours agorootparentEh, I'm not too bothered by it.

It's all quite maddening if you try and make sense of it. reply cageface 16 hours agorootparentI think a text-based, declarative rendering API is the right choice. This approach has been vindicated on the web. But the actual implementation of SwiftUI is terrible. Long compilation times, cryptic compiler error messages, bad performance, and a baked-in two-way binding observable state API that's great for code snippets and WWDC talks but makes building a coherent state model in a real app very difficult add up to a big mess. reply josv 18 hours agorootparentpreviOS and macOS had a visual editor forever. Interface Builder was a really interesting take on visual layout, instantiating real objects in the interface and serializing them into nib / xib / storyboard files ready for use in your app. Most developers I know in the ecosystem tried and tried to like the visual editor, but ended up falling back to code. Why? Source code is pretty great. It’s easy to read, write, share, diff, and organize. SwiftUI has, again, a very modern and interesting take on visual editing. The code is the truth, but there’s a rich, realtime preview canvas that makes rountripping possible. For reasons, it’s unfortunately all but unusable for a lot of folks with complex Xcode projects, but it’s a very good idea. In summary: Visual layout editors and text are both pretty great. The devil’s in the details. reply jwells89 18 hours agorootparentI find that Interface Builder, while not great for editing XIBs on iOS and storyboards on either platform (it's slow and buggy in those cases), is actually still fairly pleasant when working on Mac XIBs. My go-to is pure code UIKit on iOS, but I still reach for XIBs frequently for Mac stuff. If IB's performance and stability issues could be fixed, I think its biggest problem is the near-unintelligible spaghetti XML that it generates for XIBs and storyboards, which is a huge pain for VCS and frequently cause of merge conflicts (which must be manually corrected). If they just cleaned up the XML output or switched to something more friendly to manual editing that'd help a lot. reply w10-1 21 hours agoparentprev> the compiler is asking me to help it out Yeah, this sucks, but it's also mind-boggling. The SwiftUI body result builder returns \"some View\" which means the compiler has to infer the specific type that the function produces, as a complex combination of whatever different if/then and while loops, along with their transitive function applications and closure contexts (where the type inference can be outside-in instead of inside-out). Then layer in in the @Observation macro magic for observing data types and re-building views when data changes, Swift Data pulling with fully typed predicates from a data store automatically replicated across devices....

But not necessarily the c++ that they aren't and then likely not the c++ that rust et al are able to replace (although I guess we'll see what they have in mind as time goes by).

Right now, my Mac app depends on a few simple web services that are written in a different language. It would be neat if those services could be written in Swift, so that I could just use the language I already know instead of relearning how to do decode JSON in Python/Ruby/PHP.

The ecosystem is amazing, the language itself is awesome and follows sane rules, you can chose between native code, JVM, WASM, or JS-IR, or all as backends to compile to (for the exact same code) depending on your use case. Compose Multiplatform is also wonderful and by far my favorite UI library now and I’ve shipped a fair bit of code with it. It’s a single UI library that I can share my UI across every platform (including iOS and android), and even seamlessly interop with native widgets on platforms like iOS if I need to, like the camera viewfinder for example. Kotlin’s real strength is the compilers ability to target as many different backends as you want and cross compile into any platform you want. I have an app in production that save for about three lines of swift that declares the view controller for iOS specifically, shares its entire codebase all in kotlin between Android, iOS, Mac, Linux, and Windows.

Also, \"some say\" that macros could revolutionize both static and dynamic generation by moving a good portion of site generation to compile time.

Pity, it was a useful term. It's worth noting many others also consider automatic reference counting to be a form of gc, albeit one with different strengths and weaknesses than stack- and heap-scanning varieties reply kaba0 3 hours agorootparentprevMaybe he should then read a book on garbage collectors that all start with ref counting.. Also, is it “pause execution and clean up” together? As ref counting obviously has to clean up, that’s the whole point - and it actually does so by blocking the mutator thread (the actual program written by the user). Then we didn’t even get to the point where syncing counters across threads are possibly the slowest primitive operation a CPU can do, so if we can’t know that an object will only ever be accessed from a single thread, ref counting has plenty shortcomings. Oh also, nulling the counter in case of a big object graph will pause execution for considerable amount of time (particularly noticeable in case of a c++ program exiting which uses a bunch of shared ptrs) reply neonsunset 18 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps? Most scenarios that explicitly involve .NET's GC vs Swift's ARC display much better performance of the former, to the point where the fact that ARC does not have GC pauses does not help if the whole things is multiple times slower, in many ways it's like Go's \"\"\"low-pause\"\"\" GC design discussions that completely ignore allocation throttling and write barrier cost. Swift lacking proper performant GC is a disadvantage. Upcoming features solve it by likely enabling more scenarios to sidestep ARC, but their impact on the Swift as a whole, and user applications that use them, is yet to be seen. It's important to always remember - there's no free lunch.

Most scenarios that explicitly involve .NET's GC vs Swift's ARC display much better performance of the former By which you mean \"less CPU cycles on a desktop machine with plenty of memory\"? That's not when ARC is more performant; it's better on smaller devices that are under memory pressure and have swapped out some of your memory. In which case you have to swap it back in to go scan for pointers. And if you're a low-priority daemon then you evict higher priority pages in the process. reply neonsunset 15 hours agorootparentPerhaps? You assume GC takes unreasonably more space. It's purely a function of a tradeoff between running it more frequently, tuning heap sizing algortithms, choosing to run them as part of allocation calls on the same thread, sacrificing throughput in the process. GC can be more compact than what you assume. Modern good GC implementation are precise and don't have to mark dead GC roots as live, even within a scope of a single method. .NET and I assume Java GC implementations work this way - that's what \"precise\" means in \"precise tracing GC\". reply astrange 15 hours agorootparentIt's not that it takes more space, it's that it has to read memory more often. Not all memory pages have the same cost to read. Most memory swapping on most people's home computers is from web browsers for this reason; it's part that everyone uses them, but it's also because they're running JavaScript. And they're pretty well tuned, too. reply neonsunset 15 hours agorootparent> it's that it has to read memory more often Wait until you learn about \"reads become writes with ARC\" :) ARC as implemented by Swift, on top of ObjCs retain and release, is design that has an advantage in being more simple, but at the same time worse at other key aspects like throughput, contention, memory traffic and sometimes even memory efficiency. Originally, Swift was meant to use GC, but this failed because Apple could not integrate it well enough with existing Objective-C code, leading to a very crash-prone solution. Also, JavaScript has nothing to do with the lower in abstraction languages discussed in this chain of comments. reply astrange 15 hours agorootparentYou're lecturing me about my job here. I don't need to learn nothin'. > reads become writes with ARC That's not a big problem (it is a problem but a smaller one) since you can choose a different tradeoff wrt whether you keep the reference counting info on the same page or not. There's other allocator metadata with the same issue though. A more interesting one comes up with GC too; if you're freeing all the time, everyone compresses their swap these days, which means zeroing the freed allocations is suddenly worth it because it compresses so much better. > Originally, Swift was meant to use GC, but this failed because Apple could not integrate it well enough with existing Objective-C code, leading to a very crash-prone solution.

Also, .NET tends to heavily zero memory in general, as the spec dictates that fields, variables, arrays contents, etc. must be initialized to their default values before use (which is zero). Compiler can and will elide unneeded zeroing where it can see, but the point is that .NET's heaps should compress quite well (and this seems to be the case on M-series devices). reply vetinari 21 hours agorootparentprevThere is kotlin native, which generates native code, using the same llvm that c++, rust and swift use.

Actually, the way it's written: https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/... is a common way you see toy data structures code written, but it's inefficient (because pointer chasing is slow) and there's better patterns. If you use the arena method above, you could use indexes into the arena. If not, intrusive data structures (where the references are inside Node instead of inside Tree) are better. reply neonsunset 15 hours agorootparentPointer chasing is irrelevant here.

On systems programming, read below: All JVM languages are not viable by definition for this domain. Object oriented and heavily abstracted nature of the underlying runtime implementations prevents their effective usage in systems programming due to lack of fast FFI, structs, particularly so of custom layout, and the historical aversion of the ecosystem to low-level features. Kotlin native does not count because presently it has 0.1-0.001x performance of OpenJDK, it is that bad, and I assume is subject to the common subset of features that must also be expressible with JVM. .NET, especially with compilation to native statically linked binaries (NativeAOT) is an option, and I believe, due to ecosystem maturity as well as very heavy focus on performance in all recent .NET versions as well as continued improvement of low-level features (portable SIMD, byref pointers with simple lifetime analysis, static linking with C/C++/Rust/etc.), it is a strong contender. Unlike Java, C# has great systems programming story, after all, it was influenced as much by C++ as it was by Java, sadly many only ever think about the latter. However, I'm looking forward to Swift 6. Once it is out, I'd love to see it offer more opportunities at ensuring static dispatch and generic monomorphization (in .NET, generics with struct arguments are always monomorphized like in Rust, so you have tools for zero-cost abstractions) and happy paths allowing to bypass prohibitive cost of ARC with new annotations. By using LLVM, Swift has theoretically great performance ceiling, even if it does not deliver on it just yet, losing to C# by a good margin on the more complicated code due to ARC and dynamic dispatch. But because Apple seems to be invested in using it for tasks that will require addressing these shortcomings, it is pretty exciting to see where they will take it. reply jakey_bakey 20 hours agorootparentprevHow hard is it to build an HTTP server?

If you just want a big framework to launch an API, that's been around for years: https://vapor.codes reply taftster 18 hours agorootparentprevSneakily hard, actually. There's different versions of HTTP (of course), so pick your target. But when you hit HTTP/2.0, it's not a simple request/reply model (if HTTP/1.1 can be described as such). The intermixing of various client headers and what they imply to server behavior, handling of the streams and when to open vs. when to close, http/2 multiplexing, etc. Don't forget HTTP/3 which uses the QUIC protocol (UDP based) instead of TCP. Interestingly though, a trivial HTTP server is actually very easy to implement as well. A very crude HTTP/1.0 server (or maybe even a limited scope HTTP/1.1 server) can actually make for a fun afternoon project. Like minimal (or no) concurrency support, all TCP connections closed after the request/response cycle, GET only (or maybe POST only), etc. So it's a mixed bag of what you want and how you define an HTTP server. reply astrange 17 hours agorootparentI can't think of a good reason to want to implement the complex parts. Write an HTTP service if you must, but make it HTTP/1.0 (or 1.1 for keepalive) and stick it behind nginx to do the newer versions and SSL termination. (I also think all HTTP services should if possible be written in a shared-nothing CGI type language, and not embedded in your random stateful program. This way you can't accidentally leak info across user sessions.) reply akvadrako 20 hours agorootparentprevThat all depends on your requirements. A few hundred lines of code will get you pretty far, but there are about 100 optional features in common use. reply porcoda 20 hours agoparentprevI’ve migrated to swift for some nontrivial projects that were formerly C++. Quite happy so far, and didn’t find rust nearly as pleasant when I tried the same thing there. I don’t want explicit memory management very often, so ARC works great for me. Haven’t had any issues with portability either, although I don’t test often on windows so I’m not confident there but Linux and Mac have been great. reply dogprez 20 hours agoparentprevI'm glad you found something you like. I just want to make it clear that the things about Rust that make it \"unfriendly\" are also the things that make it able to do things other languages can't do, like compile-time memory safety. Depending on what you are making, that might make little difference. I just wanted to make sure you appreciated what Rust can do that other languages can't. reply astrange 17 hours agorootparentThis is an article about another language that can do that. reply dogprez 14 hours agorootparentNo, sorry, it's not https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.8.0/book/references-and-borrowin... reply astrange 14 hours agorootparentSwift does have borrow checking: https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-5-exclusivity/ Basically the difference is that Swift's is more implicit, happens more at runtime, and it will make some programs work via copy-on-write that Rust would reject. So that's obviously more limiting. It's more flexible when you can allocate memory freely, but it doesn't work if you can't. reply darby_nine 21 hours agoparentprevCurious! In what ways do you do you see swift as friendlier than Rust? I perceived it as functionally equivalent, although Swift had a lot more \"magic\" involved and it was less clear how things might work memory-wise. reply dagmx 12 hours agorootparentTo me, Swift has better ergonomics for most people. Ref counting by default makes most programs easier to deal with. Guard let (though recently somewhat introduced in rust) are much more friendly ways to unwrap optionals. Being able to provide parameter defaults and aliases. Easy passing in of callbacks. Easier async. Null chains with the Question mark operator. I really like rust, but it’s much faster to get to a working program in Swift. And with the new CXX interop, I now reach for Swift by default since I have to deal with a lot of C++ libraries. reply darby_nine 5 hours agorootparent> Easier async. I was on board until this one. Async is a rough spot for rust, but I find the async strategy swift went with absolutely baffling and difficult to reason about. reply dagmx 10 minutes agorootparentI’m curious, what puts you off of them? Actors are pretty standard ways to do it, and I feel like most of the successful rust implementations are actor based as well. reply 9dev 21 hours agorootparentprevMore magic (thus less required explicitness) and less involvement with memory management are typically considered as friendly traits in programming languages. reply darby_nine 20 hours agorootparent> More magic (thus less required explicitness) and less involvement with memory management are typically considered as friendly traits in programming languages. Really depends on the context. I really, really, really hated this instinct in the ruby on rails community when I was still doing that. Magic is nice until it doesn't work the way you expect, which is when it becomes an active liability. I really don't spend much time thinking about memory management in Rust, but I can certainly understand why one might be happy to not have to design around ownership and lifetimes. I really like the explicit nature of it, though, makes it super easy to read and reason about code you've never seen before. reply keyle 20 hours agoprevI'm incredibly excited for this. I thought swift was basically going to be stuck on macOS. Last time I converted the swift compiler from the Ubuntu package to work on Debian, stuff was looking really awry. Most things work but not simple things like sigterm signals. Swift is a fantastic language. I think the most advanced and smart language today. And I say this having used over 20 professionally over 25 years. Just look at how swiftUI is implemented. It's not even a DSL, it's Swift naturally! Compare it to flutter and you'll see how incredible it is. (I do like dart too though) As for the language it's full of clever features and advanced ideas that don't suck to use and consider the developer real world use of the language. Two things really suck in swift though; compiler error messages are straight out of the university of assholery and documentation was crafted in Mordor probably. Of course most libraries probably won't work well on Linux yet but there is a future with the right balance between safety and speed and joy of developing. reply neillyons 20 hours agoprevI recently started learning Swift and Swift UI and was surprised at how complicated the language is. Especially regarding reactive instance variables. eg. @observableObject. Didn't understand it. There are like five different ways to do it. Ended up playing whack a mole until it worked. reply SebastianKra 11 hours agoparentTBF, reactivity in UI is still basically an unsolved problem with frameworks going in circles between data-binding, dependency-tracking, memoization & compilation. SwiftUI initially promoted their ReactiveX alternative. reply jamil7 14 hours agoparentprevIf you’re targeting newer OSs you can try the @Observable macro instead of ObservableObject. It fixes a lot of the weird problems with the latter (although does introduce some new, weird edge cases). reply gavindean90 15 hours agoparentprevI had the same experience until I worked with swiftdata which was rather nice, especially by comparison. reply bli940505 18 hours agoprevSwift needs to figure out what it wants to do and stick to it. Too many syntactic sugar and too many half baked concepts pushed through the door. reply w10-1 21 hours agoprevIt's super nice that they support moving up incrementally. Moving to Swift-6 mode with full data-race safety checks can be daunting. They wrote a separate post on that, and Holly telegraphed that they're still actively reducing noise, i.e., warnings where the compiler could use a bit more analysis to prove there's no race. The really nice thing is you can use the new tooling, but stay with the 5.10 version of the language that works for your code, and feature-by-feature add Swift 6 checking. You can build the same package under both language modes, so libraries can move ahead in their versioning while still supporting clients who are not ready. reply jamil7 14 hours agoparentI’m sort of in two minds. On paper, I think for greenfield projects data-race safety checking looks great. If I switch to thinking about my day job, I know we will likely never adopt Swift 6 for some of our components because they’d need to basically be rewritten, at which point we’d probably consider something more cross platform like Rust or Kotlin. So despite liking the feature on paper, I feel like the overhead it introduces in practice is kind of pushing me away from the language. It’s hard to say at this point though, adoption might get a lot easier with subsequent point releases. reply O-stevns 1 hour agorootparentThe whole concurrency agenda with local reasoning sounds great in theory but in practice becomes such a pain in the ass for projects that has existed for years. Maybe our current app has unknown data race bugs, maybe not... with a crash free session percentage of 99.80% and hundreds of thousand monthly users, it's not something I consider a big enough problem, to the point where more friction to the language should be added to maybe fix it. reply bogidan 23 hours agoprevThe download sizes are quite large. 775 MB for swift-6.0-RELEASE-ubuntu22.04.tar.gz ~500MB for windows. Is this shipping an entire copy of LLVM? What could possibly make this so large? reply favorited 22 hours agoparentYeah, they contain binaries for Swift itself (the driver interface, the compiler, the repl, the package manager, swift-format, etc.), as well as the toolchain's dependencies (llvm, lldb, clang, the sanitizer runtimes, etc.). There are other (also large) downloads to enable producing static binaries on Linux, and those contain the required system libraries (musl libc, libicu, libcrypto, libpthread, etc.). Those are about twice as big as they need to be, because they bundle x86 and aarch64 together. reply derefr 22 hours agoparentprevCross-target toolchain support for shipping for all platforms from any platform? (Not sure that's in there, but if it were, it'd be large.) reply skrrtww 22 hours agoprevI wish they would stop introducing more magic syntaxes. reply schrodinger 21 hours agoparentI agree! I'm a Go programmer, and while I do wish it had some more features at times, Swift is an example of how it can easily go out of control and ruin a promising language. For example tests, there's so much magic. How do I know it runs the test for each item in the arguments array? What if there were multiple arguments? After using Go for close to a decade now, I'm really seeing the wisdom of avoiding magic, and making your testing code the same language as your building code! Compare: Swift: @Test(\"Continents mentioned in videos\", arguments: [ \"A Beach\", \"By the Lake\", \"Camping in the Woods\" ]) func mentionedContinents(videoName: String) async throws { let videoLibrary = try await VideoLibrary() let video = try #require(await videoLibrary.video(named: videoName)) #expect(video.mentionedContinents.count3 { t.Errorf(\"video %q mentions more than 3 continents\", tt.Name) } } } Go with timeout handling in case the FindVideo function takes too long (idk Swift magic well enough to know if it'd do this automatically!) func TestMentionedContinents(t *testing.T) { tests := []struct{ Name string }{ {\"A Beach\"}, {\"By the Lake\"}, {\"Camping in the Woods\"}, } for _, tt := range tests { t.Run(tt.Name, func(t *testing.T) { ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Millisecond) defer cancel() video, err := library.FindVideoByName(ctx, tt.Name) if err != nil { t.Fatalf(\"failed to get video: %v\", err) } if len(video.MentionedContinents) > 3 { t.Errorf(\"video %q mentions more than 3 continents\", tt.Name) } }) } } reply Aloisius 15 hours agorootparent@Test, #require and #expect are just macros. You can expand them if you want to see what they do (or just look at the swift-testing code itself). Perhaps I'm just used to Python unit testing with similar decorators. Presumably, if you need to pass in two arguments, you'd either pass arguments: an array of tuples or a tuple of arrays for combinatorial testing. reply tiltowait 17 hours agorootparentprev> How do I know it runs the test for each item in the arguments array? At the risk of coming across a bit rudely: this feels analogous to asking “how do I know `for _, tt := range tests` loops over every element in the array?” Both are language/syntactic constructs you have to learn. reply schrodinger 1 hour agorootparentMaybe I'm being a bit harsh myself, but with the Go code, it's the same syntax that I use whenever I would write a for loop anywhere else in my production codebase. It's not something special to testing, it's literally _just code_. However, I do like Swift, I in fact single-handledy wrote an entire iPhone app used by 10s of thousands of people on it and there were a lot of wonderful things, like nullability being \"solved\", and smart enums etc. This isn't a language war, I like them both, and could point out flaws in either just as easily. I just feel like Swift has a bit too low of a bar for adding new features, which leads to a lot of nice things, but also a lot of functionality bloat. I can look at Go written 10 years ago and it'll largely be the same as how it'd be written today; with Swift, it's night and day. I built the aforementioned app in 2014 to 2017 (mostly the first year), and there's so much I don't recognize. I think one of the things that bothered me the most where I feel they sort of \"jumped the shark\" is with ViewBuilders. It looks like code, acts like it 99% of the time, but it isn't. Does that `var body: some View { ... }` return a view anywhere? No, and it'll break if you try! It's a whole different concept to admittedly offer a very nice experience emnulating React with idempotent views. But still, it's awfully strange that this works: struct IntroView: View { @State private var text = \"Yes\" var body: some View { VStack { Text(text) Button(\"Toggle\") { text = text == \"Yes\" ? \"No\" : \"Yes\" } } } } But this does not, because it's not _actually_ code. struct IntroView: View { @State private var text = \"Yes\" var body: some View { VStack { Text(text) Button(\"Toggle\") { text = text == \"Yes\" ? \"No\" : \"Yes\" } print(\"debugging line\") } } } reply rescripting 18 hours agorootparentprev> How do I know it runs the test for each item in the arguments array I mean the APIs aren’t magic; you can “inspect macro” to see what code is generated at compile time which boils down to something similar to the Go code with better ergonomics. reply schrodinger 54 minutes agorootparentI don't know if I'd agree better ergonomics in this case, since you lose a lot. What if you wanted to load your test cases from a CSV? e.g. you had a two column CSV with 1,000 words, first column mixed case, second case lowercase. They're mixed languages, with unicode oddities sprinkled in. So it really is worth testing against such a corpus. In Go, I could simply open a csv checked into the codebase and use it for my test cases. I'm sure it's possible, but you probably have to break way from the macro (which I argue doesn't add anything) and take a completely different approach. In Go, it's JUST CODE. Again, I really like Swift (besides xcode performance at times… ugh!). It's possible to find flaws in both languages yes still like them. Swift knocks Go out of the water in so many ways. But I'm scarred from ruby on rails magic growing and growing until you had to be an expert in the magic to write code, when the point was for the magic to make it easier. reply MBCook 20 hours agoparentprevIs there a specific one you’re objecting to in 6? reply skrrtww 19 hours agorootparentSince you asked: The provided `drinkable` example I think is pretty bad and it's very surprising to me that this is a headline feature. protocol Drinkable: ~Copyable { consuming func use() } struct Coffee: Drinkable, ~Copyable { /\\* ... */ } struct Water: Drinkable { /* ... \\*/ } func drink(item: consuming some Drinkable & ~Copyable) { item.use() } drink(item: Coffee()) drink(item: Water()) Here we have a drink() function that either accepts something `Copyable` OR non-Copyable (uh, I mean, `~Copyable`) and either consumes it...or doesn't? That seems to me like a fountain for logic errors if the function behaves completely differently with the same signature (which is, in fact, explicitly labeled `consuming`). It seems like it should not just compile if you try to call this with a `Copyable` type like Water, but it does. The syntax for representing this complex and weird concept of \"maybe consuming\" being `consuming some Drinkable & ~Copyable` is also just totally gross. Why are we using bitwise operation syntax for some weird and logically incoherent kludge? We cannot apply these & and ~ operators indiscriminately, and they do not mean the same thing that they logically mean in any other context, but this function definition definitely implies that they do. reply Dagonfly 1 hour agorootparentThe issue is that `~Copyable` is basically an anti-protocol. With a generics definition like `some Drinkable` you are _restricting_ the set of suitable types (from any type to only the ones implementing `Drinkable`) which then _expands_ the available functionality (the method use() becomes available). From the perspective of type `Water`, it's conformance to `Drinkable` expands the functionality. The language designers then get in a pickle if some functionality was assumed to exist for all types (e.g. `Copyable`)! By \"conforming\" to `~Copyable` you are _removing_ functionality. The type can NOT be copied which was assumed to be universally true before. Now, a generics definition like `some ~Copyable` actually _expands_ the set of suitable types (because Copyable types can be used as if they were non-copyable) and reduces the available functionality. It's the inverse of a regular protocol! It becomes extra confusing if you combine `some Drinkable & ~Copyable` where `Drinkable` and `~Copyable` work in opposite directions. This problem also exists in Rust. `Sized` is a trait (aka protocol) that basically all normal types implement, but you can opt-out by declaring `!Sized`. Then, if you actually want to include all types in your generics, you need to write `?Sized` (read: Maybe-Sized). reply MBCook 18 hours agorootparentprevHere’s my take. I haven’t used this feature yet so I haven’t dug in too deep. drink() takes a Drinkable. A Drinkables can be non-copyable. Copyable is the default, so it has to mark itself as accepting non-copyables. Coffee is non-copyable. Water doesn’t say which means it’s copyable (the default). You can use a copyable anywhere you’d use a non-copyable since there is no restriction. So since drink can take non-copyables it can also use copyables. I’m guessing the function definition has to list non-copyable otherwise it would only allow copyable drinks since the default is all variables are copyable. “consuming some” means the function takes over the ownership of the non-copyable value. It’s no longer usable in the scope that calls drink(). For the copyable value I’m not sure but since they can be copied I could see that going either way. On syntax: Yeah it’s a bit weird, but there was a big debate about it. They wanted something easy to read and fast to use. NotCopyable is really clear but typing it over and over would get real old. ~ is not special syntax. My understand is “~Copyable” is the name of the type. You can’t just put ~ in front of anything, like ~Drinkable. But since that’s the syntax used for bitwise negation it’s pretty guessable. & is existing syntax for multiple type assertions. You can see the evolution in this Stack Overflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/24089278 Seems to read like C to me. It has to be Drinkable and not Copyable. Like I said I haven’t gotten to use this yet, but it seems like a nice improvement. And I know it’s a step in the path towards making it easier to do safe asynchronous programming, object lifetimes, and other features. reply skrrtww 17 hours agorootparentYeah after thinking about it a bit more it does make more sense to me. The primary gap I had was, as you allude here: > You can use a copyable anywhere you’d use a non-copyable since there is no restriction. Effectively copyable always conforms to non-copyable, just not the other way around. And the compiler effectively automatically notates literally everything with Copyable, so you need the explicit (& ~Copyable) in the function definition so you're still able to define functions within a ~Copyable protocol that have Copyable semantics. It's very in the weeds, and I still don't like it (I would have preferred NotCopyable since the ~, especially next to the &, directly implies something like bitwise operators), but I guess custom ownership is itself very in the weeds and you will have to think about it hard no matter what approach is taken. I would have expected custom ownership to be fundamentally incompatible with Swift, but clearly it's here; I should probably read about it more so I have a more clear understanding. (I also didn't realize & was extant syntax). reply MBCook 16 hours agorootparentYeah, I’ll admit it’s hard to get your head around. I had to think about it a couple of times just writing that explanation. It took me a couple of minutes to figure out why it was in the function definition. I guess it had to be but that wasn’t obvious to me at all at first. > And the compiler effectively automatically notates literally everything Right. Just like how all classes in Java extend Object even though you don’t have to literally write it. I believe they’re still working on a more Rust-like borrowing system, but I could be wrong. I know this helped them implement parts of the standard library much better because they could make assumptions that you can’t make with copyable objects. I do get your point about just calling it NotCopyable. I don’t actually know why they settled on the name they did, I didn’t ever try to look that up. Maybe it’s because it’s a special thing that requires compiler machinery and there’s no way for you to make an equivalent? reply sirwhinesalot 8 hours agoprevCTRL-F \"no longer takes 37000 years to typecheck a simple expression\". \"0 matches\".

All it does is correct spelling and punctuation or give rephrase suggestions. But Grammarly does it so unreasonably well that nothing else compares. Grammarly's core functionality is not even LLM-based; it's older than that. Recently, they've crammed in some LLM features that I don't care a snoot about compared to its core functionality.

It gives you an indication of how your writing comes across, e.g. friendly, aggressive, assertive, polite. English can be a very nuanced language - easy to learn, difficult to master. Grammarly helps with that. reply rlayton2 13 hours agorootparentprevI'm a big fan of Grammarly and have been using it, and paying for it, for years. The advantage is not spell checking. It is grammar and style improvements. It tells you things like \"this language is informal\", or \"this is a better word for that\". reply socksy 9 hours agorootparentprevIt is widely used in countries where the professional language is English, but the native language of the speakers is not. For example, most Slavic languages don't have the same definite/indefinite article system English does, which means that whilst someone could speak and write excellent English, the correct usage of \"a\" and \"the\" is a constant conscious struggle, where having a tool to check and correct your working is really useful. In Greek, word order is not so important. And so on. Spell check usually just doesn't cut it, and when it does (say, in Word), it usually isn't universally available. Personally, I have long wanted such a system for German, which I am not native in. Lucky for me DeepL launched a similar product with German support. A recent example for me was that I was universally using \"bekommen\" as a literal translation of \"receive\" in all sentences where I needed that word. Through DeepL I learned that the more appropriate word in a bunch of contexts is \"erhalten\", which is the sort of thing that I would never have got from a spell check. Grammarly is notably a Ukrainian founded company. reply mhuffman 12 hours agorootparentprevThe \"grammar\" part, at least in a professional setting.

Meet Harper https://github.com/elijah-potter/harper reply vunderba 14 hours agoprevNice job—I'm always a fan of 'bring your own key' (BYOK) approaches. I think there's a lot of potential in using LLMs as virtual copy editors. I do a fair amount of writing and have actually put together several custom GPTs, each with varying degrees of freedom to rewrite the text. The first one acts strictly as a professional editor—it's allowed to fix spelling errors, grammatical issues, word repetition, etc., but it has to preserve the original writing style. I do a lot of dictation while I walk my husky, so when I get back home, I can run whisper, convert the audio to text, and throw it at the GPT. It cleans it up, structures it into paragraphs, etc. Between whisper/GPT, it saves me hours of busy work. The other one is allowed to restructure the text, fix continuity errors, replace words to ensure a more professional tone, and improve the overall flow. This one is more reserved for public communique such as business related emails. reply edweis 11 hours agoparent> I'm always a fan of 'bring your own key' (BYOK) approaches. \"Bring your own key\" has the same amount of syllables as \"BYOK\" reply closetkantian 5 hours agorootparentIf your point is that BYOK is a useless acronym since it has the same number* of syllables, I disagree.

I have a custom Gemini Gem that critiques my writing and points out how I can better my paragraphs, but I do the bulk of the rewriting myself.

The fact that it can call another closed-source service doesn't mean that this tool itself is not open source. reply senko 13 hours agoparentprevThe source seems to be at the linked repo, and the license is MIT. How’s that a stretch? reply latexr 9 hours agorootparentBecause it’s a wrapper on a closed-source system. Imagine writing a shell script that cuts and converts video by calling ffmpeg, would you say it was “a video converter written in bash”? No, the important part would not be in bash, that’s just the thin wrapper used to call the tool and could be in any language. Meaning it would be useless to anyone who e.g. worked on a constrained system where they are not allowed to install any binaries. Same thing here. If you only run open-source software for privacy reasons, sending all your program data to some closed server you don’t control doesn’t address your issue. There’s no meaningful difference between making an open-source plugin that calls an OpenAI API and one that calls a Grammarly API. reply guappa 9 hours agorootparentI've seen posts of \"js interpreter written in 1 line\" that was just a script calling node… reply latexr 9 hours agorootparentWere those being serious?

I’ve canceled my subscription recently as found it getting worse, not better, I suspect because they are now applying LLMs. The suggestions started to make less sense and the problem with LLM suggestions is all your writing takes the tone of the LLM, you loose your personality/style in what you write.

Not asking from a critical place, I legitimately am curious about dysfunctional business processes at other companies and want to know if people really are drowning in SaaS access requests reply JohnMakin 22 hours agoparentLol, yes, you can extend this same bit to any team that deals with a lot of ops. Usually goes like this - Too many requests come in for one team to handle. No budget to hire more bodies, or maybe you've already reached a point where that will no longer scale - the work can usually be automated completely, but stopping and taking the time to automate it will result in a 100% loaded team KPI's dropping significantly, meaning you'll almost never get management buy-in or any time to do it, leaving you in a perpetual cycle of manual work requests flooding in like in this scene. I was kind of hoping the ending would be his tool worked and they all got laid off - actually seen this happen. reply mewpmewp2 18 hours agorootparentPersonally I think the successful automation ending would've been \"too satisfactory and perfect\". Real life is not that. I felt the video was relatable to me in many frequent situations where I would like to automatize some sort of process, but I end up being overly enthusiastic, because I'm so biased towards automating routineus activities. I frequently end up spending more time automating something than it would've been worth to just do it couple of times. I end up creating PoCs that don't entirely work in situations like those and the demos can fail, because I got bored at some point and didn't check thoroughly enough, so this video made me cringe at myself. I do feel however that this was just one layer of this video, and the other layer is about the other side where manual processes are preferred for irrational reasons over automation, so I think this video accurately reflected all sides of the story. Automating vs doing something routineusly is a balancing and tolerance act. reply JohnMakin 17 hours agorootparentI have fought this battle for my entire career. The problem is, incentives are tough - often senior engineers on ops teams have built the system on duct tape and bubble gum, and have a very specific and unobtainable knowledge about all the quirks of it which frequently involve a ton of manual, esoteric shit to resolve without a lot of know-how. Part of how I’ve made myself useful as a consultant sometimes in my career is by insisting on a strict set of processes that break down and identify bottlenecks like this. It’s almost always ops, it almost always can be automated, but there’s “no bandwidth or budget” to fix the problems so they expect superheroes to constantly save the day by pulling absurd hours or by inventing genius solutions that management buys into. For me, as an IC or sometimes as a consultant, I try to chip away. We spend X minutes a week doing Y thing manually. what’s the easiest thing we can do to reduce X? and then slowly introduce whatever arises out of those processes, and then slowly “eat the elephant” one bite at a time. when people come into a big messy manual legacy system they often, imho, make the mistake of wanting to tear it down and recreate it from scratch. having done several cloud architecture/IAC refactors in my career, I can tell you its definitely a way easier sell to management and other teams to whittle away at it than to recreate it entirely, and i think that’s also what the video is poking fun at. There’s always skeletons that your perfect solution will run into. Processes, standards, and monitoring will expose these dead bodies, but it’s not a one shot solution and I’m immediately skeptical when anyone proposes something in this space that is. Every situation is a snowflake. reply mewpmewp2 17 hours agorootparent> Every situation is a snowflake. Yeah, I mean, I think this describes it. Ultimately the video had many thoughts and layers, starting with a charismatic lead who is proud or pretending to be proud about completely meaningless, arbitrary achievements and metrics trying to motivate his team for rejecting access requests. Then it goes on to this individual who just can't handle it. Which is relatable. I don't think I could be able to perform a job like this at all. So I think this individual there was just so badly misplaced for handling this type of work - he really wanted out from there, but unfortunately it is not always so simple. In an ideal world he would've worked in another role. reply JohnMakin 17 hours agorootparentYea, this video is definitely relatable to a lot of people in a lot of ways and that’s what I love about these. They hit hard. For me particularly, I have trouble selling to stubborn management teams to delay projects just a tiny bit to allow refactoring or adjustments to automate time wasting shit, and I abhor toil to the core of my being - so I will often get into situations like this guy and be like “fuck it I’m fixing it myself.” I’ve had similar failures as in this video, lol. As a leader and as an IC. It hits really hard. If you’re ever in this situation you have to either leave, or exact whatever measures you have to fix it. Or face inevitable burnout. Those are the only choices or you will go mad. reply mewpmewp2 16 hours agorootparentSome other interesting thoughts I had about the video: 1. The team lead was somehow able to leave an impression of Matthew McConaughey from The Wolf of Wall Street so strongly, I don't know if that was intentional. The whole acting felt amazing actually in such a weird way... 2. The Slack sound effects, I assume this has to be traumatizing to everyone watching this video, right. reply jldugger 21 hours agorootparentprevPersonally, I was expecting him to solve the problem but then be faced with a \"now you have 18 standards\" problem of having to approve access to his new tool via tickets. reply jldugger 17 hours agoparentprevYes. It's so bad where I work now that IT delegated approvals back to the managers. So now whenever you hire a new engineer, you have to click approve on all the systems they need access to do their job, because apparently RBAC doesn't scale to FAANG. And then they need to re-apply, and you need to re-approve, every year because virtually no accounts are 'forever' approved. And since many of these are \"per-seat\" licensing, finance is always cajoling IT into aggressively culling unused accounts. Which makes it to these poor bastards's DMs early in the screen, and the corresponding IT ticket hell of people requesting their access back. The punchline at the end is basically just hubris: you've solved the megacorp RBAC problem in your head, but trip over the BS logistics of it all. Probably because your application doesn't have network permissions or some other ironic problem. reply kylegill 19 hours agoparentprevI find the ending particularly funny, we have a small team where we're often building things in-house that we should probably just buy, or rely on manual processes for. The fumbling with \"oops, there's some test data in here\" and the issues with the service worker hit a little close to home from some of our demos I've been a part of. reply tboyd47 21 hours agoparentprevIt's not that.

    "originBody": "A friendly introduction to assembly for high-level programmers — Hello 2024-09-08 Coming from JavaScript, Rust, C, or any other high-level language, looking at assembly snippets can be confusing or even scary. Let’s take the following snippet: section .data msg db \"Hello, World!\" section .text global _start _start: mov rax, 1 mov rdi, 1 mov rsi, msg mov rdx, 13 syscall mov rax, 60 mov rdi, 0 syscall Thankfully the second line gives away what this does. None of the bread and butter of programming as we know it is here: conditionals and loops are nowhere to be seen, there is no way to create functions… heck, variables don’t even have names! Where does one even start? This little introduction is meant to introduce you, somebody with programming experience, to the world of assembly. We’ll discuss the basics of the language and map them to high-level programming constructs. By the end of this guide, you will be able to navigate assembly code, know where to look for information, and even write some simple programs all by yourself. Let’s get started! Hello world Unsurprisingly, our first program will be a “Hello World”. Before jumping into the code though, we need to briefly introduce the language we’ll be using. At the end of this section, we will be able to write and run our first assembly program. x86-64 assembly First things first, assembly is not a language. Assembly refers to a family of programming languages featuring instructions that closely map to the machine code that the CPU will execute. In fact, one of the raisons d’etre of assembly languages is to provide a human-readable version of machine code in situations like reverse engineering, hardware programming, or developing games for consoles. In this guide, we will use x86-64 assembly which can be assembled and executed on most personal computers. This choice should ease running and tinkering with the snippets along the way. For historical reasons, there are two “flavors” of the x64-64 assembly syntax: one called Intel and the other is called AT&T1. In this guide we will stick to the Intel dialect because it’s used by the Intel Software Developer Manuals (SDM), the source of truth on what the CPU really does when fed an instruction. Assembly is all about working close to the hardware. Optimizimg for portability of the code examples across operative systems and architactures would obfuscate the content of this introduction. The snippets we will be written for Linux, and they should run fine on Window’s WSL as well. The general concepts and practices are nonetheless valid regardless of your OS of choice. Anatomy of an instruction Instructions are the way we tell the CPU what to do. They look something like this: mov rax, rbx They represent the smallest unit of assembly language and are mostly composed of two parts: mnemonic: a shortened word or sentence that specifies the operation to be performed operands: a list of 0-3 items representing what’s affected by the operation In our example, the mnemonic is mov, which stands for move, and the operands are rax and rbx. This instruction in plain English would read: move the content of rbx in rax. Note rax and rbx are registers and we will introduce them in the next paragraph. In the meantime, you can imagine them as variables holding a value. Some instructions will have more then mnemonic and operands. Additional parts such as prefixes and size directives will only be needed later, and we’ll talk through them at the right moment. Fear not, there is no need to memorize all the possible instructions now. Whenever we’ll come across new operations, we will discuss them, and with repetition you will remember in no time. The Intel Software Developer Manuals (SDM) will be our instruction reference in the next chapters. Keep it handy! Storing data: Registers You can think of registers as storage space baked right into the CPU itself. They are small and incredibly fast to access. The most common registers are the so-called general purpose registers. In x86-64 they are sixteen in total, and they are 64 bits wide. One can access the whole register or a subset by using different names. For example, using rax (as in the code above) would address all the 64 bits in the rax register. With al, you can access the lower byte of the same register. Register Higher byte Lower byte Lower 2 bytes¹ Lower 4 bytes² rax ah al ax eax rcx ch cl cx ecx rbx bh bl bx ebx rdx dh dl dx edx rsp spl sp esp rsi sil si esi rdi dil di edi rbp bpl bp ebp r8 r8b r8w r8d r9 r9b r9w r9d r10 r10b r10w r10d r11 r11b r11w r11d r12 r12b r12w r12d r13 r13b r13w r13d r14 r14b r14w r14d r15 r15b r15w r15d ¹: 2 bytes are sometimes called words (hence the w suffix) ²: 4 bytes are sometimed called double-words or dwords (hence the d suffix) General purpose means that they can store anything in principle. In practice, we’ll see that some registers have special meanings, some instructions only use certain registers, and some conventions dictate who is expected to write where. The only non-general-purpose register we will be concerned with is rip the instruction pointer register. It holds the address of the next instruction to execute, and therefore, modifying rip allows programs to jump to arbitrary instructions in the code. Our first assembly file Assembly files typically have an .s or .asm extension and they are split in three sections: data: where we define constants and initialized variables; bss: where we define non-initialized variables; text: where we will type our code, this is the only mandatory section of the file. section .data ; constants here section .bss ; variables here section .text ; code here Note The semicolon ; is the comment character: whatever comes after it will not be executed. Assembly programs run as you would expect. They start with the first instruction and sequentially execute one instruction after the other, from top to bottom. To create control flow, such as conditionals and loops, we make our programs ‘jump’ to specific instructions. We will look at jumps in detail in the next sections. Just as you’d use a main function in many high-level languages, assembly requires us to specify an entry point for our program. We do this using the global declaration, which points to a label. Labels are the assembly’s way of giving human-readable names to specific instructions. They serve two purposes: making our code more understandable and allowing us to reference these instructions elsewhere in our program. You can declare a label by writing it followed by a colon, like this: label:. When you want to reference a label (for example, in a jump instruction), use it without the colon: label. Typically, global references a _start label declared immediately after it. That is where our program will start executing. section .data ; constants here section .bss ; variables here section .text global _start _start: ; instructions here At last, “Hello World” Finally, we have all the tools to build software in assembly. Very Nice! Our program will use two system calls: sys_write to print characters in a terminal and exit to terminate the process with a given status code. Using syscalls goes like this: select the syscall to invoke by moving its identifier in rax pass arguments to the syscall by populating appropriate registers use the syscall instruction to fire the call The only other instruction we will use is mov which we have seen in the instruction paragraph. It works pretty much like an assignment (the = operator) in many high-level languages: it moves the content of the second operand into the first operand. Let’s look at the code to see how this plays together. Coding along Throughout this series, we’ll use an embedded editor to tinker with the code and run the examples as we go. The same content can be found in the sibling repository shikaan/x86-64-asm-intro if you want to run locally. All the snippets are commented to explain what’s going on step by step. Make sure you read the comments carefully! Conclusion We have a “hello world”! In this first article, we learned some basic assembly concepts, we cut our teeth on its syntax, and we even wrote some working software. Moreover, we explored how to communicate with the operative system and are ready to produce more interesting programs in the next article. Continue on Hackernews You can read up on the differences between Intel and AT&T syntax here. If it’s your absolute first time with assembly, it might be a little too early to make sense of it.

It's hopelessly outdated as an architecture, but the instruction set is way more suited for teaching (and you should look at the classic procedure from Harris and Harris where they actually design a pipelined MIPS processor component by component to handle the instruction set). reply ndiddy 2 hours agoparentMIPS is a load-store architecture and has branch delay slots, both of which make it complicated to learn for beginners. If you want to learn an obsolete ISA with no commercial relevance because it's simpler, I would recommend 68000 or 6502 instead. reply zahlman 2 hours agorootparentThose are the ones I was fed in the early 00s and I can confirm they work fine for pedagogical purposes. But if it were my choice today, I think I'd go with THUMB on legacy 32-bit ARM chips. (This can even theoretically be used practically today: GBA games can be emulated on 3DS and probably also Switch.) reply Salgat 1 hour agorootparentprevLearning assembly on the 68HC11 was the keystone moment in understanding programming at an intuitive level for me. What I learned applies to this day. reply Findecanor 9 hours agoparentprevI'd recommend RISC-V instead. It is close to MIPS assembly but more consistent without MIPS's quirks. I believe it has already replaced MIPS for teaching assembly language at many universities. Another one I've seen a lot is the 8-bit MCU Intel 8051. reply dundarious 5 hours agoparentprevPeople who say this rarely also recommend learning toki pona or Esperanto before learning a spoken language they have a practical need for. Some do, but few. In don't think it makes sense to learn a \"clean\" language first. Always learn a useful language and never learn a language that has no organic utility as step 1 of learning a useful one. Unless the person taking this advice will program MIPS devices, then go ahead. reply Brian_K_White 3 hours agorootparentThis is only true if your goal is only to speak some language rather than be a linguist. The analogy is a little off because most people do not much need to be linguists. But programmers almost always benefit from being a linguist that can pick up any language and do some job and then the next job might be any other language. The abstract language allows you to see the difference between the universal principles and the arbitrary quirks. You don't think it's worth the abstract stage it to know that? I do. Even though I'm not primarily a developer. This is just as an ordinary mere user of computers. Just the plain utility of being even basically literate and functional and do a little coding or modifying in any language that the current project happens to use is extremely valuable in whatever I want to do at any given time. Not to mention the entirely other obvious thing that you almost always learn a simple version of any new thing rather than starting immediately with the most advanced and complex version. No, this reasoning does not hold up to scrutiny. reply Salgat 1 hour agorootparentprevComparing spoken language with programming is such a terrible comparison to make. The two even at a fundamental level have almost nothing in common. The brain uses completely different parts for programming and human language. reply Jach 4 hours agorootparentprevNeed-based learning is the way to go with this for sure. Z80 assembly (ZX Spectrum) used to be a popular online recommendation, it's probably a good thing it's no longer popular... On the other hand, I think most people who are casually interested in learning a bit more about assembly don't have a need, so aren't going to actually use it or do anything with it. If the need for any particular system just isn't there, just a weak desire to learn a little, learning fundamentals is a decent strategy, and picking a language that helps get to and express those fundamentals will be helpful even if you later on use a different language. What are the relevant fundamentals for assembly? Maybe just a story about how CPUs from the 70s sort of worked is fine. With spoken languages, there's not much difference in \"cleaner\" things like Esperanto vs. useful things like English in showcasing fundamentals like nouns and verbs. With assembly, x86 is kind of insane, so I think there are bigger differences. Of course, some people might consider modern hardware advances to be the fundamentals. Like if you aren't learning about simd and so on, taking into account caches and multi-cores, what's even the point, sort of opinions. I can almost get behind that. My biased opinion though is that if you want to learn beyond a casual level, you should definitely be learning something that is running on actual hardware, not some sort of emulation layer. x86 then comes back into prominence since most PCs are that. However in the context of a captive audience like students in a classroom, the teacher can decide on something less insane, more fun than things like figuring out how to take an -O0 compiled C file and optimize a loop (ignore -O2 will do it better), and more showcasing a \"need\" because unlike your x86 class assignment, you can't just trivially do it in a higher level language, and you can't just swap in an x86 chip to a PCB. My first introduction to real assembly in college was with a little PIC microcontroller to control a robot car. I knew a bit of x86 by then, just enough to compare, and it was such a breath of fresh air just to use something not x86. It could have been ARM (we later used an ARM chip to program an RTOS and do other embedded systems relevant stuff), or anything really, the important thing is it was real. In the quest for teaching a \"simpler assembly\" I know some schools have done things I consider absurd like having students learn some other architecture but can only run code in some provided emulator on Windows, not a real chip with real peripherals you need to write code to talk to. reply zellyn 2 hours agoparentprevI disagree. I did 6502 (and a bit of z80) in high school, those old Turbo-Pascal-embedded-assembly demoscene tutorials in high school and college, learned MIPS in college, learned msp430 (very risc-y) when working through microcorruption.com, wrote a (very simply) Cool-to-MIPS compiler working through the old Coursera compilers course, and wrote a 6502 emulator, AppleII emulator, and 6502 assembler. I still feel completely intimidated and out of my depth with modern assembly. I have no idea where to start. There are just so many instructions, conventions, registers with strange names and conventions that include each other, etc. Add to that that many of the examples you see are trying to beat the compiler, so doing clever/wide stuff. A comprehensive, modern tutorial that starts simple but goes more or less the whole way would be welcome. reply zahlman 2 hours agorootparent>I still feel completely intimidated and out of my depth with modern assembly. I have no idea where to start. I'm not surprised. But keep in mind that \"create something that works on a modern CPU and beats the compiler's output\" is not the only possible goal of learning assembly programming. I would say it's not even the usual goal, and hasn't been for a long time. reply scotty79 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's not that bad if you don't expect too much of yourself. I could patch some software machine code just by drawing on my 6502 teenage experience from more than 20 years ago. x86 or IL ASM doesn't matter all that much. Core concepts are the same. Registers, stack, relative jumps conditioned on the contents of flag register. One thing that tripped me up a bit is that on x86 standard practice is using \"taking address\" lea operation combined with weird addressing mode to do simple arithmetics. I had to ask ChatGPT wtf is that. In the process I learned that 686 assembly is a very different beast and they don't play nicely with each other (or at all). reply zellyn 1 hour agorootparentAh, interesting.

Definitely easier than x86, but I kind of wonder if a modern learner wouldn't constantly be wondering if they were missing something and whether they were actually learning anything on what is now a completely obsolete framework. x86 is more complex, but you can actually see it _do_ something rather than hope that the emulator you're running it on is actually faithful to a real electronic device. reply dtagames 4 hours agoparentprevEven System/370 [0] architecture (mainframe) is a great place to start.

You can do a lot with 10MIPS 8-bit MCUs that has a bunch of easy I/O peripherals. It's easy and accessible.

    "originBody": "I wrote a decade ago about the Double Irish Dutch Sandwich, a strategy for corporations to evade taxes that was widespread and large-scale enough to come to the attention of the International Monetary Fund. But due to various changes in national and international tax agreements, the strategy seems to have faded substantially. Ana Maria Santacreu and Samuel Moore of the St. Louis Fed provide some background in “Unpacking Discrepancies in American and Irish Royalty Reporting” (August 08, 2024). For those who don’t keep up to speed on the details of international tax evasion schemes, Santacreu and Moore describe the Double Irish Dutch Sandwich works like this: The Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich tax scheme, as illustrated in the third figure, involved a complex arrangement between a U.S. parent company (USP) and three foreign subsidiaries. The first Irish subsidiary (I1) was incorporated in Ireland but managed from Bermuda, allowing it to avoid both Irish and U.S. taxes. The second Irish subsidiary (I2) was incorporated and managed in Ireland. The purpose of I2 is to control foreign distribution and collect income. A Dutch subsidiary (N) acted as an intermediary between I2 and I1 to avoid Irish taxes. The scheme worked by exploiting specific provisions in Irish and U.S. tax laws. A USP would transfer intellectual property ownership to I1. Then, I2 would sublicense the intellectual property from I1 and pay royalties. These royalties would flow from I2 to N, and then from N to I1, taking advantage of European Union tax regulations. This structure allowed profits to be shifted to tax havens like Bermuda, effectively minimizing tax liabilities for the entire corporate structure. However, a combination of Irish tax reforms in 2015 and changes in the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 made this strategy ineffective: “Consequently, Irish companies began paying royalties directly to American parent companies instead of routing them through tax havens.” The shifts in royalty payments tell the story. This figure shows royalty payments by Irish companies to the US, which doubled from since 2019 to 2021. Conversely, tax payments from Ireland and from Netherlands to Bermuda, well-known for it’s near-zero corporate taxes, went way down–showing a decilne in corporate profits being routed through Bermuda. I’m sure the international tax lawyers around the world are strategizing new tax evasion strategies even as I write these words. But it’s worth remembering that there are two large costs at play here. The obvious loss is to government revenue, but the more subtle and still very real loss is the diversion of high-powered talent from what could have been gains in efficiency and productivity to focus instead on corporate reorganizations and tax evasion games.

It's also a loss to all of us who find ourselves owning a \"foreign\" corporation for legitimate reasons, and having to do a lot of work proving that we're not playing shell games. I'm an American living in the UK; I've started what's now a one-man bootstrapped company and it just makes sense for it to be incorporated in the UK. I don't mind paying taxes, but I don't want to have to pay them twice. UK taxes are generally higher than US taxes, and there are tax treaties to avoid double taxation, so no problem, right? Wrong. First, if a US citizen owns more than 10% of a foreign corporation, there's an insanely complicated form you have to fill out, two pages of which are incomprehensible questions (\"Is your company considered an X corporation under sections Y and Z of the Blablablah act?\") that simply require an expert to fill out. Secondly, if a US citizens owns more than 50% of a foreign company, by default, income from that company counts as personal income, but taxes paid by the company to another government don't count as personal taxes. You can get around this, apparently, but it's even more complicated. So because of [REDACTED] lawyers and accountants that have come up with these schemes, I have to spend precious starting capital to a bunch of accountants to prove I'm not evading taxes, rather than actually doing something useful with that money (and that accountant doing something more useful with their time). reply gerdesj 19 hours agoparentThe \"problem\" you describe is your US citizenship requires you to pay tax on earnings from outside the US - that's a condition of US citizenship. If you don't want to pay those taxes, then renounce your US citizenship once you have, say, gained UK citizenship, if that works for you. A famous bloke once said (probably in Hebrew, written up in Aramaic or Greek and badly translated into middle, modern and somewhat strange English): \"Pay unto Caesar, that which is due to Caesar and pay unto God that which is due to God\" or words to that effect. Substitute IRS for God and you have a suitably cynical aside! If your firm over here is good enough and you are reasonably settled then why not go all in? I'm not sure what the rules are on reconnecting with the US if you have formally renounced citizenship. However, I'm sure a birth cert from Yeehaw, TX or wherever will go some way. Even so, UK citizens are generally welcomed in the Land of the Free. An ESTA (great scheme IMO) costs about £20 for two years coverage - more than enough to visit the relos. I know from second hand experience that our bureaucracy is just as convoluted as any other and it will take roughly one to two years (that was about 10 years ago) to get citizenship and probably involves a test that I would fail! You might like to look into where your company is actually registered. A Ltd is not you - it is a separate legal entity and the UK (etc) is quite a complicated setup within quite a complicated environment. You might explore Jersey and the Isle of Man for places to headquarter. Don't overlook Eire either (EU with UK to the north, with special arrangements) Anyway, the snag you have is solely US based and not UK (for a change). reply khuey 19 hours agorootparent> I'm not sure what the rules are on reconnecting with the US if you have formally renounced citizenship.

The US is very business friendly and offers top-tier everything if you have money. Wealthy people though are accustomed to having their cake and eating it too, so naturally they will try to take as much as they can while giving back as little as they can manage. Their wealth will carry them very far towards this goal, so the US cannot be soft when it comes collecting. reply jajko 48 minutes agorootparentIts like saying you need to be hard on terrorism or drugs problems, so that you can actually fix that. We know how that worked in past 100 years... What it will collect is totally negligible in US budget and won't make dent in anything (compared to say companies like Apple or Google skimming paying taxes by tens of billions yearly), and it won't make many friends to US. But sure, chase them, chase them hard, I have literally no skin in that game. I guess as long as really serious problems are ignored government is happy. reply dathinab 10 hours agorootparentprevIt's actually a pretty common law to have in some form to penalize tax evasion and capital flight. Most higher developed countries have it in some form (with varying degree of strictness, scoping etc.). Technically you also pay the tax in the process of losing your citizenship not after losing it. A more \"fair\" approach probably would be if capital (especially bound capital which generates more capital, like companies) are \"pinned\" to a country and transferring it from there involve paying tax (oversimplified). Then when renouncing US citizenship you would only need to pay \"exit\" tax if you also move your capital out of the US (e.g. your US company) but if you have a UK company it would already be pinned to the UK and you wouldn't pay exit tax on it (but you would have had to pay taxes on moving capital from the US to the UK to found the company). But I mean it's a purely hypothetical approach: - it is very much in conflict with globalization and investing in foreign companies (you have to pay exit tax on the money you invest outside the US!). This means it also hinds projection of US power by getting influence into foreign companies through investments. - it's not really viable to retroactively apply it - it kinda requires all countries to agree on this law - it would mess with investment banks, fond etc. - it's a mess when it comes to international buying of goods (as you want to prevent laundering capital moving through unusual good buying schemes) reply kergonath 8 hours agorootparent> It's actually a pretty common law to have in some form to penalize tax evasion and capital flight. It really does not sound common at all. In all countries where I have lived, my citizenship did not enter the picture for the local tax authority or that of my country of birth. All that matters is my resident status. I did not renounce any citizenship (because why would I? It comes with no downsides), but I cannot see them going after my foreign possessions, considering they entirely ignored them for years. And if they did, a loophole would be to not renounce it because again it comes with no downsides. I actually checked with my country of birth, and renouncing simply requires me to send a declaration to the authorities and they have 2 months to accept (it’s accepted by default if they do not reply within 2 months). No other requirements or anything.

Since 2007 they've been working to reform the tax code and make the voting process easier. No politician in my state has ever joined - and the tax code remains the same. Americans abroad are taxed on worldwide income, but don’t get the same benefits; healthcare, infrastructure, education, etc. We pay full price for a system we barely use. The laws on starting a company abroad are arcane; cruel and unusual. ... So I don't feel very represented*. Again, no other country outside North Korea and Eritrea (a combined population of 30m people) treats their citizens like this. The US just started it because it needed to raise funds during the Civil War, and keeps it because it's a useful way to siphon money. Non Americans are shocked when they hear of these rules - it's unthinkable. Even Americans are surprised, most have never heard of such a thing. * Tbf, neither do most Americans these days. According to Pew, only 20% of Americans are 'satisfied with how democracy is working'. 10% feel \"hopeful\" when thinking about politics, compared to 65% who feel \"exhausted\". 60 years ago, 77% of people trusted the US govt.

Suppose the company (let's call it XYZ Ltd) is owned 100% by my spouse. Let's say XYZ has $XYZPROFIT in one year. It then pays $XYZUKTAX on that profit, but the US isn't involved whatsoever. If it pays me $MYSALARY, XYZ reports that to the UK government and pays $MYUKTAX. I then report the US government $MYSALARY and $MYUKTAX, calculate $MYINCOME, and then calculate $MYUSTAX (which is normally $0, since UK taxes are higher than US taxes). Now let's suppose I own more than 10% but less than 50%. Now I basically have to report to the US the same information about XYZ's financials that the company reports to the UK government, as well as answer 40-60 questions each of which would take a few days to understand the meaning of. Thankfully that's where it ends under normal circumstances; pay an accountant to prove you're not cheating the system and you're done. Now suppose XYZ is 100% owned by me. It has $XYZPROFIT for the year, and pays $XYZUKTAX on that profit. Now, by default, $XYZPROFIT is included in $MYINCOME, but $XYZUKTAX is not included in $MYUKTAX; meaning by default I'm going to be double-taxed. I can avoid this, but only with 1) extra paperwork, and 2) forgoing any tax breaks for start-ups that the UK government has. > \"Pay unto Caesar, that which is due to Caesar and pay unto God that which is due to God\" or words to that effect.

Though compensation had little to do with talent and more to do with focus on political bs and alignment with the needs of corrupt authorities. Some could argue there was an inverse correlation between talent and compensation as the most corrupt people are often that way because they lack talent to begin with. I've observed similar dynamics in big tech corporations, unfortunately. People are promoted on the basis of their incompetence and capacity for self-delusion as it creates the necessary blind-spots which allow organizations to occasionally poke their toes beyond red lines to reap massive profits. Stupidity and incompetence are useful attributes within corporations because they instill a feeling of insecurity in the minds of the affected employees and this makes them highly loyal and controllable. Sometimes I think one of the main reasons these companies hire actual intelligent people is to make the incompetent people feel insecure 'imposter syndrome' and increase their degree of loyalty/compliance. They don't actually need intelligent people to run things because they have monopolies and the big profits are to be reaped in maintaining their monopolies which is achieved via dirty politics; not achieved via innovation. I think many intelligent people have observed this reality in companies they worked for.

That's why courts and lawyers are needed. reply gerdesj 18 hours agorootparent\"Tax avoidance and evasion are not ...\" Those are formally defined terms here in the UK [citation needed - must find one]. Tax avoidance is avoiding paying a tax by following some legally sanctioned rules. For example, in the UK, using an ISA, which is a form of bank savings account, for which the interest is paid tax free. ISAs were created by an Act of Parliament. By saving in an ISA you avoid paying some tax. Tax evasion is avoiding paying tax ... by not paying tax that is due, according to the law of the land. There are no grey areas these days. When you do \"Self Assessment\" in the UK, one of the early questions paraphrases to \"have you done anything dodgy\". I think it is something like: \"Have you participated in any tax evasion schemes within the tax year considered here\". Without looking it up now (which takes a while), it may even use the word avoidance instead of evasion. Self assessment is similar to how the US and some other countries do taxation. In the UK the norm is Pay As You Earn (PAYE). Your employer does everything - you earn a wage and tax (Income Tax and National Insurance) is extracted at source and the balance is paid to you. The taxes are passed on to His Majesty's Customs and Revenue (HMRC). You can fill in a Form P11D if you want to claim expenses for something you supplied or pay for benefits received from your employment.

The European Court of Justice found that the tax breaks Ireland was offering were unlawful state aid (a corporate subsidy that violates EU law) in the case of large multinationals such as Apple. From what I understand of the ruling, it only applies to large multinationals, and Ireland is allowed to continue to offer the same tax breaks to smaller firms. https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/202... Also, while IANAL, I have read some EU law textbooks, and one thing they make clear is that ECJ decisions do not always have “direct effect” - the ECJ can declare a national law to be in violation of EU law, but whether that by itself invalidates the national law depends on the specific grounds the ECJ used. So, without having looked into the legal details of this specific ruling, I’m not even sure if it makes the Irish law invalid, as opposed to merely illegal. The distinction is, an illegal law, the national government is obliged to repeal/amend it, and if they fail the EU can punish them, but it remains in force until they repeal/amend it; whereas an invalid law they have to immediately stop enforcing it. reply handelaar 16 hours agorootparentEveryone in Ireland [and almost everyone else] seems to be under the impression that this is what just happened with the CJEU ruling last week.

Courts are not generally very impressed by them - which is why it requires a captured government (Ireland) to do them and ideally some sort of multinational scheme so every challenge is a hugely difficult endeavour. reply AnthonyMouse 18 hours agorootparent> Did you know UK tax law makes every scheme whose primary purpose is tax avoidance tax evasion? This is the kind of law politicians pass thinking they're being clever when they're really just being incoherent. If the government makes renewable energy a tax deduction and then you invest in renewable energy to get the tax deduction, that's tax avoidance. The primary purpose of making the investment is to reduce your tax burden and if it wasn't a deduction (i.e. it didn't allow you to avoid taxes) then you'd have bought the power from the power company instead. But causing you to change your behavior in order to avoid taxes is the purpose behind making that a tax deduction. If you're deciding where to put your facility and the decision comes down to which jurisdiction has a lower tax rate, that's tax avoidance. You're avoiding taxes in the higher tax jurisdiction by putting your operations in the lower tax jurisdiction. But that is likewise the intended purpose of the lower tax rate. That jurisdiction wants businesses to set up there, or wants local businesses to have more money so they build more facilities and hire more local people etc. If the government raises the tax on cigarettes and that causes you to quit smoking... you get the idea. It makes no sense for it to be illegal for you to do the thing the government intentionally passed law to give you the incentive to do. But more than that, how are they supposed to prove it? They claim you quit smoking to avoid the tax, you claim it was because you didn't want to get cancer. Hypothetically they could uncover some email in which you were complaining about the high taxes before you quit, but that doesn't actually prove anything -- the tax could make you chafe even if your primary purpose was to avoid cancer. Moreover, the well-counseled entity is not going to write that email, which makes it a law against writing something down rather than a law against doing something, and those are the worst because the evil megacorps who know they're doing something shady make sure to cross all their t's and the ones who get punished are the guileless ones who didn't know there was effectively a law against complaining about taxes. reply donalhunt 10 hours agorootparentTo summarize, as one silicon valley CEO once put it: \"pay as little tax as you can legally get away with\". Same with any legislation applying to company operations - get as close to the line of what is legal/illegal without crossing it. reply Analemma_ 20 hours agoparentprevThis comment comes up every time tax evasion is discussed, and it's always presented as self-evident, when it really is not. I think there's no distinction, except an illusory one invented by tax evaders, and I've never seen a coherent argument to the contrary. reply AnthonyMouse 18 hours agorootparentTax avoidance and tax evasion are defined terms and the distinction between them is that the first one is the set of things that are legal. Some of these are obviously legal, like buying an electric car so you can get a tax credit you're eligible for if you buy an electric car. But companies will try to find and use all of these, including the ones that go right up to the line of what's allowed. The actual problem is that tax codes are complicated enough to allow this game to be played. You want to try to assign the profits of a multinational supply chain to a particular jurisdiction and then end up surprised it ends up somewhere with low taxes? The premise is wrong. All of the revenue is somebody's profit/income. Just tax revenue where the final product is sold, allow deductions for cost of goods sold when the tax on that portion has already been collected by the supplier and stop having any other taxes that give the accountants complicated rules to game. reply adventured 19 hours agorootparentprevThere is a clear legal distinction in fact between tax evasion and tax avoidance. Tax evasion is illegal. Tax avoidance is not. Tax evasion means you are doing something illegal to not pay taxes, taxes that you would otherwise owe for example if the government had total knowledge of your financial records. Tax avoidance means you are staying within the letter of the law and that your actions taken in the process of doing everything you can to limit the taxes you owe are legal actions. It's quite simply the difference between taking legal and illegal action. And if the IRS were to be fully aware of what you've done, whether you have broken the law or not. With tax avoidance you do everything you can to not actually break the law (you want to take max advantage without crossing the line). With tax evasion you are breaking the law. The IRS will almost always try to nail you for tax evasion if they find out what you're doing. The IRS will rarely be able to get you for something related to tax avoidance if you're very careful / strict about it and stay within the letter of the law. Obviously this applies in the US context, however I find that very commonly when people discuss tax evasion vs tax avoidance, they're talking about the premise I'm talking about: one is about taking illegal actions, one is legal and narrowly walks the letter of the law to limit taxes. reply christophilus 18 hours agorootparentExactly. The Roth IRA is tax avoidance. reply immibis 21 hours agoparentprevThis is a technicality created by legal tax evaders. To evade is to avoid. If you're avoiding tax you're evading tax. Sometimes it's moral, many times it's legal. reply DavidAdams 20 hours agorootparentThe word evade has a specific meaning in English, implying avoidance by trickery. And it has a specific legal meaning, which is knowingly bending or breaking the law. They are not synonyms, especially in a tax context. reply Alupis 21 hours agorootparentprevSo are you telling us when you prepared your recent tax return, you spent zero time ensuring you paid only the required amount? Avoiding paying taxes you are not legally required to pay is not tax evasion. reply immibis 6 hours agorootparentThat's correct. Deliberately restructuring your activities beyond common sense in order to reduce taxes even further, however, is legally evading them, by the normal definition of the English word \"evade\". If you are running a business and someone points out you can reduce taxes by registering a corporation, that's normal - most businesses are some type of corporation. If someone points out you can reduce taxes even further by registering an Irish subsidiary and sending them license fees, that's abnormal, and now you're using trickery to avoid taxes. UNLESS your business really does do R&D in Ireland at an arms-length subsidiary which charges license fees. In that case, the legal structure mirrors what is actually happening, so it's fine! reply Alupis 2 hours agorootparent> however, is legally evading them In tax law, this is considered avoidance, ie. you are avoiding overpayment. If you so much as use any tax preparation software, you are actively avoiding overpayment of your taxes. reply pdpi 21 hours agorootparentprevThere will always be legal (but arguably immoral) ways to minimise your taxes, and there will always be illegal ways to minimise your taxes. Those are different problems with different solutions. It's a useful distinction to make, that warrants having different words. reply mikeyouse 18 hours agorootparentThe point people are making (to mostly deaf ears) is that many tax \"avoidance\" strategies are just unprosecuted tax evasion strategies. If you claim deductions you don't qualify for, that's obviously just tax evasion, but most taxpayers will get away with it. Does their lack of a conviction mean they're just tax avoiding? Of course not.. so when some company dreams up a scheme where the 'owner' of a laptop changes 6 times to various subsidiaries in countries that laptop has never entered, is that just sophisticated tax avoidance? Or is the obviously illegal scheme tax evasion? (Illegal in the sense that almost every jurisdiction has laws that will pierce transactions that only occur to minimize taxes). reply yieldcrv 21 hours agorootparentprevIts a technicality created by government tax authorities and prosecutors They say avoidance is legal, evasion is illegal and the name of a prosecutable crime reply andrehacker 19 hours agoprevDoes that mean that U2 will no longer be a Dutch band ? https://taxfoundation.org/blog/u2-abandons-ireland-name-taxe... reply gosub100 19 hours agoparentThats hilarious that this social activist who promoted progressive, socialist movements chooses to (quite literally) not put his money where his mouth is/was. reply exabrial 21 hours agoprevI'm not really mad at companies for doing this, I'm sad that the same ways are not available to ordinary overtaxed people. reply toast0 21 hours agoparentOrdinary people can't do this because they missed the window, but also because their labor has a clear nexus. This scheme worked because when a product is designed in one locale, built in another, and sold in a third, there's some reasonable question of what the nexus of the income is. Ordinary people that have written books or songs or otherwise earn royalties from creative works on a regular basis could probably have arranged for ownership of their royalties to be owned by a complex corporate structure as well, but I don't know that very many ordinary people earn enough in royalties that tax avoidance is worth the setup and maintenance costs. reply BobbyJo 16 hours agorootparentI mean, the clear way to deal with this is to make them choose, and allow import tariffs. Get taxed where the nexus is, and pay to bring the value to other jurisdictions. I understand that the web of various tax laws and trade agreements makes this impossible though. 80 years of cruft is too much to sift through to improve things in one fell swoop I suppose. reply lucianbr 14 hours agorootparent> the clear way to deal with this is to make them choose My understanding is that the whole problem stems from companies being able to choose. Apple chose to pay taxes in Ireland for some things, because Ireland gave them a tax advantage, thus avoiding taxes in other European countries. Allowing import tariffs between EU countries would maybe help with this but cause other problems. The EU free market isn't a whim, it has good reasons to exist and significant benefits. There is no \"clear way\" to fix this.

We can all argue about inefficiencies, what is the right amount of spending and funding, but redistributing taxes by creating socially needed projects, from roads that you use, to ports through your shipments to policing streets so your daughter is safer when she goes out with friends.

Because people are often overtaxed due to high tax elusion/avoidance/evasion. E.g. in Italy, around 10 to 15% taxes are evaded in many ways. That bill is then paid by regular taxpayers. If even more people avoided taxes that would just make the issue worse. reply bandyaboot 20 hours agoparentprevThis seems like a really backward way of thinking. You seem to be advocating for complex tax loopholes to be opened for individuals rather than advocating for simple, but lowered taxes. reply ajsnigrutin 19 hours agorootparentI understood it more as \"the individuals should be taxed the same (so, much lower amount) as corporations\". If company X can pay justof their income as taxes (all together), why can't random bobby do the same? The law requires you to have a fire extinguisher in your office? Sure, buy one, but since it's a cost of doing business, that money comes from the pre-tax pile and is not taxed extra. The law requires me to wear pants when I go out, why do i have to buy them from post-tax pile of money (so, after ~50% gone to the government), and still pay 9.5% VAT on them? I can buy those same black jeans as a company (eg. consider black jeans a work uniform), and avoid all those taxes). Rent? Pre-tax money for a comoany, post-tax for an individual. In some countries (eg. mine, slovenia) you have even bigger stupidities... you have a CO2 tax (and some other) on gasoline (and other fuels), and you pay VAT on top of that tax... the co2 tax included in the base to calculate the VAT... you literally pay taxes on taxes. Again, businesses don't have to pay that VAT (they deduct it) because well.. they need the company car to do business. reply morpheuskafka 16 hours agorootparentThe distinction is business vs personal, not company vs individual. A sole trader can usually do avoid income and VAT on all those things (except some deductions pertaining to payroll benefits). Some countries have an alternative arrangement where very small traders pay VAT but also retain VAT on the products they sell rather than actually netting out the VAT on a return. reply yieldcrv 19 hours agorootparentprevwhat's backwards about that? driving to the neighboring town for cheaper gas (because the gas tax happens to be lower) is just as legal as these complex multijurisdiction incongruencies yes, I believe car ownership should be more accessible to people to be able to ponder such a drive reply gosub100 19 hours agorootparentprevIt's advocating for equality! how could you call that \"backward\"? reply Nursie 14 hours agoparentprev> I'm not really mad at companies for doing this I am, regardless of the effect on individuals, it skews the market away from smaller entrants and allows those that have reached enough of a size to be able to afford to play these games to leverage a huge advantage. reply Lio 11 hours agorootparentAs well as killing local competition there's also the pure hypocrisy of firms such as Apple (and they're not the only offender) passing themselves off as some kind of moral authority whist at the same time aggressively refusing to pay taxes towards hospitals and schools in the local markets they operate in. They can present themselves anyway they like but it does leave a bad taste in the mouth. reply throw310822 20 hours agoparentprevFrankly I don't even understand why companies are taxed at all. Taxes are proportional to individuals' income so that the pain of contributing to the collective good is distributed fairly.

There are so many carved-out special interest exceptions that it's almost impossible to unravel, like the carried interest tax credit for hedge fund management fees. I think we've reached the point where we need revenue apportinment of profit. That means if 50% of your revenue comes from the US, then (at least) 50% of your profit is taxable in the US. It's worth noting that there are various schemes for multinationals to avoid taking profits in the US. One of the most common is transfer pricing. Example: Company A sells sofas to US consumers for $1000. It buys them from subsidiary B (in Bermuda) for $900. Subsidiary B buys the sofas from Subsidiary C in China for $300 each. So $600 in profit is moved to a 0% tax haven like Bermuda. That's transfer pricing and it's illegal. The Double Irish Sandwich is an example of profit shifting. What's the difference between profit shifting and transfer pricing? Profit shifting is legal. Transfer pricing isn't. That's functionally the difference. So an argument against revenue appointment of profit is you can use similar schemes to hide profits but you really can't. For one, companies need to report profits to shareholders so the IRS has that data point. For another, the IRS can and does go after companies to figure out beneficial ownership and whether transactions really are at arm's length or not. For anyone saying they can benefit from this by buying shares in $BIG_TECH$, I promise you that you would benefit more from that company paying taxes to fund the roads, bridges and schools that you would from your 100 shares going up by an extra 1%. reply refurb 17 hours agoparentWhat do you mean “transfer pricing is illegal”?

    "originBody": "CUNY First Computer System to Aid Administrative Control over Colleges at the Expense of Efficiency and Effectiveness March 20, 2013 Guest Post Every once in a while I get a question, either privately or in a department meeting, regarding CUNYFirst. Here is what I know of CUNYFirst, based on a few years of working with the project as a \"training liaison\" (which is a fancy term for room-scheduler). (1) The idea of CUNYFirst is a good one: to have a unified, integrated \"enterprise\"-scale system that encompasses all university/campus business processes. Such a system could, in principle at least, have saved a lot of expenditure on maintaining dozens of disparate, redundant, barely cooperating third-party systems. Such a system could have offered information access that would have benefited the administration, the staff, the faculty, and students. (2) CUNY Central's motives in pursuing CUNYFirst were dominated by an agenda that has nothing to do with such benefits however. Rather, CUNY Central sought absolute control over all college activity, including curriculum. Think of it: whoever controls the catalog, the bulletin, the transcripts, and the apparatus in general effectively controls curriculum. CUNYFirst will be part of the arsenal by which CUNY Central shoves Pathways down our throat. CUNY Central also sought the knowledge of and therefore access to any discretionary funds that the colleges may have. (3) The negotiations that were the run-up to the purchase of CUNYFirst were a travesty. The project required an expenditure of up to a billion dollars to do it right. CUNY Central offered far less. All but one of the bidders dropped out as a result: the project could not be done properly with what CUNY offered. Oracle-PeopleSoft did not drop out. However they warned CUNY that for that level of funding, they could not, would not CUSTOMIZE: they would only CONFIGURE. CUNY Central was so eager to have a centralized MIS tool to use for its own centralizing, corporatizing agenda, that it totally ignored the implications of the Oracle \"configure-only\" limitation: business processes would have to be made to fit Oracle, not vice versa. Capabilities that we now have will vanish. The staff, the faculty, the students would just have to \"adjust\" (the technical term being \"suck it up\"). (4) And thus, CUNY has spent about $600 million dollars on a system that makes things worse everywhere it goes. The actual cost far exceeds the $600 million dollars that go to Oracle. Because processes are now much more inefficient, more people have to be hired to do tasks that were formerly automated. Unknown and unseen to most faculty has been the toll that this takes on HEOs and to some extent clericals -- the people who actually make the university run. (No, professor colleagues, you are important but you do NOT make the university run-- that is another discussion.) HEOs have been forced to put in all sorts of extra hours without compensation. Some of this is transitional, some of it is systemic. (5) CUNYFirst does work. It just works badly. • The interface is laughable: It looks like an early-90s update of 3270 bi-synch technology. Web 2.0? Ha. Not even Web 1.0. • Because CUNY wouldn't pay for customization, we had to renumber our courses. This is just one of many, less visible to faculty, changes that CUNYFirst has forced. • The security model is totally inappropriate for CUNY: we will have work-study students performing tasks that require vast permissions, thus allowing them to access data of other students. • HR has had to struggle with the \"problem\" of an individual being a grad student enrolled in one campus serving as an instructor at another campus and having a part-time office job in a third. GM and Apple don't work that way. But CUNY does. (6) We at Brooklyn College (and other \"Wave 3\" campuses) WILL adjust. I know people in other schools (in earlier \"waves\") who have. We will suffer more than they have because Brooklyn College has had the best add-on systems (for scheduling, grade reporting, etc) of the university. Many of these will now go away. (7) I witnessed some of the early testing. It was done by following a test script that the vendor provided. As it failed multiple times, an engineer from Oracle would run to the next room to adjust something and then the testers would re-try. I've heard though that they've improved this process somewhat. (9) Have you read all the way to this? Must be a slow day for you. Well, the thing to keep in mind is that no matter how bad CUNYFirst is for YOU, CUNYFirst is a success for CUNYCentral -- see point (2).

Capabilities that we now have will vanish. The staff, the faculty, the students would just have to \"adjust\" (the technical term being \"suck it up\"). This is an interesting perspective. From what I've seen / heard from others, it's generally better to adapt processes to the off-the-shelf tool than to try and customize or build from scratch to accommodate your bespoke processes (especially in the business operations realms). For one, the organization is likely less unique than you think, and those bespoke processes are as often a function of some early employee's preference as it is a genuinely good reason. For another, customizing software is not just a one time cost, since every subsequent update / upgrade is likely to require additional work (or at least testing). And finally, in most cases the closer you are to a vanilla, standard process, the more likely you are to stay in compliance with local laws and regulations. Though I suppose it's possible that the imbalance is just due to the fact that it is much harder to quantify the costs of using a suboptimal (for you) process than it is to look at the procurement contract for a custom solution. reply FartinMowler 12 minutes agoparentExactly this! I recall a large survey of SAP deployment projects in the late 1990s. By far the most successful consultancy, out of Chicago I think it was, had it written in their contracts \"you'll change your business processes to match SAP; not SAP to match your existing business processes\" (more or less). By turning away clients who could not accept that, they had happy clients, happy employees (little burn out), and no runaway costly never-ending death march projects. reply smt88 6 minutes agoparentprev> From what I've seen / heard from others, it's generally better to adapt processes to the off-the-shelf tool I have never seen this work even once. I've actually built entire businesses on the concept that people are impossible to change, but software is easy to change. reply wvenable 16 minutes agoparentprevI've had the opposite experience. Any attempt to adapt processes to an off-the-shell tool have always been a subpar experience for everyone. I've brought a few of these in house as fully custom software and the end result has been a better user experience and faster changes. If we can buy something that fits the need, we will. But if we can't, we build. And we build a fair bit. I disagree with \"the organization is likely less unique than you think\". If you're big enough you will have unique requirements that nobody else has. I'm in the middle of that now in a project to install some industry standard software that runs the whole business and we have to customize and add custom integration into it. I wouldn't want to build software this complex in house but if I was given the resources and tasked to do it, I could, and it would be better. reply tqi 4 minutes agorootparent> If you're big enough you will have unique requirements that nobody else has. Definitely agree, and that is very interesting to hear. I only mean to speak to my experience, and what I saw in a lot of cases was unique requirements that were due to the organizational equivalent of tech debt (ie things like \"our books are organized in this unique way because we acquired this other company a many years back but kept their stuff separate because it was the path of least resistance at the time\"). reply ethbr1 6 minutes agorootparentprevThere are two different scenarios. Scenario 1: You're doing something that every other business is doing. E.g. ERP/accounting, sales, contact center, etc. Scenario 2: You're doing something few other businesses are doing. E.g. your actual customer business, creative, etc. (1) is amenable to making your process fit software, to good results. (2) is usually a train wreck. Unfortunately, figuring out if your thing is scenario 1 or 2 is non-trivial. Canonical example: EMR/EHR systems in healthcare. You think they'd be the same... but actually there are so many integrations with other systems and/or different sorts of specialists, that a real world implementation has substantial functionality gaps (papered over with custom work). reply nfriedly 20 minutes agoparentprevOne more reason to adapt your process to the tool is that it can make hiring/training easier. reply alberth 1 hour agoprevI know hating on Oracle is en vogue, but I struggle to believe this $600M figure. a. I use to work in this space, even a $6M deal would be massive (let alone something 100x bigger). b. The ENTIRE cuny budget in 2013 was only $2B [0]. This isn't their IT budget, this is literally the entire budget to run the entire university system across multiple campus, faculty, buildings, etc. c. Because Higher Ed is known to be so cheap, especially in the late 00s - big tech companies charged accordingly (which was at a massive discount relative to most other accounts). d. even if this $600M figure was an aggregated figure over multiple years, staffing and auxiliary costs - it still wouldn't come close to this figure. e. an expenditure this large would definitely be called out in CUNY annual financial reports, and I can't seem to find any reference to it.

Organizations typically add 3-5x additional to either \"pad\" their request (in the event it doesn't get 'fully funded') and/or this is an opportunity for the university to higher for a bunch of roles they wouldn't have been able to get funded in the first place - so lots of things get buried in these numbers. Lastly, the figures are also typically multi-year. Like 5-years being asked up front for approval.

I suspect the writer is very much mistaken on the price and a bit paranoid on the College's motives. Perhaps it is 600 million over 10+ years. Why they would ever go with Oracle is another mystery as there are a number of vendors who specialize in this type of software for colleges (some of it good, most of it bad), so it would be foolish to explore a solution from Oracle that needs such a high level of customization to fit the needs of a University. reply Vegenoid 3 minutes agorootparentThese kinds of mysteries usually have a frustrating and mundane answer. The people with the power to make the decision: - were incompetent and just went with a big name, or - made the decision due to salespeople (social pressure and/or gifts), or - had interests that did not align with the org (ex. resume padding) But who knows, maybe there's a good reason they went with Oracle. reply jeffwask 1 hour agoparentprevMy first thought was for $800 million you could found your own startup to write an HRMS and have enough left over for a fleet of super cars. reply efitz 31 minutes agorootparentWith government bureaucrats with no penalty for failure and no expertise in software development guiding the design?

I've almost never seen a 9 figure deal in my life, and the only ones I've seen are massive core infra level deals by mega-corps. I absolutely cannot imagine CUNY spending more than most F50s spend on HRMs. Edit: I did some digging into the Tender [0] and it looks like it was $300M total across all 25 universities and colleges in the CUNY system along with the CUNY administrative portion itself and it was a full bundle of HRM, ERP, On-Prem Compute Resources, and headcount (PS and internal) over a 10 year period, so $30M per year across all 26 institutions. This came out to around $1.25M ACV per organization (10 year contract, 26 organizations). In reality, some of the larger colleges (eg. CCNY) will have spent much more than the smaller ones (eg. Bronx CC). In addition, each of the large CUNY colleges had budgets in the $150M range in the early 2010s [1] along with a separate $2B budget for CUNY's central organization (as mentioned above) What seems to have happened is the above page treated overall TCV as part of a single budget, when in reality, each individual constituent org with it's own budget spent out of their own pocket for ERP, HRM, Headcounr (PS and internal), and Compute (on-prem) This isn't egregious for the size of organizations that each of the constituent colleges and CCs in CUNY are. The big question is, if you used the PSC's (imo flawed) methodology, what would it give for CSUs, UCs, and SUNY (all of whom have a similar structure and student size). I'd expect a similar amount.

Vendors overcharge crazy amounts all the time and get away with it without the gov client batting an eye. Experienced it first hand where I was on several projects where I did, without exaggeration, 95% of the work and my employer at the time charged $500,000 for one project and for another $750,000 in a single fiscal year. Sure, it wasn't $600 million (seems like that $600 million to Oracle had to of been spread out too), but the work was simply formatting their website content from an old template in their busted CMS (pretty sure it was some ancient HP CMS) in HTML and had to write some minor CSS and some minor JS. I ended up automating it locally and then the rest of the time was spent copying and pasting through this convoluted process due to having to connect to their outdated locked down remote desktop with a super slow connection. Additionally, I was only being paid under 6 figures at the time and it took much less time than they were quoted for, though my employer sat on their hands to make it seem like it took that much time. But yeah what the agencies were charged was unjustified irl... but on paper it was, they didn't push back on it or anything, and the cost of completing the projects was wayyy the hell less than what my employer at the time quoted them for. My assumption is they dont push back due to budgets not rolling over and wanting to maintain/increase their dept's annual budget. So it's not surprising they'd throw away that amount over the course of some years. reply JCM9 1 hour agoprevWhen you see how badly most academics and academic administrators are at actually running things from a business standpoint it no surprise the academic sector is in such a mess at the moment.

In fact, I would say there is a willful ignorance to understanding the intricacies and complexities of what it takes to run a University system and the precarious financial realities of most colleges and universities. However, every once in a while an academic decides to take on administrative responsibilities to fix all of the things they perceive as broken or to show everyone how smart / right they are. Usually the first year for them is incredibly difficult for them and everyone around them and they make a true and terrible mess of it. At this point, after a full year, they usually know just enough to realize how little they know about running a college, managing people, or generally being a leader. They then react in one of three ways: 1. Resign from their admin job and go back to just teaching as if nothing happened 2. Become humble and begin actually collaborating with people and not blaming everyone for every thing that isn’t as they see it. 3. Double down and truly blow everything up until they are either fired or whatever it is they are running collapses in on itself. This isn’t everyone. The faculty who transition best to leadership tend to be pretty humble to begin with. reply panzagl 1 hour agoparentprevThis doesn't sound like the academics', or even administrators' fault- this is being imposed by the state university system.

I had to look it up, and I live upstate. reply nfw2 31 minutes agoparentprevI recently left a software dev job in academia, and the amount of rot in the organization is insane. As part of my off-boarding, the lead engineer mentioned she would ideally like to hire 5 more developers to the team. That would bring the team size up to 15 (8 devs, 2 devops, 2 Ux, 1 graphic designer, 1 pm, 1 eng manager). The team maintains two things: - The static website for the library - A pretty basic image server and viewer for the library and museum collections Sure, the library needs a website, but that shouldn't require more than a person or two to maintain. The image viewer was only used by a handful of people. But it doesn't matter. The team gets funded because the students will keep paying their tuition. The engineers can keep sitting around watching youtube all day and the world keeps turning. Perhaps most egregious example was in my first 1:1 -- my manager said, \"Don't expect much output from [SENIOR ENGINEER X]. He isn't a good engineer.\" The organization isn't willing to fire anyone. As a result, the people in charge are the ones who have been around the longest. That said, it's risky to fire anybody because hiring is so difficult. The salary bands are set at the university level for all employees, which means the maximum a software engineer can make is much lower than market rate. To make matters worse, working \"in person\" is mandated by the library dean, and the university is in a college town in the middle of nowhere. The interview process also includes NO coding sessions although I'm not sure whether that's due to some corporate process or just incompetence. To be fair, these sorts of issues aren't exclusive to academia, and I've seen similar issues in large organizations. Somewhat paradoxically, the more bullet-proof the business-model is, the more potential there is for rot to grow in a company. reply lostlogin 19 minutes agoparentprevThe university I was at had this amazing process for internal billing.

I'm sure they spent a ton of money, and I'm sure it was the right choice. I would have gotten bored of it pretty quick. You don't pay Oracle because it's a good deal or a good product... you pay Oracle so you never have to think about it ever again. I don't really have a point here. I wish there were better options in the market. But I certainly don't want to build them, since it's a boring problem with bad customers (edtech is a horrible sector to sell to). Oracle has a price point that makes it worth it to them, and they have customers willing to pay it.

So $375M. But the above numbers are hugely generous. This is not building an ERP from scratch. Do you really think it would take 500 people (say 400 engineers and 100 non-engineers), to build and deploy such a system?

The dealer will say it's because the insurance company is such a hassle to deal with that they have to dedicate employee time to jumping through hoops to get paid. The insurance company will say the quote is higher because the dealer sees the insurance company as a big bag of money and if the insurance company doesn't ride them then prices of insurance will go up.

There was another case where a McKinsey consultant (IIT+IIM postgrad) who joined the firm and commited suicide (https://www.consultancy.in/news/4168/young-mckinsey-consulta...). The story starts way back. In general the schooling syllabus in India is very broad and deep (I can say this now since I live outside India). Then due to the large population - around 30 million students complete school every year. After that there are not many good universities (you may have heard of IITs or NITs), only around 100-200K get into good unis. The competetion to get in is therefore intense. Preparation for these \"entrance exams\" can start at age 15 (or even earlier). If someone makes it somehow, graduation, postgrad and MBA is another similar struggle. Now you think you surely made it. The last 7-8 years of intense work and hardship are over, this is doubly true if the person is not from a well off family in India (which is very common). Preparation schools, hostels, being away from family etc. has its mental costs. Then you land a job and it hits you, as a new joiner in the hugely competitive Indian job market you are treated like sh* and all this while you thought \"you made it\" but the real struggle has just started. Long working hours, immense pressure and then the thought that all the hardwork you did in the past can come crashing down with one bad review. Combine that with the real stuggles of life as you move to a new city, manage finances, support family back home etc. it creates a huge amount of pressure. Some unfortunately are not able to handle it, they are in a position they feel that all was futile and no one can understand their situation. reply jt2190 7 hours agoparentWe see this here in the U.S. as well (and I’m sure in other countries, Japan’s “salaryman” culture comes to mind.). It’s far more industry-specific though. There are two things to consider: - when technical ability amongst competitors is high across the board those become “table stakes” and the competition shifts to social signaling, i.e. who can appear to be the most committed? Examples are: Who can show up to work earlier and leave later? Who will respond to texts the fastest? In an environment with an unrestrained management there will be no limits and can become very toxic. - Individuals have different stress tolerance. Hyper-competitive environments weed out those who are less adept at managing the stress, meaning that new “untested” individuals learn the hard way just how bad it can be, sometimes with very bad results. While stress tolerance can be increased in individuals it’s not limitless, so ultimately responsibility lies with management to set hard limits on what is within bounds. reply hi-v-rocknroll 5 hours agorootparentIn my experience, \"table stakes\" is bizword signaling used by demanding, ahole managers use to insist on severe work-life imbalance while simultaneously waxing about work-life balance and the mission statement, making them either intentionally dishonest or willfully cognitively dissonant. reply loa_in_ 10 hours agoparentprevReally can't fault people for coming to a conclusion that it's futile if they don't work for something except work.

Have you tried farming or even just growing something to eat in a pot? For most people an office job is better than subsistence farming. reply amonith 8 hours agorootparentI grew up on a farm in the 90's in Poland (In 89' Poland dissolved PPR/PRL - basically just got rid of communism so villages were quite poor) and I did have to work in the field as that was our main source of food (honestly probably a lot of that was because of the culture, not poverty - everyone grew their own stuff and our grandparents which lived through WW2 still remembered even worse times and did not trust the economy at all). Honestly - it was not that bad. For your own sustenance (literally when you don't sell much) you do not need that much land and the work is not 24/7 every day. There are a couple of tough weeks in the year but much more downtime than you might realize (like, you barely need to do almost anything entire winter and most of the other seasons actually. 1-2h tops to feed the livestock and bring some wood/coal to the furnace). It would be a different story if farming was our business and we wanted to raise money for something significant - but if you don't have any ambitions like that - village life is pretty easy. I guess it depends on the type of said office job, but currently I work as a senior dev contractor in the city and it's barely better, if it is at all (I still can't really make up my mind if I'm happier). All of my extra money goes to mortgage (I \"own\" an apartment, not a house) and after work I do the exact same things I did when I worked on the farm to unwind (read, play games, nap, listen to music) because that's all the energy I have. And then we need to add all of the extra stress and competitiveness that comes with this line of job, wile \"on the farm\" I was already \"at the bottom\" and didn't stress much. There are a lot of scenarios on the farm where something is very urgent sure but they are not really stressful. If some farmer says they are - he did not experience real stress (legal threats, danger of losing not only the source of food but entire house + going into debt, long economy downturns without hope of things getting better [as compared to temporary stuff like the weather destroying the current year's crops], lots of stuff). reply thoroughburro 6 hours agorootparentprev> Have you tried farming or even just growing something to eat in a pot?

You can see this is every facet of life in India. In my time in India, I met my fair share of toxic managers (e.g. leaving at 6 PM we were asked why were we leaving for \"half-day\"), probably had very few genuinely nice and kind managers. See also - https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/narayana-murthys-70-hour-wor... reply piva00 9 hours agorootparentI believe this is more universal than just India. I was born and lived most of my life in Brazil, the same dynamics apply over there, a bit less brutal and gruesome but the competition for limited resources create a work culture of overwork, of management abuse, of constant fear of losing your job, of anxiety someone else is working longer and harder than you so you need to compensate for that. It's also similar on the education path, there are a few of very good Brazilian public universities (usually they are much better academically than private ones), entrance is through exams and most of my education was focused on passing those exams. Curriculum is tailored for what might be asked on the entrance exams, preparation for these exams (including mock exams) start also around age 15, etc. I venture to say this is reality in most of the developing world, even more on countries on the middle income bracket like Brazil, India, etc., which aren't so poor that there are no opportunities but are poor enough that good opportunities are few and far between, competition for those spots is insane. I don't think anyone growing up in developed countries can emotionally understand that, even though there's high competition for great universities, top jobs, etc., you can still live a very fulfilling and decent life without getting into Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Oxford, and so on. That's not really an option in poorer places, you either make it or you will live in some limbo where you earn enough to sustain yourself but don't have access to much else, it's a constant state of surviving to work without seeing upwards mobility. reply hi-v-rocknroll 5 hours agoparentprevThere's a fraction of Big 4/MBB associates who dream of becoming partners and this is the hazing ritual the culture has established to select who will get to stop 3-4-5 / 80 hr work weeks and pivot into something a little less insane with more money.

We have a similar process in France for specific elite schools where French students go through a 2-stage exam system (first you need to get to a preparatory school, then there is a national exam). The work during these two preparation years is insane and the entrance ratio is about 3% (depends on the school). This system is completely surreal (though the ones who go through it often like it) and different from other European systems.

To get my CPA, I had to obtain a master’s degree, sit for and pass all four sections of the CPA exam, and then work for roughly a year under a licensed CPA. The last requirement was easiest to fulfill at a Big 4. What I got for all of those credentials coming out of school was a starting salary of 55,000 in California and a whole lot of stress. Busy season was 80+ hour work weeks and included working on the weekends. I tried pushing back about working on Sundays, but I was the only one on the team who didn’t work. Once busy season was over, I was sold on the idea that the Summer would be easy, but that wasn’t the case. The partners took on more clients to generate more revenue for themselves, and I continued working 40+ hours during the Summer despite being told I wouldn’t. Worse, we couldn’t get newer members to join out of college and started outsourcing all of our audit work to the Philippines and India. The work from the Philippines was somewhat passable, and the work from India was unusable. So I had to do all this coordinating across time zones and a never ending amount of corrections to make the work meet the quality expected by a US-based audit firm. It wasn’t fun in the slightest. You can never have a perfect audit because there’s always more work that you can do. The system pushes you to fill every waking hour that it can get from you with work. It’s mostly meaningless busy-work that shouldn’t be ans stressful as it is. All of that for 55,000 with a graduate degree. Worse, the firm achieved record profits in 2020 yet froze salaries for those being promoted to senior (supposed to be a jump to about 100,000). I really miss the ease of interviews from having a CPA and the protections afforded by a body overseeing the industry. It was a lot better than the system we have as software engineers.

For me, it's ulcers, caused by lack of a strict eating schedule and growing acidity levels due to not eating properly. Although in incidentally, during my PE days, what could've killed me was not that, but massive depression from a lack of socialization and not having someone to talk to. For some folks I knew, it was a lifestyle of smoking and/or poor dietary habits, which led to a heart attack and an early death. For another, it was a heart attack too, caused by drinking too much energy drinks to stay awake. For still another, it was due to taking controlled medication on a slightly higher dose that landed them in the ER. And then there's the story of that guy behind the \"Impossible is Nothing\" meme who suffered from massive depression after his video resume was leaked and made viral across Wall Street banks. Ended up dying from a medication overdose, although it's also alleged that it was an intentional suicide. It's easy to figure out the warning signs early on - they stand out extremely obvious to anyone with a couple of braincells.

(Also another hilarious reason I'll share later.) For context, The minimum wage in pakistan for 2024 is 37,000 PKR per month [1] (That's 132 USD per month. Yes, one hundred thirty two dollars, for a whole month) This what you would pay for manual 'un-skilled' labour. The stipend rate for ICAP trainees depends on stage[2], but goes from PKR 19,700 ($70) to PKR 84,700 ($304) per month, but most people I knew were at the stage that pays PKR 30,700 ($110) per month. It's the same for any org hiring an ICAP trainee, be it Big4 or whatever. They call it stipend, to imply it isn't a salary and affected by salary laws, but these are proper 9am-9pm 6 days a week jobs you have to do for atleast 3 years. My accounting body ACCA (UK based, but works intenationally), doesn't specify a standard stipend rate, which means accounting firms are free to abuse us even below the pitiful ICAP rate. Here is an ad[3] on their own job board, by an 'ACCA-approved' employer, offering 15-20K stipend per month. ($54-$72) ____ This leads to the other, hilarious reason why I never went into an accounting firm... because we were banned by ICAP. Since ACCA never fixed rates, accounting firms starting hiring ACCA over Pakistani CA students, because they could pay use even less. This led to ICAP banning accounting firms from hiring non-Pakistan based accounting body students. Then ACCA had to go to the Competiton Commission of Pakistan [4] to get this ruling turned over. But by the time the judgement came in our favour, it had been too late for people like me. Anyhoo, I went on to other jobs, then went back to uni, currently doing my MSc (distance learning), but I do wonder sometimes what the other path would have taken me.

EY spent a fair amount to plan the restructuring and took on a fair amount of debt to pair for it (and of course it did this before bothering to make sure the stakeholders would actually go through with the plan)... Clients began to wonder why they should trust EY with their restructuring/business planning/etc if EY couldn't even handle its own. This resulted in a pretty significant outflow of clients in the consulting and tax groups.

Years ago when my father was leading a team in a bank in Paris, he would observe that most people were at the office before he was and he was nearly always the first to leave. But once when getting back to the office 5 minutes after realizing he had forgotten something important at his desk, the whole thing was empty. He realized all his subordinates would just wait for him to go in order to not be seen as lazy workers. It was all about pretending as some might have been playing solitaire while waiting, who knows. He had to implement a mandatory \"leave before I do\" rule to fight against this toxic culture. Years later I realized one coworker in my mostly swiss team was doing the same when I went back to my desk also for a forgotten item less than 5 minutes after my departure. One of my coworker was always still at his desk when I was heading home but when I went back, he was already gone. Out of curiosity I did it a few times and could only confirm. I even rammed into him in the corridor when I turned back literally 2 minutes later. That employee was french too. ---- Different culture, but similar.

    "originBody": "A gentle guide to self-hosting your software 15 Sep, 2024 Reading time: 6 minutes There was a time when software (and games! Games are just software for fun!) were distributed on DVD. A physical disk that you would insert into your system to load up software and install. This was the 2000's, when computers prided themselves on being personal computation devices. A Chromebook was a curiosity at the time, promising to run most of your software in \"someone else's computer\"; all you needed was the internet and the interface. The Chromebook was a reckoning. Through the 2010's we slowly moved into the clouds of various giants; it was the easy way to compute. The giants were renting out services - subscriptions started gaining foothold as the second best way to make money online after advertisements - and we were happy to give away the control in exchange for convenience. A minor consequence of this is that an entire generation of computer scientists hasn't had the opportunity to start off as computer enthusiasts - the primordial hacker mindset is slowly waning in prominence. It is 2024, and I say it is time we revisited some of the fundamental joys of setting up our own systems. Why? Good question. Philosophically, it is a form of rebellion, carving out a niche in a world dominated by monopolies, resisting the forces that be from having complete control over our digital selves. Showing the world a different way of living. One of the last bastions of online freedom, self-hosters stand alongside open-source-ers, data-hoard-ers, privacy-ers, matrix/activity-pub/decentralized-tech-ers, piracy-ers, de-google-ers and hack-ers. Practically, it is foolishness, for what you save in money you lose in time and sanity. Seriously, else-hosting is the practical option, let someone else worry about the reliability, concurrency, redundancy and availability of your systems. Intellectually, it is the digital garage of constant tweaking of systems, a source of zen and arcane knowledge. Where you retire after a day's work to work on your favourite toys. So most importantly, it is supposed to be fun. A hobby. And like every hobby there are a lot of gatekeepers. People who believe having a personal server that you can touch is a necessity to call yourself a self-hoster. Eh. Don't listen to them. Self-hosting is as much about the software as it is about the hardware. I say we get the enthusiasts by any means necessary; they will eventually grow into full-fledged self-hosting. Or not. It doesn't matter! This is supposed to be fun, why are you stopping people from having fun? And so, here is a gentle introduction to self-hosting that is not \"true self-hosting\", but whatever. Sue me. We will operate at the software level only, and laugh at the feeble protestations of the rigidly-defined self-hoster loyalists. We will dispense with the heavy prose after this point. Shared hosting A shared web hosting service is a web hosting service where many services reside on one web server connected to the Internet. The overall cost of server maintenance is spread over many customers. You need a space to host. I recommend Uberspace. They are the most heart-warmingly nice people about hosting; they operate on the idea of \"here's a screwdriver, try not to burn down the building, but have fun\". Excellent. So, make an account on Uberspace - did I also mention that you pay after the month ends, so technically everyone gets a free month of trial? I mean, can they get more awesome? (pst, they do). The Secure Shell Protocol is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution. Here's the cool part: you now have SSH access to a computer in the cloud with 10GB of storage and 1.5GB of RAM. Go ahead, do it now. Run ls to be greeted by your brand spanking new empty user directory. The Software What to do, what to install…. I will give you two resources to peruse. Uberspace Labs - An Uberspace specific installation guide to various software that you can play around with on Uberspace. Highly recommend searching for anything you want here first. Awesome-Selfhosted - A broader listing of self-hostable software. If it is on here, it means there is a decent amount of community behind that software; it should cover 90% of the broadly self-hostable programs. You cannot use Docker in Uberspace. The memory constraints are too low to run a full virtualization suite. Which is a bummer for the larger software and docker-only installations but there are workarounds for it. You can install software from source or pull the final run-time from the dockerisation process and use it as a build image (I leave this as an exercise for the intrepid reader :)). But what exactly do I install first?? Alright, alright. Author suggests the following two trackers - one for finance, and one for videos and website updates. Actual Budget Have you always wanted a way to track your finances - expenditures, net worth, spend patterns, etc.? Have also been wary of putting all this sensitive information in the hands of others? What if there was a way to be in control of your data, yet have it accessible across the world via a browser? Actual Budget is a super fast and privacy-focused app for managing your finances. At its heart is the well proven and much loved Envelope Budgeting methodology. I use this and I have written a guide on how to install this here. Make sure to peek into the reports section - you should be able to slice and dice your finances and gain tons of insight out of it. For instance, turns out what I considered to be minor purchases actually add up over the month, and I spend an inordinate amount of money on commute! Miniflux Miniflux is a minimalist and opinionated feed reader. There is a way to keep track of your favourite news outlets and magazines, be posted on the latest blog posts of your favourite writers. You could also build a dedicated ad-free feed timeline of your YouTube subscriptions. RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. Subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator, which constantly monitor sites for new content, removing the need for the user to manually check them. Bonus: YouTube has an RSS feed and the embedded YouTube player is ad-free. Install Miniflux on Uberspace. Add feeds of your favourite YouTube channels. Hop into settings and enable Fever API. Now any RSS client which is capable of reading from the Fever API should be able to access your RSS aggregator in the cloud. If you are in the Apple ecosystem I highly recommend Unread by Golden Hill Software. With this I have a dedicated recent first timeline of all the videos as they are released. I also have separate categories of feed for news and comics - there is a ton of webcomics out there beyond xkcd, smbc and oatmeal - a great way to catch up is via RSS. Bonus: Your Domain The coolest part about self-hosting is showing off your stuff. What better way to show off your things than to have a personal domain - a place you can call your own. Head over to a domain name registrar and grab a site on the net-estate. I suggest Porkbun. Now you have a bunch of extraordinary things you can do. With something like awesauce.com: You can point the various services you host on Uberspace to subdomains of your main site. Show off your actual.awesauce.com and miniflux.awesauce.com! Check with your email provider if they allow you to set up custom domain. You may have to pay for the privilege. Once done you have achieved another freedom - now you can shift the underlying email service provider while keeping the address the same. All mails, for forever, can come to contact@awesauce.com. Woohoo! Point a subdomain or a URL path to your GitHub repository and host publicly accessible files like your resume: awesauce.com/files/resume.pdf This has not been a detailed step by step walkthrough on how to do things, by design. You are meant to go and explore; this is simply a way pointer to invigorate your curiosities. Here is a final reader's exercise: Figure out a way to send yourself a mobile notification when a particular item comes back in stock or website changes :D This made it to the HackerNews front page, head over there for some good discussion around the topic. #devops #hacker #selfhosting #systems 44",

I guess it’s like how “cooking from scratch” evolved. A cookbook from the nineteenth century might have said “1 hog” as an ingredient and instructed you to slaughter it. Now of course you buy hog pieces on foam trays. reply apitman 43 minutes agoparentThere are other issues with the terminology as well. The self hosting community (centered at /r/selfhosted) has a very technical vibe. These people enjoy tinkering with computers. They're like kit car builders. But there's a whole market of people who could benefit from self hosting, but shouldn't be required to understand all the details. For example, you can get many of these benefits by using a managed service with your own domain. Things like data ownership, open source software, provider competition, etc. I think we need a broader term. I've been using \"indie hosting\" lately. reply simcop2387 38 minutes agorootparentThis is the kind of thing I've been watching unfold with some home \"NAS\" boxes over the past couple of years. It started much earlier but it's started to become more of a differentiating factor in some of the lines lately because the NAS side of things is basically entirely a solved problem for 99% of people, so the manufacturers (Synology, QNAP, Terramaster, U-Green, etc.) have been adding support for doing what looks a lot like turn-key installation of things like NextCloud, Plex, and a bunch of other services that the self-hosting community has been talking about for years. I think one of the big drivers of it has been the serious increase in performance and capability of the low power embedded processors from Intel and AMD (and in the last year or so some ARM based ones), like supporting more than 2GB of ram and having multiple cores that can meaningfully do work even with a 15W TDP. reply hk1337 11 minutes agoparentprevI'm not sure what your classification of \"old-timer\" is with how it compares to me but I would think of myself as an old-timer as Gen X. I feel like there's another term for what you're thinking of but I cannot come up with what it is. Self-hosting definitely was locally hosted on your own hardware back when hosting providers like Linode, Digital Ocean, AWS, etc existed or were as customizable. Even corporations \"self-host\" GitHub Enterprise or Gitlab when they set it up on AWS. Self-host just means you're not reliant on creator of the application to host it for you and manage the server. There are certainly advantages and disadvantages to self-hosting on your own hardware, as there are to using a hosting provider. reply bityard 13 minutes agoparentprevI have always understood self-hosting to mean being in charge of your applications and data instead of delegating it to a company. An example might be, setting up Nextcloud instead of Dropbox. Or Taiga instead of Trello. WHERE and HOW it is hosted, is less important to me. Because if you self-host your own tools, you can freely pick them up and move them to any hosting provider, a cloud provider, or a Raspberry Pi in your basement. Self-hosting FREES you from infra/vendor lock-in. reply al_borland 6 minutes agorootparentBut isn’t using a 3rd party web host giving up some of that control. Hopefully a reputable hosting company won’t shutdown at a moments notice, but could. Or if they go down, you’re stuck sitting there waiting for them to come back online with no access to your services. Hosting from home has its own challenges, so I get why people would go to a hosting provider, but I do think some control is given up in the process. reply kayson 3 hours agoparentprevThere are definitely plenty of people who would say that using a hosting provider doesn't count, even if you're deploying the software yourself. The one generally accepted exception to this is network protection. You don't want to expose your home ip address to the outside world if you can help it, so a lot of people use tailscale, cloud flare tunnels, or a vps as a proxy. reply Cyph0n 3 hours agorootparentA VPS that proxies traffic over Tailscale is another neat option. I use this approach to serve self-hosted services that I want to be accessible over the internet. reply bauruine 3 hours agorootparentWhy use Tailscale if you can just setup a WireGuard tunnel? reply freedomben 3 hours agorootparentTailscale is far, far less work to set up and maintain. Not to use a cliche, but it reminds me of Dropbox vs. rsync. If you know Wireguard well enough to set up your own and you're willing, you'll have a lot more control and less dependency, which is a win IMHO. But if you are limited by time and/or knowledge, Tailscale is great reply darkwater 1 hour agorootparentAren't we talking about self-hosting, tinkering with your software for fun and hobby instead of going the SaaS way? Arguing about WG instead of TS in this context is perfectly fine reply al_borland 2 minutes agorootparentSome people want the control without it becoming a full time hobby. I wanted a NAS. I could do it with Linux and ZFS, rolling my own with full control. However, I didn’t want to sink that much time into it, and figured when something needed to be done, I would have forgotten so much I’d need to relearn over and over again. Instead I went with a Synology. I get my NAS, I’m in control of my data, I can run some stuff with Docker on it… but I don’t really have to spend any time playing sys admin on my weekends. freedomben 43 minutes agorootparentprevIndeed, if you got the impression from my comment that I didn't think a debate on WG vs. TS was fine, then I apologize. I think it's a great (and important) thing to debate. My opinion is as stated. I think it's a different cost-benefit analysis for each person depending on time and/or knowledge. reply icedchai 1 hour agorootparentprevI have a VPS configured for BGP peering, using my own ASN, tunneling an IPv4 block and a couple of IPv6 blocks back to my home network over a wireguard tunnel. These wind up on their own VLANs, exposing a few VMs directly to the Internet. It took a bit of time to set this up (and I fortunately had the V4 block already registered from back in the 90's.) I also had experience with BGP from previous jobs at early ISPs, which helped. Proxying is easier. reply Saris 2 hours agorootparentprevJust ease of use mostly, Tailscale works even behind CGNAT and automatically manages things for you. reply dylan604 34 minutes agoparentprevHosting from home was always subject to home ISP ToS limits on doing that very thing. When I self-hosted in the early days, it was still paying someone to mount my system in their rack and use their network. So whether that was hardware that I rented from them, built the box myself, or using a VM they provide, it's still the same amount of work to maintain it. That's still different from using Wix/Squarespace, geocities, or using a social media platform. reply m463 1 hour agoparentprevI agree with you. and so does the author, kind of... \"And so, here is a gentle introduction to self-hosting that is not \"true self-hosting\", but whatever.

So if \"not self-hosting\" is hosting on a shared VPS, then self-hosting is hosting on a computer at home. But \"not self-hosting\" has now become \"hosted in cloud\" so self-hosting moved to \"shared VPS\" instead, as the other end moved. Kind of makes sense, but kind of also makes historical texts more difficult to understand. In the year 2124, who know what \"self-hosting\" meant in 2054? I guess it's up to future software archeologists to figure out. reply icedchai 1 hour agorootparentYes, the goalposts move. When I started w/the internet 30+ years ago, self hosting meant your own 56K leased line. reply _heimdall 57 minutes agoparentprevI must be becoming an old timer too, I only really consider it self hosting if its on my own hardware. In case that doesn't make me an old timer, I also actually have pork and home cured bacon in the freezer from hogs we raised and processed. \"An old soul living in a new world\" feels pretty fitting here. reply eximius 1 hour agoparentprevEvery time this sentiment comes up I'm reminded that it's a spectrum. reply hoosieree 2 hours agoparentprevYeah, my list of requirements for self-hosting starts with: 1. battery backup That said, I'm not zealous about it. \"Perfect is the enemy of good\" and I like ecosystem diversity in general. Better to have a few dozen shared hosting providers than 2 or 3 monopolies. reply asar 6 hours agoprevLove self-hosting and really got into it over the last couple of months. I run a bunch of services for my company now and also in my home lab. I use a Hetzner VPS and provision things either via ansible + docker compose files or via https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/. The awesome-selfhosted repository is also a great place to find projects to self-host but lacks some features for ease-of-use, which is why I've created a directory with some UX improvements on https://selfhostedworld.com. It has search, filters projects by stars, trending, date and also has a dark-mode. reply user_7832 5 hours agoparentSince you seem knowledgeable on this topic I'd like to ask - how risky is it to expose a computer on your network to the internet, if you're somewhat tech-savvy but not very familiar with networking? Is it relatively \"safe\" with modern tools and VMs or do you need to stay on top and (for eg) always ensure you're updating software weekly? I've thought of setting up and running a server for a long time and finally have a spare laptop so I'm thinking of actually running a NAS at least. reply packetlost 5 hours agorootparentI've been doing it for about 13 years now with HTTP/s (80, 443), SSH (22), MOSH (lol idk), and IRC (6697) exposed to the internet. You don't need it, but something like fail2ban or crowdsec is a good idea. You will get spammed with attempts to break in using default passwords for commodity routers (Ubiquiti's `ubnt` is rather popular), but if you're up to date and take a few minor precautions it's not all that hard and/or dangerous. That being said, there are alternatives such as Tailscale that are strictly more secure but far less flexible. I've heard of people using Cloudflare tunnels as well, but I'd rather not rely on big players for stuff like that if I'm going through the effort to self host (and don't have any real risk of DDoS). I would try to set up automatic updates for critical security patches or update about weekly. I know people that self host and do it monthly and they seem fine too. Most anything super scary vulnerability wise is on the front page here for awhile, so if you read regularly you'll probably see when a quick update is prudent. I personally use NixOS for all of my servers and have auto-updates configured to run daily. An old laptop is exactly how I got started 13 years ago, they're great because they tend to be pretty power efficient and quiet too. reply tasuki 1 hour agorootparentMy stuff is always out of date and hasn't gotten hacked yet. I don't see why you'd want to run ssh on port 22. I run it on a different port and never get login attempts. Yes, if someone targeted me specifically of course they'd find out, but I guess that hasn't happened yet. reply johndough 1 hour agorootparent> I don't see why you'd want to run ssh on port 22. I run ssh on port 22 because I like wasting the time of those script kiddies. Also I like to brag about half a million \"hacker attacks\" on my server per month. reply scubbo 3 hours agorootparentprev> I've heard of people using Cloudflare tunnels as well... As a Cloudflare Tunnels user who only recently discovered Tailscale - just go with Tailscale straight off the bat. It's magic, and smooth as butter. reply packetlost 3 hours agorootparentTailscale Funnel [0] is limited to TLS-based protocols (maybe even just HTTPS) which is a non-starter for many cases. [0]: https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel reply Larrikin 1 hour agorootparentWhich cases? Tailscale has eliminated all my fears I had about self hosting and I've been using it a ton. The only issue I've run in to has been a single service (Withings) that uses a web hook to trigger updates for my sleep mat. Their server isn't on my tablet so I would need to expose atleast one service to the wider Internet. reply packetlost 13 minutes agorootparentI'm talking specifically about Tailscale Funnel which gives ingress access to services on the tailnet from outside (ie. on the general internet). Any case that doesn't use TLS for a transport won't work. SSH being a notable one, but I can think of several others. reply clvx 4 hours agorootparentprevOn top of this, having ipv6 configured makes things harder to discover but not impossible (As long as you don't use ${ipv6_subnet}::xxxx for your hosts). You can avoid NAT and just expose the nodes you need. Most ISP assign /56 or /64 which is a humongous amount of ips. It's nice if you are just using a flat virtual network in your home lab. The amount of scanners I see for my subnet are non existent at the moment. reply packetlost 3 hours agorootparentThat's if your ISP supports IPv6. My current one does, but my last one did not. reply 0xfeba 44 minutes agorootparentprevI've been at it for over a decade. Home router has firewall exceptions for SSH (not port 22 though), TLS IRC, and 80/443, which are forwarded to my home server with fail2ban. I run SSH (requires PKI outside local network), IRC, nextcloud, and ampache (though don't really use ampache anymore :( ). Home server is encrypted RAID6 Arch Linux. If I had to do it again I'd forego rolling releases and use something more stable, like Debian. Encrypted backups are done to backblaze once a month. I also have a backup drive that I plug in on occasion, encrypted of course. Which reminds me my RAID6 drives are getting old now... I'm tempted to move to a VPS. reply conradklnspl 5 hours agorootparentprevA god option is to setup a wireguard connection between workstation and servers. All traffic has to go through wireguard. Because wireguard is UDP and only responds to valid requests, there isn't any open port from the outside. Not even ssh. reply jimvdv 3 hours agorootparentAdditionally you can use Tailscale for added convenience. Tailscale is a payed service, for a simple home server you can get away with the free plan and their mobile apps work rather well. Not affiliated with Tailscale at all just shouting them out because they do make things very easy and I often recommend them to hobbyist. reply asar 5 hours agorootparentprevThe approach most people use is to tunnel into the server. You install a daemon on your computer which establishes a tunnel to log-into from outside your network. Cloudflare and Tailscale have solutions for this that are very popular among the self-hosted crowd. https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/application... https://tailscale.com/kb/1151/what-is-tailscale reply diggan 4 hours agorootparentprev> Is it relatively \"safe\" with modern tools and VMs or do you need to stay on top and (for eg) always ensure you're updating software weekly? First step to figure out if you actually need to be able to access it from the outside at all. If you just want a NAS, chances are you can put it on a separate VLAN/network that is only accessible within your LAN, so it wouldn't even be accessible from the outside. If you really need it to be accessible from the outside, make sure you start with everything locked down/not accessible at all from the beginning, then step-by-step open up exactly what you want, and nothing else. Make sure the endpoints accessible is run by software you keep up to date, at least weekly if not daily. reply voidUpdate 5 hours agorootparentprevYou'll want to make sure everything stays up to date in case someone finds a vulnerability in whatever software you're currently using. If you have to expose stuff to the outside world, only open the ports you need to. Only allow access to a specific user with a non-default username (or at the very least disable root ssh access), and use long passwords or ssh keys.

But for most, the added complexity doesn't buy enough for the trade-off to be worth it. Keep in mind most people have a single node, so docker does everything they need. Personally, even with a 4 node setup (of tiny desktops; the hardware you have would easily cost me $200/mo in power bills), I use docker swarm.

Sign-Up Here Register for the Trottier 2024 Symposium! Register Now Home Reports of the Death of Dental Cavities Are Greatly Exaggerated You can buy a bacterium to infect your mouth and prevent cavities. If only science were that easy. Jonathan Jarry M.Sc.17 May 2024 Medical Critical Thinking Technology Facebook LinkedIn Tweet Widget If I asked you to name the most common chronic disease in children, what would you say? Asthma comes top of mind, but there is something five times more common in kids: cavities. We don’t typically think of dental cavities as a chronic disease—in part because of the separation between medicine and dentistry—but it is. And it doesn’t just affect children: most adults in industrialized countries, where sugary food is commonly available, have to deal with this disease process. I write the word “cavity,” but the phrase “dental caries” is actually more encompassing. First documented in 1634 and coming from the Latin meaning “to decay,” caries refers to the process that can eventually lead to a hole in a tooth, an actual cavity. Few people enjoy going to the dentist and being told to reduce their sugar consumption. So, what if there was a pain-free way of avoiding dental caries forever? There is a product you can buy right now that essentially—through interviews and social media endorsements—promises to do just that. It’s a bacterium that you paint onto your teeth. It superinfects your mouth, taking over for the bacteria responsible for caries. A single application lasts a lifetime. There is, however, a big problem with this product, called Lumina, and it has to do with what happens when we become so focused on a potential solution, dedicating our life to making it work, that we miss important changes in our understanding of the problem itself. The perfect replacement In 1924, an Irish bacteriologist by the name of James Kilian Clarke isolated a bacterium he found in a dental cavity. It looked like some sort of mutated version of a streptococcus, so he named it Streptococcus mutans, or S. mutans for short. A few decades later, S. mutans had established itself in the minds of the scientific community as the great culprit behind dental caries, what experts call its etiology, meaning its cause. The bacterium was able to stick to the surface of our teeth and, in processing the sugars in our mouth, it would produce large amounts of acid, specifically lactic acid. Normally, our saliva is able to neutralize a lot of this acid, but S. mutans secretes complex sugars that create a sort of film over our teeth called plaque, trapping its acid underneath. Over time, the tooth, eroded by the acid, would cavitate and develop a hole. In the late 1970s, however, a chance event would promise to change the game. Dr. Jeffrey Hillman, a dentist and researcher then based in Boston, had found a version of S. mutans that had a very specific mutation, which meant that it produced less acid when metabolizing sugars. This opened the door to replacement therapy. A destructive approach to the problem of dental carries would be to use an antibiotic to kill the culprit; with replacement therapy, the idea is to replace the culprit with a version of it that is harmless. An example of this has been explored recently with genetically engineered mosquitoes that do not bite and that can only produce male offspring in an attempt to reduce the spread of diseases like Zika and yellow fever. Could we colonize the human mouth with this naturally mutated S. mutans and thus bid goodbye to cavities? A good replacement strain, it turns out, needs to meet a number of criteria, not unlike the robots of Isaac Asimov’s fictional universe which had to abide by the Laws of Robotics. The chosen bacterium must not cause disease, obviously. It should not predispose us to other diseases by disrupting the bacterial ecosystem that exists in our mouth. It has to stay in the mouth for a long time and ensure that the bacterium it is replacing doesn’t grow back. And because mutations do arise naturally, it has to be genetically stable: it should not be able to regain the ability to produce massive amounts of acid by picking up the gene from a neighbouring bacterium (which does happen in the wild!). Figuring out that the mutated S. mutans did not fulfill all of these criteria and finding a strain that did led Hillman and colleagues down a very long path. For a few decades, they laboured to find (or engineer) a strain of S. mutans that apparently checked all of the right boxes. Eventually, they arrived at strain BCS3-L1. It did not produce the dreaded lactic acid but instead metabolized sugars into ethanol and a molecule called acetoin, which is responsible for the flavour of butter. It also secreted a compound called Mutacin-1140 which kills other strains of S. mutans but which, importantly, does not destroy BCS3-L1. In rats, it colonized the mouth easily and the animals looked fine after six months. A strain that preceded BCS3-L1 was also tested in five human volunteers in the 1980s and the bacterium stuck to their teeth for many years (at least 14 in two cases). It was time to see if BCS3-L1 could be sold to Americans as a novel drug. Safety first It may seem like BCS3-L1 was the perfect candidate, but in an independent paper looking at this body of research, multiple concerns were highlighted. The toxicity of this Mutacin-1140 compound had not been tested. What would be the consequences of millions of bacteria in the mouth releasing this compound? The answer wasn’t clear, even though the archetypal compound in the family Mutacin-1140 belonged to was known to be very safe. BCS3-L1 also had the possibility to disturb the microbiome in the mouth in ways that were not predicted and allow disease-causing microorganisms to grow and thrive. And the fact that this bacterium did not produce acid could theoretically be reversed if it acquired the gene from a neighbouring bacterium. Still, a new drug application was filed with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and thus began a decade of back-and-forth. The FDA wanted a big red “abort” button in case something went wrong, a way to kill BCS3-L1. So Hillman, who was now the director and chief scientific officer for a company called Oragenics, made a change to BCS3-L1: the bacterium now needed an amino acid to survive, one that wasn’t typically found in the human diet but which would be given to research participants in the form of a mouthwash. By withholding the mouthwash, the bacterium would die. Once on the market, though, the strain that would be sold to people would not need this amino acid to survive: this safeguard was only meant for the safety trials. (It turns out that when tested in rats, this safeguarded bacterial strain was still occasionally able to colonize the mouth in the absence of this amino acid in the rat’s diet, possibly because it was getting it from the poop the rat was eating. Hence the safeguard was not foolproof.) More than that, the FDA insisted on participants with no real teeth, only dentures, so that they could be bleached if something went wrong. Oragenics thus aimed to recruit volunteers under 55 years of age who had a full set of dentures. They managed to find one. They then tried to design a new trial where people with actual teeth would be quarantined to a hospital-like setting, but there too not enough participants showed interest. By 2014, the company admitted that the only possibility moving forward was to partner with someone else. Otherwise, the work would have to be abandoned. Around that time, the patent they had for this bacterial strain expired. Aaron Silverbook, who founded a company called Lantern Bioworks, saw a way to rescue this technology from the regulatory red tape: what if it wasn’t filed as a drug but as a probiotic? He made a deal with Oragenics to acquire the recipe and aimed to get it approved by the FDA through its much less stringent probiotic pathway. He first sold it in Próspera, a libertarian charter city on a Central American island where any biotech product can be sold as long as the buyer signs a waiver, and now the product, renamed Lumina, is gaining hype on social media among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and DIY experimenters. You can even preorder the product for USD 250, to be shipped in June of this year. Goodbye, dentist! Only, there is a slight problem. Beyond Streptococcus mutans This whole technology is predicated on the assumption that dental caries are caused only (or, at the very least, mostly) by S. mutans. That was, after all, the accepted theory in the 1970s when Hillman got the ball rolling. Our understanding of dental caries, however, has greatly advanced in the interim. We went from calling caries an infectious disease that was specifically caused by S. mutans—much like how the influenza virus causes the flu—to gaining a more ecological perspective on the disease. S. mutans is not the only acid-producing oral bacterium that can cause caries: in fact, it forms less than 2% of all the bacteria that cause caries, and a little over one in seven people with caries do not have S. mutans in their mouth. There is even a scientific paper on dental caries literally titled “Beyond Streptococcus mutans”! Caries occur because of a catastrophic shift in the balance of our mouth’s bacterial and fungal ecosystem. It is not due to any one bacterium, and any bacterium capable of releasing acid after ingesting sugars can contribute to this. Even if you could reliably stop S. mutans from producing acid, you could not guarantee the absence of future dental caries. The reason why S. mutans became the Big Bad of the 1970s dentistry world is because researchers were stuck studying the mouth bacteria they could grow in the laboratory, and S. mutansgrows well in the conditions scientists were selecting back then. But now, with DNA technology, scientists have been able to detect 800 different species of bacteria in the human mouth. We are thus left with a product, Lumina, that cannot guarantee the prevention of future caries and whose safety can be summarized by a giant question mark. Is the Mutacin-1140 it releases into the mouth safe in the long term? Can the bacterium be transmitted to a partner via kissing? Is it safe in people with a compromised immune system? Will it upset the oral microbiome in ways that have not been tested for? I wish I had answers. The idea of replacement therapy has not gone away, with different strains of oral bacteria being manipulated in the lab to see if it might reduce the potential for caries. But in terms of what works to reduce the chances of a dentist announcing you have a cavity, it’s fairly straightforward: reduce your sugar consumption and use a toothpaste that contains fluoride. Our teeth are constantly in the midst of getting demineralized and remineralizing themselves. The acid produced by bacteria in the mouth interferes with remineralization, but the presence of fluoride helps those precious minerals diffuse into the tooth to form new crystals and thus protect the tooth from cavities. That’s why fluoride is so good for our teeth. Or you could paint your teeth with an experimental bacterium and see what happens. Take-home message: - Lumina is a genetically engineered version of the Streptococcus mutans bacterium that lives in the mouth, and it is supposed to prevent you from developing dental caries because it does not produce acid - It has been poorly studied for safety and effectiveness - Streptococcus mutans is actually neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of dental caries; the disease actually comes about because of a shift in the equilibrium of bacteria in the mouth which encourages the demineralization of our teeth @CrackedScience Keywords: cavity cavities Lumina S. mutans Streptococcus mutans fluoride What to read next What the Media Gets Wrong about CAM 13 Sep 2024 Another Bullet Fired at Highly Processed Food 11 Sep 2024 Should You Be Worried About Eating Burned Toast? 6 Sep 2024 Can You Trust Dr. Wikipedia? 6 Sep 2024 Serotonin Syndrome: Too Much of a “Good Thing” 6 Sep 2024 Study Gets to the Heart of Controversial Chelation Therapy 30 Aug 2024 Department and University Information Office for Science and Society McGill University 801 Sherbrooke Street West Montreal, Quebec H3A 0B8 Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram McGill University Copyright © 2024 McGill University Accessibility Cookie notice Cookie settings Log in Privacy settings We use cookies to help improve the usability of our websites.

What matters most is whether there is a substantial reduction of future caries, not whether it makes you totally immune to it. Say, if Lumina/BCS3-L1 \"only\" reduces cavities by 50%, it is already half as good (arguably) as a drug which prevented 100%. This would already be large progress for such a massive global problem.

Whenever someone introduces something that greatly helps with something, there are a bunch of people who start pointing out that, while the new solution is waay better than anything before it, it's not 100% perfect, and therefore \"it's benefits are exaggerated\" or similar. If the new thing is in the public eye for long enough, those \"exaggerated\" complaints start morphing into \"it's a scam\", and shortly after that the new solution to yesterday's problem is the villain that must be stopped. It's really confusing, and quite tiring. reply psychlops 2 hours agorootparentPerfect is the enemy of the good. reply smaudet 2 hours agorootparentI think the bigger issue is not whether it has some efficacy, even if limited (which could be interpreted as a good thing), it's the potential for the bacterium to create a mono-culture, which would be objectively bad (remember, diversity is critical in populations, and for our oral health perhaps even necessary). So not so much perfect being the enemy of the good, fluoride isn't perfect either, but it is good.

Multiple progressive outlets, especially the Guardian, published articles stating the drug was overhyped, playing down its value, citing overweight women from \"fat studies\" academia (basically activists against the stigma of being overweight saying that being overweight itself is not the problem), emphasizing all its downsides etc. Of course they couldn't stop the hype, because the drug actually works. Yet another example: In early 2020, for a few weeks many news sites claimed that face masks don't help against coronavirus transmission because there was \"no evidence\" that they did. Of course this wasn't true (the evidence was just limited, and the protection wasn't optimal), and they changed their tone quickly once multiple non-Asian countries started to introduce mask mandates for visiting public places. reply johnyzee 8 hours agoparentprevThe tone of the article is for some reason very dismissive and derisive of alternatives to plain dental hygiene. As you point out, if a simple supplement in the form of harmless bacteria could improve caries reduction by even a small amount, it seems it would be a valuable option. There is an existing 'probiotic' that has been around for years and works the same way, and promises the same benefits, as the one described in the article, it is called Streptococcus salivarius M18, there are quite a few studies that indicate it does work to some extent [1]. You get them in the form of lozenges that you put in the mouth while sleeping and they dissolve by themselves, so not a very invasive treatment if one wanted to use it. [1] https://www.google.com/search?q=Streptococcus+salivarius+M18 reply pj808 5 hours agorootparentThe claim of the headline is also not supported by the evidence shared in the article. As just one example, the article notes that many different strains of bacteria are responsible for caries. This fact doesn't necessarily say anything about the effectiveness of Lantern's treatments - although it might shed light on the mechanisms that make it effe tive (or not). That's what the clinical trials and studies on the early adopters are for. There's lots of interesting commentary on the early research, such as Scott Alexander's write-up, that are much better than this article. reply cubefox 7 hours agorootparentprev> The tone of the article is for some reason very dismissive and derisive of alternatives to plain dental hygiene. Yeah, emphasis on \"plain\". It's proposed as an addition, not an alternative, to conventonal tooth brushing. Streptococcus salivarius M18 seems also interesting, but its results in preventing caries are much more limited, from what I can tell. It also has be taken continuously (once per day), instead being a one-time application like BCS3-L1. reply cptskippy 2 hours agorootparentprev> The tone of the article is for some reason very dismissive and derisive of alternatives to plain dental hygiene. Putting my conspiracy theory hat on, the dental hygiene industry in the US is for-profit, like the pharmaceutical, and would rather sell you a treatment than a cure. I tried to have a dialog with my child's dentist about nano-hydroxyapatite. I was interested in their thoughts about it, not as a replacement for fluoride based therapies, but in addition to them. Rather than having a discussion about the merits of both treatments or discussing any concerns about compatibility, the dentist adopted an attitude that was belittling and made me feel like I was an anti-vaxer. The suggested we could just not do any fluoride therapies at all. It was very odd and alarming. reply lern_too_spel 2 hours agoparentprevThe article makes clear that a 50% reduction is likely massively optimistic. reply cubefox 1 hour agorootparentYou mean this quote? https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41574918 reply derektank 11 hours agoprevIt seems like FDA restrictions on clinical trials have really shot us all in the foot by depriving us the opportunity to collect data on this bacteria before it was made available as a supplement. There is clearly a demand for this product and it seems quite likely that Hillman et al could have gotten a cohort together to conduct a trial if they hadn't been faced with such extreme restrictions on testing. Why is informed consent not sufficient for participation in a RCT? reply zenexer 9 hours agoparentBecause the participants could very easily spread it to other people. This wouldn’t just affect them. That’s why the trial was ultimately required to take place under quarantine. It’s not even a question of whether it would spread, but whether it might spread. There’s a reasonable chance that this bacterium would, in fact, spread, and nobody has proven otherwise. The FDA is doing its job here: it’s protecting the masses from people who believe they’re just consenting for themselves. reply mapt 7 hours agorootparentThe FDA, however, is not regulating the spread of the 800 other known species of oral bacteria as well as presumably numerous unknown ones, which do cause some known harm. The extreme suspicion of commercially introduced anthropogenic agents seems a bit ridiculous in both natural ecology and the human microbiome. Prove this compound conclusively safe, but not these other ten million compounds we're just going to allow to run wild. Or for competitors - rely on the 'proof' of safety established in the 1920's or the 1970's before we had any idea whatsoever what we were doing scientifically. Or just rely on doctors/dentists unsupported first-principles advice - we've never demonstrated scientifically that floss works, for example. We should all be quarantined, all the time, by this criteria.

Lumina is a genetically modified bacteria. It has no research supporting its effectiveness because the original inventors never bothered to conduct a human trial; they just said that it probably works based on testing in a petri dish. (Note: lots of drugs work in petri dishes and laboratory animals. Very few go on to have success in humans.)

Does she see the same dentist as you now? I once had a dentist who claimed I had a cavity every visit. I saw him once a year, and he did little more than look at my teeth. I've since switched dentists three times as I moved around the country and my dental insurance changed, and with all three, I've gotten nothing but rave reviews about the state of my teeth. I see my latest dentist twice a year, and he does an X-ray and an intraoral scan every other visit, and on my most recent visit, he discovered that one of those alleged cavities my first dentist had filled was filled improperly and appeared to have become reinfected. Unfortunately for me, I was busy at the time and postponed treatment for too long, and now the filling has fallen out and the tooth has collapsed in on itself, requiring a root canal and a crown, which in addition to being somewhat painful, will likely set me back several thousand dollars.

Dentists, or scientists? Dentists seem to be about 5-10 years behind the research on this topic. I know of a single practice that has started doing oral microbiome testing. We know that caries are caused by acid eroding the teeth. And we know which bacterial species produce this acid, how quickly they secrete it, and how common they are. The most significant source is Strep. Mutans. Sugar is an input to this process, and Xylitol (a sugar alcohol) can kill this bacteria selectively. Diet is probably the most significant way to affect gum disease. Gum disease is associated with systemic inflammation and auto-immunity. The same dietary interventions that are used to treat those conditions also treat gum disease. reply mishu2 5 hours agorootparent> Dentists seem to be about 5-10 years behind the research on this topic. Generalizations are usually not helpful, I think it really depends on the dentist. I'm not sure there are proven benefits to oral microbiome testing, except in some very specific cases. > The most significant cause for caries is S. mutans. The 'Beyond Streptococcus mutans' section in TFA explains that the situation is much more complex than this; even if it is, good oral hygiene and reduced sugar intake (both in quantity and frequency) are still the best way to reduce the amount of biofilm present on teeth (which is a requirement for caries formation, whether S. mutans is there or not). > Diet is the most significant way to affect gum disease. The current clinical treatment guidelines for periodontitis[1,2] only mention that the benefit of weight-reducing diet and lifestyle changes is unclear (for treating periodontitis, obviously), and that oral hygiene is still the most important thing you can do yourself for the prevention, and, once established, to assist in the treatment of the disease.

The directly cited article (https://www.nature.com/articles/sj.bdj.2018.81) says the following: \"These caries ecological concepts have been confirmed by recent DNA- and RNA-based molecular studies that have uncovered an extraordinarily diverse microbial ecosystem, where S. mutans accounts for a very small fraction (0.1%–1.6%) of the bacterial community implicated in the caries process.[20]\" Note the sudden conversion of \"implicated in the caries process\" to \"cause caries\". The next step in the citation chain is https://www.cell.com/trends/microbiology/abstract/S0966-842X.... \"In recent years, the use of second-generation sequencing and metagenomic techniques has uncovered an extraordinarily diverse ecosystem where S. mutans accounts only for 0.1% of the bacterial community in dental plaque and 0.7–1.6% in carious lesions[14,15].\" Now the claim is merely one of prevalence! The next steps in the citation chain, https://karger.com/cre/article-abstract/47/6/591/85901/A-Tis... and https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal..., do seem to plausibly provide evidence that there are other mouth-colonizing bacteria which would perform the same function as S. Mutans when it comes to causing caries, such that fully eliminating S. Mutans probably wouldn't eliminate caries entirely. But, importantly, the citation in the McGill article doesn't much support the original claim, and this citation chain could easily have bottomed out in a completely different set of results which didn't happen to lend some (weak) evidentiary support to the high-level claim. Also importantly, this article is committing the sin of figuring out some reasons why a treatment might not be perfectly effective in all cases, and implicitly deciding that justifies ignoring any non-total benefits (i.e. cases where S. Mutans would have been counterfactually responsible for causing caries, that could be prevented). Questions that would have been appropriate, but were apparently uninteresting: \"Does this intervention also happen to chase out other acid-producing bacteria that fulfill a similar ecological niche as S. Mutans?\" \"What percentage of caries cases would be prevented by chasing out just S. Mutans with this intervention, while leaving other acid-producing bacteria untouched?\" Likely this is because answers to those questions would not really have changed the bottom line. That bottom line was written by the \"unanswered\" safety concerns (reasonable in the abstract, less obviously reasonable in this specific case). All of the listed safety concerns have evidence pointing in various directions. Very little of that evidence is listed, probably because it's not in a format that's legible to scientific institutions. The article does note, earlier on, \"The toxicity of this Mutacin-1140 compound had not been tested. What would be the consequences of millions of bacteria in the mouth releasing this compound? The answer wasn’t clear, even though the archetypal compound in the family Mutacin-1140 belonged to was known to be very safe.\" This is obviously relevant evidence about the safety of Mutacin-1140. _How much_ evidence? Unasked, unanswered. (I have no idea how predictive the safety of other compounds in the same family is of another unstudied compound in that family, I'm not a biologist. But this is not an _unanswerable_ question.) (Marginal conflict of interest: I know the Lumina founder socially. I have no financial interest in that venture or any of his other ventures. I have not taken Lumina myself.) reply bnralt 15 hours agoparentThe safety concerns sound circular in an almost Kafkaesque manner. From what I can tell, a strain of the bacteria was found in the wild that created less acid and seemed to lead to less carries. So people thought it needed to be safer, so they instead created a genetically modified version of the bacteria. But now it couldn’t even be tested in the wild because the “safer” version had so many unknowns that even letting people experiment with it would be dangerous, since it could potentially escape into the general population and hurt people (possibly escape through activities like kissing, the article states). But the earlier strain has been out there spreading in the population for decades/centuries already. Why not just let people experiment on their own with the original low acid bacteria if they want? It’s already there in the wild. You’re already “painting your teeth” with different bacteria when you kiss people, so why not at least let some people pick which naturally occurring bacteria they can expose themselves to instead of letting it happen by random chance? A lot of the hype about Lumina seemed to be goofy, but the hand wringing over “painting your mouth with bacteria!” is just as bad if not worse. reply bhaney 14 hours agorootparent> From what I can tell, a strain of the bacteria was found in the wild that created less acid and seemed to lead to less carries I think you're confused about which changes to the bacteria were natural and which were engineered. A strain in the wild was discovered that produced a weak antibiotic that it had also developed a resistance to, but it still had the original metabolic pathway that produced lactic acid. Researches took that strain and genetically modified it to produce ethanol instead of lactic acid, and then relied on the natural antibiotic-related mutations to get this strain to replace common S. Mutans in the oral microbiomes of test subjects. The useful non-acidic property of the strain is entirely artificially introduced. The natural mutation in the wild just allowed for outcompeting and replacing bacteria that lack it. There would be no benefit from personally experimenting with the natural non-engineered strains. reply nick__m 2 hours agorootparentIf that strain produces ethanol and can colonize the guts, then it has the potential to cause the auto-brewery syndrome. That a good reason to be careful! reply consp 15 hours agorootparentprev> So people thought it needed to be safer That was after they decided it needed to outcompete the existing bacterium and added a mutagen to kill it off. reply bnralt 14 hours agorootparentBut why did they decide that? It seems to be a pretty clear example of the perfect being the enemy of the good. 1. Better bacteria is found in the wild, it might be able to significantly reduce cavities. People could be randomly passing it to others through kissing, and no one is concerned about it since it doesn't seem to be harmful. 2. It’s not given to people for replacement therapy because (as the article states) people decided that a replacement therapy “needs to meet a number of criteria.\" 3. Except meeting that criteria makes people think the replacement isn’t safe and shouldn’t be tried. The article is saying “of course we needed to add X characteristics to the bacteria, they were necessary in order for it to be a good replacement” and then goes on to say “of course people shouldn’t be using the bacteria with X characteristics, X characteristics might be dangerous.” reply bawolff 13 hours agoprevWhat i don't understand, is why not do animal studies?

In this case, the absolute risk when measuring for death in the GIM pre-intervention and GIM post-intervention are 0.0215 (2.15%) and 0.0146 (1.46%) with an absolute risk reduction of 0.0069 (.69%). While the relative risk is 26% across the pre- and post-intervention, the absolute risk reduction is only 0.69% with a NNT (number needed to treat) of 1/156. Which means that 1 patient in 156 was helped by this intervention. In addition, they had 2 false alarms for each true alarm and could suggest that interventions were performed in patients who did not require it — more tests, medications and possibly increased risk from said interventions. This shows that the CHARTwatch ML/AI is not helping at all that much clinically. reply vessenes 1 hour agoparentI like this analysis, although I come to a different conclusion: if AI can give early warning to nursing staff, telling them 'look closer', and over 1/3 of the time, it was right, that seems great. Right now in a 30 bed unit, nurses have to keep track of 30 sets of data. With this, they could focus in on 3 sets when an alarm goes off. I believe these systems will get better over time as well. But, as a patient, I'd 100% take a ward that early AI warning with 66% chance of false positives over one with no such tech. Wouldn't you? reply hammock 1 minute agorootparentI like this analysis, although I come to a different conclusion: if AI can allow nurses to manage 10x as many beds (30 vs 3), a hospital can now let go 90% of its nursing staff. Wouldn’t you? reply _aavaa_ 1 hour agorootparentprevI would not. High false alarm rates are a problem in all sorts of industry when it comes to warnings and alerts. Too many alerts, or too many false positive alerts cause operators (or nurses in this example) to start ignoring such warnings. reply rscho 1 hour agorootparentprevNo, many people working in clinical units wouldn't. Because of what might happen on false alarms. What GP said: more meds, more interventions. It's not clear at all whether such systems would help with current workflows and current technology. One of the most famous books about medicine says that good medicine is doing nothing as much as possible. It's still very true in 2024, and probably for a long time still. reply fsckboy 10 minutes agoparentprev>1 patient in 156 was helped by this intervention the headline says we're talking about death: does that mean 1 life was saved for every 156 patients? >In addition, they had 2 false alarms for each true alarm and ... and possibly increased risk from said interventions but wouldn't this study have captured any deaths from those interventions, so the 1 out of 156 life-savings was net? reply swyx 1 hour agoparentprevthis was excellent and necessary context on all fluff pieces like the OP. how can we automate this kind of analysis? reply esoleyman 1 hour agorootparentYou can't automate it. You have to look at the data and charts to figure out the specifics you want and then you plug and chug. I haven't looked deeply at this though but whenever researchers use relative risk and it shows a profound effect, I always calculate the absolute risk to make sure that the intervention is effective. Many researchers go to relative risk because it shows better results! reply netruk44 1 hour agorootparentprevI know everyone hates \"I asked ChatGPT\" comments but...I feel it's relevant here.

Technology allows companies to become 'just good enough'. Any better than 'just good enough' and resources are withdrawn. If there is a 26% improvement in x and x was 'just good enough' before then the only 'rational' move by administration is to reduce other resources until x hits 'just good enough' again. That being said, I think the improvements are coming so rapidly in healthcare that we have a real chance of causing the entire system to shift into a new dynamic so maybe we will actually capture some of these gains for patients. reply jjmarr 2 hours agoparentThis takes place in Canada. There are no for-profit hospital complexes like the USA. All of our major hospitals are non-profit, reimbursed by the single-payer healthcare system and philanthropists getting stuff named after them. The profit-motive isn't as significant of a factor here. That being said, I'm fine with a reduction of resources if additional resources don't increase the quality of my care. In Canada, doctors don't really like to prescribe antibiotics for minor infections. Americans find this bizarre, but for a minor infection antibiotics are going to screw up your stomach bacteria and long-term health to maybe treat a disease that your body can easily handle on its own. There's no magic value that comes from allocating resources to a problem. Oftentimes spending money has zero or negative impact beyond virtue-signalling that you care about the problem. reply llm_nerd 2 hours agorootparentCanadian hospitals have largely the same cost cutting and \"efficiency\" measures as their US equivalents. Departments have budgets that they have to fight for, feifdoms compete for scraps, and there is an enormous and perpetually growing admin/executive side that is taking more and more of the budget. Couple this with governments such as Ontario that \"starve the beast\", so to speak, forcing hospitals to squeeze further. I don't think we should ever take any sort of superior position on this. The same motivations and outcomes occur. Having said that, efficiency is good, especially with an aging population that will require more and more care. Resources are limited, so applying them in the most effective, efficient way possible is always a win. reply jjmarr 1 hour agorootparentAmerican healthcare spending 80% more than Canada on a per-capita basis for worse or equal outcomes.[1] Our system has major problems, but we spend less money and have a healthier population. That definitionally means we're more efficient. > The same motivations and outcomes occur. Our hospitals don't have shareholders that capture excess revenue as profit. Efficiency gains in a non-profit hospital typically get reinvested into the mission of providing healthcare. Efficiency gains in a for-profit hospital often go to the owners. \"Efficiency\" is also measured differently in a non-profit context. A business measures monetary return on investment. A non-profit organization measures the monetary cost of achieving its mission. Many for-profit hospitals in the United States offer free mental health clinics. These clinics have been accused of baiting patients into saying something suicidal as a tactic to involuntarily commit said patients.[2] Because appeals of an emergency mental health order are difficult, this is an extremely efficient way of making money (the hospital gets to bill the patient for their stay). I don't believe this could happen in Canada. The goal is to get people out of the hospital because there aren't enough beds. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_the_healthcare_s... [2] https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rosalindadams/intake reply llm_nerd 28 minutes agorootparentI will always choose properly funded universal healthcare over the US model, and my disagreement was with the claim that somehow the Canadian system wouldn't yield a reduction in resources because of some unique quality of universal/non-profit healthcare. Of course resources would be rebalanced if some part of healthcare could be done with less, and if the administration could cut budgets because a model lets them hit the same benchmarks with less, they absolutely, unequivocally will. And then they'll give themselves a fat bonus. As to the mental health holds, here in Canada we have a problem with social workers encouraging difficult cases to consider medically assisted suicides, which is pretty disgusting. We have people dying on waiting lists. We have people having to go to the US to get basic imagining of probable cancer cases. Universal healthcare is superior -- again assuming proper funding, which jurisdictions like Ontario are far, far short of -- but in the current state of the Canadian system, I would never imagine bragging about it online. reply jmward01 2 hours agorootparentprevI totally agree. The tie to whole patient outcome is stronger in that system. Still not perfect, but a lot more direct for sure. It may be an odd thing to say, but because of that there is an argument that the Canadian system is closer to a true free market healthcare system with the patient as the consumer than the US system. reply doe_eyes 3 hours agoparentprevI think you're missing an important part of the equation: it's outcome quality per amount paid. If you could have gotten 20% better results but it would mean tripling the costs of healthcare because we'd need to hire a lot more staff, perhaps we felt that was a bad deal. If you can get 20% by paying... what, presumablyBecause that is a whole lot cheaper than extra (unwanted) pregnancies.

The tool mostly seems to provide ongoing diagnosis at a level of detail the clinical team doesn't have regular bandwidth for (they might make one diagnosis of the patient per time they visit the patient rather than on an ongoing basis). It doesn't really reduce the amount of time staff can spend with patients. They can't get rid of doctor diagnosis entirely so they can't really reduce time per patient in any effective way. reply wesselbindt 3 hours agoparentprevStarving the beast is an ongoing program, the budget will be cut (or fixed, hence silently cut through inflation) either way. My hope is that improvements like this will stave off the harmful effects of the budget cuts. reply formerly_proven 3 hours agorootparentYou realistically can’t starve the beast that is healthcare. The costs will go up disproportionately, and they do, in basically every advanced economy: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol_effect reply wesselbindt 2 hours agorootparentWhile I agree that you shouldn't, and that the end goal (privatized health care) is at the same time more costly and less efficient, that doesn't mean people can't or don't. The Baumol effect you link to only shows that wage demands from health care workers go up in proportion to the wages of other workers. This means (roughly speaking), that reducing the health care budget will reduce the effectiveness of your health care system, because you're able to afford fewer people (I think this is the point you're making, please correct me if I'm wrong). But that's entirely the point of starving the beast! By cutting funding to some federal department, that department becomes less effective, which makes people think that the government is incapable of running said department, and makes them open to the idea of privatizing the department. Et voila, you've opened up a whole new market that can be exploited for profits! The holy grail is opening up a market with inelastic demand such as health care, where people, no matter what you charge, will be forced to buy your product. This program has been incredibly successful in the US, which can be seen by comparing their health care system to that of other wealthy nations. reply lotsofpulp 2 hours agorootparentprevYou can reduce the spend per person by replacing more qualified workers with less qualified (cheaper) workers, and adding friction to the process of obtaining healthcare. Increasing prior authorizations, increasing paperwork complexity, increasing hold times on the phone, obfuscation for who is responsible for what, constantly changing coverage so people have to change providers, and otherwise discourage them from seeking care. reply MichaelZuo 3 hours agoparentprevWhy are you putting ‘just good enough’ in quotation marks? Even declaring that is the case doesn’t change that it’s still clearly a personal judgement depending on the individual. reply MSFT_Edging 2 hours agorootparentIts not a personal judgement to say private equity buying up hospitals has shifted the priorities of the hospitals from care to profit. \"Depending on the individual\" here means, depending if you're a share holder, or the patient dying on the cot. reply MichaelZuo 2 hours agorootparentHuh?

If a company has an opportunity to make money, they will. Any better than 'good enough' isn't rational and the people running that company should be fired. In the long term the entire industry will slowly adopt this and the standard of care may rise slightly as these gains are used for competitive advantage instead of pure profit but that will take a while at best and relies on a true free market, which healthcare definitely isn't. reply SteveNuts 3 hours agorootparent> relies on a true free market, which healthcare definitely isn't. I think this is the part that people miss the most. When a purchasing decision is made based on something like \"who has the best quality shoes in price range X\", competition can occur. When the buying decision is \"will I live or die\", there's not really any choice made there. Couple that with the complete lack of transparency for how much a give procedure will cost, and you've strayed so far away from a free market that it's not even recognizable. I mean, even the hospital can't even remotely accurately tell you how much something will cost before you actually get a bill... reply 9dev 2 hours agorootparentIt’s not only about living or dying.

In an ideal world, the nurse to patient ratio would be high enough that patients could be seen on regular rotation frequently. I've never been in a hospital where this was the case. So a system that can correctly prioritize resources for critical cases even if it's pulling resources away from non-critical cases will probably result in a net improved outcome. reply rscho 3 hours agorootparentWith such a false positive rate, I expect the staff on site to find ways to negate the effect pretty quickly. reply Tostino 3 hours agorootparentI don't know...If every 3rd time I was alerted it was some relatively serious issue, vs how often there is a serious issue when just doing rounds that you stumble upon, I'd think that would be a pretty good alert rate compared to the norm. But then again, I'm not in healthcare. reply rscho 3 hours agorootparentEssentially, it depends on workplace integration, i.e. how much effort it takes to discover the alert trigger. From personal experience, I'd say the upper limit of inconvenience is 'click the alert' on mobile, and 'move mouse on alert label to see tooltip' on desktop.

Here in China once the doctor prescribes a finger blood test, we sample finger blood after lining up for 15 minutes, and the result is available within 30 minutes. The patient prints the results from a kiosk and any patient who cares enough about their own health will see the exceptionally high white cell count and request an urgent appointment with the doctor for diagnosis right away. Even in normal cases we usually have the doctor see the report within two hours.

If a study found that letting cats roam hospital hallways reduced unexpected deaths by 26%, I think that would be reported, too. reply contagiousflow 3 hours agorootparentIt's a 26% decrease in relative terms, but looking at the study shows that it is a 0.5% decrease in absolute terms (1.6% vs 2.1%). A 0.5% decrease is great and should be applauded, but I think the article framing of this being a breakthrough is misleading and even goes against the conclusions of the very paper it is reporting on. reply charlie0 3 minutes agorootparentDang, the journos fooled me again with their creative headlines.

They're not using \"regex\" to develop algorithms for monitoring patients (???), and frankly that suggestion is so wild that one has to assume you don't know anything about algorithm design at all. An LLM literally hallucinates incorrect answers by design and struggles to get extremely basic math and spelling correct. You're welcome to put your literal life in the hands of a hallucinating english generator, but when it comes to healthcare, I want a \"0% LLM\" policy.

The weirdest thing I've experienced as a patient is that Physicians will urge you against second opinions or having multiple doctors. Hope telemedicine becomes more mainstream, I'd like to avoid US physicians as much as possible. reply chaosist 26 minutes agorootparentI was semi-retired two years ago and decided to do a LPN program to work part time, do something physical, something that felt like a moral win and good for society. I would have had no problem intellectually getting through the program but quit after the first night in a hospital. Anyone sitting at a desk can not understand how tough and miserable a nursing job is. Everyone is basically miserable and stressed out. The work is completely thankless, disgusting and dangerous with personal liability on the line if you make a mistake. Everything that we take for granted in an office setting just doesn't apply in a medical setting. I eventually just went back to a bullshit project management job, for more money than a nurse of course. This is obviously part of the problem. It is easy to complain about the system when it is someone else who has to help grandma to the bathroom. There is no easy solution for any of this given the demographics. It is basically a disaster. reply rscho 3 hours agorootparentprevMedicine isn't science because science is not as advanced as many would think. The lack of workplace integration is also a big factor. I don't think we discourage second opinions, except maybe in some for-profit structures. The bad idea is to have multiple people making decisions in parallel. I'm not in the US, though. Regarding advocacy, I don't think it's so crazy. It's very good to have a valid interlocutor when the patient is diminished. Also, hospitals are big systems with limited personalization. If someone's there to call out the system when it's trying to shoehorn too hard, it's also very good. reply ndarray 3 hours agorootparentprevEnjoy the privilege of seeing multiple doctors as long as you still can. With steady cost reduction (AI, automation, less effort per patient) and increase in medical authoritarianism (\"expert said so\") that privilege is on thin ice. In the UK it's already normal to have a single area-designated doctor you're allowed to go to, and that doctor is also a gatekeeper to refer you to specialists. Hope he likes you! Beyond that, AI diagnosis would likely require an extensive medical online profile of you. Such e-med profiles obviously already exist in various countries, as opt-out features. In the name of cost reduction through automation, I'll be so free and call it: These profiles will become mandatory over the next ten years. Either way, good luck getting a second opinion once a false diagnosis ended up in your file or once AI continuously misidentifies a pattern present there. reply SketchySeaBeast 4 hours agoprevImportant to note that the timing of this means that it's dedicated, specific AI, not \"throw a wrapper and a specific prompt in front of ChatGPT\" AI.

Probably takes as input all of the factors over a time series and then determines based on these inputs over time there is a higher likelihood of Y. When that likelihood reaches some threshold it sends an alert to the nurse. It's almost certainly not as simple as temperature at 105 -> alert (although a temp of 105, would certainly signal a problem). reply daft_pink 1 hour agoprevThis is really awesome.

If it's not terrorism, what is the differentiating factor(s)? *side note: I'm quite sure other western countries have used tactics that I would call terrorism as well. This isn't meant to be a callout or anti-anything post. I'm genuinely curious where the line is drawn. reply pdabbadabba 3 hours agoparentI think it should not be considered terrorism to the extent that the attack targeted legitimate military targets during a time of war — broadly speaking, combatants and other parts of the organization that affect its ability to wage war. Terrorism, at least least in my view, is an attack that either intentionally targets civilians or is truly indiscriminate, and is aimed at producing political cha age by causing fear. By those definitions, I think this is clearly not terrorism. (Though we might learn more information about who was targeted that could change this assessment.) Admittedly, my definitions only imperfectly track the way the word is used in the west, but I think that's only due to frequent misuse of the term for political ends. I would worry about a definition of terrorism that creates an incentive to avoid this type of warfare in favor of dropping bombs. reply 113 1 hour agorootparent> legitimate military targets during a time of war Israel and Lebanon are not at war. reply edanm 1 hour agorootparentBut Israel and Hezbollah are at war, and these are (reportedly) devices used by Hezbollah operatives.

All feasible precautions must be taken to avoid, and in any event to minimize, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects.”* *Provisions common to the territories of the Parties to the conflict and to occupied territories - Article 27* “Protected persons are entitled, in all circumstances, to respect for their persons, their honour, their family rights, their religious convictions and practices, and their manners and customs. They shall at all times be humanely treated, and shall be protected especially against all acts of violence or threats thereof and against insults and public curiosity.” *Article 51 - Protection of the civilian population* “1. The civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations. To give effect to this protection, the following rules, which are additional to other applicable rules of international law, shall be observed in all circumstances. 2. The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited. 3. Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this Section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities. 4. Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Indiscriminate attacks are: (a) those which are not directed at a specific military objective; (b) those which employ a method or means of combat which cannot be directed at a specific military objective; or (c) those which employ a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by this Protocol; and consequently, in each such case, are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction. 5. Among others, the following types of attacks are to be considered as indiscriminate: (a) an attack by bombardment by any methods or means which treats as a single military objective a number of clearly separated and distinct military objectives located in a city, town, village or other area containing a similar concentration of civilians or civilian objects; and (b) an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. 6. Attacks against the civilian population or civilians by way of reprisals are prohibited. 7. The presence or movements of the civilian population or individual civilians shall not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations, in particular in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield, favour or impede military operations. The Parties to the conflict shall not direct the movement of the civilian population or individual civilians in order to attempt to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield military operations. 8. Any violation of these prohibitions shall not release the Parties to the conflict from their legal obligations with respect to the civilian population and civilians, including the obligation to take the precautionary measures provided for in Article 57.” *Article 48 of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (1977):* “In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.” reply pdabbadabba 2 hours agorootparentYou've posted several paragraphs. It would be helpful if you'd identify the part of this you think Israel has violated, because I see none. Broadly speaking, the Geneva Convention calls for the use of \"all feasible precautions\" to be taken in protecting civilians, but does not require perfection in doing so. In the context of a world where wars are normally fought with missiles and bombs, I would have thought that Israel's decision to instead target Hezbollah via tiny explosives hidden in devices known to be sold to Hezbollah members would be an extreme way of complying with this rule. If not even this is good enough, how else would you advise a nation to defend itself without violating this principle?

There's just a distinction to be made from intentionally killing civilians for the purpose of causing terror versus targeting a group that you are in an open military hostility with. The second one, as you say, is basically just war. And war has historically also included civilian casualties. Flying a plane full of civilians into a building full of civilians, or detonating a bomb in a public square full of civilians, are pretty clear examples of what \"terrorism\" is. They aren't actions meant to directly attack the capability of an enemy to wage war against you. What governments and media choose to label \"terrorism\" or \"terrorist groups\" however is inherently political and not done following some agreed, objective definition. reply lukan 1 hour agorootparentprevYou are aware that Hezbollah routinely fires missiles into Israel (and Israel fires Artillery and drop bombs)?

By contrast, the targets of this attack were directly against the personnel and leadership of a militarized organization currently in a shooting war with israel. The goal is not to instill terror in a population, but to directly target the capabilities of a military organization. Note that doesn't mean its not a war crime (I don't think it is but...)!

Typically the differentiating factor is who the victims are and what the goal of the operation are - terrorists = victims are primarily civilian and the operation has negligible military benefit. Not terrorists = the targets are military. If there is collateral damage then it is not excessive (or not intended to be; intent matters) in relation to the military objective. All this is subjective of course, and politics are involved, but that is what the difference is usually given as. In this particular case - i would say it would be terrorism if it was random people's radios & pagers, but not terrorism if it was pagers/radios bought for military purpose that were primarily owned by soldiers. Initial reports suggest it is the latter, but i imagine more details will appear in time to better make that determination. reply jaredklewis 1 hour agoparentprev> I'm genuinely curious where the line is drawn. I'm the opposite, in that I think it is incredibly uninteresting to obsess over semantics and try to neatly sort everything into a terrorism or non-terrorism box.

The definition will simply be stretched by the interpreting party to put things they do not morally approve of into the terrorism box and things they do approve of in the non-terrorism box.

Like almost all other parties in the middle east- the separation of combatants and civilians is not held up. Means civilians switch into insurgent roles and back all the time.

If you tell us to un-hand Taiwan again, we'll press the big red button and un-hand a few million of your citizens\" Now that this kind of attack is frontpage news, every country in the world is by now aware it's possible -- and it appears to be super effective. So it seems entirely reasonable that some countries will start planning to do the same sort of attack against their enemies. What I'm saying is, now that everyone's become aware this sort of thing is possible and effective, China might realize it has the means, opportunity, and possibly motive to attack the US this way on a large scale.

That was Hamas, not Hezbollah so maybe the latter didn't learn the lesson and left themselves open to this type of attack or retribution, depending on your individual perspective.

They routinely spy on the US, and according the the CIA, spy on us as aggressively as the Chinese and Russians do.

Their nuclear program was started primarily with stolen radioactive material that they exfiltrated from the US. These stories go on and on and on, and they're just the ones we know about. Jonathan Pollard was hardly the only spy, but it was the most high profile. It's naive to call them an ally.

No one matches the Mossad and the semi-private private intel industry of Israel in terms of capabilities. Another reason is that Israel is a relatively stable, Western aligned democracy in a sea of dictatorships, kingdoms, fiefdoms and failed states... which are all organized in OPEC. The US needs a powerful Israel as a check-and-balance against OPEC - a credible threat that if OPEC ever repeats another Oil Crisis, they'll get putsched away. > They routinely spy on the US, and according the the CIA, spy on us as aggressively as the Chinese and Russians do.

Israel ranks up there with China and Russia, and that's an issue. And it's absolutely true that they did not sign the nuclear non proliferation treaty, and then went on to do nuclear tests off the coast of South Africa in the 1979 Vela incident. And that provided a huge motivation for Israel's enemies (which are absolutely anti-US) to seek nuclear weapons, which caused huge regional instability since then and threatened US national security. Yes, you can talk about how it's hypocritical that the US gets to do these things and nobody else does. And in a sense it is, but the fact is that at the moment, the US effectively rules the world for better or worse.

You could hear on the radio when the recording crew began shooting for the day's production.

But I also think a lot of radios look like Baofengs, or are whitelabeled Baofengs, so who knows...
