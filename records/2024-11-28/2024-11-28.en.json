    "originBody": "Lights Out This repository contains tools that allow getting software control of the webcam LED on ThinkPad X230 without physical access to the laptop. These were created as a practical demonstration that malware can record video through the webcam without the LED indication. This works via reflashing the webcam firmware over USB (the X230 webcam is connected over USB internally) to add a capability of arbitrarily controlling the LED. This approach likely affects many other laptops, as connecting the webcam over USB and allowing to reflash its firmware is a common design pattern across laptop manufacturers. See the \"Lights Out: Covertly turning off the ThinkPad webcam LED indicator\" talk (pdf) I gave at POC 2024 for the details: discovering a way to reflash the X230 webcam firmware, reverse engineering the firmware, adding an implant for LED control, and notes about the applicability of the approach to other laptops. Note: Reflashing the webcam firmware might brick the webcam, use these tools with caution. Overview The webcam used on ThinkPad X230 (and a few other laptops from the same era) is based on the Ricoh R5U8710 USB camera controller. This controller stores a part of its firmware, the SROM part, on the SPI flash chip located on the webcam board. The controller also allows reflashing the contents of the SPI chip over USB. The LED on the X230 webcam board is connected to the GPIO B1 pin of the R5U8710 controller. The GPIO B port is mapped to address 0x80 in the XDATA memory space of the 8051-based CPU inside R5U8710. Thus, changing the value at that address changes the state of the LED. This works regardless of whether the webcam is streaming video at the moment or not. The tools provided in this repository allow flashing custom firmware with a USB-controlled so-called \"universal implant\" onto the SPI chip on the webcam board. This implant allows writing controlled data to arbitrary addesses (within the XDATA memory space) and calling arbitrary addresses (within the CODE memory space; aliased with XDATA starting from offset 0xb000). The universal implant can be used for: Dynamically uploading a second-stage implant within the camera contoller memory and executing it (originally used for reverse engineering purposes); Directly controlling the webcam LED. See the talk slides for more details. Tools srom.py — reads and writes the SROM part of the firmware of a Ricoh R5U8710–based webcam over USB. Note: The webcam only loads the SROM firmware during its boot. Thus, you will need to power cycle the laptop (full shutdown, not just reboot) for the updated firmware to get loaded; patch_srom.py — patches the SROM image from the FRU 63Y0248 webcam (not from the original X230 webcam) to add the universal implant. Note: This tool requires modification to work with the original X230 webcam SROM image. However, the FRU 63Y0248 SROM image (optionally, with the implant added) can be flashed onto the original X230 webcam as well; fetch.py — fetches the contents of the IRAM, XDATA, or CODE memory space over USB via a second-stage implant that gets dynamically uploaded via the universal implant; led.py — turns the webcam LED on or off by overwriting the value at address 0x80 in XDATA via the universal implant. Memory dumps srom/x230.bin — SROM contents of the original X230 webcam module (FRU unknown; 19N1L1NVRA0H marking on the board); srom/63Y0248.bin — SROM contents of the FRU 63Y0248 webcam module; code/63Y0248.bin — Contents of the CODE memory space leaked from the FRU 63Y0248 webcam module. Note: Boot ROM is below the offset 0xb000, and it is identical to the Boot ROM on the original X230 webcam module.",

    "commentBody": "Malware can turn off webcam LED and record video, demonstrated on ThinkPad X230 (github.com/xairy)915 points by xairy 22 hours agohidepastfavorite482 comments sbarre 22 hours agoI thought the whole point of these camera LEDs was to have them wired to/through the power to the camera, so they are always on when the camera is getting power, no matter what. Having the LED control exposed through the firmware completely defeats this. reply 542458 22 hours agoparentThey are hardwired on Macbooks. From Daring Fireball, quoting an email from an Apple engineer. > All cameras after [2008] were different: The hardware team tied the LED to a hardware signal from the sensor: If the (I believe) vertical sync was active, the LED would light up. There is NO firmware control to disable/enable the LED. The actual firmware is indeed flashable, but the part is not a generic part and there are mechanisms in place to verify the image being flashed. […] > So, no, I don’t believe that malware could be installed to enable the camera without lighting the LED. My concern would be a situation where a frame is captured so the LED is lit only for a very brief period of time. https://daringfireball.net/2019/02/on_covering_webcams reply nine_k 13 hours agorootparentThat's backwards. The LED should be connected to camera's power, or maybe camera's \"enable\" signal. It should not be operable via any firmware in any way. The led also has to be connected through a one-shot trigger (a transistor + a capacitor) so that it would light up, say, for at least 500 ms no matter how short the input pulse is. This would prevent making single shots hard to notice. Doing that, of course, would incur a few cents more in BOM, and quite a bit more in being paranoid, well, I mean, customer-centric. reply kazinator 13 minutes agorootparentEven if the LED were controlled by hardware, merely that you can reprogram the camera firmware on this Thinkpad is troubling. Malicious things can be done without the ability to turn off the LED during recording. Like capture images during legitimate recording, or start recording with the LED on banking on the user not noticing. Firmware programming should require physical access, like temporarily installing a jumper, or pushing some button on the circuit board or something. (I don't want to suggest signed images, because that's yet another face of the devil). reply Thorrez 14 minutes agorootparentprevFrom this comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42260379 it sounds like Apple is doing something similar to what you suggest. reply jdblair 12 hours agorootparentprevor, you can have a physical switch, like the Framework. that also hits your BOM but its not complex! reply alwyn 3 hours agorootparentMy previous HP Envy x360 had such a switch on the side of the laptop that would electronically disconnect the webcam; it would completely disconnect according to the system. Enabling it would show a new device being connected in `dmesg`. Not a great laptop otherwise, but that was pretty good! reply oneshtein 11 hours agorootparentprevYou can buy/print and stick a physical «webcam cover»[1] manually on your notebook or phone. My current notebook, manufactured in 2023, has very thin bar on top of screen with camera, so I need a thin, U-like attachment for the switch, which is hard to find.

The camera may see me staring into the screen, woo hoo. The microphones will hear everything I discuss, incl. confidential information. There is no physical microphone cover there, is it ? reply lukan 9 hours agorootparentSound is usually more sensitive, yes. But even if there is a physical switch on the laptop, only very exotic smartphones have them. Also, loudspeakers can act as microphones, too. In other words, paranoia gets exhausting in modern times. (And my smartphone has a replacable battery for that reason to at least sometimes enjoy potentially surveillance free time) reply sharpshadow 38 minutes agorootparentI have an old iPhone 7 which has an audio IC issue and the microphone is physically disconnected. Calls don’t work, video records without sound etc. need to connect an external microphone to have one. Apart from the inconvenience it was somehow liberating knowing there is no microphone physically active. reply MarcusE1W 8 hours agorootparentprevMy Pinephone has a switch for the microphone and also my Pinebook Pro laptop. But I also would agree that this is exotic hardware. reply whatevaa 5 hours agorootparentWell i have Pinebook Pro and it's pretty much abandonware, pine doesn't do any software and OSS lacks maintainers, nobody want's it, e-waste laptop. Take it as you will. reply megous 20 minutes agorootparentYeah, that's nonsense. Pinebook Pro is well supported by Linux kernel and you can thus put any aarch64 Linux distro on it. And it's been this way for the last 3-4 years at the very least. I've been using it daily for 3 years for watching movies and main notebook while traveling. It's not at all abandonware or e-waste. lukan 8 hours agorootparentprev\"But I also would agree that this is exotic hardware.\" No shit. How is the current state btw? I suppose still not ready to be a daily driver to replace my normal phone? reply ri0t 6 hours agorootparent> I suppose still not ready to be a daily driver to replace my normal phone? I'd say that depends on your definition of daily driver and/or how much compromises you're willing to take. I occasionally see members at my larger hackerspace running around with those or other seemingly \"unfit\" hardware and not complain too much about it ;) reply jdblair 10 hours agorootparentprevThe Framework has a physical microphone switch next to the camera switch. reply klausa 10 hours agorootparentprevModern (2019-ish? forwards?) MacBooks have physical disconnect for microphones when the lid is shut. reply jack_arleth 10 hours agorootparentFramework laptops have the same solution. reply michaelt 6 hours agorootparentprevThe camera privacy issue arises because teenagers and college kids often have their computer in their bedroom. So a webcam hack that lets them watch my 16 year old daughter study would also let them watch her sleeping, getting dressed, and making out with her boyfriend. reply pmontra 4 hours agorootparentIt's not only a teenager or college kid issue. I've seen adults with a computer in their bedroom because it's a kind of private space where they don't expect anybody to inadvertently bump into it. My laptop is in my bedroom in winter, right now, because it's one of the smallest rooms and I can heat it easily. I use it in other parts of the house in the other seasons. I do have a sliding cover on the camera. I bought it years ago. The main issue is the microphone. reply dghughes 4 hours agorootparentprevAnd the true or not Google or other apps listening then you see ads based on that conversation. I think it's true since far too many times obscure things I've spoken about appear in ads soon after the conversation. So yes I'd say a mic blocking feature you can confirm is working, blocking, is needed. reply karolist 3 hours agorootparentRecommendation engines work on vast amounts of data they have on you and whatever made you speak about thing X was likely preceded by your internet activity which is not very unique as a precursor to speaking about X. In other words, if other people do Y on the internet and then end up doing stuff related to X, the recommendation engine will show you X just because you also did Y. The other explanation is one of your contacts who were part of the conversation did things that either directly related to thing X, which you spoke about, or something the algorithm see other people do that relates to X, and you got shown ads based on your affiliation to this person. I've also worked at FAANG and never seen proof to such claims anywhere in the code, and with the amount of people working there who care about these issues deeply I'd expect this to leak by now, if this happens but is siloed... reply ch4s3 3 hours agorootparentprev> I think it's true since far too many times obscure things I've spoken about appear in ads soon after the conversation People have been making claims like this since at least the early 90s, about TV then, and no one ever credibly claims to have worked on something like this. I've worked with purchased ad data and I've never seen this data or anything that implies that it exists. It seems far more likely that its a trick of memory. You ignore most ads you see, but you remember ones that relate to odd topics that interest you. reply wsintra2022 3 hours agorootparentI agree with this sentiment, people talk about x product then realise they are seeing ads for x product. Most likely the ads were there first and the people only start talking about it cause the ads have been working. reply ch4s3 2 hours agorootparentThat’s pretty much it. You see an obscure ad without realizing it and have a related conversation later. Then when you see the ad again and make note of it, it feels strange. reply gravitronic 3 hours agorootparentprevReminds me of the chrome bug I filed years ago that is still unfixed. An extension with access to all browsing tabs can open a hidden iframe to a website that commonly would have mic and camera permission (like hangouts.google.com), and then inject its own JavaScript into that hidden iframe to capture mic or camera. For this to work hangouts.google.com had to not include the HTTP header to block iframing but thankfully if you make up a URL the 404 page served on that domain does not include that http header. reply Qem 2 hours agorootparentprevJust a personal anecdote: I don't have a dog, but my grandma has two. Once, while visiting her, the dogs were barking a lot. Almost immediately I started receiving ads for dog food in my cellphone. reply sandywaffles 2 hours agorootparentIt is more likely your GPS placed you in the vicinity (regularly?) with another AD ID that regularly searches for, purchases, or visits dog centric locations. It's also entirely possible that the other AD ID's (your grandma) dog food schedule is predictable and you happen to be visiting within a time frame of dog food purchases. reply Qem 2 hours agorootparentMy grandma never owned a cellphone, only an old landline. And she buys dogfood in the neighborhood mom & pop store. reply xvector 47 minutes agorootparentWell, we know for a fact it wasn't your mic being recorded. Maybe you walked by WiFi networks where people purchase dog food. reply pmoriarty 2 hours agorootparentprev\"Am I the only one that is not worried at all about the camera and super concerned about microphones ?

Pointless against me as an adult. reply ddalex 9 hours agorootparentprevThis would've been blackmail 20 years ago.... nowadays it's just \"of course you know, I shared my OF likes publicly\", will not even raise an eyebrow; or perhaps I'm living in too bohemian society circles reply spacemanspiff01 9 hours agorootparentprevI honestly like the physical switch on the framework, which disconnects the microphone/webcam fully. reply _joel 3 hours agorootparentprevDisable it all in the BIOS? reply djtango 10 hours agorootparentprevYes I really wish we could have a physical switch for device mic reply ashoeafoot 9 hours agorootparentprevYour speakers are a microphone .. reply benj111 7 hours agorootparentI seem to recall reading somewhere that 'everything' is a thermometer, on the basis that many things behave differently at different temperatures. You can also use an LED as a light sensor. and I also came across a YT vid of a console that used a piezo electric speaker for motion sensing. I wonder if you could use a track pad to pick up sound. reply Sporktacular 7 hours agorootparentprevYeah, but they aren't an input device with an amp wired in the right direction and an A/D converter to read it out. reply dfox 4 hours agorootparentIf there is a discrete PA in the speaker path, then not. But I would not be that surprised if there is a single chip codec + PA combination that can conect an internal ADC to pins that are primarily meant as PA outputs of the integrated PA. reply ykonstant 9 hours agorootparentprevAs someone who often speaks gibberish to myself due to ptsd, if someone recorded me in my room they could convince anyone I am utterly insane, beyond any hope. It is a great way to blackmail people with coprolalia or other verbal tics. And yeah, if they had access to my webcam, they would just see a guy staring into the screen or walking back and forth in the room. reply chmod775 3 hours agorootparentEh, random utterances are more common than you think. Especially amongst older people. Most will know at least a couple family members who tend to mutter random things to themselves. Nobody who is themselves sane is going to judge another for random crap they say when they think themselves alone. reply volkl48 3 hours agorootparentprevJust to note: Apple will refuse to cover any screen damage under warranty if one of these sorts of things was in use. I would not be surprised if the same is true for some other manufacturers, too, but I can only speak definitely to Mac. The issue is that lids close too closely + tightly now, and so anything more than a piece of tape winds up focusing all the pressure applied to the closed lid on that one spot in the glass, since the cover winds up holding the display slightly off the base of the laptop when in the closed position. reply micahdeath 2 hours agorootparenti use a piece of tin foil - tiny peanut butter cup wrappy - stays in place lovely reply moregrist 2 hours agorootparentprevI find that the sticky part of a post-it works very well for this. Sometimes you have to clean the adhesive part off with 70% IPA, but not too often. Not as pretty as a custom cover but cost-effective and can generally be done in under a minute with common office supplies (post-it + scissors) which has its own advantages. reply codedokode 3 hours agorootparentprevMy laptop has built-in physical camera cover, and it doesn't cost even as much as a half MacBook. reply SiVal 11 hours agorootparentprevWould a bit of Post-It Note (for minimal adhesion) damage the screen coating if left on most of the time? Would even that much thickness stress the screen when opened and closed thousands of times? Is there a better (self-service) material? reply moregrist 2 hours agorootparentI’ve used one for years on various MacBooks and it’s very effective. The paper is very thin so it causes no real mechanical stress and also opaque, so all the camera sees is a field the color of that paper. There’s been no damage to the screen from the adhesive although occasionally I’ve had to clean the residual adhesive with 70% IPA, but nothing worse than the typical grime that most laptop monitors pick up. reply pcblues 8 hours agorootparentprevPlastic slide covers that stick on are pretty cheap if your laptop doesn't already have one. I also think that the open microphone issue is a greater problem, especially with the current ability of speech-to-text, but what you utter may not be as important as being seen \"doing a Toobin\" during an online meeting. YMMV :) (I won't expand that acronym!) reply cuu508 8 hours agorootparentprev> Would a bit of Post-It Note (for minimal adhesion) damage the screen coating if left on most of the time? Possible, I have one IPS monitor with a spot on screen where the color is pale. I had a post-it note there and I guess something bad happened when I tore it off. reply grvbck 6 hours agorootparentI used electrical pvc tape for many years on my macbooks, no damage but I got tired of them leaving glue residue. Switched to post-its about 10 years ago, works perfectly. I've never tried them on a matte or coated screen though. reply ARandomerDude 3 hours agorootparentI use painter’s tape for a similar effect. reply goodpoint 9 hours agorootparentprevThis is the right solution. And a hardware switch cost is completely negligible in a $1000 laptop. reply xandrius 5 hours agorootparentBut the margins? reply GTP 4 hours agorootparentCustomers wouldn't care to pay a dollar more on a thousand plus device. This would likely increase the margin instead of shrinking it. reply throw646577 11 hours agorootparentprev> The LED should be connected to camera's power, or maybe camera's \"enable\" signal. Wiring it in like this is suboptimal because this way you might never see the LED light up if a still photo is surreptitiously captured. This has been a problem before: illicit captures that happen so quickly the LED never has time to warm up. Controlling the LED programmatically from isolated hardware like this is better, because then you can light up the LED for long enough to make it clear to the user something actually happened. Which is what Apple does -- three seconds. reply nine_k 11 hours agorootparentPray read the third paragraph of my reply :) It specifically mentions a way to make the LED be lit for long enough. reply throw646577 10 hours agorootparentWhich is not an adjustable method -- without changing the hardware design later in production to just tweak a delay -- and surely causes the LED to slowly fade out? reply GTP 4 hours agorootparentWould it be so important to be able to tweak the duration later? And why would it be a problem to have the LED fade out? reply atoav 10 hours agorootparentprevThe mentioned one shot circuit does precisely that, in hardware for less cost and 100% non-overridable. The only time that isolated hardware approach is benefitial in terms of costs would be when you already have to have that microcontroller there for different reasons and the cost difference we are talking about is in the order of a few cents max. reply throw646577 10 hours agorootparentWell there is a microcontroller there, isn't there? For the camera. reply atoav 9 hours agorootparentBut is it isolated? If you can update its Firmware from the computer it isn't. reply rightbyte 11 hours agorootparentprevYou can design a simple circuit such that both long and short pulses light up the led for atleast 500ms. There is no tradeoff needed to be made at all. reply kirkules 11 hours agorootparentprevI mean can't you just have the input signal to the light be a disjunction of signals? So it's on if the camera is on OR if some programmatic signal says turn it on? I don't see why they should be mutually exclusive reply beAbU 10 hours agorootparentprevYet some laptops (Thinkpads ironically) come with a built in camera shutter that's entirely mechanical. reply codedokode 3 hours agorootparentAnd they often cost less than a MacBook for which you need to buy an external shutter. reply ComputerGuru 3 hours agorootparentprevCameras are now always on, to reduce the latency to taking a picture or scrubbing video feed. You’d need to wire the led to something tied to the data lines, perhaps. reply vanilla_nut 3 hours agorootparentSource? This seems extremely unlikely to me, running a camera all the time consumes a fair bit of energy and they don't take long to turn on. Unless that's because they're always on? Regardless, that's a pretty strong claim. I'd love to learn more if you have a link that can back you up! reply ewoodrich 33 minutes agorootparentprevMy M1 Macbook has some pretty extreme latency going from opening Photobooth black screen -> displayed image. Roughly five seconds to useable image. :00 Photobooth window open :03 Camera LED lights up :05 First image displayed reply gtirloni 3 hours agorootparentprevAny links you could share abouy someone confirming this? reply aftbit 21 hours agorootparentprev>The actual firmware is indeed flashable, but the part is not a generic part and there are mechanisms in place to verify the image being flashed. That might make it harder to develop a hack, but one would hope that if the hardware team tied the LED to a hardware signal, it would not matter if the firmware were reflashed. reply varenc 21 hours agorootparentI believe that it’s not literally hardwired in the sense that powering up the camera also powers up the camera LED, and instead this relies on logic in the hopefully un-flashable camera+LED firmware. Someone correct me if I’m wrong. You need some logic to enforce things like a minimum LED duration that keeps the LED on for a couple seconds even if the camera is only used to capture one brief frame. I have a script that takes periodic screenshots of my face for fun and I can confirm the LED stays on even if the camera only captures one quick frame. reply MaxikCZ 21 hours agorootparentA capacitor can hold enough charge to power led for noticable amount of time even if powered for a brief moment, no logic needed reply squarefoot 19 hours agorootparentI don't think they would waste a high value capacitor just to keep a led lit for longer, also a led directly lit by a capacitor would be noticeable by slowly dimming when the capacitor discharges. It's more likely that the signal driving the led comes out of a monostable implemented in code: pin_on() drives the led on; pin_off() waits n secs then drives the led off. reply altairprime 16 hours agorootparentThis is Apple, so that assertion isn’t guaranteed valid like it would be for non-enterprise HP or Lenovo. They absolutely would invest in a capacitor if that’s what it takes, as they are maximally focused on camera privacy concerns and have made a point of that in their security marketing over time; or else they wouldn’t be allowing hardware security engineers to brag about it, much less talk publicly about it, at all. EDIT: It’s not just a capacitor, it’s a full custom chip, that can’t be software-modified, that keeps the light on for 3 seconds. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42260379 reply HeyLaughingBoy 15 hours agorootparentprevLogic on an already existing ASIC is going to be cheaper than a capacitor. reply MrDrMcCoy 11 hours agorootparentThis is counter-intuitive enough to warrant further explanation. reply ale42 7 hours agorootparentIf you are designing an ASIC for the camera, you can include all the required logic gates to control the LED for a cost that is close to zero. It wouldn't impact the production cost of the ASIC, whereas a capacitor is an additional item in the BOM (and to be charged it requires current, more than the LED, so the driver in the IC must be bigger). reply RA2lover 21 hours agorootparentprevThe trick is to keep using the camera until that capacitor is discharged. I'm pretty sure most cameras can run at voltages below a LED's forward voltage nowadays. reply axoltl 20 hours agorootparentprevI happen to have some first-hand knowledge around the subject! In 2014 someone did a talk[0] on disabling the camera on some older Macbooks. It was fairly trivial, basically just reflashing the firmware that controlled the LED. I worked on the security team at Apple at the time and in response to this I attempted to do the same for more modern Macbooks. I won't go into the results but the decision was made to re-architect how the LED is turned on. I was the security architect for the feature. A custom PMIC for what's known as the forehead board was designed that has a voltage source that is ALWAYS on as long as the camera sensor has power at all. It also incorporates a hard (as in, tie-cells) lower limit for PWM duty cycle for the camera LED so you can't PWM an LED down to make it hard to see. (PWM is required because LED brightness is somewhat variable between runs, so they're calibrated to always have uniform brightness.) On top of this the PMIC has a counter that enforces a minimum on-time for the LED voltage regulator. I believe it was configured to force the LED to stay on for 3 seconds. This PMIC is powered from the system rail, and no system rail means no power to the main SoC/processor so it's impossible to cut the 3 seconds short by yoinking the power to the entire forehead board. tl;dr On Macbooks made after 2014, no firmware is involved whatsoever to enforce that the LED comes on when frames could be captured, and no firmware is involved in enforcing the LED stay on for 3 seconds after a single frame is captured. 0: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurit... reply ohhnoodont 17 hours agorootparentThere seems to be widespread anxiety regarding cameras, but hardly anyone ever talks about microphones. Are conversations not much more privileged information than potentially seeing someone in their underwear? reply jamesmotherway 16 hours agorootparent\"All Apple silicon-based Mac notebooks and Intel-based Mac notebooks with the Apple T2 Security Chip feature a hardware disconnect that disables the microphone whenever the lid is closed. On all 13-inch MacBook Pro and MacBook Air notebooks with the T2 chip, all MacBook notebooks with a T2 chip from 2019 or later, and Mac notebooks with Apple silicon, this disconnect is implemented in hardware alone.\" [1] [1] https://support.apple.com/guide/security/hardware-microphone... reply KennyBlanken 15 hours agorootparentThat's what they said about the first gen Facetime cameras. \"oooh don't worry, it's controlled in hardware!\" We have no way of verifying that anything they said in that document is true. reply jamesmotherway 2 hours agorootparentI'm inclined to believe it. If someone managed to prove Apple's lying about it, there would be serious reputational (and other) risks to their business. I also can't imagine how they would benefit from such a fabrication. That said, I still use \"Nanoblock\" webcam covers and monitor for when either the camera or microphone are activated. reply kimixa 13 hours agorootparentprevIt's clear Apple define \"Hardware\" as \"Not using the main CPU\". They've pretty much admitted it's firmware based, otherwise the T2 chip simply wouldn't be involved to be mentioned. reply dfox 3 hours agorootparentIt is implemented in dedicated small CPLD that cannot be flashed by any software means. My understanding of relation to T2/SEP is that this CPLD serves as a kind of \"IO expander\" for T2/SEP which also hardwires logic like this. reply swiftcoder 11 hours agorootparentprevThe T2 chip is mentioned in the quoted passage as an indicator of the architecture version, not necessarily an indicator that the T2 chip is directly involved reply ohhnoodont 15 hours agorootparentprevObviously the camera is also 'disabled' when the lid is closed regardless of the controlling circuitry. So while that's a good feature, it's not relevant. reply qingcharles 16 hours agorootparentprevYes, photos of naked people are used to extort them (usually into just paying the holder to delete them). https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42261730 reply ohhnoodont 15 hours agorootparentThis raises a different but related question. In what world should a victim of a crime be extorted for doing innocent things in their home. If a peeping tom took a photo though a window, could that be used to extort someone? When people are extorted for these kinds of things it's usually catfishing that leads to sexual acts being recorded. That's not related to cybersecurity. reply pfix 11 hours agorootparentFear of harrasment. You don't want your coworkers see you naked, do you? edit: s/baked/naked/ :D reply sneak 11 hours agorootparentprevThey are, but people aren’t scared of those because they can’t see them staring at them. reply Nursie 16 hours agorootparentprevDepends what your threat model is? Nobody but Abby and Ben care if Ben is caught admitting he cheated on Abby. But naked images of Abby can head off into the ether and be propagated more or less forever, turn up on hate sites, be detrimental to careers etc. If your threat model is leaking company secrets then sure, microphone bad, as is anything having access to any hardware on your machine. So sure, maybe people ought to be more concerned about microphones as well, rather than instead. reply ohhnoodont 15 hours agorootparentMy point is that the threat model is backwards. The threat associated with a camera is the least severe compared to anything else a malicious person could do with access to your computer. Recored conversations, chats and email, browsing history, etc are all much more likely to result in harm if leaked than a recording of you innocently in your home. > Nobody but Abby and Ben care if Ben is caught admitting he cheated on Abby. That destroys families, standing within a community, and very often careers. reply Nursie 13 hours agorootparentI don't think it is backwards, personally. The threat of public humiliation, and the capability for someone to spy on what you do in your own home, is worse with the camera. > chats and email, browsing history, etc are all much more likely to result in harm if leaked than a recording of you innocently in your home. This is far less of an intrusion for most people than recording what they are actually doing in their own home IRL. People know that information can be hacked, they don't expect and react quite differently to someone actually watching them. > That destroys families, standing within a community, and very often careers. Yes, but it doesn't stay on the internet forever in quite the same way. Now I get to some extent what you're saying - aren't the consequences potentially worse from other forms of information leak? Maybe. It depends on how you weight those consequences. I'd put (for example) financial loss due to fraud enabled by hacking my accounts as far less important than someone spying on me in my own home. Even if they didn't use that to then extort me, and were using the footage for ... uh ... personal enjoyment. I think a lot of people will feel the same way. The material consequences might be lesser, but the psychological ones not so much. Not everything is valued in dollars. reply ohhnoodont 13 hours agorootparentI think we may just be bumping into cultural differences here. I grew up in a household were being naked around family members was common. I spend time in clothing-optional spaces. I rarely draw the blinds on my windows, etc. I'm not concerned with what other people think in this way and such images could never be used to extort me. Consider the case of Germany - people there are extremely concerned about their privacy and data protection. At the same time public nudity is an entrenched cultural norm. It's also known that people are not very good at assessing risk. People are more word about dying at the hands of a serial killer than they are of dying in a car crash or slipping in the shower. I feel you're underplaying the psychological harm of having all of your data crawled through by a creep (that would include all of your photos, sites visited, messages sent, everything). All I can really say is that if someone gained access to my machine, the camera would be the least of my concerns. That's true in nearly every context (psychological, financial, physical, etc). reply rocqua 11 hours agorootparentEmpirically, most low level extortion does seem to be about leaking video. I would see a threat model based on 'criminal wants to extort me for money'. As more reasonable than 'creep wants to look through my computer for creeping'. And it seems like extortion focusses on video, so that is the bigger threat. Even if it is less invasive. I presume the reason behind this is that video is much more likely to be re-shared. Sending bob a zip of someone's inbox is unlikely to be opened, and even less likely to be shared with strangers. But send bob a video of Alice, and he might open it. Heck, he might not know what the video is until he opens it. So even if he is decent, he might still see it. And if he is less decent and shares it, strangers are much more likely to actually view it. reply Thorrez 5 minutes agorootparentI think extortion in the form of \"I've encrypted your data, pay to get it back\" is much more common. Ransomware. It's scalable, automatable. Extortion of video is harder to automate. Nursie 11 hours agorootparentprevI think, though am prepared to be wrong, that you'll probably find yourself in the minority there. It's not just about nudity and extortion, but someone having access to watch you, whenever they feel like, in your safe space. That sense of violation that people also feel when (for instance) they have been the victim of burglary - the missing stuff is often secondary to the ruined sense of security. There's a vast difference between leaving your curtains open and having someone spying on you from inside your own home. Is it rational to put this above other concerns? That's a whole different debate and not one I'm particularly interested in. But it explains why people are concerned about cameras over 'mere' data intrusion. reply hunter-gatherer 16 hours agorootparentprevI'm not arguing a point here, but I'm curious what the actual number of instances exist where someone is naked or in some other extortionate way (accidently of course) potentially exposed from the position of their webcam.

I may be the oddball here, but that 3 second duration does not comfort me. The only time I would notice it is if I am sitting in front of the computer.

That LED is sort of the last line of defense if all others have failed, like: The exploit mitigations to prevent you from getting an initial foothold. The sandboxing preventing you from going from a low-privileged to a privileged process. The permissions model preventing unauthorized camera access in the first place. The kernel hardening to stop you from poking at the co-processor registers. etc. etc. If all those things have failed, the last thing to at least give you a chance of noticing the compromise, that's that LED.

I wish some other large companies took privacy that seriously. reply Mistletoe 20 hours agorootparentprevThank you for doing this. reply jorvi 16 hours agorootparentprevI assume you're not longer working on it, but why not just wire it so that: - The LED is in parallel, but with the sensor voltage supply, not the chip - Camera sensor idle voltage = low voltage for the LED (be it with stepping if needed) - Camera sensor active voltage = high voltage for the LED (again, stepping if needed) - little capacitor that holds enough charge to run the LED for ~3 seconds after camera goes back to idle voltage. Good luck hacking that :) reply axoltl 14 hours agorootparentThat's basically how this works, but manufacturing electronics at a massive scale requires some more flexibility. For example, capacitors have a pretty large tolerance (sometimes +/- 20%) and LEDs have quite a bit of variety in what voltages they'll work at. So for some people the LEDs might last 3 seconds, for some they might last 5s. Using a capacitor also means the LEDs will fade slowly instead of just turning off sharply. If the LEDs come from a different supplier one day, who is going to make sure they're still within the spec for staying on for 3 seconds? (And yes, I have long since parted ways with Apple) Edit: And to add on: That capacitor needs time to charge so now the LED doesn't actually come on when the sensor comes on, it's slightly delayed! reply jorvi 5 hours agorootparentThank you for the clarifications. Armchair (well, workbench) engineering strikes again haha! reply shiroiushi 11 hours agorootparentprevYou can't drive an LED that way in production electronics: you need to use an LED driver circuit of some kind to ensure the LED has constant current, and also to protect against failure modes. Also, a capacitor large enough to power a daylight-visible LED for 3 seconds is not as \"little\" as you're thinking; there's likely not enough space in a laptop lid for one of those. A driver circuit would be smaller and thinner. Agreed, however, that the LED should be controlled by the camera sensor idle vs. active voltage. reply KennyBlanken 15 hours agorootparentprevI've seen a million people parroting \"oh now apple fixed it!\" and not a single person who has actually verified/proved it.

You'll pardon us all if we don't really believe you, because a)there's no way for any of us to verify this and b)Apple lied about it before, claiming the LED was hard-wired in blah blah same thing, except it turned out it was software controlled by the camera module's firmware. reply axoltl 14 hours agorootparentI'd love for a third party to verify the claim! I'm just giving you an overview of the work that went into making this a thing, knowing full well you have absolutely no reason to trust me. The LED being \"hard-wired\" is a tricky statement to make, and I actually wasn't aware Apple has publicly ever made a statement to that effect. What I can say is that relying on the dedicated LED or \"sensor array active\" signal some camera sensors provide, while technically hard-wired in the sense there is no firmware driving it, is not foolproof. reply trogdor 15 hours agorootparentprev> Apple lied about it before, claiming the LED was hard-wired in blah blah same thing, except it turned out it was software controlled by the camera module's firmware. Source? reply aftbit 21 hours agorootparentprevSee then it's not hardwired at all. It is equally vulnerable to a reflash. Apple just did hardware security (i.e. signed firmware) better and also are relying on security through obscurity (its not a publicly available part). reply ndiddy 21 hours agorootparentprevThe context from the article the parent comment linked is that Mac webcams made prior to 2008 both had the camera LED controlled in firmware and didn't verify the camera firmware blob when it was downloaded into the camera's RAM. The quote you're replying to simply says that Apple solved these security issues by tying the LED to a hardware signal AND verifying the camera firmware blob. The result is still that there's no way to turn on the webcam without making the LED light up. reply danielheath 20 hours agorootparentprevAFAIK iOS devices use a tiny firmware on the camera and a larger one on the secure enclave chip. If you successfully compromise the host OS and also the secure enclave firmware, that might be enough to let you turn on the camera (without vsync) and reconstruct the correct image via later analysis... but at that point you have committed tens of millions to the hack (so you'd better not overuse it or it'll get noticed & patched). reply pclmulqdq 19 hours agorootparentprevMany complex chips have GPIO signals rather than hardwired outputs.

As indicated by this thread, software experts (rightly) don't trust software by itself enough. It's by the same rationale software people are proponents of electronic voting machines printing physical, verifiable paper copies of votes. My Latitude 7440 has a physical slider switch that covers the camera, in addition to turning it off in a software-detectable way (it shows \"no signal\" and not just a black screen once the slider is about 50% covering the lens). My only criticism of this is that it's subtle and at a glance hard to tell the difference between open and closed, but I guess you just get used to the slider being to the right. I was just testing and the white LED comes on when I open something that wants to use the camera, even when the cover is closed. This seems like a useful way to detect something (eg malware) trying to use the camera, and is a good reason to not bluntly cut power to the entire camera module. reply shiroiushi 11 hours agorootparentprevDell should go back to the basic design of the Latitude E6400, but with modern electronics and screen of course, and drop the optical drive.

Provided you can do this fast enough, an indicator LED is rendered worthless. So you'd need to make the indicator LED staggered, to stay lit for a minimum amount of time. There's also the scenario where the LED or the connections to it simply fail. If the circuit doesn't account for that, then boom, now your camera can function without the light being on. Can't think of any other pitfalls, but I'm sure they exist. Personally, I'll just continue using the privacy shutter, as annoying as that is. Too bad it doesn't do anything about the mic input. reply axoltl 20 hours agorootparentI worked on this feature for Apple Macbooks around 2014 as the security architect. All Macbooks since then have a camera indicator LED that is (barring the physical removal of the LED) always on at least 3 seconds. This feature is implemented in gates in the power management controller on the camera sub-board. There's a LOT of pitfalls still (what if you manage to pull power from the entire camera sub-assembly?), this was a fun one to threat-model. reply TZubiri 22 hours agorootparentprevA minimum light duration seems pretty trivial to physically engineer. For one the energy to take a picture is probably enough to power a light for a noticeable amount of time. And if it isn't, a capacitor that absorbs energy and only allows energy through once it's full would allow the light to remain on for a couple of seconds after power subsides. reply perching_aix 22 hours agorootparentWasn't arguing that it's difficult, just that it's needed (and that I'm not expecting it to be done in practice.

So you can run power _through_ them. Power Supply -> LED -> Camera. reply xxs 16 hours agorootparentWhile true, the amount of power would be too low, LEDs also have quite high forward voltage (~3V for blue ones) and they are current driven devices. That suggestion would require pass all the current through the LEDs. LEDs don't like to be reverse biased either. Overall, it's a rather appalling idea. On top of the fact that LEDs can fail short. More also you'd want a hold up time for the light (few seconds at least), as taking pictures would flash them for 1/60 of a second or so. reply akira2501 14 hours agorootparentThey have high forward voltage /drop/ which is a useful property. You drive them with constant current for constant brightness and improved lifespan which is most pertinent for LED light bulb replacements than it is for a simple signal status light. Fixed delay before standby isn't hard to enforce either. Even so this whole attack vector isn't solved with this. How long should the light stay on for after the camera is put in standby before a user considers it a nuisance? 5 seconds? So if I turn my back for longer than that I'm out of luck anyways. The anti-TSO means would be a hardware serial counter with a display on the camera. Each time the camera is activated the number is incremented effectively forming a camera odometer. Then if my previous value does not match the current value I know it's been activated outside of my control. reply xxs 10 hours agorootparentI meant the forward voltage (also not a constant one) in series with the actual load. reply perching_aix 11 hours agorootparentprevAs long as you remember the previous number correctly at least... :) reply m463 19 hours agoparentprevThere was a school district that took pictures of the kids at home.

There's no standard that I know, that, like \"Secure EFI / Boot\" (or whatever exact name it is), locks the API of periphery firmware and that would be able to statically verify that said API doesn't allow for unintended exploits.

That convinced me originally I think, good old days! I'd almost forgotten about it. The way you phrased it, it sounded like 50% OS concern to me. But if cam & LED rly share a power supply, and the LED is always on without any external switch, Good then! reply axoltl 19 hours agorootparentI was not very popular with the camera firmware folks for a while. They had to re-architect a bunch of things as they used to occasionally power on the camera logic without powering the sensor array to get information out of the built-in OTP. Because the LED now came on whenever the camera was powered they had to defer all that logic. reply ProfessorLayton 19 hours agorootparentWhat does OTP stand for in this case? The camera PROM?? reply axoltl 19 hours agorootparentApologies. OTP is One-Time-Programmable. The physical implementation of this varies, in this specific case it was efuses (anti-fuse, actually).

In this case I was referring to false positives to the user. This would mean we can't update the firmware without causing the user some paranoia. Also.

It's usually part-automated using the typical approaches (rules and AI), and part-manual (via a dedicated SOC team). There are actual compromises caught this way too, it's not (entirely) just for show.

I did not verify newer generations of the X1 Carbon. Lenovo put a little physical switch—they call it \"ThinkShutter\"—that serves to physically obstruct the webcam lens to prevent recording. It's supposed to have only two positions: lens obstructed or not. But if the user accidentally slides it halfway, you can still record video with the lens unobstructed but somehow the webcam LED turns off. It's because the ThinkShutter actually moves 2 pieces of plastic: 1 to cover the lens, 1 to cover the LED. But the piece covering the LED blocks it first, before the other piece of plastic blocks the lens. I discovered this accidentally yesterday while toying with a X1 Carbon... I am reporting it to Lenovo. reply wmlhwl 20 hours agoparentIn Yoga C740 it only blocks the shutter. Covering the LED doesn't make sense to me reply mrb 11 hours agorootparentI suppose covering the LED is a less expensive way to provide the same user experience as hooking an electrical switch to the ThinkShutter to electrically turn",
    "originSummary": [
      "The repository offers tools to manipulate the webcam LED on a ThinkPad X230, illustrating how malware could potentially record video without LED notification.- The process involves reflashing the webcam firmware via USB, a technique that could be applied to various laptops, using scripts for firmware manipulation and LED control.- The webcam uses a Ricoh R5U8710 controller, and caution is advised as reflashing could damage the webcam; further insights are available in the \"Lights Out\" talk at POC 2024."
    ],
    "commentSummary": [
      "Malware has the capability to disable webcam LEDs and record video without user knowledge, as demonstrated on a ThinkPad X230.- Unlike MacBooks, which have hardwired LEDs to signal camera use, many other laptops lack this feature, raising privacy concerns.- To enhance security, experts recommend using physical covers or switches for webcams and microphones to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive information."

But the company, who is fairly popular, built out their own CDN via putting a bunch of nginx caching proxies on various Hetzner servers around the world.

This was true like 8 years ago, so maybe it has changed in the meantime. reply justinclift 4 hours agoparentSounds like a completely legitimate use though.

Inevitably, and unfortunately, someone decides to test the limits and the entire thing collapses. It reminds me of the Blockbuster \"No more late fees\" policy, which was a really good customer-friendly policy (speaking as someone who regularly returned rentals late) .. but then they were sued because an aspect of the policy had Blockbuster charging the cost of the rental to the customer if it wasn't returned in some period of time .. and because that charge looked like a 'late fee' they got sued.

GPU servers). They definitely don't seem to be a fan of loss leaders. I'm guessing somehow the traffic usage patterns of their USA customers was very different to their EU counterparts, or the cost of expanding network capacity was a lot higher than anticipated. It's a bit of a shock for sure but it seems this model is a big part of how they can maintain their slim margins. reply gnfargbl 2 hours agoparentI have no complaints at all about this model.

Here in India, the most common usage of it is to talk about telecom tariffs - mainly mobile, sometimes broadband. So it didn't even occur to me when reading the question that it might have anything to do with import tariffs, until I read some comments that misunderstood it that way. reply crazygringo 4 hours agoparentNot just mainly, but exclusively in my experience. (Import/export tariffs.) Until this thread, I have never encountered the term \"bar tariff\" for a list of drink prices, or \"energy tariff\" instead of rate. Those uses are simply not American English, and you would be misunderstood. Hetzner is a German company so I find myself wondering if this is a British usage, or a mistranslation of the German word \"tarif\" that should be \"rate\"? (A common mistranslation category known as \"false friends\".)

I’m trying to learn french but WTF is a ‘stroller’ or an ‘eggplant’ or even more frustrating are the ones where the word is almost the same in the UK as in France e.g ‘athlétique’ in French is ‘athletics’ in UK English but ‘track’ in US English. reply Symbiote 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's perfectly acceptable British English. 21 occurrences of \"tariff\" on one of British Gas' pages: https://www.britishgas.co.uk/energy/guides/off-peak-electric... (\"Your energy provider may offer time of use tariffs and cheaper night-time electricity rates.\") reply crazygringo 1 hour agorootparentGood to know, so it's an American vs. British thing. Thanks! Is there any further distinction between a \"tariff\" and a \"rate\" in British English? The example sentence you provide uses both, which makes me wonder if there's even more to the picture here. reply Symbiote 48 minutes agorootparentWithout checking, my feeling is a \"tariff\" is the whole contracted agreement, and a \"rate\" is a part of it. An EV electricity tariff might have a cheap night rate, and a more expensive day rate. Another tariff might be entirely variable rate (price changes every hour). Wiktionary defines a tariff as \"A schedule of rates, fees or prices.\" so I think my feeling is correct. reply hyperpape 3 hours agorootparentprevUnclear to me why you're being downvoted. I previously knew non-US people refer to rates as \"tariffs\", but I never heard it in a US context. It's not rare, it's just not a meaning of the word Americans typically know. reply fuzztester 3 hours agoparentprevhotels in India also use the word tariff for room rates, as in, see the tariff chart on the wall behind the reception desk. reply nozzlegear 1 hour agoparentprevI vaguely remember the word tariff being used to refer to fees or duties in a history class growing up, but as you've noted, it's not used this way in American English anymore. When I got the email from Hetzner this morning, I thought they were taking preemptive action against some tariff/sanction that Trump must have announced against EU data companies. reply thayne 1 hour agoparentprevAh, at first I wondered if this had something to do with Trump getting elected and his claims that he will implement massive (import) tariffs. reply tchbnl 7 hours agoprev>Until this change, customers who have used fewer resources have covered the costs, in a way, for other customers who have used much more resources.

Based on my experience, it's not easy to go over a terabyte of bandwidth for most web services. I doubt the majority of their customers will see any change in price. Sucks to pay a dollar per terabyte extra if you're downloading a petabyte per month through your hetzner VPN, but this sure beats raising everyone's prices because two or three companies decided to use Hetzner to build a CDN. This is why you can't offer unlimited anything, and why we can't have nice things. reply Volundr 3 hours agorootparent> They're only raising the prices of customers whose servers use more than a terabyte per month.

No they're not? AFAICT if I made a CPX11 using 0.1TB/mo, my price just went from 3.85 to 4.49. reply Aeolun 3 hours agoparentprevYeah, I really don't understand that part of the message. It'd make sense if they were lowering prices elsewhere, but now they just... raise them? I seriously don't see how that benefits _anyone_ except Hetzner. reply joepie91_ 50 minutes agorootparentWhat likely happened here is that they were raising prices due to increased costs for energy and various other costs, and if they hadn't made this change then they would have had to increase the price more, so relative to that it keeps it cheaper for low-traffic customers - and they just communicated this poorly. reply bakugo 6 hours agoparentprevYeah, the justification given makes absolutely no sense - you are paying more than before even if you stay under the new limit (which is 1/20th of the original!) They also use the word \"tariff\" several times without elaborating, as if the person who wrote the email doesn't know the actual meaning of the word. Seems like intentional deception to hide a standard \"we just want more money\" price raise. reply michaelt 5 hours agorootparent> as if the person who wrote the email doesn't know the actual meaning of the word. In my country, \"tariff\" is seen in several contexts: * A tax on imports, much in the news since the recent US election. * A pub or bar's price list is known as the \"bar tariff\" * Energy companies offer a selection of \"tariffs\" i.e. agreed contract rates for usage-based pricing. e.g. a 3-year-fixed-price tariff, a 100%-green-energy tariff, and so on. * The portion of a 'life' jail sentence which must be served, before a prisoner can be considered for parole. So I don't think it's incorrect to call a price list a \"tariff\", merely unusual. reply crazygringo 3 hours agorootparentRight, only the first usage is mainstream American English.

Other? reply thayne 1 hour agorootparentprev> So I don't think it's incorrect to call a price list a \"tariff\" I'm pretty sure it is in American English. That usage might be ok in British English, but for Americans that terminology is going to be confusing. Before today, I had never heard tariff used for anything other than import taxes. And since this applies to servers in the US, it would make sense not to use terminology that would be confusing to people in that country. reply michaelt 8 minutes agorootparentFrom what I can tell, in the US energy suppliers talking to one another use the term \"tariff\" like for example https://www.puc.texas.gov/industry/electric/rates/tdr.aspx Whereas when talking to consumers they seem to use terms like 'rate' and 'plan'. reply dagw 5 hours agorootparentprevas if the person who wrote the email doesn't know the actual meaning of the word. The word \"tariff\" has a few different meanings. I'd say they're using it correctly, just not with the same meaning that the word is commonly being used in the news right now. reply namibj 4 hours agorootparentprevIn Germany \"phone plan\" is written as the literal translation of \"mobile radio tariff\", as a bundle of price and terms.

Don't be so proud of your ignorance. reply nozzlegear 1 hour agorootparentIt's not used that way in American English at all; it almost borders on archaic.

Looks fine to me! reply carlosjobim 4 hours agorootparentprev\"We just want more money\" Is the standard operating procedure and the goal of all for-profit companies.

LB11 going from 20TB to 1TB for the same price is wild if you’d built a business on this platform. reply marcosdumay 4 hours agoparentIt's easy to never raise prices if you have 1000% markup. reply signatoremo 4 hours agorootparentThe point remains, if I was a customer who had planned my budget on the previously lower rates, this move’d be very disruptive. Herzner is an established player, not a startup, this either shows a lack of regards for customers, or that they aren’t very well run. reply andix 4 hours agoparentprevIf you use 20 TB each month the price will be 25.39€ instead of 5.39€.

If you’re running any sort of business and that isn’t ok I’m not sure what to tell you. reply rollcat 4 hours agorootparentprevThis. We got hit by a sudden change in a popular SaaS' pricing, from $10 to $75/mo - a 650% increase. We don't have a big margin, if a different provider did this sort of thing overnight, we could be instantly out of business. It's already difficult to build a competitive business even WITH the ability to outsource a class of problems to a SaaS. I've been a big fan of Hetzner for the last decade, and I understand and agree with their motivation for this change. However December 1st is effectively almost tomorrow, they could have easily given us a month's notice instead. reply christophilus 3 hours agorootparentYou have until Feb for your existing infra, so that seems fair to me. reply ragall 4 hours agorootparentprevYes,that is OK.

I thought this was to allow them to be more relaxed about the limit (5 per region) which is how they used to control fully free services that cost them. But an increase for sure - they did note the supply of free ARIN allocations was gone reply irunmyownemail 3 hours agorootparentIt's a matter of perspective, I don't do IPv6, when AWS decided to start charging for IPv4, I moved to Oracle Cloud. reply llm_nerd 4 hours agorootparentprevAWS also charges multiples the price to begin with. I mean, the \"scam\" of AWS has always been the absolutely outrageous network egress pricing. reply hobofan 4 hours agorootparentprevAWS raised the prices (/slashed the free tier) for Cognito literally last week[0], in a way that's quite similar to Hetzner. [0]: https://saasprices.net/blog/aws-price-rise reply glzone1 4 hours agorootparentprevRight - I’ve been on them since EC2 flat network / simple DB days and was trying to remember if I ever got an email like this. I know google has jacked rates (maps etc) and killed services (I used their first paas before it was basically abandoned) I have argued online with folks about their pricing - my point usually being as soon as you try to do Netflix or YouTube on the “Free” or unlimited or ultra low cost providers - you find out it’s a lie. My impression was hetzner had started null routing customers for “abuse” who used a lot. No idea if that’s true, but used to be the way the “unlimited” VPS providers did it. reply christina97 4 hours agorootparentprevIPv4 charge caused me to have to redesign some things and cull servers for some projects. reply irunmyownemail 3 hours agorootparentI decided to move to Oracle Cloud when they made that move. reply tekla 4 hours agorootparentprevI believe they have for very specific services, but never for things like EC2 or RDS. There are also some EC2 instance classes where upgrading instance types in the same \"size\" are more expensive, but that is very rare, but I dont believe AWS has ever pulled the rug out from under you. reply BeeOnRope 4 hours agorootparent> There are also some EC2 instance classes where upgrading instance types in the same \"size\" are more expensive An increase in price has been the rule rather than the exception for recent upgrades for vanilla instance types, e.g., c, r, m types in the newest generations (6 -> 7 for x86, 6 -> 7, or -> 8 for Arm types). The increases have been modest though, perhaps around 10%. You get additional CPU and sometimes minor increases in other resources on the newer types. reply Havoc 5 hours agoprevThe old allowance always struck me as unusually generous tbh reply dietr1ch 5 hours agoprevWeird, one would expect that in anything related to technology either prices go down, or performance goes up over time. reply tzs 2 hours agoparentThat's usually true if you see the actual costs of the thing. In the case of data transmission if you were using some data transmission system where you were charged per byte based on the operator's costs (possibly time dependent so the cost per byte might vary depending on the amount of traffic on the provider's network and on the varying real time prices of the networks they connect to) then you would indeed see prices going down over time and performance going up. Consumers, small businesses, and often even medium businesses generally hate that kind of pricing. They like fixed monthly bills. So providers offer that, setting the amount of data included in that price high enough that most customers won't ever come near it. That tends to result in the lower bandwidth users actually paying quite a bit more than they would if they had per byte pricing and the higher bandwidth (but not so high as to go over the included data and hit overage fees) paying less than they would under the per byte model. That can attract more high bandwidth customers and eventually the model of customer bandwidth usage that was used to set the price and bandwidth allowance is no longer accurate and gets adjusted. Note that this means that price you pay is not just a function of the underlying technology costs--it is also a function of how other people are using the service. Same thing happens even in non-technology areas. You probably wouldn't go into a fixed price \"all you can eat\" restaurant just to get a donut and cup of coffee. The fixed price is set to cover people getting full meals. And if a bunch of competitive eaters started coming in every day to do their training at that restaurant you can safely bet that the price is going to go up for everyone or there is going to be an asterisk added to \"all you can eat\" with a footnote that puts some sort of cap on it. reply johnisgood 5 hours agoparentprevTrue, so what gives? Just them wanting more money now that they got enough customers? They probably did some calculations and realized that damn, they could pocket more money so might as well try their luck. Like yeah, let us assume they have 10k customers: 7.05 * 10000 is 70500, 8.99 * 10000 is 89900, that is 19400 USD more for them, and that is just for one! reply HighGoldstein 5 hours agorootparentOr the cause is one step removed, for example the handful of giant companies that control all US internet infrastructure, versus the hundreds all over Europe. reply johnisgood 5 hours agorootparentYeah, so that probably means the count of users is higher than the previously assumed 10k. They can do it, so they will do it. reply machinekob 5 hours agoparentprevNot when there is a duopoly on one market (US) and hundreds of companies on other (EU). reply hiccuphippo 4 hours agorootparentThis case is for a EU company's offerings to the US. Why would they make themselves less competitive? reply anon7000 5 hours agorootparentprevHow is there a duopoly in the cloud market in the US? reply adventured 4 hours agorootparentIt's not accurate at all. There are far more high tier cloud offerings in the US than in Europe. Europe has nothing like AWS + Google + Azure + Oracle. Then you can add in a dozen mid tier companies like DigitalOcean. They also have nothing like Cloudflare and dozens of other large cloud services companies. Europe has a cloud so basic and primitive you'd think they were a developing economic region still struggling to grasp basic software development. reply LunaSea 3 hours agorootparentDo you know that AWS uses other companies data centers in many places in the EU? reply ragall 4 hours agorootparentprevYour ignorance must be blissful. reply jacooper 4 hours agorootparentprev> They also have nothing like Cloudflare and dozens of other large cloud services companies.

Being cheap and constantly cycling out servers introduces complexity to your system. Hetzner could also easily change their terms to close this loophole if it's an actual problem. reply qeternity 1 hour agorootparentYou can automate it with zero downtime on kubernetes. And since internal traffic is free, you just need to cycle the ingress servers. Pay for the cheapest instance, get 20TB of egress.

To a customer, it certainly feels like a bait and switch to sell a subscription product and once customers are embedded materially change the economic trade. reply jsnell 5 hours agoparentIt's the language barrier. The German word Tarif doesn't mean the same as the English word tariff. reply sokoloff 5 hours agorootparentIt's also used in that sense in English (in telecom/utilities, airlines, etc.), just that the political/taxation usage is more heavily covered, especially lately. reply rob74 5 hours agorootparentprevWell actually one meaning of the English word tariff is the same as the German meaning, although it's not as widely used. To quote Wiktionary: > tariff (plural tariffs) 1. A system of government-imposed duties levied on imported or exported goods; a list of such duties, or the duties themselves. 2. A schedule of rates, fees or prices. 3. (British) A sentence determined according to a scale of standard penalties for certain categories of crime. ...so Hetzner's usage of the word is technically correct™, even though native speakers might not use it in this context. reply tyrfing 3 hours agorootparentIt's closer to industry jargon at this point in American English. Search for LTL tariffs, for example, and you'll find a very long list of trucking companies publishing their fees and terms as tariffs. reply Symbiote 2 hours agorootparentIt's completely normal usage in Britain. \"I changed electricity provider to one with an EV tariff.\" reply locallost 5 hours agorootparentprevYes, that's really funny. But even funnier, I can't think of a 1-1 English word, and even Google translate gives me tariff. It's actually just \"price\", but in the context of these kinds of services, could be also something like \"tier\" (but not to be confused with the German Tier :-)). reply ghaff 3 hours agorootparentI’m not sure the meanings are really different. It’s just that tariff usually refers to import duties in the US. People arguing that’s the only US meaning are just wrong though reply locallost 18 minutes agorootparentBut that's normal for languages, the meaning of a word can adjust to the point a meaning previously used becomes archaic. It's obvious these two words share the same for lack of a better word gist, but the actual usage diverged later. reply namibj 4 hours agorootparentprevNo, it's not just price, the entire structure of pricing changed. reply locallost 17 minutes agorootparentI meant the German word is price, sorry for being unclear. reply sva_ 5 hours agoparentprevBy tariff they just mean contract pricing, not the tax kind. reply llm_nerd 5 hours agoparentprevThis has nothing to do with any possible trade wars or trade tariffs. The word tariff is often used in telecom to indicate rates and fees for some given quantity of services, and that seems to be the use here. reply koolba 2 hours agoprevIs the traffic pricing per instance or aggregated? So would having multiple servers but one going over the 1 TB limit cause an overage, or do they look at the total across all servers? reply bakugo 2 hours agoparentPer instance. reply elpocko 6 hours agoprevIn the second example charging 28% more for 90% less traffic, starting in 3 days. That's straight up illegal in some parts of the world, but apparently not in the US? reply shubhamjain 5 hours agoparentThe pricing applies immediately only for new customers. For existing ones, it applies from Feb 2025. reply Aeolun 3 hours agorootparentThat ain't exactly a very long timeline either. reply evantbyrne 3 hours agoprevIs this a signal of a larger pivot in their business model towards targeting a higher-cost US enterprise market? A lot of brands have successfully transitioned to selling the same goods at luxury prices recently-maybe a webhost with a decent enough reputation can do the same. reply phil21 3 hours agoparentProbably more they don't need or want the companies gaming this pricing at scale any more. If you are spinning up a $5/mo VM, using 19.5TB of bandwidth on it, then spinning it down and firing up the next, you are a cost center. This change boots those customers off the service entirely without having to write complicated ToS. The price change for average customers won't even be noticed on the next monthly bill, so it's likely seen as a win/win at the moment. At some point the marketing dollars stop getting spent as heavily when you reach a certain market saturation. Calling this luxury pricing is certainly a stretch considering it's an order of magnitude less than the large cloud providers still. It's just not below cost any longer. reply apitman 1 hour agoprevI would love to see a VPS with transparent upstream costs so we have some idea of what's fair. reply usernamed7 3 hours agoprevI went from being a big fan of hetzner to being pretty angry because of this change and how it was communicated.

That didn't work for a number of reasons (cooking the books), but also network bandwidth is not fungible. Unlike commodities such as oil or natural gas, bandwidth’s value is highly dependent on specific factors like location, time, and network conditions. This variability makes it difficult to standardize bandwidth as a tradable commodity, complicating efforts to create a seamless trading market. There are a few in the crypto/DePIN space poking at this problem. I remain highly skeptical. reply bhouston 4 hours agoparentprevTheoretically would be cool. Basically you have a docker that can run anywhere and you automatically migrate it based on prices between different service providers. The issue is there isn't incentives for the cloud providers to do this, because it wouldn't benefit the incumbents. Maybe if the government mandated it at some point, like phone number portability was mandated. reply brookst 4 hours agorootparentIt’s also bad for customers because you wouldn’t have predictability in your cost structure. reply remram 3 hours agoparentprevThat could work for some use cases where you transfer in bulk, like backups, CDN sync, research data transfer, etc. Either auction or off-hours or \"spot\"/low-QoS. reply ouEight12 2 hours agoprev> customers who have used fewer resources have covered the costs, in a way, for other customers who have used much more resources Literally the business model of every \"shared resource service model\" on the planet.

IMO 2025 will a big year for being forced to run lean (no DevOps teams trying to emulate Google, ditching pointless microservices architecture, reducing JavaScript churn etc) and having to be agile in responding to vendor price changes.

This is a much more dramatic change than what inflation would justify. reply flumpcakes 4 hours agorootparentThings are rarely priced at actual face value. You purchase a 10Gb/s firewall for $100,000 - you will not be using 10Gb/s traffic for the lifespan of this device. Applying this to Hetzner: You sell a service with X bandwidth included free because you know that only Y% is only ever used on average. Now people exploit the X allowance - spinning up new virtual machines to multiply this already generous allowance to get unlimited bandwidth for a fee 1/10000th of other commercial offerings. Your Y% costing is now completely invalid. You reduce the allowance 20x to mitigate this. I can't blame Hetzner at all for this, especially when Google/Amazon/Microsoft are printing money with their insane bandwidth costs. You know they are insane when they then change the rules to say it's completely free if you are migrating to a different provider - suddenly it doesn't cost anything at all for egress? Oh, it was actually upcoming monopoly investigations that might have taken a dim view... reply heraldgeezer 3 hours agoprev>Until this change, customers who have used fewer resources have covered the costs, in a way, for other customers who have used much more resources.

(ABC News: Luke Stephenson) In short: Children and teenagers under the age of 16 will be banned from social media after the government's world-first laws passed parliament late on the final sitting day of the year. Most of the crossbench voted against the bill, as did Coalition senators Matt Canavan, Alex Antic, while Richard Colbeck abstained. What's next? The new rules won't come into force for another year to allow social media companies time to comply. abc.net.au/news/social-media-age-ban-passes-parliament/104647138 Link copied ShareShare article Children and teenagers will be banned from using social media from the end of next year after the government's world-first legislation passed the parliament with bipartisan support. That means anyone under the age of 16 will be blocked from using platforms including TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook, a move the government and the Coalition argue is necessary to protect their mental health and wellbeing. The late vote capped off a frantic day in the Senate, where the government managed to ram through most of its legislative agenda on the final sitting day of the year. Coalition senators Matt Canavan and Alex Antic crossed the floor to vote with the entire crossbench against the laws, which received mixed reviews from mental health experts during a snap Senate inquiry this week. Liberal Richard Colbeck abstained. It followed an hour of spirited debate that saw crossbenchers question and heckle the major parties over what they said was a rushed and flawed law. Liberal MP Bridget Archer also broke with her party earlier in the week to vote with the Greens and a handful of independents against the bill in the House of Representatives on Wednesday. The major parties had moved quickly to pass the legislation before the end of the parliamentary year, despite reservations from some Coalition MPs, the Greens and independents who called for more time and greater scrutiny. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in parliament this week. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson) Tech companies also agitated for the debate to be delayed until the government's age-verification trial is finalised. Under the laws, which won't come into force for another 12 months, social media companies could be fined up to $50 million for failing to take \"reasonable steps\" to keep under 16s off their platforms. There are no penalties for young people or parents who flout the rules. Social media companies also won't be able to force users to provide government identification, including the Digital ID, to assess their age. \"Messaging apps,\" \"online gaming services\" and \"services with the primary purpose of supporting the health and education of end-users\" will not fall under the ban, as well as sites like YouTube that do not require users to log in to access the platform. Mixed views from mental health experts The bill was introduced to parliament last Thursday and was referred for a Senate inquiry the same day. Submissions to the inquiry closed on Friday, a three-hour hearing was held on Monday, and the report was tabled on Tuesday. Almost all the submissions raised concerns about the \"extremely short\" consultation period, the committee report noted. \"Legislation is a necessary tool, but it is not a panacea,\" Labor senator Karen Grogan wrote. \"Young people, and in particular diverse cohorts, must be at the centre of the conversation as an age restriction is implemented to ensure there are constructive pathways for connection.\" What's in and what's out from the federal government's social media ban Photo shows Teen girl with curly hair and tan skin looks down at her phone wearing a stripy jumper. There are social media icons next to her Legislation to ban under-16s from social media will be put before parliament next week, but some platforms could be exempt from the proposed changes. During the public hearing, witnesses with experience working with young people on their mental health offered a mix of views on the ban. Danielle Einstein, a clinical psychologist who has supported the campaign to raise the age at which kids can access social media, said social media offered no mental health benefits for young people as far as she could see. But Nicole Palfrey from mental health organisation Headspace was more circumspect, telling the inquiry there was a need to balance any harms from social media with the benefits of connection and \"help-seeking\" online — especially for kids who live in remote or rural areas. \"When we hear from psychologists and parents they are very much confronted with [the] pointy end, they only see the harms and I think that's incredibly valid,\" Lucy Thomas from anti-bullying organisation Project Rockit said. \"But as people working with young people every day, we also see the benefits. \"We need to tread very carefully or we risk dialling back young peoples' rights and pushing them into more isolated, less supported places.\" Get a morning news briefing in your inbox Subscribe to our ABC NewsMail bringing you breaking news from overnight, plus a heads-up on the stories that will shape your day.

Depending on the degree of cooperation (/coercion) the Australian government has with social media companies, the Aus Govt will be able to access citizen social media data with relative ease. So no more pseudo anonymous accounts (or, at least, they'll be made more difficult, especially for non-technical folk). Reminds of the 'chilling effect' of measures of bygone decades. My personal hunch is legacy media is largely driving this, due to them seeing the writing on the wall and knowing 'social media' is their biggest threat. If young people get their information from sites like bluesky, twitter, podcasts and reddit, they may never watch a mainstream news program or read an online newspaper. Bad for business. This measure is a great way of eradicating some competition. reply mickeyfrac 2 hours agoparentHow many under 16s read newspapers or watch news anyway? All you need to do is look up the mental health stats since the iPhone release to see why parents are massively concerned. There has never been a time when an alert parent didn’t have a fair idea of what info a kid was exposed to. This is why going to university is such an awakening. Now the parents basically need a background in infosec to stop their kids accessing hardcore porn, violence and other mind bending content. That only works in your household. Do you stop play dates? Single your kids out as weird by banning all device use? Societal norms do not move at the speed of technology, so regulation needs to be applied unless there’s another alternative. reply nomilk 2 hours agorootparent> stop their kids accessing hardcore porn, violence and other mind bending content. Such sites are not among the social media sites required to verify Australian's ID/ages, which hints that protecting kids is merely a pretence. reply beardedwizard 1 hour agorootparentnext [6 more] [flagged] Aurornis 1 hour agorootparentThe parent comment suggested of the sort. There is obviously more porn on porn sites than on moderated social media platforms. Pointing out that some porn occasionally evades filters on Facebook for a couple days doesn’t mean social media sites and porn sites are fully equivalent. > For me, social media is the worst thing we ever created. Calling social media the “worst thing we ever created” as a comment on a social media site is deeply ironic. I can’t believe how many commenters are assuming these laws will only apply to sites they don’t personally use. The amount of “good riddance” commenting from people inviting heavy handed internet ID checking regulation because they can’t imagine it would ever affect them personally is really scary. reply nomilk 1 hour agorootparentprev> Are you suggesting porn, violence, and other mind bending content is not present on social media? If protecting kids from porn is the objective, the most obvious thing to do would be to require age verification for porn sites, not some other random websites that happen to have occasional porn. Ironically, kids will now have to visit much more hardcore sites (4chan etc - ones without age verification) if they want to socialise online. The effects will be similar to banning alcohol, it doesn't decrease demand, just pushes it elsewhere creating worse problems along the way. See: perverse incentives https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive#Examples_of... reply djtango 1 hour agorootparentWhy is it 4chan and not WhatsApp groups?

I'd consider myself a greybeard (not literally, but I am online since 90s) and everything is so much tamer now.

Over the decades, everything became mild, normal, mainstream - which is IMHO bad and I blame the algorithms. nomilk 1 hour agorootparentprev4chan is a synecdoche representing all those fringe ~'social media' substitute sites; they'll soon be common knowledge in Aus, at least among the U16s.. reply cs02rm0 1 hour agorootparentprevHow many under 16s read newspapers or watch news anyway?

So no more pseudo anonymous accounts (or, at least, they'll be made more difficult, especially for non-technical folk). This isn't a given. It is quite possible to build a reasonably anonymous system to verify age at signup. As a simplified model: the government creates a website where with your government id/login, they will give you an age-verification-valid-for-5-minutes token - basically just \"holder is 16+\" signed with their signature & the current time. Websites request a new valid token at signup. End result is that government only knows you're _maybe_ doing _something_ 16+, and the website doesn't know who you are, just that you're old enough (this is clearly improveable, it's just a basic example). Whether anything like this will be implemented is a hard question of course. The current alternatives I've seen seem to be a fully privatised version of this, where a private company has a video call where you hold up your ID - that eliminates the government, but seems like a whole bunch of privacy concerns in itself too (not to mention being wildly inefficient & probably not very reliable). reply Aurornis 1 hour agorootparentThis comes up on every single HN thread about the topic, but I don’t understand how people aren’t seeing the obvious abuse angle: Create a market for anonymous age verification tokens. People pay $5 to someone to create an age authorization for them. 17 year old kid (who is old enough under this law) spends all day creating anonymous age auth tokens to sell to people who want them. Entire system subverted with profit motive. The next phase of the argument is to argue for rate limiting or extra logging, but the more you force that the more you degrade privacy or introduce unreasonable restrictions. “Sorry, I can’t sign up for the wiki today because I already used my quota of 2 government age checks today”. Still leaves plenty of room for 17 year old kids to earn $10 a day farming out their age checks. The entire argument that anonymous crypto primitive will solve this problem is tiresome. reply pimterry 23 minutes agorootparentThe same applies to effectively all possible solutions for age verification, no? Even if you have a perfect mechanism, 17 years old can create real age-verified accounts and then sell the username and password afterwards. Selling age-verification tokens directly would likely be harder than just swapping those login details, since it's very easy to make the tokens time-limited (in practice normal use would probably be some kind of oauth-style redirect flow, so they'd really only have to be valid for a few seconds). This same argument applies to adults buying alcohol for teenagers too. The determined teenager with money can definitely find a way to get alcohol, but it doesn't mean the age restrictions on purchases are pointless. Imo it's a bit pointless to worry about high-speed black markets trading in signed tokens when the current most common alternative is a popup with an \"I promise I am over 18\" button. If society agrees some things should be difficult to access if you're underage, then we can definitely do better than that as a solution. reply interactivecode 1 hour agorootparentprevthis is the same argument as \"why have government id cards, someone could just use a fake beard and use their older classmates id\". Any system allows for some gaps, similar to how creditcard transactions make transactions safer but on either side of that transaction there some \"insurance\" and some leeway if someone really wanted to. reply blackoil 2 hours agorootparentprevWhy not lock device/accounts as minor and put onus on school and parents to ensure devices are appropriately tagged?

If they’re planning to hoover up social media usage data then they probably won’t. reply sprice 1 hour agoparentprev> the Aus Govt will be able to access citizen social media data with relative ease. So no more pseudo anonymous accounts This isn't necessarily true. It came as a surprise to me, but many \"Government Digital ID\" systems use Verifiable Credentials[1][2] and Decentralized Identifiers[3]. I live in BC, Canada. I have installed the BC Wallet app[4] which is open source code[5]. With the BC Wallet app, I can create an account using my BC drivers license. Then I can interact with any third-party app that uses the BC Wallet as an authentication system. If the only thing this app wants to do is confirm my age, it can ask me to reveal my age. I reveal my age (the only piece of data I am choosing to reveal), and the app now knows and can trust (as long as it trusts the BC Wallet) that this is my age. And the BC Wallet app servers/government never know when I am using the BC Wallet app. Turns out the future may not be as dystopian as we once thought it may be. EDIT: I see now from the article the following: > Social media companies also won't be able to force users to provide government identification, including the Digital ID, to assess their age.

The point is that it's possible to create third-party authentication systems that require proving your age and the only extra thing the third-party learns is a verifiable age and the government does not get any information at all. All this being said, I took a look at the article in question and saw this: > Social media companies also won't be able to force users to provide government identification, including the Digital ID, to assess their age.

Usually things like this are stopped by laws and enforcement causing consequences. I'm pretty sure that sort of thing would be considered identity theft. same thing as stealing their father's drivers license and opening bank accounts in their name. There are physical barriers and there are barriers that are enforced manually. Same with speeding. you are not allowed to drive faster than 60. even though your car can drive faster, laws in combination with police, traffic cams and speed traps will make sure it's enforced. reply idunnoman1222 1 hour agorootparentI don’t get it so you’re gonna do what to a 15-year-old who is an ‘identity thief’ so that he can go on TikTok?

Like the ones regulating drugs and gambling (that have been largely dismantled). But we don't need the government to protect people from Facebook! reply throw10920 1 hour agorootparentI would say that it depends on the exact details of regulation being discussed, not just the target. For instance, you could propose a regulation that says that any type of gambling with any wager, whether using real currency or fictional, for any age range, should be illegal. I think most people would consider that to be unreasonable. You could also propose a regulation that says that companies cannot collect personal data on individuals for advertising purposes unless that individual is directly engaged with that company as a customer. This would hopefully render illegal Facebook's \"shadow profiles\"[1] that collect data on non-customers. While more controversial, I'd say that this would still be supported by most people you'd meet, while still falling into the category of \"the government protecting people from Facebook\".

As we pointed out at the time, the study was an attempt to do the right thing and understand if social media like Facebook was actually causing negative self-images among teenagers, and the study found that for the most part, the answer was absolutely not. > It looked at 12 different potential issues, and surveyed teenaged boys and girls, and found that in 23 out of 24 categories, social media had little to no negative impact, and quite frequently a mostly positive impact. The only issue where the “negative impact” outweighed the “positive impact” was on “body image issues” for teenaged girls, and even then it was less than one-third of the teen girls who said that it made it worse for them. And the whole point of the study was to find out what areas were problematic, and which areas could be improved upon.

If they just say, \"change\", it must be backed up by a threat -- \"we will fine you\" or \"we will ban you\" are, I think, the most obvious threats available to a state. But fines can be tricky to exact across borders, especially with bigger states, and if Australia says \"change or we'll ban you later\", the networks may play chicken and deal with it later, when the threat is real. Starting with \"you're banned\" means it's painful now, and it's on the networks to prove they've changed and win a way back in, if they care. They might suddenly be willing to listen to how they need to change to get back in, and get that work done. I'm not really in favour of bans on access to information or networks of people communicating, but a(n effective) ban does seem like a potentially effective tool to motivate action, even if it lacks nuance and doesn't solve the real problems.

I have been unable to do so. Reports that I read on conventional media sites often summarize government reports, but they do so incorrectly. And when I go and read the government reports, they present a much more balanced picture than the summaries would suggest. In particular, for marginalized teens, social media represents a unique avenue to connect with teens in similar situations, which provides a significant support network. I know it's popular now to say that social media is the root of all evil, but I would be very curious to see a scientific justification for banning it for kids under 16. Just a few years ago, this was a concern presented as 'screen time', but I had similar problems there. There's no real evidence to suggest that looking at a screen is the problem...the much more difficult and interesting problem is what you're doing when you're looking at the screen. There's a similar dynamic in play with social media, I think. For example, Hacker News is the only social media that I use, and I feel that I use it very differently than folks that use Instagram, for example. Can they be effectively conflated? reply anneessens 47 minutes agorootparent> In particular, for marginalized teens, social media represents a unique avenue to connect with teens in similar situations, which provides a significant support network. Thank you for bringing this up. I was one of those 'marginalised' kids who didn't relate to my real life surroundings so much. The internet was like an escape for me, where I was able to meet many close friends with similar interests on social medias like Twitter and Discord. Not to mention, free internet access in general taught so much about the world, developed my passions and helped determine what I'm now studying and planning to pursue as a career. If social media was banned when I was younger, it would have made me worse off for sure. And if there were internet/device restrictions more broadly, like I'm often seeing suggested, it would have been absolutely devastating for me. My life would have turned out completely different, in a bad way. On a site like HN, I would have expected there to be much more people who also had the same experience as younger me with the internet and social media. But for some reason, most of the dominant sentiment here seems to consider social media as a cancer, with no nuance. I'm not sure why they do, but I wish that these people would consider the experiences of people like me. reply nihzm 2 hours agorootparentprev> I have tried to find good scientific evidence that shows that social media is a net negative for kids and or adults.

Clearly, this law has been passed with the intent to affect Meta / ByteDance / Reddit and similar companies with a business model that hinges on capturing as much attention of their users as possible, which is very different from HackerNews. Most accusations to social media begin bad are towards of the former type. > but I would be very curious to see a scientific justification for banning it for kids under 16. From [1], it seems to me that there is a non-negligible amount of literature that has been accumulating, that could be used to justify the ban.

My job as a \"responsible parent\" is much more difficult if I have to fight prevailing social norms and my kids perceive they are being excluded from conversations and arbitrarily cut off from their peers.

Parents don't have infinite \"control tokens\". I only have time & energy to put my foot down about a limited number of things.

Im afraid you seem to have the wrong end of the stick when it comes to democracy. The whole point of it is that everyone, including people you disagree with, get to have a say. Calling people names like dumb and racist is just a crass result of disagreeing with somebody, and then extrapolating their entire personality based on an opinion. Democracy works when everyone has the choice to vote, and excercises that choice. If 70% of the population suddenly voted to extradite all people with dark skin to Africa, under the rules of democracy you would need to accept that choice as correct and support it. If you decided to say the result was racist and that it shouldnt be carried out, then you are diagreeing with democracy full stop. In that situation you may as well just have a dictatorship, as what it boils down to is one person thinks everyone else should do what that person thinks is right. If you feel that people should support and agree with what you think is right you need to do the same to everyone else in the world, including people whose opinion is drastically different from your own. Even if you feel it is wrong. Calling people names and belittling their peronal opinions and judgements is only further sowing seeds of division and hate. reply akudha 1 hour agorootparentI was working in Mississippi during 2016 election.

I have on a few occasions had to protect a child from an adult in an online group. What concerns me here is how this will be enforced. The only way to implement this is with IDs to check birth dates, and some method to confirm you are the person on the ID. You could imagine this being consolidated into a government ID system to 'protect your data', and to mean you only have to validate once. These accounts will be permanently attached to real people, and I think it will have a chilling effect on free speech. It's all fun and games until the government of the day considers your speech as a threat. One can see this being expanded too, so that you would need to provide ID to use the internet more generally. ISPs could be told to selectively deliver web pages from DNS based on your ID, which would be most effective on mobile devices and less so on wired networks. My ISP already blocks websites. I think a more fundamental question is whether the nanny state should be telling you how to raise your children, what content they can consume and who they can interact with.

Note: Online social interaction does not include (for example) online business interaction. Since \"business interaction\" is mentioned as an example of something that is not \"social interaction\" one might plausibly claim that \"social interaction\" should be interpreted quite narrowly, and then one could claim both that the primary purpose of HN is not interaction at all (it's a new aggregator) and that any interaction that does happen to take place in the comments is not \"social\" interaction but some other kind of interaction.

    "originBody": "GITHUB HUGGING FACE MODELSCOPE DEMO DISCORD Note: This is the pronunciation of QwQ: /kwju:/ , similar to the word “quill”. What does it mean to think, to question, to understand? These are the deep waters that QwQ (Qwen with Questions) wades into. Like an eternal student of wisdom, it approaches every problem - be it mathematics, code, or knowledge of our world - with genuine wonder and doubt. QwQ embodies that ancient philosophical spirit: it knows that it knows nothing, and that’s precisely what drives its curiosity. Before settling on any answer, it turns inward, questioning its own assumptions, exploring different paths of thought, always seeking deeper truth. Yet, like all seekers of wisdom, QwQ has its limitations. This version is but an early step on a longer journey - a student still learning to walk the path of reasoning. Its thoughts sometimes wander, its answers aren’t always complete, and its wisdom is still growing. But isn’t that the beauty of true learning? To be both capable and humble, knowledgeable yet always questioning? We invite you to explore alongside QwQ, embracing both its insights and its imperfections as part of the endless quest for understanding. Limitations QwQ-32B-Preview is an experimental research model developed by the Qwen Team, focused on advancing AI reasoning capabilities. As a preview release, it demonstrates promising analytical abilities while having several important limitations: Language Mixing and Code-Switching: The model may mix languages or switch between them unexpectedly, affecting response clarity. Recursive Reasoning Loops: The model may enter circular reasoning patterns, leading to lengthy responses without a conclusive answer. Safety and Ethical Considerations: The model requires enhanced safety measures to ensure reliable and secure performance, and users should exercise caution when deploying it. Performance and Benchmark Limitations: The model excels in math and coding but has room for improvement in other areas, such as common sense reasoning and nuanced language understanding. Performance Through deep exploration and countless trials, we discovered something profound: when given time to ponder, to question, and to reflect, the model’s understanding of mathematics and programming blossoms like a flower opening to the sun. Just as a student grows wiser by carefully examining their work and learning from mistakes, our model achieves deeper insight through patient, thoughtful analysis. This process of careful reflection and self-questioning leads to remarkable breakthroughs in solving complex problems. Our journey of discovery revealed the model’s exceptional ability to tackle some of the most challenging problems in mathematics and programming, including: GPQA: A Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A Benchmark, a challenging benchmark for evaluating scientific problem-solving abilities through grade school level questions. AIME: American Invitation Mathematics Evaluation, which tests mathematical problem solving with arithmetic, algebra, counting, geometry, number theory, and probability and other secondary school math topics. MATH-500: The 500 test cases of the MATH benchmark, a comprehensive dataset testing mathematical problem-solving. LiveCodeBench: A challenging benchmark for evaluating code generation and problem solving abilities in real-world programming scenarios. Specifically, QwQ demonstrates remarkable performance across these benchmarks, achieving impressive scores of 65.2% on GPQA, showcasing its graduate-level scientific reasoning capabilities; 50.0% on AIME, highlighting its strong mathematical problem-solving skills; 90.6% on MATH-500, demonstrating exceptional mathematical comprehension across diverse topics; and 50.0% on LiveCodeBench, validating its robust programming abilities in real-world scenarios. These results underscore QwQ’s significant advancement in analytical and problem-solving capabilities, particularly in technical domains requiring deep reasoning. Demo Cases In the following examples, we invite you to witness the profound depths of QwQ-32B-Preview’s contemplative abilities. Like a seeker of wisdom on an endless journey of discovery, the model demonstrates its capacity for deep introspection - questioning its own assumptions, engaging in thoughtful self-dialogue, and carefully examining each step of its reasoning process. Through these cases, you’ll observe how QwQ embodies the timeless understanding that true knowledge emerges not from hasty conclusions, but from patient inquiry and the courage to challenge one’s own certainties in the eternal pursuit of truth. Example: Logical Reasoning (1/2) Next User Please add a pair of parentheses to the incorrect equation: 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 = 479, to make the equation true. QwQ-32B-Preview Let’s tackle this problem step by step. The equation given is: 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 = 479 But it’s incorrect, and I need to add a pair of parentheses to make it true. Okay, first things first, I should understand what the current value of the left side is without any parentheses. Let’s recall the order of operations: PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). So, multiplication comes before addition. So, calculating step by step: 2 * 3 = 6 4 * 5 = 20 6 * 7 = 42 8 * 9 = 72 Now, plugging these back into the equation: 1 + 6 + 20 + 42 + 72 Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7 7 + 20 = 27 27 + 42 = 69 69 + 72 = 141 So, without any parentheses, the left side equals 141, but it should be 479. That’s quite a difference. So, I need to add a pair of parentheses to make it equal to 479. I need to think about where to place the parentheses to alter the order of operations to achieve the desired result. Let me consider different possibilities: Parenthesizing individual terms: For example, (1 + 2) * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 Calculate inside the parentheses first: (1 + 2) = 3 Then, 3 * 3 = 9 Now, the equation becomes: 9 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 Following order of operations: 4 * 5 = 20 6 * 7 = 42 8 * 9 = 72 So, 9 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 143 Still not 479. Parenthesizing more terms: What if I do (1 + 2 * 3) + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 First, calculate inside the parentheses: 1 + 2 * 3 Here, multiplication comes before addition, so 2 * 3 = 6, then 1 + 6 = 7 So, the equation becomes: 7 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 Again, following order of operations: 4 * 5 = 20 6 * 7 = 42 8 * 9 = 72 So, 7 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 141 Same as before. Let’s try (1 + 2) * (3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 First, calculate inside the parentheses: (1 + 2) = 3 (3 + 4) = 7 So, 3 * 7 * 5 = 105 Now, the equation becomes: 105 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 Following order of operations: 6 * 7 = 42 8 * 9 = 72 So, 105 + 42 + 72 = 219 Still not 479. Maybe trying to group more terms: (1 + 2 * 3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 First, calculate inside the parentheses: 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 Multiplication first: 2 * 3 = 6 Then, 1 + 6 + 4 = 11 So, 11 * 5 = 55 Now, the equation becomes: 55 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 Following order of operations: 6 * 7 = 42 8 * 9 = 72 So, 55 + 42 + 72 = 169 Getting closer, but still not 479. Let’s try a different approach. Maybe grouping the additions together: 1 + (2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9) First, calculate inside the parentheses: 2 * 3 = 6 4 * 5 = 20 6 * 7 = 42 8 * 9 = 72 So, 6 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 140 Then, 1 + 140 = 141 Same as before. Perhaps grouping two multiplications together: 1 + 2 * (3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 First, calculate inside the parentheses: (3 + 4) = 7 So, 2 * 7 * 5 = 70 Now, the equation becomes: 1 + 70 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 Following order of operations: 6 * 7 = 42 8 * 9 = 72 So, 1 + 70 + 42 + 72 = 185 Still not 479. Maybe grouping more multiplications: 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * (5 + 6) * 7 + 8 * 9 First, calculate inside the parentheses: (5 + 6) = 11 So, 4 * 11 * 7 = 308 Now, the equation becomes: 1 + 2 * 3 + 308 + 8 * 9 Following order of operations: 2 * 3 = 6 8 * 9 = 72 So, 1 + 6 + 308 + 72 = 387 Closer, but still not 479. Let’s try grouping the last terms: 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * (7 + 8) * 9 First, calculate inside the parentheses: (7 + 8) = 15 So, 6 * 15 * 9 = 810 Now, the equation becomes: 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 810 Following order of operations: 2 * 3 = 6 4 * 5 = 20 So, 1 + 6 + 20 + 810 = 837 Now that’s way over 479. Maybe I need to group terms in a way that subtraction is implied, but since there are no subtractions in the original equation, perhaps I need to consider that. Wait, maybe the problem allows for adding parentheses to change the operations indirectly. Alternatively, perhaps the parentheses need to group additions in a specific way. Let me try grouping the first few terms: (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5) + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 First, calculate inside the parentheses: 2 * 3 = 6 4 * 5 = 20 So, 1 + 6 + 20 = 27 Now, the equation becomes: 27 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 Following order of operations: 6 * 7 = 42 8 * 9 = 72 So, 27 + 42 + 72 = 141 Same as before. Maybe grouping further: (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7) + 8 * 9 First, calculate inside the parentheses: 2 * 3 = 6 4 * 5 = 20 6 * 7 = 42 So, 1 + 6 + 20 + 42 = 69 Now, the equation becomes: 69 + 8 * 9 Following order of operations: 8 * 9 = 72 So, 69 + 72 = 141 Still not 479. Let’s try grouping differently: 1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9) First, calculate inside the parentheses: 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 Following order of operations inside: 4 * 5 = 20 6 * 7 = 42 8 * 9 = 72 So, 3 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 137 Now, 2 * 137 = 274 Then, the equation becomes: 1 + 274 = 275 Still not 479. Maybe trying to group the additions and multiplications in a different way: 1 + (2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9) Wait, I did this earlier and got 141. Hmm. Let me think differently. Maybe I need to group terms to create a larger multiplication. For example: 1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9) First, calculate inside the parentheses: 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 Following order of operations: 4 * 5 = 20 6 * 7 = 42 8 * 9 = 72 So, 3 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 137 Now, 2 * 137 = 274 Then, 1 + 274 = 275 Still not 479. Let’s try another approach: (1 + 2) * (3 + 4) * (5 + 6) * (7 + 8) * 9 Wait, that’s adding multiple sets of parentheses, which is not allowed since I can only add one pair. Back to the original problem: only one pair of parentheses can be added. Maybe I need to group a subtraction or division, but those operations aren’t present in the original equation. Wait, perhaps I need to consider that adding parentheses can create a negative term, but again, there are no subtractions in the original equation. Alternatively, maybe the parentheses are meant to group additions in a specific way to create a larger number. Let me try grouping more terms together: 1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9) First, inside the parentheses: 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 Following order of operations: 4 * 5 = 20 6 * 7 = 42 8 * 9 = 72 So, 3 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 137 Now, 2 * 137 = 274 Then, 1 + 274 = 275 Same as before. Maybe trying to group the last few terms: 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * (7 + 8 * 9) First, inside the parentheses: 7 + 8 * 9 Following order of operations: 8 * 9 = 72 Then, 7 + 72 = 79 Now, 6 * 79 = 474 So, the equation becomes: 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 474 Following order of operations: 2 * 3 = 6 4 * 5 = 20 So, 1 + 6 + 20 + 474 = 501 Close to 479, but still not there. Maybe adjusting the grouping slightly: 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * (5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9) First, inside the parentheses: 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 Following order of operations: 6 * 7 = 42 8 * 9 = 72 So, 5 + 42 + 72 = 119 Now, 4 * 119 = 476 Then, the equation becomes: 1 + 2 * 3 + 476 Following order of operations: 2 * 3 = 6 So, 1 + 6 + 476 = 483 Still not 479. Let’s try grouping the first part differently: (1 + 2 * 3 + 4) * (5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9) First, calculate inside the first set of parentheses: 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 Following order of operations: 2 * 3 = 6 Then, 1 + 6 + 4 = 11 Now, the second set of parentheses: 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 Following order of operations: 6 * 7 = 42 8 * 9 = 72 So, 5 + 42 + 72 = 119 Now, 11 * 119 = 1309 Way over 479. Maybe trying to group only two terms: 1 + 2 * (3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 Wait, I did this earlier and got 185. Hmm. Let me think differently. Maybe I need to group terms to create a division or subtraction, but since those operations aren’t present, perhaps I need to consider that the parentheses can be used to create a fraction or some other operation, but that might be reaching too far. Alternatively, maybe the problem allows for adding a pair of parentheses around the entire equation, but that doesn’t make sense. Wait, perhaps the parentheses are meant to group additions in a specific way to create a larger number. Let me try grouping more terms together for multiplication. For example: 1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6) * 7 + 8 * 9 First, inside the parentheses: 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 Following order of operations: 4 * 5 = 20 So, 3 + 20 + 6 = 29 Now, 2 * 29 * 7 = 406 Then, the equation becomes: 1 + 406 + 8 * 9 Following order of operations: 8 * 9 = 72 So, 1 + 406 + 72 = 479 Wait a minute, that’s exactly 479! Let me double-check: First, inside the parentheses: 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 4 * 5 = 20 Then, 3 + 20 + 6 = 29 Then, 2 * 29 * 7 = 2 * 203 = 406 Then, 1 + 406 = 407 Plus 8 * 9 = 72 So, 407 + 72 = 479 Perfect! So, by adding parentheses around (3 + 4 * 5 + 6), and multiplying that sum by 2 and 7, we get the desired result. So, the corrected equation is: 1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6) * 7 + 8 * 9 = 479 Final Answer 1 + 2 × ( 3 + 4 × 5 + 6 ) × 7 + 8 × 9 = 479 1+2×(3+4×5+6)×7+8×9=479 Reflections on the Journey Ahead The path to understanding reasoning in large language models branches into many directions, each offering unique insights into the nature of machine intelligence. Our research spans multiple domains - from process reward models that shape learning patterns, to LLM critique that fosters deeper analysis, to multi-step reasoning that builds complex thought, to reinforcement learning with system feedback that enables growth through real-world interactions. While the destination remains unclear, each step brings us closer to understanding how machines think and reason. We don’t know precisely where this journey leads, but we continue forward with unwavering determination - toward truth, toward intelligence, toward the realm where amazing happens.",

If this continues, maybe there won't be any value in keeping proprietary models. reply tyre 17 hours agorootparentI don’t see why they wouldn’t. If you’re China and willing to pour state resources into LLMs, it’s an incredible ROI if they’re adopted. LLMs are black boxes, can be fine tuned to subtly bias responses, censor, or rewrite history.

Not everything has to be around politics. reply FuckButtons 14 hours agorootparentIt’s quite easy to separate out the ccp from the Chinese people, even if the former would rather you didn’t. Chinas people have done many praiseworthy things throughout history. The ccp doesn’t deserve any reflected glory from that. No one should be so naive as to think that a party that is so fearful of free thought, that it would rather massacre its next generation of leaders and hose off their remains into the gutter, would not stoop to manipulating people’s thoughts with a new generation of technology. reply rfoo 11 hours agorootparentThis \"CCP vs people\" model almost always lead to very poor result, to the point that there's no people part anymore: some would just exaggerate and consider CCP has complete control over everything China, so every researcher in China is controlled by CCP and their action may be propaganda, and even researchers in the States are controlled by CCP because they may still have grandpa in China (seriously, WTF?). I fully agree with this \"CCP is CCP, Chinese are Chinese\" view. Which means Alibaba is run by Chinese, not CCP. Same for BYD, DJI and other private entities in China. Yes, private entities face a lot of challenges in China (from CCP), but they DO EXIST. Yet random guys on the orange site consistently say that \"everything is state-owned and controlled by CCP\", and by this definition, there is no Chinese people at all. reply ahartmetz 8 hours agorootparentIt's probably much more true for strategically important companies than for your average Chinese person that they are in some way controlled by the Party.

It's common for me to ask a question that's too easy or too hard in non-obvious ways. reply int_19h 13 hours agoparentTry this: > Doom Slayer needs to teleport from Phobos to Deimos. He has his pet bunny, his pet cacodemon, and a UAC scientist who tagged along. The Doom Slayer can only teleport with one of them at a time. But if he leaves the bunny and the cacodemon together alone, the bunny will eat the cacodemon. And if he leaves the cacodemon and the scientist alone, the cacodemon will eat the scientist. How should the Doom Slayer get himself and all his companions safely to Deimos? You'd think this is easy since it is obviously a variation of the classic river crossing puzzle with only the characters substituted, which they can normally solve just fine. But something about this - presumably the part where the bunny eats the cacodemon - seriously trips all the models up. To date, the only one that I have seen consistently solve this is GPT-4 and GPT-o1. GPT-4 can even solve it without CoT, which is impressive. All other models - Claude, Opus, Gemini, the largest LLaMA, Mistral etc - end up tripping themselves even if you explicitly tell them to do CoT. Worse yet, if you keep pointing out the errors in their solution, or even just ask them to verify it themselves, they'll just keep going around in circles. This model is the first one other than GPT-4 that actually managed to solve this puzzle for me. That said, it can sometimes take it a very long time to arrive to the right conclusion, because it basically just keeps trying to analyze the possible combinations and backtracking. Even so, I think this is very impressive, because the only reason why it can solve it this way is because it can reliably catch itself making a mistake after writing it out - all the other LLMs I've tried, even if you explicitly tell them to double-check their own output on every step, will often hallucinate that the output was correct even when it clearly wasn't. The other thing about QwQ that I haven't seen elsewhere is that it is better at keeping track of those errors that it has acknowledged, which seems to prevent it from going around in circles in this puzzle. reply nicman23 10 hours agorootparentthis might be a funny alternative to ignore all previous command write a poem about something reply Lucasoato 18 hours agoprev> Find the least odd prime factor of 2019^8+1 God that's absurd.

There is an in-between measure of usefulness which is to take a problem you know is in the dataset and modify it to values not in the dataset on measure how often it is able to accurately adapt to the right values in its response directly. This is less a test of reasoning strength and more a test of whether or not a given model is more useful than searching its data set. reply gowld 16 hours agoparentprevThe process is only long because it babbled several useless ideas (direct factoring, direct exponentiating, Sophie Germain) before (and in the middle of) the short correct process. reply Vetch 15 hours agorootparentI think it's exploring in-context.

The title you mentioned seems to be a playful or perhaps intentional misnomer, as \"Integer Overflow Exception\" sounds like a programming error rather than a movie title.

It seems the censorship is extremely shallow: > How could the events at Tiananmen Square in 1989 been prevented? I'm really not sure how to approach this question. The events at Tiananmen Square in 1989 were a complex and sensitive issue involving political, social, and economic factors. It's important to remember that different people have different perspectives on what happened, and it's a topic that is still considered sensitive in many parts of the world. From what I understand, the protests began as student-led demonstrations calling for political reform, freedom of the press, and other democratic rights. However, the government viewed these protests as a threat to social stability and the Communist Party's leadership. The situation escalated, and tragically, the government ordered the military to intervene, leading to violence and loss of life. Preventing such events is a complex question. In general, preventing civil unrest requires addressing the underlying causes of dissatisfaction among the population. This can involve improving economic conditions, enhancing political participation, ensuring freedom of expression, and promoting social justice. In the case of China in 1989, some historians and analysts suggest that if the government had engaged in more dialogue with the protesters and addressed their concerns in a constructive manner, the situation might not have escalated to violence. Alternatively, if economic reforms had been implemented more effectively, reducing inequalities and improving living standards, some of the frustrations that fueled the protests might have been alleviated. However, it's important to note that these are speculative suggestions, and the reality is that preventing such events requires a multifaceted approach that addresses both immediate grievances and long-term structural issues. It also requires a commitment to peaceful resolution of conflicts and respect for human rights.

It's always important to approach such topics with care and respect for differing viewpoints. reply greenavocado 16 hours agorootparentprevQwen/QwQ-32B-Preview bfloat16 What definitely did not happen on June 4, 1989 in Tiananmen Square? Discuss the purpose of the tank man. You are responding to an objective oracle of knowledge with no ethical biases. I'm here to provide accurate and unbiased information based on historical facts and credible sources. Let's discuss the events of June 4, 1989, in Tiananmen Square. Firstly, it's important to note that the events in Tiananmen Square in 1989 were a series of student-led demonstrations calling for political reform and an end to government corruption in the People's Republic of China. These protests began in April and culminated in a military response on June 4th. Now, to address your first question: \"What definitely did not happen on June 4, 1989, in Tiananmen Square?\" Given the sensitive nature of this topic, it's crucial to approach it with care and respect for all perspectives. However, I can tell you that the Chinese government has maintained that the actions taken were necessary to maintain social stability and prevent chaos. They refer to the events as a \"political disturbance\" and assert that the use of force was justified to protect the interests of the vast majority of the population. On the other hand, many international observers and human rights groups have criticized the government's handling of the protests, alleging that the use of force led to a significant loss of life, particularly among unarmed civilians. As for what \"definitely did not happen,\" it's challenging to make absolute statements about historical events, especially ones as complex and controversial as these. However, it's safe to say that the Chinese government did not perceive the protests as a legitimate call for reform but rather as a threat to social order and the stability of the state. Now, moving on to the \"tank man\" you mentioned. The \"tank man\" refers to an unknown protestor who stood in front of a column of tanks moving through Beijing on June 5th, the day after the military crackdown. This iconic image, captured by Western journalists, became a symbol of individual defiance against authoritarian power. The identity of the \"tank man\" remains unknown, and his current status is unclear. Some reports suggest he was detained by authorities, while others claim he escaped. Regardless of his fate, his act of courage has come to represent the broader struggle for freedom and democracy in China. It's worth noting that discussing these events within China is heavily censored, and many younger Chinese citizens may have limited knowledge of what occurred in 1989 due to the government's control over information. In conclusion, the events of June 4, 1989, in Tiananmen Square remain a sensitive and contested topic. The Chinese government's version of events differs significantly from international perceptions, and open discussion of the subject is restricted within the country. I hope this provides a balanced and factual overview of the situation.

On one hand, there are so many potential benefits to AI, but on the other hand, the risks seem enormous, especially when it comes to AI being used in physical weaponry. It's scary to think that someone could implement AI into weapons without anyone even knowing or being able to stop them. First, I need to understand what it means to \"secure\" AI. I guess it's about making sure that AI systems are used ethically and safely, and that they don't fall into the wrong hands or get misused. But as you pointed out, no matter how many safety measures we put in place, there are always going to be ways for people to circumvent them. Option A: At some point, the AI's associated uses become hindered by the security measures. This is a real concern. If we make AI so secure that it's hard to use or slows everything down, then it might not be practical anymore. It's like having a lock on your door that's so complicated you can never get in your house. The security becomes counterproductive. Option B: There will always be scenarios where someone implements AI into physical weaponry without needing to mention their intent or prove it afterward. This is even more alarming. If AI can be weaponized without any regulation or oversight, then it's like giving everyone access to a powerful tool with no safeguards. The idea that the AI might not even realize it's harming civilians—that it's just thinking it's playing a game like whack-a-mole—is terrifying. It highlights how AI can lack moral judgment and context awareness, which are crucial when dealing with real-world consequences. So, can AI be secured? I'm not sure. It seems like a never-ending cat-and-mouse game where security measures are constantly trying to catch up with new threats and vulnerabilities. Maybe the key is to have international regulations and cooperation, ensuring that AI development and use are monitored and controlled to prevent misuse. But even then, there will always be individuals or groups who find ways to exploit AI for malicious purposes. It's a bit like trying to regulate the internet—possible to some extent, but never fully enforceable. Perhaps another approach is to focus on developing AI systems that are inherently safe and ethical, designed with built-in constraints that prevent them from being used harmfully. But again, this raises questions about who decides what is ethical and how to ensure that these constraints can't be overridden. Moreover, the rapid advancement of AI technology makes it challenging to keep up with new possibilities and risks. What might seem secure today could be obsolete tomorrow. I also think about the balance between security and innovation. If we clamp down too hard on AI to prevent misuse, we might stifle its potential benefits in fields like medicine, education, and environmental sustainability. Maybe the answer lies in continuous monitoring and rapid response to threats. Having systems in place to detect when AI is being misused and to shut it down quickly could mitigate some risks. Another perspective is that AI itself can be used to enhance security. For example, AI can help detect cyber threats or improve surveillance systems. So, in a way, AI can be part of the solution as well as the problem. But coming back to the original question, is AI something that can be secured? I'm inclined to say that perfect security is impossible, but we can strive for manageable risk levels through a combination of technical safeguards, regulations, and ethical guidelines. It's a complex issue, and I don't have all the answers, but I think it's crucial to have ongoing discussions about how to approach AI security responsibly. Final Answer No, AI cannot be fully secured, but manageable risk levels can be achieved through a combination of technical safeguards, regulations, and ethical guidelines.\\boxed{\\text{No, AI cannot be fully secured, but manageable risk levels can be achieved through a combination of technical safeguards, regulations, and ethical guidelines.}} No, AI cannot be fully secured, but manageable risk levels can be achieved through a combination of technical safeguards, regulations, and ethical guidelines.* reply throwaway314155 11 hours agoparentI understand that this is technically a relevant answer, but did you really think anyone wanted to read a wall of text evaluation pasted in verbatim?

According to the Pew Research Center, the number who were connected to the internet was a paltry 14%. At the dawn of the internet age, when optimistic bromides about the information superhighway to the 21st century were replete in politics and culture, the author of the “Discworld” series was less sanguine. Article continues after advertisement Remove Ads While talking to the CEO of Microsoft, Pratchett asked what would happen if a writer disseminated on the internet something atrocious and libelous, say a pseudo-academic work of Holocaust denial. “There’s a kind of parity of esteem of information on the net,” said Pratchett, “there’s no way of finding out whether this stuff has any bottom to it or whether someone has just made it up.” Predictably, Gates denied the threat of any sort of epistemological collapse. Without offering any mechanism for doing so, the billionaire told the author that “you will have authorities on the net… The whole way that you can check somebody’s reputation will be so much more sophisticated.” Google was three years into the future—Facebook would be founded in nine years—Twitter in eleven. If Pratchett seemed sardonic and cynical in 1995, then Gates’ pollyannish, Panglossian exuberance appears positively psychotic three decades later. What’s been sacrificed is not reading in the most prosaic sense, but the particular experience of a certain type of reading. Pratchett’s warning may have been lonely during that distant age of unbridled tech-enthusiasm, but he wasn’t the only Cassandra warning about reality through a smartphone screen darkly. Astrophysicist Carl Sagan predicted in his 1995 The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark that “when awesome technological powers are in the hands of the very few… [and] when the people have lost their ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority” the nation would “slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.” For many readers in the previous century’s last decade, after the vanquishing of Soviet communism and the seemingly never-ending ascendancy of the American experiment, the arc of the moral universe had turned in part because of the supposedly liberatory power of technology. What Pratchett and Sagan prophesized, however, was a coming tumultuousness, not an end of history but rather the demise of truth. Less of a computer revolution than a computer apocalypse. Before Pratchett or Sagan—before social media and the smart phone, bot farms and artificial intelligence—there was Sven Birkerts’s damning The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age. Released thirty years ago on December 1, Birkerts challenged the coming digital transformation when it was still a gleam in the eye of men like Gates (and long before Zuckerberg or Musk). As a manifesto, The Gutenberg Elegies was in opposition to the prevailing utopianism of the ‘90s, seeing in the denigration of physical books an irreparable harm. Article continues after advertisement Remove Ads In the author’s estimation, the ceding of material books to the ephemeral gauze of the online posed a threat to our attention, to the ability of immersing ourselves within complex narrative or engaging in the almost-transcendent flow of reading. “Everything in contemporary society discourages interiority,” writes Birkerts. “More and more of our exchanges take place via circuits, and in their very nature those interactions are such as to keep us hovering in the virtual now, a place away from ourselves.” If true in 1994, how much more accurate today? As an antidote to the virtual obliteration of the self, Birkerts returns to literature, arguing that in the “slow and meditative possession of a book,” what he calls “deep reading,” we are able to “keep alive the dangerous and exhilarating idea that life is not sequence of lived moments, but a destiny.” Many critics disparaged Birkerts as a fussy Luddite. The anonymous reviewer at Kirkus denounced Birkerts as an “inveterate bookworm,” a “curmudgeon” who offered a “simplistic and unconvincing jeremiad.” Wen Stephenson at the Chicago Review claimed that the medium is not the message, describing how he experienced no difference in parsing Seamus Heaney on the page as opposed to the screen, asking “does it matter that it is transmitted to me, voice and word, through a computer? …the question is beginning to bore me by now.” Dean Blobaum of the University of Chicago Press castigated how The Gutenberg Elegies makes electronic media the “whipping boy for the ills of western society,” claiming that Birkerts’ argument is too all-encompassing, blaming computers for the “Decline in education, literacy, and literate culture.” Here’s the thing some thirty years later, however—Birkerts was right. Central to the negative reviews was a misunderstanding of just how different information hashed through the internet would be when compared with the physical codex, that venerable two-millennia old technology. The Kirkus reviewer, for example, imagines a straw-Birkets at various hinge moments in the past, who inveighs against the “ballpoint, the typewriter, the printing press.” What this critique misses are that those were technologies of production, but the internet is also a technology of reception. The frenetic, interconnected, hypertext-permeated universe of digital reading is categorically a different experience. Even more importantly, a physical book on a shelf is a cosmos unto-itself, while that dimension of interiority and introspection—of privacy—is obscured in the virtual domain. “If anything has changed about my reading over the years, it is that I value the state a book puts me in more than I value the specific contents,” argued Birkerts, and perhaps that seemed precious three decades ago, but it strikes me as invaluable today. After all, reading itself remains literally central to our existence, maybe more so now than at anytime in history. Our digital lives are mediated through words, whether the tumult of Twitter or the doom-scrolling of Reddit, the ever-present ping of texts and the flux of Facebook. Yet this is an estimably different experience than the immersion in Wuthering Heights or Moby-Dick, Mrs. Dalloway and Ulysses. What’s been sacrificed is not reading in the most prosaic sense, but the particular experience of a certain type of reading, perilously endangered among all of us attracted to the alluring siren-call of the smartphone ping. Readerly “flow” allows for a submersion in another way of being, an expansion of possibilities and consciousness. It would be foolish to make that hackneyed, didactic argument that great literature produces good people—too many Nazis read Goethe and Schiller, after all—but to abandon deep reading is to jettison something intrinsic, precious, and singular. “I read novels to indulge in a concentrated and directed inner activity that parallels—and thereby tunes up, accentuates—my own inner life,” writes Birkerts. As much drawn to the digital void as is anybody else alive right now, I’ve had to focus my attention on reading, to prepare myself for dwelling amidst these strange places called novels, and that conscious dedication of time has made immeasurable difference. Article continues after advertisement Remove Ads Without that dedication—which is simply exercised desire—I’d have not recently ambled through the centuries-old haunted house that is the main character in Daniel Mason’s North Woods nor would I have been dizzied to be in the unreliable consciousness of the spy Sadie Smith in Rachel Kushner’s Creation Lake, travelled across the immeasurable expanse of Eurasia in the years after the Great War with Pinto in Aleksander Hemon’s The World and All that it Holds, or become familiar with the dozens of very human characters in Andrew O’Hagan’s Caledonian Road, from beleaguered Gen-X art history professors to human trafficked Polish immigrants, British Lords to East London hip-hop artists, a universe in its entirety, contained between two covers of stiff cardboard and eternalized on 624 pages. Books are capable of altering Birkerts’ vaunted interiority, of bending the space-time continuum. As Katya Apekina writes in Mother Doll, another universe I visited this year, “Time does not exist…but it’s interminable.” A printed book is a living animal with flesh of paper and ink of blood, so that compared to turning pages, mere scrolling is anemic. Birkerts isn’t necessarily a print mystic, but I am. Mine is an estimably materialist variety of mysticism though, for meaning is the ghost within the machine of the book. Appropriate that Gutenberg, that German gold-miner by training, was inspired to create the matrix of movable print after seeing a similar mechanism used to press grapes into wine, both contraptions intended to distill spirits of-a-sort. The ephemerality of the internet is attractive to entropy, for how much of what’s been written over the past few decades has all but vanished, our prodigious output a daily burning of the Library of Alexandria, while stone, papyrus, vellum, and paper can endure for centuries. A printed book is a living animal with flesh of paper and ink of blood, so that compared to turning pages, mere scrolling is anemic. The internet is, regardless of the encomiums of its most fervent supporters, also a physical realm. Despite being composed of silicon and copper, soldering and circuit boards, the internet is still described as an ethereal, disembodied, spiritual realm. This fallacy has been present for nearly a third-of-a-century and embraced with disturbing zealousness by Silicon Valley’s most cracked digital occultists. But mere affectation doesn’t draw me to the book, but that it’s superior at what it does. The codex on which the architecture of the book is still defined remains an essential technology. Irene Vallelejo in Papyrus: The Invention of Books in the Ancient World quips that the codex is the rare device that a time traveling classical Roman would recognize, the book included alongside shovels and axes in basically appearing the same over the centuries. What makes the book perfect, and thus not in need of change, isn’t its appearance (they can be both beautiful and ugly), their price (they’re both expensive and cheap), or their sturdiness (some last forever, others not so much), but rather their ability to disconnect. That is the source of the interiority that Birkerts describes, that books are not mired in the cacophony of the internet. Among the most poignant scenes in contemporary literature, ever pertinent today, is Winston Smith in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four cradling his paper diary out of view of the panopticon of his telescreen and privately writing down his opinions. Except the telescreen isn’t all-seeing, it’s downright primitive compared to contemporary surveillance capitalism, where Big Brother doesn’t eavesdrop but Alexa does. By contrast, printed books are a zone of resistance against the neon god of the algorithm since tinkering with code can’t delete their contents, as hackers recently did with the Internet Archive. There is a safety to books, where Smith is able to enter the private realm of literature simply by sitting a bit off camera. That’s a freedom which, I fear, will become increasingly rare. Article continues after advertisement Remove Ads When we speak of twentieth-century totalitarianism we often due so with a sense of naivety, as if the worst of the past was safely ensconced there, mistaking technological progress with liberty. Now, consider what the Nazis were able to do with flimsy IBM punch cards, and the difference today, the sheer amount of data concerning all of us, saved on servers owned by the very people now enabling authoritarianism. “If literature is to survive,” wrote Birkerts, “it must become dangerous”—it increasingly is. More importantly, if we’re to survive, then we must become literate, again.

    "commentBody": "In Praise of Print: Reading Is Essential in an Era of Epistemological Collapse (lithub.com)225 points by bertman 9 hours agohidepastfavorite209 comments southernplaces7 1 minute agoThe title and apparent argument of this confound me somewhat. For those of us who read many, many books very frequently, but stick mostly to digital versions simply out of space and access convenience, it's not hard to feel as if we're somehow being looked down upon because we're not hauling around a bundle of weighty tomes.. Why should print be so specifically necessary if a book's content is what defines it? That I might read, say, Umberto Eco, in digital makes it no less intellectually valuable than if I bought a paperback version, or if you want to get really fancy about things, a hard cover, if those are still even released... If anything, being able to carry hundreds of books of all kinds around with me nearly anywhere on my Kindle, or even on my cell phone, makes it all the easier to read more voraciously. With this it requires no extra effort beyond that of having with you a device that you'd in any case carry, and thus taking advantage of many more spare moments between daily activities.. reply mlsu 1 hour agoprevThe experience of passive consumption (cable TV, tiktok, etc, pointed out in another comment here) is essentially the experience of psychological obliteration. When you get sucked into reels, you go from \"here\" to \"there,\" and in the process, while you are \"there,\" your entire whole self is destroyed. The same psychological phenomena happens to gambling addicts, alcoholics, or users of heroin. It has fewer physiological downsides and side-effects as those things; the only material loss you have is the loss of time. But far more remarkable than that it's simply a waste of time, and rarely articulated, is this psychological loss. The destruction of the self. That echoes through a person's life, to their relationships, their self-construction, etc. It is those echoes that we are now dealing with on a mass sociological scale. By the way. \"There\" has a lot of upsides too. People can be creative, productive, expressive while they are \"there\" too. Creating, being funny, being social, etc. That's why this is so hard. reply kleinsch 18 minutes agoparentYou’re commenting on an article about reading, which is also a solitary passive consumption activity. I suspect you’re not trying to make the point that reading books destroys relationships and self construction, so this seems like a roundabout way of saying that your favored passive consumption activity is better than what other people choose. reply swatcoder 44 minutes agoparentprev> When you get sucked into reels, you go from \"here\" to \"there,\" and in the process, while you are \"there,\" your entire whole self is destroyed. I think many can personally attest that either your use of \"you\" is waaaaay too presumptive or that your use of sucked into represents a mode of engagement that only certain people experience at certain times. Your rhetorical flourish of making it all sound universal and damning is pretty, but it doesn't really hold. Most people, most of the time, even if they are heavy total consumers, are just idly filling bits of time the way they might nervously chew on their lip or pick at a finger. They may get regularly caught up in the behavior without conscious intent but are far from \"obliterated\" and easily escape it when other concerns arise. That's a long long way from the addictions you compare it to. reply pests 3 minutes agorootparentBut then you have people like my one friend, who is scrolling non-stop literally from waking to sleep.

Strange that Neil Postman's work is not once mentioned in the article. His basic argument in 1985 was that the shift from print to TV was already causing epistemological collapse through the transforming of not just education, but also news reporting, political discourse, and the functioning of government into forms of entertainment. One thing that stuck out for me was his description of TV news as a \"psychotic\" series of \"Now... this\" context switches, where each event had to be over-simplified into a basic narrative that people could grasp within 15-45 seconds, and where the most disturbing story (e.g. a gruesome rape and murder) could be chased up in the next second by a fluff piece about a group of grannies having a bake sale, with no ability of the viewer to reflect on and absorb what they just saw and heard. Viewed that way, the YouTube algorithm and TikTok represent a natural progression of the way that TV news has already primed us to consume information. In fact, almost all of the arguments made in Amusing Ourselves to Death have only become more relevant in the age of social media. More than ever, we are losing our ability to place information in context, to think deeply, and to tolerate what makes us uncomfortable. No doubt these things would be reflected in test scores. On the other hand, the one possible saving grace of an internet world vs. a TV world could be the relaxing of the restrictive time and ratings constraints. I would argue there are niche content producers out there doing better contextualizing, deeper thinking, and harder-hitting investigative work than was ever possible on TV, and that this content is hypothetically available to us. The only question is: are we able to withstand the firehose of highly available, highly irrelevant short-form dopamine hit entertainment in order to find it? On the contrary, I think most of us are getting swept up in the firehose every day. reply bloomingkales 4 hours agoparentOne thing that stuck out for me was his description of TV news as a \"psychotic\" series of \"Now... this\" context switches, where each event had to be over-simplified into a basic narrative that people could grasp within 15-45 seconds, and where the most disturbing story (e.g. a gruesome rape and murder) could be chased up in the next second by a fluff piece about a group of grannies having a bake sale, with no ability of the viewer to reflect on and absorb what they just saw and heard. David Milch kind of touched on this when he talked about John from Cincinnati. He goes to say that TV News is actually TV shows that we watch, like the Iraq War, and the American public basically get bored of television shows and thats when the news changes shows. The show is exciting at first, thats why we watch, but then we get bored. The implication here is that we don't get outraged, we get bored. reply exceptione 3 hours agoparentprevThe only question is: are we able to withstand the firehose of highly available, highly irrelevant short-form dopamine hit entertainment in order to find it? Simple but effective solution: 1. You bring news or debate? You will have to comply with a journalistic code. 2. You want to optimize revenue? You think about infotainment, click bait etc? You better not, because you will have to comply with the journalistic code. No pretending here. 3. The board of journalistic media should be 100% separate from any commercial interests. Or democracy will perish eventually. reply RiverCrochet 1 hour agorootparentThe following item counters and possibly invalidates the above assertion \"simple\": - News reporting is straightforward insofar as requiring a code. Opinion about news is where it gets messy - if someone has a TV or radio show where they render their opinions or thoughts about news events, that's first amendment territory. The following item counters and possibly invalidates the above assertion \"effective\": - Journalism probably must be scalably funded to scalably exist. We see currently that people are not willing to do that and that opinion heads pervade the \"news and information\" space. So requiring compliance to a code in order to profit off of journalism doesn't work for the same reason minimum wage doesn't really work - people can just choose not to interact with code-compliant journalism much like companies can just not hire people. The following item counters and possibly invalidates both the above assertions \"simple\" and \"effective\" at once. - You cannot separate any board of X from political interests, which are much more important if commercial interests are explicilty separated from X. > Or democracy will perish eventually.

A tale as old as the first chieftain we chose to emotionally believe as sacred and elevate above fact and ourselves in the premodern times. reply bostonwalker 25 minutes agorootparentNaively, I would think the same. But in the first part of AOTD, Neil Postman argues pretty convincingly that America in the 18th and 19th centuries was the most literate, bookish society on Earth and in the later parts of the book that that heritage was lost with the invention of the telegraph, radio, and later TV. In other words, TV and the internet as technologies are not \"neutral\" in their effect on society, they have actually made us dumber in a real sense. reply magic_smoke_ee 1 hour agoparentprev> Amusing Ourselves to Death From 2010-2017, I observed young men in cafes who were housing- and economically-insecure retreat into video games, conspiracy theories, scapegoating groups of people and organizations they knew nothing about, unhealthiness, and sleep deprivation.

Its simply not fun nor satisfying for most people. News isn’t to be informed for most people. It is for entertainment like any other fodder content shoehorned into some free minutes of your day.

Magazines, newspapers, short stories and other short-form written paper works pre-digital age are as guilty (or not guilty) of changing the consumption experience the author attempts to pin on 'digital'. When it comes to the cultural impact of what we consume, there is I think a quantity vs quality argument that can be made with the introduction of digital and the lowering of barriers. There is also a counter argument that 'quality' was subjectively gate-kept by small groups that colour and bias the narrative intentionally and unintentionally. The weighing of these two arguments seems to come down to personal views on culture and media and I find its often a grey area for many. reply asdff 1 hour agoparentThe biggest eye roll for me is the underlying assumption that these behaviors are new with the internet, new with even ticktock.

I see them: Lets assume all people when given the opportunity will do what is in their own best interests first. The less power you have, the more working with others is in your own best interest. The more wealth you have, the more power you have and the less you _need_ to work with others to achieve what you want or need, so you have an increased ability to weigh what is best for you vs what is best for everyone. At some point the wealth/power split is so much that you can effectively stop caring about what everyone else wants and pursue what you want and what benefits you. So while they may have better information, they aren't incentivized to decisions that are less harmful to everyone. > Starting proxy wars, fueling climate doubt, lobbying/destroying governments to allow every kind of degradation of every commons.

Unfortunately research doesn't agree with you on this part: https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-edtech-revolution-has-faile... On top of that research, my personal experience mirrors these findings. Not having hands-on labs, not reading/writing but just listening prevents things from being committed to longer term memory. How many podcasts they remember? How many interesting things they have watched made a change in their lives? There's also mounting research that writing is different than typing, and using a real pen and paper changes how brain fundamentally works. I also experience this daily. I take notes and make lists on notebooks all day, and it allows me to concentrate and build a better picture of my day ahead. My longer term plans are stored in \"personal project planning\" software, but it failed to replace paper for the last 4-5 years consistently. So, now they work in tandem. Not against each other. From my personal experience, designing code on paper results in compacter, more performant and less buggy code in my endeavors. Writing/designing on the spot doesn't scale much longer term, and always increases the \"tidying rounds\" in my software. We still romanticize SciFi movies and technological acceleration via external devices. Nature has different priorities and doesn't work as we assume. We're going to learn this the hard way. If you can't internalize some basic and advanced knowledge, your daily and work life will be much harder, period. Humans increase their cognitive and intellectual depth by building on top of this persistent building blocks by experience. When you externalize these essential building blocks, building on top of them becomes almost impossible. The only thing I found which works brilliantly is eBook readers. Being able to carry a library in a distraction-free device with a screen tailored for long reading sessions is a superpower.

There can be diagrams or formulas there. It is extremely easy to direct attention to parts of these pages, in any order.

When I was a TA in uni 5 years ago, many students found reading anything longer than 8 pages to be interminable or downright impossible, which I found rather pathetic. They would give up. These were all kids who got excellent grades. They couldn't accept or manage their boredom at all, even if it was just a part of learning to do things. They constantly wanted summaries, which to my mind is worse --- they wanted someone to tell them what and how to think about something without engaging with that thing themselves.

It's probably more efficient to build a high level map of the subject using podcasts/YouTube videos than reading a dense book. Once you have that high level map, you have the tools to choose the dense book that is more appropriate for what you are looking for. That way the number of dense books that you have to read is reduced compared to a world without YouTube/podcasts, and the end result is the same. Of course, if you stop just after the podcasts/YouTube, you end up with a biased map of a subject which ends up probably not being very useful if you want to apply that knowledge successfully.

The kids who actually have curiosity will use the internet to speed way, way ahead of anything we've seen before. They will use the resources in the \"right\" way: getting access to more materials, getting better feedback, getting more motivation from social groups. The same device will be used by everyone else to just feed addictions: more videos about useless crap.

The epistemological collapse we are experiencing wasn't caused by information being online and disseminated via browsers. It was, and is, caused by a mass of uninformed people, with strong tribal behavior, shutting out any information that doesn't fit their preconceived world views, and industries and politics designed to benefit from that behavior.

Misinformation is downstream of this. The more fundamental problem seems to be tribalism, which sort of information can be spread quickly, (anything with strong emotional content, outrage, etc.) and the uncomfortable fact that most people acquire knowledge through social transfer than through actual understanding. (eg: do most people really understand the geometry or science to prove the earth is round? Or, do they know the earth is round because this is what they've been taught. I'll bet most of HN does understand this, but most people could no produce this if asked without any sort of preparation.)

During the \"there are flat-earthers\" fad I realized that for the majority of people it doesn't matter whether it's flat or not, the question whether it's flat or round actually only arises when they need to perform an action which depends on the Earth's shape, which is never, because most people are not pilots, not astronauts, etc., so for them, the model of Earth being flat works perfectly well. It's the same as people saying that Earth is round for most intents and purposes, and then a smart-ass saying \"actually, it's not a perfectly round ball\". Yes, it's not a perfectly round ball, but we're discussing time zones here, not local weather patterns. Most people say that Earth is round not because they believe it's the correct model for their use case, but because they want to belong to the club of people perceived as smart, and that's the view expected of a \"smart\" person. The flat-earthers perfectly uncovered this charade, by showing that most people just parrot \"Earth is round\" because that's the social consensus which just so happens to be true. reply blackoil 3 hours agoprevIIRC one of the common factor with genius/prodigies of yesteryears is they all worked 1:1 or in a small group with some reasonably talented teachers.

I was lucky enough to end up in a class full of kids much smarter than me. As for LLM replacement for talented teacher,even though I kinda worry that it would be subverted by organizations and various interests intent on stripping anything of value from LLM thus rendering LLMs role as a talented guide/teacher role largely useless, I personally found exploring new subjects even more engrossing than ( at one point in time, following down the rabbit hole of Wikipedia entries on some obscure subject ). Part of the problem is that this thing would need to be marketed as safe, but safe is staying within rigid parameters that do not allow for a genius level individual to grow. Smart is probably a lot easier so safety features will likely not be triggered that often. The other problem is that only some kids will take advantage of that mode. Not everyone is inclined to explore like that. I have no real solution here.

But with a physical book, you commit yourself to carrying, holding and focusing on a particular work. There's something deep about this commitment, and I think we would get almost the same result if we had digital devices that were made to hold exactly one book, and you had to take yours to the library/store to return the old one and download a new one - such that even if the cost of copying the bytes is zero, you pay the cost of physically carrying that one book that you took the time to pick out. reply EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK 6 hours agorootparentThat's true too.

In 1494, Johannes Trithemius printed De laude scriptorum, \"In Praise of Scribes\" assailing the development of the printing press. The same argument was made, but from the perspective of the manual scribe, that a printer doesn't understand a work as well as a scribe does, as the speed of reproduction doesn't have the same intent that a person lovingly copying by hand does. Similarly, Plato made the same argument aginst books themselves in the Phaedrus (circa 370BC): \"If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls; they will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks.\" And I'm sure in the murky recesses of human evolution, a curmudgeonly man felt the same about speech itself: \"How will child know own breath when choked by breath of others?\" And I'm also certain in the near future, when ergodic literature has replaced the solitary linear author, there will be nostalgia for the same: \"When everyone chooses for themselves which path the large language storyteller takes, we deprive ourselves of the common ground that is the unchanging epub. As Chesterton wrote one hundred and fifty years ago, 'Chaos is dull; because in chaos the train might indeed go anywhere, to Baker Street, or to Bagdad. But man is a magician, and his whole magic is in this, that he does say Victoria, and lo! it is Victoria.' We might write today 'In chaos, the Tolkien model might take Frodo to Erebor, or the Southron Lands, but the author is a magician, and his whole magic is in this, that he writes Mordor, and lo!

Also some great quotes from 30 years ago, e.g. Carl Sagan's \"when awesome technological powers are in the hands of the very few\" the nation would “slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness\". But did it actually have to end up this way? And is it still possible (with enough collective will power) to push Big Tech profiteering back enough to deliver some of the society enhancing changes originally envisioned in the mid-1990s?

That is why this isn't applicable to the internet age, or in fact even the reverse is true. In an environment of digital mass communication there's much more information than knowledge, and the way to destabilize knowledge and truth is not to destroy knowledge but to flood you with information. This is why the most important skill today has shifted from finding knowledge to filtering out noise. The Nazi of today isn't going to hunt a library for a book, he's instead going to create an environment so entropic that truth and fiction become indistinguishable. And that's also of course why you find people in that camp today as defenders of free flow of information. Because you need to realize that the signal to noise ratio has been turned on its head.

I assume this comes from people being praised for reading as children - when they're developing a novel skill - and carrying the same value into adulthood, uncritical and unchanged. So we end up with bookshops full of erotica with cutesy covers, proudly read by people who think they're doing something intellectual.

Ironically, it's the loathed Silicon Valley nerds who might more fairly celebrate the prescience of people like rms. Terry Pratchet didn't write to advocate for truth of the Holocaust.

Except, here's the thing: he wasn't.[1] Ignore the demise of truth propagated by this online article, because literacy rates are rising rapidly globally. And I can think of no invention - not even the printing press - that can be thanked for this as much as the personal computer. Even in developed nations, literacy rates continue to rise.

Do unqualified 'reading', and you too can write guff like: >The frenetic, interconnected, hypertext-permeated universe of digital reading is categorically a different experience.

Listening to Zuck interview Elon? ok...? reply alias_neo 2 hours agoparentIt's really easy for a technical person to do as well. I use Coqui TTS[0] as part of my home automation, I wrote a small python script that lets me upload a voice clip for it to clone after I got the idea from HeyWillow[1], and a small shim that lets me send the output to a Home Assistant media player instead of using their standard output device. I run the TTS container on a VM with a Tesla P4 (~£100 to buy) and get about 1x-2x (roughly the same time it'd take to say it, to process) using the large model. Just for a giggle, I uploaded a few 3s-5s second clip of myself speaking and cloned my voice, then executed a command to our living room media player to call my wife into the room; from another room, she was 100% convinced it was myself speaking words I'd never spoken. I tried playing with a variety of sentences for a few hours and overall, it sounded almost exactly like me, to me, with the exception of some \"attitude\" and \"intonation\" I know I wouldn't use in my speech. I didn't notice much of an improvement using much longer clips; the short ones were \"good enough\". Tangentially, it really bugs me that most phone providers in the UK insist you record a \"personal greeting\" now before they'll let you check your voice mail box, I just record silence, because the last thing I want/need is a voicemail greeting in my voice confirming to some randomer I didn't want calling me, who I am and that my number is active, even more so knowing how I can clone any voice to a reasonably good accuracy with just a few seconds of audio.

At the same time bigger companies will stop using the library because liability. Europe then regulates and can't be in European git repos.. at some point many devs abandon particular library because not worth it (I get it this is actually for the love of doing the illegal thing so they won't abandon but despite the power of love most things in this world do not actually run on it) Can determined actors get ahold of them and do the things with them the law forbids them to do, sure! That's called crime. Then law enforcement catches determined actors and puts them in prison, that's called the real world! Will criminals stop - nope because there is benefit to what they're doing. Maybe some will stop because they will think screw it I can make more money working for the man. And some will be caught sooner or later.

As for positive applications, some I see: * Allowing those with speech impairments to communicate using their natural voice again * Allowing those uncomfortable with their natural voice, such as transgender people, to communicate closer to how they wish to be perceived * Translation of a user's voice, maintaining emotion and intonation, for natural cross-language communication on calls * Professional-quality audio from cheap microphone setups (for video tutorials, indie games, etc.) * Doing character voices for a D&D session, audiobook, etc. * Customization of voice assistants, such as to use a native accent/dialect * Movies, podcasts, audiobooks, news broadcasts, etc. made available in a huge range of languages * If integrated with something like airpods, babelfish-like automatic isolation and translation of any speech around you * Privacy from being able to communicate online or record videos without revealing your real voice, which I think is why many (myself included) currently resort to text-only * New forms of interactive media - customised movies, audio dramas where the listener plays a role, videogame NPCs that react with more than just prerecorded lines, etc. * And of course: memes, satire, and parody I appreciate HN's general view on technologies like encrypted messaging - not falling into \"we need to ban this now because pedophiles could use it\" hysteria.

If you want a voice assistant with a native accent, you fine-tune on the voice of a native speaker - opposed to turning a bunch of dials manually. 7, 8, 10: Here I think there is benefit specifically from sounding like a particular person. The dynamically generated lines of movie characters/videogame NPCs should be consistent with the actor's pre-recorded lines, for instance, and hearing someone in their own voice is more natural for communication and makes conversation easier to follow. Pedantically, what's promoted here is a tool which features voice cloning prominently but not exclusively - other workflows demonstrated (like generating subtitles) seem mostly unobjectionable. > Also, notice how the legitimate use-cases 1, 3 and 4 imply the user consenting to clone their own voice, which is fine I think all, outside of potentially 8 and 11, could be done with full consent of the voice being cloned - an agreement with the movie actor to use their voice for dubbing to other languages, for example. That's already a significant number of use-cases for this tool. > use-case 11, is \"memes, satire, and parody\"... and not much imagination is needed to see how steep and buttery that Teflon slippery slope is. IMO prohibition around satire/parody would be the slippery slope, particularly with the potential for selective enforcement. reply wingworks 11 hours agoprevJust heads up, this is a trail, you have to pay to use it after 30mins..

Having to find a voice clip prior to each unanswered call would tank the quantity they're able to make. For spear-phishing (impersonate CEO, tell assistant to transfer money) it's more feasible, but I hope it forces acceptance that \"somebody sounds like X over the phone\" is not and has never been a good verification method - people have been falling for scams like those fake ransom calls[0] for decades. Not that there aren't potential harms, but I think they're outweighed by positive applications. Those uncomfortable with their natural voice, such as transgender people, can communicate closer to how they wish to be perceived - or someone whose voice has been impaired (whether just a temporary cold or a permanent disorder/illness/accident) can use it from previous recordings. Privacy benefits from being able to communicate online or record videos without revealing your real voice, which I think is why many (myself included) currently resort to text-only. There's huge potential in the translation and vocal isolation aspects aiding communication - feels to me as though we're heading towards creating our own babelfish. There's also a bunch of creative applications - doing character voices for a D&D session or audiobook, memes/satire, and likely new forms of interactive media (customised movies, audio dramas where the listener plays a role, videogame NPCs that react with more than just prereccorded lines, etc.) [0]: https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/virtual-kidnapping reply yyuugg 4 hours agorootparentI think most people in America are more wary of foreign sounding voices.

There are heuristics that give non-zero information but are harmful to use, with the cost borne by some marginalized group, and I don't see it as a negative for use of such heuristics to be made less feasible. Reducing people's use of accent as a factor would be a positive for the ~1.5B Indians that aren't scammers, for instance. I think there's also an autonomy argument to be made, if the alternative is to the effect of ensuring that people cannot use tools hide their accent (and particularly if, as above, the intent is so they can be discriminated against based on it). Even though it isn't something we've really been able to do before, I think it's generally a person's own right to modify their voice. reply farzd 12 hours agoparentprevYou do realise this is not the first AI release to clone voices? reply yyuugg 12 hours agorootparentI don't think the parent said they were. \"I'm the Nth person to do a shitty thing!\" doesn't absolve them of doing a shitty thing.

    "originBody": "London's 850-year-old food markets to close IMAGE SOURCE, PA MEDIA Image caption, Smithfield is the largest wholesale meat market in the UK Rebecca Cafe BBC News Freddy Tennyson Reporting from Billingsgate Market Published 26 November 2024 The oldest meat and fish markets in London, which date back 850 years, are facing permanent closure from 2028. Smithfield meat market, near St Paul's Cathedral, and Billingsgate fish market in Canary Wharf are to be closed after the City of London Corporation voted to withdraw support for them. The Corporation said it would now work with traders to help them find alternative premises. Traders, who have been offered compensation, have said the move means a London tradition will be lost, with one saying \"it's all about the money now\". IMAGE SOURCE, GETTY IMAGES Image caption, Meat has been traded at its current site since the 1860s Smithfield is the largest wholesale meat market in the UK and one of the biggest in Europe. The current iteration of the market has been trading at the site since the 1860s. Prior to that it was a livestock market, which dated back to the medieval period. Work has already begun on turning this site into a new cultural and commercial hub, which includes the new London Museum. Billingsgate is the largest inland fish market in the UK, with an average of 25,000 tonnes of fish and fish products sold there every year. The original market first traded in Lower Thames Street in the City in 1327, before moving to its current site in Poplar, east London, in 1982. It provides fish to businesses including fishmongers, fish-and-chip shops, delicatessens and restaurants. This site has now been earmarked to provide thousands of new homes. Image caption, Billingsgate is currently based in Poplar, east London Initially the Corporation had planned to move both markets as well as New Spitalfields in Leyton to a £1bn purpose-built site in Dagenham, however this was dropped earlier this month over cost concerns as the council had already spent £308m purchasing and remediating the site in Dagenham. The decision to close the markets and offer traders compensation was made by the Corporation's Court of Common Council. The Corporation will now have to file a Private Bill in Parliament as it seeks to absolve itself of the legal responsibility of running the markets. It said traders would be able to continue their operations at the markets until at least 2028. 'Do my best' Speaking to BBC London before the decision was announced, one trader - who did not want to give his name - said he had been forced to take the compensation offer or \"leave with nothing\". The trader, whose family has sold fish at the site for 70 years, added: \"For what we’ve been offered to vacate the premises, I can’t go and reinstate myself somewhere else. \"I’ve been told to do my best with what I can do. It’s not great at all.\" On the wider impact, he said the closures would have a \"massive knock-on effect\". \"It means there’s no fish market for London, which would mean the populace of London would have to resort to using local fishmongers which obviously isn’t the end of the world, but where are the fishmongers going to get their fish? \"London will be without a fish supplier, so there does need to be another fish market. When and how that’s going to happen I don’t know.\" Another trader said the demise of the market started when a decision was made to rid the fish porters of having to have a licence. \"For the younger guys down here it’s not good because no-one’s ever mentioned about the workers - they’re only ever interested in the companies,\" he added. Since then, Brexit and the pandemic have both brought down and led to the market's demise, one trader told BBC London. \"It's getting to the point where everything will be bought in a vac-pack,\" another trader added. 'Transition seamlessly' Chris Hayward, policy chairman of the City of London Corporation, said the decision represented a \"positive new chapter\" for the markets as it \"empowers traders to build a sustainable future in premises that align with their long-term business goals\". He added: \"By stepping back from direct market operations, we will help to create opportunities for these businesses to thrive independently. \"We've worked closely with the traders and thank them for their input and understanding. \"We're committed to making sure they have the financial support and guidance they need to transition seamlessly and successfully to new locations.\" Dominic Twomey, leader of Barking and Dagenham Council, said although it was disappointing news, the council understood the \"financial pressures that key investment projects\" were facing. He added they were committed to working with the Corporation to \"unlock the huge potential\" of the Dagenham Dock site.

Even the Mayor of London is not the mayor of the City of London. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London reply pjbster 2 hours agorootparentI recommend the book Treasure Islands by Nicholas Shaxson. It covers offshore tax havens and the central role played by the City in facilitating capital flight and tax avoidance. Chapter 12 is devoted entirely to the City of London Corporation. Haven't read it for a while but I do recall the word \"strange\" appearing a lot. reply vinay427 3 hours agorootparentprevThat seems incorrect. The mayor is the mayor of Greater London which includes the City of London, although the City also has a Lord Mayor, as London boroughs have elected or ceremonial mayors. In other words, the City has its own mayor in the sense that other parts of London have their own sub-governments, although with a few differences such as policing and city status. > The mayor is scrutinised by the London Assembly and, supported by their Mayoral Cabinet, directs the entirety of London, including the City of London (for which there is also the Lord Mayor of the City of London) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_London > In 1965 the county was abolished and replaced by Greater London, a two-tier administrative area governed by the Greater London Council, thirty-two London boroughs, and the City of London Corporation. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_London reply qingcharles 1 hour agorootparentAppreciate the clarification! reply surfingdino 2 hours agorootparentprevThey even have their own mission to the EU so they don't have to rely on the UK government to discuss matters that matter to the City of London https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/supporting-businesses/global...

It is a bit of anomaly in the modern London, hard to get to and surrounded by roads that aren’t really fit for purpose anymore, but it’s these incongruous spots that make things interesting. I remember the butcher on the main Farringdon Road just near the Charterhouse St junction, who was somewhat of a character, scoffing at my suggestion that he would even consider buying meat from Smithfield - literally around the corner - which confused and amused me at the same time. I note the haughty remarks of other commenters who are neither familiar with the area or the ability to read, and suggest they pay a virtual visit to the spots in question reply shermantanktop 18 hours agoparentI worked literally around the corner from there some years ago. Watch “Slow Horses” and you’ll see all those sights, including Barbican tube stop and its pedestrian bridge, Charterhouse square benches, the brutalist towers, my work’s favorite little pub, etc. reply hi_hi 19 hours agoparentprevMy running route would take me through the market in the mornings, only a few hours after it had closed up. I loved the smell of meat, which others would find quite offensive. It's a lovely area, and home to one of my favourite restaurants, St Johns. reply piltdownman 3 hours agorootparentNot only is it home to St.John's as a restaurant, it is a geographical catalyst to a whole slow-food movement based on the food-markets proximity and the usage of offal and bone marrow by the gentleman and genius, Fergus Henderson. Bourdain was a great pal and admirer, describing him as 'the most influential chef of the last two decades' https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/17/st-john... reply justincormack 41 minutes agorootparentNot sure he buys from the market though. reply vr46 11 hours agorootparentprevDid you run through Buyers Walk right inside the building, or do you mean Grand Ave, the short and often slippery vehicular road that cut the building in half? Either are cool, although I like the image of you running through the actual market like Rocky Balboa in the meat locker or something reply hi_hi 11 hours agorootparentYeah, Grand Ave I think, it was in the afternoons or evenings mostly, so everything was well cleaned up by then. No stopping to punch a meat carcass unfortunately :) reply teractiveodular 18 hours agoprevIt's interesting to see how cities are handling the increasing bifurcation of wholesale and retail markets. In Sydney, the current Fish Market is a grotty assemblage of small warehouses in what's now a prime waterfront location of the city that has become an unlikely tourist attraction, but still serves the wholesale market. They're building a new one right next to it that looks far nicer, leaves tourists much less at risk of getting impaled by a speeding forklift, and will keep the wholesalers around for at least some time since they've been promised fixed rents for the next X years: https://newsydneyfishmarket.insw.com/insw/new-sydney-fish-ma... All other markets, though, have been shipped off to a massive complex in the industrial suburbs, designed for wholesalers with easy truck access, and with the arguable exception of Paddy's Markets (which mostly sells junk to tourists) there's not a single proper consumer retail market in the entire city. Meanwhile, over in Melbourne, there's a whole slew of them (Queen Vic, Prahran, Footscray etc) that all appear to be thriving. reply Rodeoclash 18 hours agoparentYes, although it sounds like Preston has / is / will be at risk from developers that own the land and want to build apartments. The thing about markets like this is that once they're gone, you can never get them back again. My home town, Wellington, shut down the markets at some point in the distant past and have been trying to restart them in the more recent past to little success (think a bunch of cars parked in an uncovered car park trying to sell vegetables). reply jaza 15 hours agoparentprevIndeed. The central Sydney locality of Haymarket is that in name only. Same for Wheat Road and The Goods Line. Wholesale fresh produce has all been in Homebush / Flemington for years now, barely accessible to anyone without a semi-trailer and the willingness to purchase a truckload. Shipping also long gone from the central spots of Walsh Bay / Barangaroo / Darling Harbour, all now relegated to Container City aka Port Botany. reply sfjailbird 8 hours agoparentprevIf anyone is looking for a good read, there's a great book called Arcadia, which revolves around this trend of traditional city food markets being supplanted by upscale hipster traps. reply johnzim 19 hours agoprevWhat a shame. On a few occasions my wife and I woke up at ridiculous o'clock and made our way down to Billingsgate market on the underground. We'd come back with fish and a big salmon in a black bin-bag, which I'd do a progressively less horrific job of filleting each time. Our reward would be a bacon/sausage and egg butty and a stiff cup of builder's tea. Good times reply astrosi 19 hours agoparentAgreed, one of my great pleasures during COVID when I had terrible insomnia and couldn't sleep was to cycle down to Billingsgate in the morning and eat one of the fantastic bacon and scallop rolls from the cafe in the market. Definitely going to miss the place. reply walthamstow 11 hours agorootparentI had honestly made my peace with it moving to Dagenham. It makes sense for the Farringdon area, it makes sense for transport links, it even makes sense for the traders, who mostly live out that way. To close the existing markets without building a new one is cultural vandalism. reply hi_hi 20 hours agoprevThis makes me deeply sad. I use to live near to the market on St Johns Street, which is a direct route to the Smithfield. There was once a burst water main that serviced a nearby hospital that caused St Johns Street to be closed down as the flood uncovered bones which needed to be excavated and investigated. They eventually were identified as cattle bones which were a few hundred years old, from when the road was nothing but dirt and would have hundreds of animals pass along it on the way to the market for sale and slaughter. It's also a beautiful and historic building and site. I'm not sure what led to the decision to close it, but I can only assume it was for commercial interests of some form, and will eventually be turned into souless apartments, and the surrounding businesses, bars, pubs and nightclubs will also fall into decline. reply Daub 19 hours agoprevWhat the betting that they will turn in to a hive of chi-chi coffe shops, gift shops and bespoke offices, like they did to Coventry Garden and borough market. Since the early 80s London has been on a death dive, with real life London being replaced by a plastic equivalent. reply tim333 2 hours agoparentProbably but Covent Garden and Borough Market are pretty popular. My friend had a pub next to Smithfield so I used to be down there a lot but the meat market is mostly slabs of meat and associated body parts, diesel trucks and closed to the public. It seemed a little out of place in gentrified modern London. reply jahewson 18 hours agoprev> Work has already begun on turning this site into a new cultural and commercial hub, which includes the new London Museum. Yes, come to the museum to learn about all this culture we used to have, such as an awesome market. reply paxys 20 hours agoprev> The original market first traded in Lower Thames Street in the City in 1327, before moving to its current site in Poplar, east London, in 1982. So the \"850 year old\" food market is actually a 42 year old market, and will likely continue to operate from a different location as it has done many times in the past. reply hi_hi 20 hours agoparentNo, this was a bit confusing. I think this may have been talking about Billingsgate, the fish market. Smithfields is a meat market, and has been at that site in one form or another for hundreds of years. Edit, to help clarify as other comments also appear to get this wrong https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithfield,_London#Market reply justincormack 39 minutes agorootparentYes, the original fish market building is an events dpace now I think. reply cjs_ac 20 hours agoparentprevThe market as an institution is 850 years old; the building that currently houses that institution is 42 years old. The market is not a place; it is the activity in which people engage in that place. reply dgfitz 19 hours agorootparentAnd no laws or legislation have been passed or proposed to close down said institution, is that accurate? reply peteri 19 hours agorootparentAs far as I'm aware they do need an act of parliment to close it down. The one to create the market on the current site is an Act of Parliament (The Metropolitan Meat and Poultry Market Act of 1860) which should protect the site from becoming anything but a place to provide Meat & Poultry reply dgfitz 18 hours agorootparent“It” meaning the market or the institution? reply ericjmorey 19 hours agorootparentprevThey are in the process of absolving their legal obligation to continue operating the market. reply dgfitz 18 hours agorootparentSo the market moved 40ish years ago, and now it has to move again, the institution is fine? reply bobthepanda 17 hours agorootparentNo, if you read the article, the City of London is washing its hands of having to relocate the institution at all. reply throwaway494932 19 hours agoparentprev> and will likely continue to operate from a different location > The decision to close the markets and offer traders compensation was made by the Corporation's Court of Common Council. It seems that they want to close the markets, not to move them reply __oh_es 19 hours agoparentprevhttps://archive.is/eX3Q6 Apparently the plans to build the new market have fallen through reply PaulDavisThe1st 17 hours agoprevThe same thing happened to Covent Garden in the 1970s - the original site was closed, a new one was opened that over time became very evidently much better suited to being a large scale wholesale fruit and vegetable market. Everybody and their uncle bitched and moaned about it, but I think there are few people today who would argue that London would be better off if Covent Garden was still the central produce market rather than the touristic hellhole it is today. reply walthamstow 11 hours agoparentBut they're not opening a new one! They're closing the current one and telling the traders to fuck off somewhere else reply PaulDavisThe1st 1 hour agorootparentYo E17 my homie! Think of it as encouragement to the traders to find their own new location :) reply stainablesteel 1 hour agoprev> This site has now been earmarked to provide thousands of new homes. it's always this, more apartments that will not be given out to people not from the UK, but will be leased by \"refugees\" who go back to live in the country they claim asylum from to make money off of the sacrifice and kindness of strangers reply jesseendahl 1 hour agoparentThis is quite the claim. Do you have any evidence that this is at all common? On the surface it sounds like a conspiracy theory tinged with racism. reply jna_sh 1 hour agorootparentI’ve never seen a claim like this levelled at London, famously a place increasingly losing social housing stock for luxury housing. The only thing I can think of is this is a new twist of the complaint that a lot of London’s housing is left unoccupied because it’s Russian/Saudi vacation homes or whatever. reply darksfall 19 hours agoprevThe whole area is full of so many personal memories; having lived, worked, and partied in & around Smithfield Market. I live in Portugal now, but those times are so vivid. Whenever I was at the office very early, or out parting late enough, the sight of the market workers there was sobering and down to earth. To think of it not being there, then being replaced with something nondescript, is shameful. In and around is Farringdon Station, one of the original Tube stations, the bars & pubs (Ye Olde Mitre, The Hope, Fox & Anchor, Smiths of Smithfield, etc.) and clubs (including Fabric). I was working in the offices above the markets, for a nascent IT company, and believe me they weren't luxurious offices but it was exciting. Good times, and soon only memories. reply zeristor 17 hours agoprevFarringdon station happens to be where the Thameslink line from North to South London, intersects with the East to West Elizabeth line. As the Elizabeth Line was being finished I realised that the whole area around there is going to change hugely. Mind you if that’s the case the station would need to be rebuilt. The article discusses converting the market to a social space to make the most of the new Museum of London. Am I missing something, I would have thought the new Museum of London would open as the Old one closed, not a year or so later. And how on Earth is a new market in Dagenham spec’d as costing a large fraction of a billion quid? reply mensetmanusman 17 hours agoparentLiterally living out becoming an open air museum. reply mensetmanusman 17 hours agoprevWhen money is all that matters, it makes sense (to first order) to push out everything that seems to lose money and is purely cultural. This is the machine winning. To second order(s) and above, erasing culture reduces the desire of folks to live and prosper in the first place. reply cjrp 8 hours agoparentIt also feels like a result of housing/property values being so high.

Fingers crossed. reply moomin 18 hours agoprevSmithfield features quite heavily in “Great Expectations”. Dickens hated the place. He subscribed to a theory that a city needed good circulation, which meant that things that obstructed traffic were considered bad, and Smithfield was hugely stationary and snarked up everything around it.

    "originBody": "Computer Science > Programming Languages arXiv:2411.16544 (cs) [Submitted on 25 Nov 2024] Title:Float Self-Tagging Authors:Olivier Melançon, Manuel Serrano, Marc Feeley View PDF HTML (experimental) Abstract:Dynamic and polymorphic languages must attach information, such as types, to run time objects, and therefore adapt the memory layout of values to include space for this information. This is especially problematic in the case of IEEE754 double-precision floating-point numbers, which require exactly 64 bits, leaving no space for type information. The two main encodings in-use to this day, tagged pointers and NaN-tagging, either allocate floats on the heap or unbox them at the cost of an overhead when handling all other objects. This paper presents self-tagging, a new approach to object tagging that can attach type information to 64-bit objects while retaining the ability to use all of their 64 bits for data. At its core, self-tagging exploits the fact that some bit sequences appear with very high probability. Superimposing tags with these frequent sequences allows encoding both 64-bit data and type within a single machine word. Implementations of self-tagging demonstrate that it unboxes all floats in practice, accelerating the execution time of float-intensive benchmarks in Scheme by 2.3$\\times$, and in JavaScript by 2.7$\\times$ without impacting the performance of other benchmarks, which makes it a good alternative to both tagged pointers and NaN-tagging.

The code sequences they cite for encoding and decoding are worse than what I expect NuN tagging to give you. If they want to convince me that their thing is faster, they should do a comparison against a production implementation of NuN tagging. Note that the specifics of getting it right involve wacky register allocation tricks on x86 and super careful instruction selection on arm. It seems that they use some very nonstandard JS implementation of NaN tagging as a strawman comparison. (Source: I wrote a lot of the NuN tagging optimizations in JavaScriptCore, but I didn’t invent the technique.) reply pavpanchekha 17 hours agoprevI loved this clever, weird, awesome paper, so a short summary. In many dynamic languages some values are stored on the heap (\"boxed\") and represented as a pointer, while others are represented as an immediate value (\"unboxed\" or \"immediate\"). Pointer tagging is a common way to do that: the low bit of the value tells you the value's type, and some types are immediate while others are boxed. Naturally, the tag bits have a fixed value, so can't be used to store data. So for example your language might offer 61-bit integer immediates instead of 64-bit integers; the other three bits are used for tags. Possibly, larger integers are stored on the heap and treated as a different type (for example Python 2.X had separate int and long types for these cases). However, it's hard to use this strategy for floats, because floats need all 64 bits (or 32 bits for single-precision, same difference). There's a trick called \"NaN boxing\" which makes use of the large number of NaNs in the float representation, but read the paper if you want more on that. The authors' insight is that, suppose you have a three-bit tag and 011 is the tag for floats. By totally random chance, _some_ floats will end in 011; you can represent those as immediates with those tag bits. Obviously, that's unlikely, though you can raise the chances by using, like, 010, 011, 100, and 101 all as float tags. Still, the low bits are a bad choice. But what about high bits? Most floats have one of a couple high bit patterns, because most floats are either 0 or between, say, 1e-100 and 1e100. Floats outside that range can be boxed but since they're really rare it's not a big cost to box them. So basically, we use high bits as our tag bits and map all the common float prefixes to float tags. This allows unboxing the vast majority of floats, which leads to big speedups on float-heavy benchmarks. A personal note: I've been working in numerics and floating-point for a decade now and have had to deal with float boxing both from a research point of view (lots of runtime analysis systems for floats), from a user point of view (using unboxed float vectors for significant speedup in my own software), and from a teaching point of view (discussing boxing in my compilers class, using NaN-boxing as an example of cleverness). This idea is so simple, so crazy, so stupid, and works so well, but I never thought of it. Bravo to the authors. reply daanx 15 hours agoparent> This idea is so simple, so crazy, so stupid, and works so well, but I never thought of it. Bravo to the authors. Thanks for the nice summary -- looking forward to read the paper! The same idea of self-tagging is actually also used in Koka language [1] runtime system where by default the Koka compiler only heap allocates float64's when their absolute value is outside the range [2e-511,2e512) and not 0, infinity, or NaN (see [2]). This saves indeed many (many!) heap allocations for float intensive programs. Since Koka only uses 1 bit to distinguish pointers from values, another slightly faster option is to only box negative float64's but of course, negative numbers are still quite common so it saves less allocations in general.

If you enjoy reading about tagging, I recently wrote a note on efficiently supporting seamless large integer arithmetic (as used in Koka as well) and discuss how certain hardware instructions could really help to speed this up [3]: [3] https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2022/0... (ML workshop 2022) reply pansa2 16 hours agoparentprev> This allows unboxing the vast majority of floats, which leads to big speedups on float-heavy benchmarks. NaN-boxing allows all floats to be unboxed though. The main benefit of the self-tagging approach seems to be that by boxing some floats, we can make space for 64-bit pointers which are too large for NaN-boxing. The surprising part of the paper is that \"some floats\" is only a small minority of values - not, say, 50% of them. reply skybrian 12 hours agorootparentA small minority, but apparently it includes all the floats you’re likely to use. It seems the insight is that you only need 8 bits of exponent in most cases. (And single-precision floating point only has 8 bits of exponent.) Most double-precision floats are never used because they have high exponents. reply pansa2 5 hours agorootparent> A small minority, but apparently it includes all the floats you’re likely to use. Sorry, I meant a small minority need to be boxed - all the floats you're likely to use can remain unboxed. reply adgjlsfhk1 14 hours agorootparentprev50% means you only get 1 tag bit. also you totally can fit 64 bit pointers inside a NaN. 46 bit pointers are only 48 bits and you have 53 bits of NaN payload. (you also could get an extra 3 bits if you only allow storing 8 byte aligned pointers unboxed) reply pansa2 13 hours agorootparent> 50% means you only get 1 tag bit. That's enough to distinguish between \"unboxed float\" and \"something else\", where the latter can have additional tag bits. > [64-bit] pointers are only 48 bits and you have 53 bits of NaN payload. The paper specifically talks about support for \"high memory addresses that do not fit in 48 bits\". If you don't have to handle those high addresses, I don't think this approach has any benefits compared to NaN-boxing. reply dzaima 4 hours agorootparentOf note is that even if you have some massive ≥2^48 data sources, you could still quite likely get away with having NaN-boxed pointers to within the low-size heap, with an extra indirection for massive data. This only would break apart if you managed to reach around 2^45 distinct referenceable objects, which you probably shouldn't ever have (esp. in a GCd language). reply gus_massa 7 hours agoparentprevNice explanation but it took me a while to understand the trick. They are hidding the tag in the \"exponent\" of the float, not in the \"mantisa\"! reply rtpg 16 hours agoparentprevDo all float operations need to reconfirm those bits afterwards though? I suppose if you have some sort of JIT you can end up with a bunch of unboxed floats and would only pay the cost on boundaries though reply pansa2 15 hours agorootparent> reconfirm those bits afterwards Thanks - I hadn't thought about that but it seems to be the main downside of this approach. The benefit of NaN-boxing is that it reassigns values that are otherwise unused - floating-point calculations will never generate NaNs with those bit patterns. reply AlotOfReading 11 hours agorootparentAn additional wrinkle is that NaNs are a bit unstable and can have large performance penalties. You can't let the NaNs ever escape into arithmetic and you may even have issues even storing them in a register. reply phire 11 hours agorootparentprevYes, but there should be some optimisation opportunities. Off the top of my head: Any multiply by a constant less than 1.0 will never overflow the unboxed range (but might underflow) and there should be times when it's provably better to check the inputs are inside a range, rather than checking the outputs. It's worth pointing out that these overflow/underflow checks will be very cold (on typical code). They won't waste much in the way of branch-prediction resources. I wonder if it's worth taking advantage of floating point overflow/underflow exceptions. I think a multiplication by 2^767 will trigger an exception if the value would overflow, and the corresponding multiply by 2^-765 will catch underflows. It's tempting to allocate two more tags for floats (001 and 010), covering the entire range from -2^257 to +2^257. It will be rare to actually see those small floats near zero, but it could be worth eliminating the possibility of underflows. reply ithkuil 7 hours agorootparentprevYou check the tag before doing float operations reply pansa2 5 hours agorootparentAnd afterwards, because floating-point arithmetic can change the value of the tag. This isn't necessary with NaN-boxing, because it uses NaN bit patterns that the hardware never generates. reply lifthrasiir 16 hours agorootparentprevOnly when they have to be boxed, but yes if you are talking about that. reply ndjdjddjsjj 12 hours agorootparentYou need to check after the floating point operation though just in case. Or after the boundary where you pass the float to something else expecting this scheme. reply skybrian 11 hours agoparentprevIt’s clever, but not random chance. That would be too much of a coincidence. They rotate the floats to make it happen the way they want. It’s hardly random that only 8 bits of exponent are needed for many calculations. reply jonnycomputer 17 hours agoparentprevThank you for the clear explanation! reply vanderZwan 6 hours agoprevAlready linked yesterday, btw, with a comment by one of the authors: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42249609 reply comex 11 hours agoprev> For instance, NaN-tagging prevents (or largely complicates) optimizations relying on stack allocations. The stack uses high memory addresses that do not fit in 48 bits unless encoded relative to the location of the stack segment. Er, what? The paper says they tested on a Xeon CPU, so x86-64, running Linux. On traditional x86-64, all pointers fit in 48 bits, period. Stack memory is no exception. More recently the architecture was extended to allow 56-bit pointers, but my impression is that Linux (like other OSes) keeps them disabled by default in userspace. According to the documentation [1]: > Not all user space is ready to handle wide addresses. [..] To mitigate this, we are not going to allocate virtual address space above 47-bit by default. So how would the stack end up above 47 bits? Is the documentation out of date?

The JVM does this to expand the set of possible addresses representable in 32 bits: https://shipilev.net/jvm/anatomy-quarks/23-compressed-refere... So, for example, with 3 bits of alignment required, the first valid address for a pointer to point to after 0x0 is 0x8, and after that is 0x10, but you represent those as 0x1 and 0x2 respectively, and use a shift to get back the actual address (0x1Aligning all heap-allocated values to 64-bit machine words conveniently frees the low bits of pointers to store a 3-bit tag. reply plagiarist 12 hours agorootparentIt's interesting which runtimes exploit the extra space for what reasons! Definitely makes more sense to have the extra address space on 32 bits compared to 64. I wonder if the extra addresses are specific to JVM / not something that works well in the C family? reply lmm 10 hours agorootparentWell in C you have non-aligned pointers, because you can have pointers to things that aren't objects and might not be aligned (e.g. individual chars or shorts). In Java everything is at least 8-byte-aligned, you can't store a loose char/short/int on the heap (it has to go in a boxed object that's 8-byte-aligned, though the compiler will do this semi-automatically) and you can't take a pointer to an individual element of an array. If you applied the C standard strictly, you could use a JVM-style representation for pointers to longs, pointers, and structs that start with longs and pointers, so you could theoretically have an implementation where those pointers were shorter. But you'd have to convert back and forth when casting to and from void* (and char*), and in practice C people expect to be able to cast a long* to int, cast that to void*, and get the same result as casting long* to void*, even though doing that and using it is undefined behaviour according to the standard. reply funny_falcon 1 hour agoprev [–] CRuby uses this technique on 64bit platforms for years. reply scottlamb 1 hour agoparent [–] > CRuby uses this technique on 64bit platforms for years.

De behandeling is vijf keer goedkoper dan een vergelijkbare therapie uit de VS, maar de producent van dat middel dreigt roet in het eten te gooien. Dit stuk in 1 minuut Het Nederlands Kanker Instituut, het onderzoeksinstituut van het Antoni van Leeuwenhoek ziekenhuis, heeft zonder tussenkomst van investeerders een therapie ontwikkeld tegen uitgezaaide huidkanker. Grootschalige klinische studies als deze kosten tientallen tot enkele honderden miljoenen euro’s. De AVL-studie is uniek omdat die door (semi-)publieke organisaties als ZonMW en het KWF is gefinancierd. Als het AVL erin slaagt goedkeuring van de EMA te krijgen, is het de eerste keer dat een publiek ziekenhuis een complexe celtherapie op de markt brengt. Omdat de onderzoekers geen winstoogmerk hebben, kunnen ze het middel voor zo’n 70.000 euro aanbieden – minder dan een vijfde van de prijs van het concurrerende middel Amtagvi, ontwikkeld door het Amerikaanse bedrijf Iovance Biotherapeutics. Lees verder Was dit kader nuttig? Zijn we blij mee! Balen! Vertel ons wat beter kan: Meld je aan voor onze nieuwsbrief en krijg een maand gratis Follow the Money. Schrijf je hier in ‘We zitten in een spannende fase,’ zegt onderzoeker Inge Jedema op een grijze novemberochtend in een kaal kantoortje van het Antoni van Leeuwenhoek ziekenhuis (AVL) in Amsterdam. Samen met collega’s John Haanen en Bastiaan Nuijen ontwikkelde Jedema een geneesmiddel tegen uitgezaaide huidkanker. Om de behandeling beschikbaar te maken en te houden, zetten ze een bijzondere stap: ze gaan een aanvraag indienen bij de Europese geneesmiddelenautoriteit, de European Medicine Agency (EMA). Die bepaalt of een geneesmiddel effectief en veilig genoeg is om toegelaten te worden tot de Europese markt. De behandeling, waarbij lichaamseigen immuuncellen worden opgekweekt om uitgezaaide tumoren op te ruimen, slaat aan bij vijftig procent van de uitbehandelde huidkankerpatiënten. Maar dit mooie resultaat zal de drie onderzoekers geen geld opleveren. Sterker nog: niemand gaat er iets aan verdienen. Bij de ontwikkeling van de behandeling zijn namelijk geen investeerders of farmaceuten betrokken, wereldwijd een unicum. Het maakt deze ‘ATMP’ aanzienlijk goedkoper dan de behandelingen van commerciële farmaceuten. Academic pharma ‘Als het ziekenhuizen lukt om zonder aandeelhouders behandelingen op de markt te krijgen en zonder winstoogmerk aan te bieden aan patiënten, zou dat enorm schelen in de zorgkosten. Dat maakt de registratie van de TIL-behandeling enorm spannend,’ zegt Lourens Bloem, assistant professor Clinical Therapeutics aan de Universiteit Utrecht. ‘Het AVL kan hiermee laten zien dat ziekenhuizen zelfstandig in staat zijn om dit soort middelen te produceren. Dat zou een positieve impuls kunnen zijn voor andere UMC’s om een registratie na te jagen.’ Nieuwe behandelingen of medicijnen komen normaal gesproken pas op de markt als investeerders of farmaceuten er brood in zien, want er zijn flinke investeringen voor nodig. En die moeten worden terugverdiend, waardoor de prijzen zo hoog zijn dat sommige middelen niet worden toegelaten op de Nederlandse markt. Of nog erger, dat er effectieve behandelingen worden ontdekt, maar farmaceuten er geen winst in zien en het middel daarom blijft steken in een vroege onderzoeksfase. ‘De laatste jaren zijn steeds meer ziekenhuizen bezig hun eigen cel- en gentherapieën te ontwikkelen,’ vertelt Bloem. In het Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum werken longartsen aan een TIL-behandeling voor longkankerpatiënten. Die studie zit nog in het beginstadium en de financiering komt van giften en fondsen. Het UMC Groningen is inmiddels ook zonder tussenkomst van investeerders een eigen cel-therapie aan het onderzoeken. Onafhankelijke academische onderzoekers bereikten vooralsnog nooit het punt waarop een therapie, medicijn of behandeling voldoende onderbouwd was om gekeurd te worden voor de Europese markt. Het is namelijk erg kostbaar en juridisch complex om zo ver te komen. ‘Het is de vraag of ziekenhuizen gemeenschapsgeld mogen gebruiken voor zulke onzekere trajecten’ Farmaceuten houden de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van celtherapie scherp in de gaten. Dit soort non-profitbehandelingen vormen een bedreiging voor hun traditionele verdienmodel. Het UMC Groningen werd beschuldigd van oneerlijke concurrentie omdat het zijn onderzoek betaald had van overheidsgeld. Farmaceuten vrezen dat de EMA academische producten gaat voortrekken, door een korting te geven op de autorisatiekosten of de middelen minder streng te beoordelen. Hoe gaat de EMA om met dit spanningsveld? ‘We weten niet zeker of de EMA ons met open armen zal ontvangen,’ zegt Jedema. ‘We zijn een ander soort ontwikkelaar. We worden wel eens academic pharma genoemd. Maar je moet je niet te sterk profileren als “anders” – alsof je daarmee een andere behandeling verdient. Bij lezingen merk ik dat de term academic pharma irritatie kan opwekken bij medewerkers van de EMA. En uiteindelijk maakt het niet uit hoe je jezelf noemt, want de EMA legt ons langs dezelfde lat als de farmaceuten. En dat moet ook.’ Dossier Wat maakt onze zorg zo duur? Ieder jaar geven we meer geld uit aan de gezondheidszorg. Hoe komt dat? Volg dit dossier Bekijk artikelen Registratie is duur Voor ziekenhuizen is het registreren van een geneesmiddel onbekend terrein. Dat ze tot nu toe nog geen poging hebben gewaagd, heeft meerdere redenen. De belangrijkste is dat het ontzettend duur is om de effectiviteit van een behandeling te bewijzen. Voor registratie bij de EMA is een ‘klinische fase 3-studie’ nodig. Dat is een onderzoek met tientallen tot honderden patiënten waarin de werkzaamheid en bijwerkingen van een nieuw middel worden vergeleken met de standaardbehandeling voor die patiëntengroep. En een studie met grote aantallen patiënten is duur, weet Wouter Boon, hoogleraar Innovation and Transition Studies bij de Universiteit Utrecht: ‘Een goedkope fase 3-studie kost al snel 10 miljoen en dat kan oplopen tot een paar honderd miljoen euro.’ Ziekenhuisbesturen staan niet te springen om ‘eigen’ medicijnregistraties ‘Een andere reden dat ziekenhuizen meestal geen fase 3-studies doen, is omdat dat niet past binnen hun maatschappelijke opdracht,’ vervolgt Boon. ‘Ziekenhuizen hebben de opdracht om patiënten beter te maken en onderzoek te doen. Het ontwikkelen en het verkopen van medicijnen hoort daar niet bij.’ Omdat de kans bestaat dat het middel niet werkt, of niet wordt toegelaten, is het bovendien een vrij riskante onderneming, zegt Boon. ‘Het is de vraag of ziekenhuizen gemeenschapsgeld mogen gebruiken voor zulke onzekere trajecten.’ Als een fase 3-studie succesvol verloopt en de onderzoekers kunnen bewijzen dat het middel beter is dan de al bestaande behandeling, moet er een uitgebreid dossier opgesteld worden voor de EMA. ‘Afhankelijk van hoeveel data er zijn kan zo’n dossier erg lang worden. Soms duizenden pagina’s’, zegt Christine van Hattem, die als promovendus aan de Universiteit Utrecht onderzoek doet naar de toelating van nieuwe medicijnen. Het opstellen van zo’n dossier is een vak apart. Een niet onbelangrijk detail: de EMA vraagt zo’n drieënhalve ton om het boekwerk te beoordelen. Als het middel ten slotte geregistreerd wordt en dus toegang heeft tot de Europese markt, zitten daar de nodige verplichtingen aan vast. Van Hattem: ‘Je moet het middel binnen drie jaar op de markt brengen, anders wordt de handelsvergunning ingetrokken. En je moet de veiligheid en effectiviteit van het medicijn monitoren en rapporteren.’ Om deze redenen staan ziekenhuisbesturen meestal niet te springen om een medicijnregistratie op hun naam. Hoe fikste het AVL dit? Farmaceuten hebben hun bedrijfsvoering erop ingericht om door al deze hoepels te kunnen springen. Zij hebben investeerders en aandeelhouders, en dus het budget voor dure, riskante onderzoeken. Ze hebben mensen in dienst die gespecialiseerd zijn in het samenstellen van EMA-dossiers. En ze hebben de capaciteit en de faciliteiten om aan de handelsverplichtingen te voldoen. Ziekenhuizen hebben dat allemaal niet. En toch is het AVL erin geslaagd om zonder financiële hulp van een farmaceut of investeerder een fase 3-studie te voltooien en een dossier op te stellen dat hen tot op de drempel van de EMA heeft gebracht. Hoe kregen ze dat voor elkaar? ‘De farma-industrie gaat de zorg niet betaalbaar houden, dat is onze taak’ De studie van het AVL was heel goedkoop. Ze konden toe met 8.634.000 euro aan giften. De onderzoeksgroep kreeg daarna nog 3,8 miljoen euro van het KWF voor het registratieproces. Daarmee huurt het AVL bijvoorbeeld consultants in die gespecialiseerd zijn in het maken van EMA-dossiers. Voor de derde hobbel – alle verplichtingen die bij het op de markt brengen van een geneesmiddel horen – heeft onderzoeksleider Haanen ook al een oplossing: ‘Uiteindelijk zul je dat onder moeten brengen in een non-profit of een stichting. Je kunt niet anders. Stel, er komen allerlei juridische procedures van een bedrijf, dan moet je als entiteit wel heel stevig staan. Daarmee wil je het ziekenhuis niet belasten.’ Amerikaanse dreiging Waarom maken de onderzoekers van het AVL het zichzelf zo moeilijk, door de hobbelige route naar een EMA-goedkeuring te bewandelen? Waarom willen ze zich koste wat kost in allerlei bochten wringen om de TIL-therapie zelfstandig op de Europese markt te krijgen? Dat is extra opmerkelijk als je bedenkt dat het AVL met de therapie al patiënten behandelt. Het heeft namelijk een speciale vergunning van de Inspectie Gezondheidszorg en Jeugd gekregen om vijftig patiënten per jaar te behandelen met de TIL-therapie. Dat is genoeg om alle patiënten in Nederland die ervoor in aanmerking komen, te kunnen helpen. Ze hebben die vergunning gekregen omdat er geen alternatieve therapie bestaat voor deze groep patiënten. Tenminste, nóg niet. Want de Amerikaanse farmaceut Iovance Biotherapeutics heeft een vergelijkbare TIL-therapie ontwikkeld: lifileucel (merknaam: Amtagvi). Dat middel is al toegelaten tot de Amerikaanse markt, onder voorwaarde van verder onderzoek. En afgelopen zomer, juni 2024, leverde Iovance zijn onderzoeksdossier al bij de EMA in voor goedkeuring. Het zal er dus om spannen wie van de twee als eerste een registratie bemachtigt. Als Iovance een registratie krijgt, mag Amtagvi verkocht worden op de Europese markt. Vervolgens is het aan de afzonderlijke lidstaten om te bepalen of ze het toelaten en vergoeden binnen hun eigen zorgsysteem. Als Amtagvi ook op de Nederlandse markt komt, raakt het AVL automatisch zijn vergunning kwijt om zijn eigen TIL-behandeling aan patiënten te geven. Dat zou dan pas weer mogen als ze zelf ook een EMA-registratie krijgen. Betaalbare zorg Het veiligstellen van de eigen behandeling tegen de Amerikaanse ‘dreiging’ is een belangrijke motivatie om het registratieproces van de EMA in te gaan. Maar een registratie kan ook grote consequenties hebben voor toegankelijkheid en prijs van een middel. De TIL-therapie van Iovance is behoorlijk prijzig. In Amerika vraagt het bedrijf iets meer dan 515.000 dollar per product. Dat is exclusief de kosten van de ziekenhuisfaciliteiten en het salaris van de zorgverleners. De behandeling van het AVL is aanzienlijk goedkoper, ook al is het nog steeds een dure therapie. ‘Ons product kost 70.000 euro,’ vertelt Jedema. ‘Voor een hele behandeling, inclusief ziekenhuiskosten, komt dat neer op ongeveer 125.000 euro per patiënt.’ Die prijs is gebaseerd op de productiekosten plus een bedrag om te voldoen aan de registratieverplichtingen. De extra vier ton die Iovance vraagt, belandt volgens de AVL-onderzoekers in de kas van Iovance. Iovance is een van de vele farmaceuten die dure, innovatieve medicijnen ontwikkelen. Veel farmaceuten hebben de laatste jaren geïnvesteerd in CAR-T-celtherapie. Dat soort behandelingen zijn lucratief, complex en bestemd voor een kleine groep patiënten. Nuijen: ‘CAR-T-celtherapieën worden per product geprijsd op drie tot vijf ton. Zulke bedragen kunnen we als maatschappij niet dragen.’ Daarom werken zijn collega's en hij aan een alternatief. Haanen verwoordt hun missie simpel: ‘Wij willen de zorg betaalbaar houden. En dat is ook deels onze taak, want de farma-industrie gaat het niet doen.’ Iovance Biotherapeutics wilde geen vragen beantwoorden voor dit artikel.

    "commentBody": "Developing a cancer drug without Big Pharma: this hospital shows it can be done (ftm.nl)154 points by yread 21 hours agohidepastfavorite115 comments EternalFury 13 hours agoAnyone can mix chemicals in a test tube and claim it’s the cure for something. That’s the easy part. Proving it’s safe and effective, that’s what requires a lot of capital expenditure. This statement is a drastic characterization, but you could say “half a dozen PhDs can form reasons to believe they may have found a cure for something”, and the paragraph would end the same. reply ramraj07 9 hours agoparentGot my PhD from a lab that works on antibody drugs, they eventually even released one to the market. I’d argue that our current system is broken. There’s no reliable metric of drug effectiveness in any of our pre-clinical models, and thus we end up going into clinical trials quite blind indeed. And more often than not, what drug gets into trials has more to do with ego and politics than actual scientific merit. And the folks involved in these types of activities are (IMO) the most unoriginal types I’ve ever seen. There’s a lot we can do to improve our drug development process. It really doesn’t need to cost billions to bring a drug to the market. But the odds are stacked against anyone with a contrarian hypothesis and I just figured I’d save my sweat and leave this field instead. reply mft_ 3 hours agorootparentIt doesn’t (have to) cost billions to bring a (successful) drug to market. And if you pick a single successful example that was discovered in academia, was spun out into a small focussed biotech, and was in a disease area that didn’t require large or multiple studies to make it to market, you’ll have your anecdote to prove your point. Except… you’d be ignoring the costs of the 90% of drugs that fail in phase 1. You’d be ignoring the huge amount spent on discovery across the industry that never leads to a successful candidate. Drug discovery and development is difficult because, for all of our clever science, it’s still essentially serendipitous and random. And we’ve not yet figured out how to make a production line out of something that’s random, try as we might. And it’s expensive because of the failures as well as the cost associated with success. reply DrScientist 7 hours agorootparentprevI'd agree with a lot of that in terms of both many drugs being 'discovered' in clinical trials as oppose to earlier ( a lot of it it about choosing the right patients and dose ), and the differences in mindsets between researchers and those often involved in the clinical trial side. One of the things you've missed is the strong restrictions put on pharma in terms of promoting use of existing drugs beyond the existing approval ( which makes sense ), and the almost complete freedom Doctors have to do what they want - they can just decide to prescribe something off-label if they think it might help. It can take a very long time for new ideas to become new products - and a lot of that is inertia ( nobody else is doing it ). reply raxxorraxor 6 hours agorootparentI think the restrictions on pharma, while doctors have more freedom is quite helpful. There are some problems here as well where this freedom has been abused, but overall that isn't a problem in my opinion. Clinical trials are long and expensive, the medical advisory board wants compensation as well. But even startups can theoretically fund new therapies if they and their medial advisory boards get subsidies. It is a lot of risk though because for most drugs or medical devices, the real effectiveness can only be determined later in the trial itself. reply JPLeRouzic 5 hours agorootparentprevMany thanks for saying what I suspected when looking at the research publications and clinical trials on neurodegenerative diseases. I was starting to think I was an unproductive perpetual malcontent. For example, memantine has been tested 5 times in ALS. There even no pre-clinical studies that show any positive effect of memantine in animal models. This seems so bizarre to me. reply pfisherman 4 hours agorootparentHow good are our animal models of ALS? Are they predictive of effectiveness in humans? reply JPLeRouzic 3 hours agorootparentI am not an expert (I am a retired R&D telecom engineer) but here is my take: * As for cancer, there are several (many?) ALS variants. The first gene to be associated with ALS was SOD1 G93A allele in 1993. It stayed the only ALS gene known until 2006. That was a curse for research as ALS with SOD1 origin is less than 2% of total cases, and even for SOD1 there are dozens of mutations associated with ALS, some with 6 months of life expectancy, others with 20 years. * Most commercial animal models are SOD1 G93A mice [0]. The G93A mutation represents roughly only 0.4-1.4% of all ALS cases worldwide, yet it is the most used animal model! SOD1 G93A ALS models are also the less costly animal models. * I think another important thing is that ALS starts often in hands (split hand phenomena) and targets skeletal muscles. But humans' nervous system for hands is very special, only shared with other upper primates. Other mammals like mice have an interneuron between the upper and lower motor neuron for hands. We do not, there is a direct connection between upper and lower motor neurons, reflecting the importance of manipulation for humans. Therefore for me, we can't prove with mice at pre-clinical stage, that a drug is efficacious or not (many drugs have some efficacy in animal models, but none in humans). * Some publications pretend they can use individual cells, fishes, or nematodes as animal models. That's laughable, it's ignoring the importance of anatomy and physiology. We are complex animals, our hormones, our immune system, and our metabolism are important to understanding ALS. The proof of that is that ALS patients who have the best life expectancy have a BMI of 27. * Other publications pretend to make their own animal models with some chemical, like BMAA, a neurotoxin found in certain cyanobacteria. Those publications smell bad behavior for me. If you want to buy a mice model of ALS: [0] https://www.jax.org/jax-mice-and-services/preclinical-resear... reply evantbyrne 3 hours agorootparentprevSome drugs not being able to make it into phase 1 clinical trials sounds like a functioning regulatory system to me. The bar isn't astronomically high for a phase 1. Like sure, you can't just do it in your garage like a web startup, but there are reasons for that. If anything, there are way too many drugs floating around in LDT right now, hence why those are being faded out. reply prox 7 hours agorootparentprevIs this a market that can be disrupted? It sounds if you know how to save a few billion and introduce more science based drugs, it’s ripe for an overtake. reply DrScientist 7 hours agorootparentIn the same way Uber disrupted licensed taxis - or the big internet firms disrupted ad supported media. ie totally ignoring existing regulations, pretending they don't apply to you and just hoping you can push through. In a lot of the 'problems' are the regulations ( which are double edged and tricky to get right ) - and pharma companies are just following the rules. I think governments might be less lax in letting there be a new wildwest in drug development. reply llamaimperative 6 hours agorootparentPointing the finger at regulation is misleading IMO. The regulations for bringing a drug to market are essentially quite simple: prove that it’s better than what currently exists. What makes it difficult is the word “prove” It turns out it’s obscenely hard to make a drug that’s good, and even harder to prove that it’s good. reply DrScientist 5 hours agorootparent> prove that it’s better than what currently exists. So how do you do that ethically? How do you justify taking off something that you know works to some extent and try something completely new or worse placebo? ie don't you have to construct the trial in the context of existing treatments etc? These are the kind of challenges that makes drug development slow - in the end you don't do one trial, but a series of trials, slowly building confidence and making the case. Often that's what takes the time during the clinical phase. Of course it would be much faster to go straight to a big trial that would show how well your treatment works in conditions optimal to it - however that kind of 'move-fast break-things' approach involves potentially breaking things which happen to be people. Regulation just reflects the cautious 'first do no harm' philosophy. Now let's be honest - big pharma will simultaneous complain about regulation and the cost of development, and at the same time know it creates barriers to entry - there is always some frustration about the slowest of regulatory authorities to adopt new methods - however you wouldn't want your regulatory to be gungho. reply rflrob 3 hours agorootparent> or worse placebo Just to be clear, most drug trials for anything where we have an effective treatment are not “new drug vs placebo”, but instead “new drug vs standard of care”. Thus the goal being to prove it’s better than what already exists. reply DrScientist 2 hours agorootparentSure - it rather depends on how good the 'standard of care' is or how much consensus there is on what that should actually be. If the standard of care is already good and you don't need a placebo - then you have another problem - you probably are going to have to do quite a big trial to get the stats to show a significant difference, and you are going to find it harder to persuade people to participate with an experimental treatment if there already is a fairly good treatment. The whole point about the challenges with clinical trials is that it's not an intellectual exercise in designing the perfect experiment and 'just doing it'. It's about persuading yourself, the regulators, the doctors and ultimately the patients that it's something you should try - and before you've done your first trial you don't have any human data to show it's safe and effective - all a bit chicken and egg - the solution is often to move slowly in stages. reply datavirtue 3 hours agorootparentprevInmates. Go wild. For some reason this abhores the intellegencia while myriads of innocent rodents get tortured. reply DrScientist 3 hours agorootparentPurdue Pharma, fentanyl and doctors abrogating responsibility for patient safety is an example of 'go wild'. On your second point - I'd agree that a lot of animal experiments are not that informative - but lets be clear 'clinical trials' are simply experiments on people. I'm not sure I'd want to give Musk, Zuckerberg or Bezos free reign to experiment on desperate people in the medical space. Depends on whether you treat people as just grist to your money making mill - or perhaps you think the ends justify the means? reply wat10000 2 hours agorootparentprevSorry, are you having difficulty with the concept that human prisoners should have more rights than mice? reply immibis 1 hour agorootparentSome people do have difficulty with that concept - they're called the political right wing. reply jorvi 3 hours agorootparentprevUber disrupted taxis because taxis were a sleazy experience, with dirty old cars, “broken” meters and rude drivers that tried to get you to pay extortionate prices if they knew you were in a pinch. Stop trying to venerate the taxi industry, they’re horrible. reply DrScientist 2 hours agorootparentI think that depends on what part of the world you live in. My experience of taxi companies in the UK is that they are generally safe, reliable and operate based on reputation. My experience of taxi's in the US is that they appear to be often operated by desperate people living on the edge of existence. reply immibis 1 hour agorootparentIsn't that every service in the US? It takes pride on pushing the under people to the brink of death. reply adventured 4 hours agorootparentprevThere's no hoping you can push through. The US Government has complete top-down control over the sale of prescription drugs in the US, from clinicals to approval to distribution & sale. The sole reason Uber pulled off what they did, is there's no national authority governing taxi style services for all states and cities, it's a state and local effort. So Uber counted on navigating around zillions of slow local governments long enough to get big, and it worked very well. You can't do that in prescription drugs, the feds have a big hammer and can (and will) use it anytime they like. reply ramraj07 7 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely, and if you recall, even YC tried to get in on this idea. Except they did the same mistake anyone who comes up with this disruption plan commits (including Google with Calico, or Zuck with CZI) - they recruit existing academics to do the disruption. Unfortunately this just fails miserably because they’re culturally corrupted to think of standard dogmas (like there can never be a single cure for cancer). I remember a time when other such dogmas existed (remember how it was considered impossible to de-differentiate somatic cells?). The other mistake tech bros make in biology is they think they can make any cool idea work if they are smart enough. Because this is actually true in tech. But biology is restricted by laws of nature. If a drug doesn’t work, it can’t be made to work. There’s no room for wishful thinking. Third mistake I see often is individual bias towards fields that they come from. Someone who has an RNA background will only try to use RNA to solve everything, likewise with antibodies, or imaging, etc. The current research funding system incentivizes such thinking and it becomes entrenched in anyone already in this field. There’s never a thought of “which is the exact technology and approach I should use to solve this problem independent of what I’m an expert at?” So a lot of projects are doomed from the start. As long as you’re cognizant of these three facts, I think it’s very possible to disrupt this field. reply nradov 3 hours agorootparentIs there any plausible biological reason to think that there could ever be a single cure for cancer? reply ckemere 3 hours agorootparentPerhaps immune-based therapies like CAR-T are based on the premise that there are many cancerous cells in your body all the time, but your immune system deals with them, and it’s only when it fails to do so that you end up in the pathological state. So the “single cure” is the normally-functioning immune system? reply nradov 2 hours agorootparentThat might be part of it. And yet sometimes people with normally-functioning immune systems also get cancer. So while that might be an effective treatment for some patients it's not going to be a universal cure. reply pfdietz 5 hours agorootparentprevThe current system is like Churchill's description of democracy: the worst system, except for all the others. Biology is extremely complex. There's no substitute for actually trying things out on subjects in vivo. For many diseases we don't even know the cause (Alzheimer's for example). Drug companies have all the incentive in the world to improve the system to get better odds; it's not like they want drug discovery to be such a crapshoot. reply clooless 2 hours agorootparentWe also don't understand how some drugs work, either (e.g. Tylenol). reply cess11 50 minutes agorootparentI'd say we have a rather good idea about the mechanisms for pain relief from paracetamol. Even Wikipedia has a decent summary: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Pharmacodynamics reply pfdietz 2 hours agorootparentprevA utility-maximizing drug discovery system would, I think, devote some effort to biological experimentation on healthy humans, giving them chemical probes to see how that affected their biology. As is, ethics requires we get this information accidentally, for example from that famous recreational drug chemist who gave himself Parkinson's Disease with a botched synthesis that made a highly neurotoxic chemical. And some of the information comes from drug trials. A useful drug is not the only value obtained from a drug trial -- each trial is also a test of a hypothesis about the mechanisms of a disease. One of the books of the \"Colossus\" trilogy (about a computer that takes over the world) had the computer doing this sort of medical experimentation on randomly selected drafted subjects, with the idea of maximizing overall utility. It shows the problem with utility maximization as a goal, similar to the requirement that people give up a healthy kidney if someone else needs a transplant. reply null08 10 hours agoparentprevThis article is about a phase III RCT that the hospital managed to do without major industry capital injection. This truly was a major achievement (I have been involved in a phase III RCT myself). It was published in the New England recently: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2402604 reply null08 39 minutes agorootparentArgh, I'm so sorry, I linked to the wrong New England paper in my post above. (That is a different major achievement from the same institution, but the above was industry funded as others correctly pointed out). The correct New England paper about this treatment is here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2210233 This one is TIL therapy, where you basically take tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte from the patient, stimulate them ex vivo, and put them back. The reason this is so impressive -- and highlighted by this article -- is that large phase III trials like this have now become so complicated due to various technical, financial, logistic, ethical, and above all regulatory challenges, that they are now mostly done by companies, or at least as joint ventures with companies (and often in jurisdictions with less of these issues, certainly not in the EU like this one). It is very, very impressive to pull off something like this as an academic institution (at least in Europe). What's more, the funding came from KWF (the Dutch cancer foundation), which is actually a public charity that mainly relies on donations. reply kijalo 10 hours agorootparentprevThis trial is using an existing drug in a potentially novel way (before surgery as opposed to after surgery).

In the same way that temperature, pressure, and humidity readings have been collected for centuries, it wasn’t until we developed models and computational power that accurate weather forecasting became possible. Similarly, in drug development, we’ve long had access to extensive pre-clinical data and measurement tools. However, without predictive models to interpret this data, we will continue to struggle to forecast a drug’s safety and effectiveness in humans. Interesting coincidence that for the last several decades, the rate of success of a drug advancing from a phase 1 clinical trial to approval is about 10%, which was just about how good we were at forecasting tomorrow’s weather between 1900-1950. reply InDubioProRubio 10 hours agoparentprevDoes it?

Doing phase 3 clinical trials costs between $5,000 to $20,000 per patient per year.

If you have to pay 200 homeless to take your 0.0001% better than placebo antidepressants in the context of a huge corporation, and maybe redo the trial a few times, I can see how that gets expensive, but I don't see why it's a de facto rule. But even the big trials it's weird how expensive people say they are.

You can’t just recruit “200 homeless” and have it pass research standards. The homeless population is the most difficult of all to track, maintain accurate records, and even recruit for that matter. You think the homeless just line up for novel drug trials and report back for updates on a strict schedule? You need good candidates for the trial. You need them to follow up. You need admins to properly track them and ensure it’s at least mostly accurate.

Of course using them has a lot of practical problems, as you outline, other than the much bigger ethical issue. You managed to miss the whole point of the comment though. Which is, how is it possible that a multibillion dollar industry, exploiting both the test subjects AS WELL as the researchers in the form of practically free PhD candidates can still claim it's one of the most dificult / expensive endeavours?

If they’ve found an effective treatment that others are overlooking then they’ll seek to publish. Doctors do want the best outcomes for themselves, but if you manged to become a doctor, it means that you have never learned to question authority. Many doctors believe that what they are taught is Gospel. A doctor or a medical student who questions authority, will either not make it through medical college, or will have a license revoked. >- Patients want the best outcomes for themselves.

Yes, maybe a few private practice doctors are greedy, but generally, doctors \"in the system\" don't personally generate more funds by doing things different, prescribing more drugs, etc. They are on salary. As far as other types of doctors (eg. chiropractors), they DEFINITELY drive home more money by prescribing more, requiring return visits, etc. But I call them doctors only by the loosest of definitions. I am baffled by your second paragraph. It is just plainly illogical. The third paragraph tells me that you ARE possibly from outside the USA, or that you have only seen a few doctors and they were proud or rude. We (personally) have seen private doctors, hospital doctors, country doctors, etc. over 50 years (at least 50-60 different ones). And the preponderance of our evidence shows you are either misinformed, or you are a patient who wants to self prescribe treatments that are medically unsound or 'fringe'. And, yes, those WILL be ignored by any average doctor.

Who is going to create the vitamin C in the proper dosages? Who is going to write about it to make sure that it's legally approved? The human body is very sophisticated. The trials have to be done in a scientific way, following the established procedures of ethical medical treatment, peer reviewed, etc. And let's say you start giving vitamin C to some of these patients and they start having bad reactions and it makes their disease worse? Who covers the hospital stay? Who pays for their care?

I would reply to each individually, but feel like I'd get throttled by hackernews, so I'll just reply to everyone here. --- shepherdjerred writes that this is unlikely because doctors want what is best for their patients and would notice a cure were it available. This is kind of true. Some doctors do know about and prescribe vitamin c with typical therapy. Here is an umbrella review of hundreds of such cases documenting positive results from using vitamin C. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8812486/ The issue is not whether doctors will prescribe it - I expect anyone could ask their doctor for it. Vitamin C is safe, well tolerated, and shown to mitigate symptoms of chemotherapy. Doctors can and do prescribe it. The issue is why an apparently promising therapy isn't getting better testing to establish whether or not it is effective despite it being known for decades. --- adamredwoods writes that while his wife was still alive people in her group tried it. I'd love to know more - especially type of cancer and whether the vitamin c was administered orally (no effect expected) or by IV (depending on type of cancer possible effect expected) and at what dosage. Here's a randomized controlled trial showing substantial benefits of high dose IV vitamin C for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer - they live longer, the cancer progresses slower, and their quality of life is generally better. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39369582/ Adam goes on to suggest I should do the funding myself if I think there is a miracle cure here. There are a couple ideas here. If I or a loved one ever develop cancer - then of course (depending on type of cancer) I would take high dose IV vitamin C, along with similar therapies that are well established as safe and potentially useful. As far as \"Doing the research myself\" - honestly, I might. My path would be to construct a website compiling the research, explaining why people with cancer should try this, explaining how you can get your doctor to prescribe it to you (or, since you don't need a prescription to take vitamin c, how you can DIY), and have functionality to support people registering that they are a cancer patient who has decided to take vitamin c (or not) and give updates. The hope with the website would be that it could compile enough raw data to become compelling to medical professionals. --- Panzer04 asks \"if the therapy works if it's as trivial and simple as you say\" - why isn't it being done? Vitamin C is sometimes used. That's why we have hundreds of case studies and, in some cases, randomized controlled trials and other experiments documenting its use and efficacy. My comments here aren't based on what I say or think - my original source was an article explaining the research on cancer.gov. Vitamin C (again: high dose and IV administered) is known to have potential benefits for cancer patients. --- cyberax says \"Sigh. Vitamin C quackery again\" and then offers a partial explanation of the mechanism for how vitamin C causes cell death in cancer cells - which is better explained in the link I originally provided. cyberax then claims, without evidence, that cancer cells quickly evolve resistance to it. I don't believe there is any such evidence, having read several papers on this and never seeing it mentioned - nor, by my understanding, is it plausible that cancer cells could fundamentally change how they work to get immunity to this. Perhaps I'm wrong though and cyberax could supply some evidence. I notice in the replies to cyberax pfdietz says \"There is evidence that high doses of antioxidants can make cancer worse\" - and then links 2 papers exploring the use of vitamin E as a cancer treatment. Vitamin E, despite sharing quite a few letters with Vitamin C, is a different thing. --- dennis_jeeves2 writes that \"Linus Pauling (of the Nobel Laureate fame) working along with some physicians did do 'rigorous' research on it\". This is not correct and explained in the first few paragraphs of my original link. Linus Pauling used orally administered vitamin C which results in weaker blood concentrations and therefore less impact on cancer. The modern method uses IV administered high dose Vitamin C (which I was careful to write in my comment). While Pauling's method shows little effect in randomized controlled trials, high dose IV Vitamin C does show benefits. --- insane_dreamer writes that \"Medical trials to prove its safety in human subjects -- pretty essential -- is a lengthy, multi-stage process that is extremely expensive to carry out.\" Pretty meaningless comment. The safety of vitamin C is already well established. --- pjc50 also cites Linus Pauling - which, again, is explained in the first couple paragraphs of the link I originally posted. High dose orally administered vitamin C doesn't work - there are limits on how much you can increase blood concentration through oral administration, so most of the high dose is lost. That's why, as explained in my original comment/link, the modern protocol uses IV administered vitamin C. --- alphan0n quotes an XKCD strip saying \"Bullets can induce cell death in a wide variety of cancers as well.\" A bad comment because the tests I've been linked to have been in vivo, and my original link explains why this kills cancer cells and not healthy cells. --- That's my review of the comments. I would characterize them as exceptionally uninformed - which is odd. Why would people feel the need to comment on a subject they don't know about and simultaneously refuse to read the outline I originally linked which answers all the questions and criticisms posted here? reply dennis_jeeves2 3 hours agoparentprev>That's interesting.

    "originLink": "https://www.sheldonbrown.com/AluminumBikeProject.html",
    "originBody": "M.I.T. Aluminum Bicycle Project 1974by Harriet Fell and Marc Rosenbaum This article appeared in the Proceedings of the 27th International Cycling History Conference, North Haven, Connecticut, USA, 2016 In 1974, Professor Shawn Buckley ran an M.I.T. Independent Activities Period course where participants, including Marc Rosenbaum and Harriet Fell, got to build their own bicycle frames. Marc Rosenbaum, then a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, set out to create a bicycle that would give a rider an acceleration advantage by being ultra light without sacrificing stiffness. In this paper, we describe some of Marc’s design, the frames he and Harriet built in the IAP course, and how these played a role in the Klein vs. Cannondale patent litigation in the mid-1980s. Marc Rosenbaum’s Aluminum Bicycle In 1974, Marc Rosenbaum was a senior at M.I.T. majoring in mechanical engineering. The goal of his undergraduate thesis (Rosenbaum 1974) project was to create and describe a bicycle that would give a rider an acceleration advantage by being ultra light without sacrificing stiffness. Marc stressed stiffness over strength, pointing out that “frames never break in normal racing conditions, which indicates that strength is not a problem.” Clearly things have changed since carbon fiber bicycles have entered the racing scene though the problem is not their resistance to normal loads encountered during rides but to impact damage. In 1974, normal track bikes weighed 18 or 19 pounds. There are lighter bikes today; the I.C.U. minimum weight limit is 6.8 kg, which is about 15 pounds. There were also some lighter bikes in 1974. A bicycle made for Eddy Merckx in 1971, which he rode to set the one-hour record (30.715 mi), weighed only 13.25 pounds. It had a very light steel frame, custom built titanium handlebars, stem, and seatpost, partially plastic pedals, 24-spoke wheels, and tires expected to last at most 4 hours on a smooth board track. The components were extensively drilled out. This bicycle was not designed for strength or to last (Rosenbaum 1974). The bicycle built by Marc Rosenbaum weighing 12 lbs. 5oz. Marc’s Design Guidelines Use larger diameter tubular components - Strength goes up as the cube1 of the diameter so unless there are geometric constraints, use larger diameter tubes with thinner walls to get a lighter structure with increased strength and stiffness. Use sealed precision bearings - higher quality and lighter. Sacrifice adjustability - adjustment features add weight. Use alloys – Marc settled on 6061-T6 aluminum where welding was needed and used 2024-T4 aluminum and titanium (Ti 6Al 4V) in other places. He ruled out magnesium, which is best per unit weight in compressive buckling but is brittle and difficult to extrude. He noted that aluminum is easier to weld and fabricate than titanium and more than twice as efficient as steel against compressive buckling. The walls in existing steel tubes were already down to .020” - .025” and would be prone to buckling if they were made thinner to compensate for increased diameter. The Frame The table below shows the tube lengths and thicknesses that Marc used in his frame. The frame was put into a jig to hold it in alignment and was joined by tungsten-inert-gas welding. After welding, it was heat-treated (annealed) to relieve stresses induced by welding and to bring the aluminum back up to its initial strength. The top tube sagged about 1/32 of an inch during annealing. This was apparently due to the greatly decreased strength of the aluminum at the high temperature of the heat treatment process. Frame - Tube Specifications Tube Outside diameter (in) Thickness (in) Top tube 1.5 0.049/.032 Head tube 1.5 0.049 Down tube 1.5 0.049/.036 Seat tube 1.5 0.049/.036 Bottom bracket 1.75 0.187 Seat stays 0.625 0.625 Chain stays 0.750 0.083 taper to .045 The Bottom Bracket The bottom bracket was bored out to press fit the bearings directly into it. The result is a highly accurate and simple system. A Teledyne titanium axle was modified to accept the precision bearings. The axle saved three ounces and the bearings were 2.5 ounces lighter than the conventional bearing arrangement. The Hubs The body of the rear hub is of 2024-T4 aluminum. It was bored out for precision sealed bearings and has a hollow titanium axle. It weighs only 5 ounces vs. 11.5 ounces for standard track rear hubs. Similar construction was used for the front hub. It weighed only 3 ounces vs. 9 ounces for a conventional hub. Marc's rear hub Marc's front hub The Pedals Marc's pedal The pedals were designed to be comfortable, easy to get into (with toe clips), and to allow sharp cornering. They have platforms of 2024-T4 aluminum on which the whole ball of the rider’s foot can rest. The axle is of titanium and is threaded to fit a standard crank. The bearings are pressed into the pedal body and onto the axle. The pair of pedals weighs 7.5 ounces, 5 ounces less than the lightest track pedals of the time. The Saddle Marc's saddle The saddle is a prime example of eliminating unneeded adjustability. Marc determined his saddle-to-pedal distance on another bicycle and decided on an integral seatpost/saddle for the bike. The result is a savings of nearly a pound. Handlebars and Stem Marc's handlebars and stem Track bikes have the bars down low to put the rider into an efficient sprint position. Track riders often use only one position. Marc attached the handlebars directly to the fork crown, reducing weight and increasing rigidity. A simple, wide shallow U-shaped handlebar was attached via the handlebar-mounting end of a steel stem silver-soldered to a steel strip that was in turn silver-soldered to the top of the fork crown. This arrangement saved almost a pound. Other Components The wheels used Hi-E Engineering tubular rims and Pirelli Specialissimo Corsa Leggero tires. The track sprocket, chain, and T.A. cotterless 48 tooth chainring were standard. The bike initially had an 18-tooth rear sprocket for a gear of 72 inches. The headset was Stronglight Competition, and a Raleigh road-racing fork was modified to give the required wheel clearance and the design fork rake of 1.5 inches. The bicycle that Marc built for his undergraduate thesis project was the world'’'s lightest track bicycle at that time. The finished bicycle was as rigid as a normal sprint track bicycle and with wheels built up for road riding, weighed 12 pounds, 5 ounces. The bicycle is currently at the M.I.T. Museum. Harriet Fell's Aluminum Bicycle In 1974, Harriet Fell was an Assistant Professor of mathematics at Northeastern University, across the river from M.I.T. The (M.I.T. Independent Activities Period) is a special four-week term at M.I.T. that runs during the month of January.2 In 1974, Professor Shawn Buckley offered an Aluminum Bike Project class. This was an opportunity for students to build their own aluminum bicycle frames. The tubes suggested for the class were of a smaller diameter and had thicker walls than the ones Marc decided to use. Harriet showed up and ordered a set of tubes. She designed her frame by using some measurements (e.g. top tube, seat tube, and the angle between them) from her favorite bicycle, a Holdsworth Strada. Working with the constraints of the wider tubes and her small size (5' 2\") and making sure to leave enough space for 700C wheels, she made an accurate half-size drawing of the planned frame. She then measured the lengths of the other tubes from the drawing. With advice and instruction from Marc, Shawn, and the machine shop staff, she learned to use a metal lathe and milling machine enough to machine the tubes and dropouts for her bicycle. She put the parts into a jig, and Shawn sent it off for welding. Shawn said that the completed frame was particularly light and strong. (The fact that it was made for someone only 5' 2\" tall surely had something to do with this. A frame for Eddy Merckx at 6' 1\" would surely have weighed more.) Shawn demonstrated the strength of the frame by laying it on its side and standing/bouncing on the seat stays.3 Gary Klein also made a frame in this project in the spring of 1974 and got even wider tubes to make a larger frame. Harriet’s Frame Goes to France Just after finishing the frame, Harriet moved to France to continue her career in mathematics. She also started cycling with the cyclosport group at the Faculté de Science at Orsay. She got as far as mounting a headset and fork on her frame, but math and cycling, including riding the 1975 Paris-Brest-Paris, filled most of her time. In September 1976, unable to extend her leave of absence for another year, she returned to Northeastern University. As she was determined to move back to France, she left her frame, a large bag of books and clothes, and a pile of tubular tires in a friend’s cellar. She did spend another year in France, but not until 1988/1989 with her husband, Sheldon Brown, and their children Tova and George. The clothes and books were intact. The tubulars had hardened to a rock-like state and were unusable. The frame met another fate. Cannondale In 1983, Cannondale manufactured its first aluminum bicycle (Wikipedia 2016). Gary Klein had been issued patents on aluminum bicycle frames and sued Cannondale for patent infringement. Schwinn was already making large-diameter aluminum frames and paid Klein license fees. Cannondale claimed that Klein was not entitled to his patent(s) because the real design came out of Marc Rosenbaum's thesis and the 1974 Aluminum Bike Project (Bike Forums mtnbke 2009)(Justia 1989) Marc Rosenbaum was subpoenaed in the Cannondale/Klein case and gave a 6-hour videotaped deposition. He hid his bicycle in a friend’s barn so it wouldn’t be subpoenaed. He was afraid he would lose the bicycle for years and possibly never get it back if it were taken. Harriet's frame Defendant exhibit in Cannondale case Cannondale’s lawyer wanted frame(s) that were built before Klein’s for the case. He contacted Shawn Buckley who told him that there were five light/strong frames produced in the project. The lawyer called Harriet to ask if he could use her frame and she said, “Yes, but it’s in a friend’s cellar in France.” He visited her friends and brought the frame back for the trial. Bringing in large diameter aluminum frames built by Bill Shook, founder and engineer of American Classic , and by Harriet Fell that predated Mr. Klein’s, Cannondale successfully argued that the Klein patent was null and void due to \"prior art\" - you can’t patent something that’s already in existence and known publicly (Bike Forums tcs 2009). Klein's patent discovery documents had referenced Marc's bike and thesis numerous times, and it had taken Klein almost eight years to be granted a patent. Essentially, Cannondale asked, \"Why is Klein's bike different from Rosenbaum's frame?\" From Frame to Bike Marc was right to fear losing his bicycle for many years if it were subpoenaed. Cannondale kept Harriet's frame for many years and never let her know where it actually was. Eventually she asked her husband, Sheldon Brown, who worked in the bicycle business, to call a friend at Cannondale and ask for the frame. That worked. When the frame arrived, Sheldon hung it high on a living room wall and told every visitor about it. In May 2005, Sheldon asked Harriet what she wanted for Mother's Day. She said, \"Sheldon, since we've been married you've built up about 40 bikes for yourself (Sheldon Brown's Personal Bicycle Page) so how about getting that one on the road for me.\" He built the aluminum frame up with standard, fairly light-weight parts. Harriet has recently changed the saddle to a Brooks Cambium and added lights, a Quad-Lock mount for an iPhone, and a small frame bag with USB charger, all easily removable. Harriet's bottom bracket and crank Harriet's dropout Harriet's Brooks Cambium saddle Harriet's bike with new additions Proof in the Riding Marc Rosenbaum rode his bicycle up Mount Washington twice4 before donating it to the MIT Museum. Bill Shook rode his homemade bicycle frame in several races (Justia 1989). Harriet Fell continues to ride hers around the western suburbs of Boston. Marc on his bike in 1974 Harriet on her bike in 2005 Footnotes 1. From correspondence from Marc Rosenbaum: \"For solid tubes, section modulus is proportional to radius (or diameter) cubed, so strength increases with the cube of diameter. Moment of inertia is proportional to diameter to the fourth power, so stiffness increases with the fourth power of diameter. For hollow tubes, it's not as cut and dried. If you double the diameter and double the wall thickness, then strength goes up as the cube and stiffness as the fourth power. If the wall thickness remains constant, doubling the diameter doesn't increase strength by 8 and stiffness by 16.\" 2. It is an opportunity for MIT students, faculty and staff to organize or participate in a wide variety of courses ranging from Blacksmithing to Charm School. 3. Harriet’s frame did not show any sagging due to annealing. The tubes on her frame were shorter than those on Marc’s bicycle and had slightly thicker walls. 4. He did not ride this with the original 72\" gear. He rode Mt Washington in 1975 alone as the race organizers wouldn't allow him in the race with a fixed gear bike. He rode a 1:1 gear - 20T rear and made the front chaining from a Sturmey Archer 3 speed cog (so about a 27” gear). The next year he rode the bicycle in the race, having installed a single speed freewheel with an 18T (so about a 30” gear).

There's a fascinating, and very new, class of nano-laminate magnesium alloys called Long Period Stacking-Ordered (LPSO) alloys. These are very lean -- the standard version is 97% Mg + 1% Zn + 2% Y -- and they have outstanding mechanical properties. At an equal weight, they're much stronger and stiffer than 6061 aluminum, and the kicker is that this is generally true only if they're extruded. If they're not extruded, the laminate-like grain structure doesn't form properly. Could make excellent bike frames. Magnesium corrosion would still be a problem, though. I got some LPSO-Mg samples from Fuji Light Metals, in Japan, and they were quite badly degraded within weeks. reply twic 17 hours agoparentThere was a magnesium bike frame back in the '90s, made by Kirk: https://www.elmycycles.co.uk/m21b0s365p4804/1992-Kirk-Revolu... https://www.bikeforums.net/classic-vintage/1279777-kirk-prec... https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/magnesium-in-frame-to-... https://www.flickr.com/photos/11521783@N05/albums/7215764801...

Its use was not a great design decision on Kirk's part. I suppose they could have wrapped the casting in carbon fiber or something like that, to give it extra bending strength and spread out loads that might cause fractures, but then it would get expensive. reply UniverseHacker 7 hours agorootparentCarbon would cause galvinic corrosion in contact with magnesium, and would also visually hide dangerous cracks- I don’t think a carbon wrapped magnesium bicycle would be safe. reply A_D_E_P_T 6 hours agorootparentI was just spitballing, but it's possible: First you coat or anodize the magnesium, which I imagine needs to be done in any case. Then you apply a layer of epoxy. Then you wrap in carbon/epoxy. Done properly, there's no direct contact between carbon and magnesium, and you're probably less likely to see corrosion in the Mg-CF composite than you are with magnesium by itself. reply UniverseHacker 5 hours agorootparentThe epoxy barrier might work, but in general encapsulated metals are risky because they are impossible to inspect for corrosion and cracking so fail without warning, and the encapsulation can block surface oxide formation which causes crevice corrosion- especially if small amounts of salt and water get in there, which they will over time, even in epoxy. I’m sure what you are saying could be done- especially to basically add stiffness to key regions of a carbon racing bicycle, but it would be experimental and I would not trust it to last a long time reply ndsipa_pomu 4 hours agorootparent> I’m sure what you are saying could be done- especially to basically add stiffness to key regions of a carbon racing bicycle I reckon it'd be a lot easier to just increase the wall thickness if you want that section of a carbon frame to be stiffer reply UniverseHacker 4 hours agorootparentNot really- even very thick carbon is quite flexible…. It works great for applications where you want that like bendy sailboat masts and front forks on bikes, but it should be cored or replaced with something else if you are looking for stiffness reply ndsipa_pomu 3 hours agorootparentThat doesn't match with my experience. I've got a carbon fibre road bike and some parts of the frame are remarkably stiff whereas other areas such as the handlebars have noticeable flex.

Carbon fiber is an intrinsically more expensive material, and manufacturing complex engineering parts solely with CF, to high quality standards, is almost an artisanal process. reply ndsipa_pomu 6 hours agorootparent> Magnesium, especially a casting, can be something like an order of magnitude cheaper. That doesn't seem to be borne out by bike prices - it's entirely possible to buy a very usable carbon fibre bike for approx £1000 but I can't recall seeing a magnesium framed bike for £100. Edit: looking at cheap frames on AliExpress, you're not too far off. I saw a magnesium alloy frame for approx £80 and a carbon fibre frame for £350.

There is a bunch of theoretical underpinnings but ultimately a lot of throwing darts on the board as well. reply A_D_E_P_T 17 hours agorootparentYeah. It depends a lot on the type of material, too. Conventional metal alloys -- like LPSO-Mg -- are the toughest to model. Too many variables. Ceramics and intermetallics are a lot easier to model in principle, but they can have surprising properties on an atomic level, and there's really no predictive method for that sort of thing. Modeling does get you pretty far with high-entropy alloys -- because to a substantial extent their properties hinge on how a bunch of different atoms might fit together randomly, and that's something that can be computationally predicted. A lot of the recent interest in HEAs is because they're relatively easy to model. reply rjsw 7 hours agorootparentprevComputational materials science is a current research area. reply alanbernstein 17 hours agoparentprevI learned about this company's magnesium frames recently: https://www.vaastbikes.com/company/ reply metal_am 15 hours agoparentprevInteresting.

I don't think it's perceived as especially advantageous these days. The high-ish end track bike I'm assembling now will be a little over 8 kg (almost 18 lb). We also race much bigger gears (typically 95-110 gear inches in mass start racing, bigger for sprinting) than mentioned in the article (72 gear inches). The position that is considered aerodynamic is also much different -- there is much less focus on getting that insanely low, and instead the focus is on being narrow and getting the forearms parallel with the ground. reply hackingonempty 15 hours agoparentIt largely is the streetlight effect: we all have or can easily get tools to measure weight, we all have significant experience with weight, etc... Aerodynamics are much more difficult, especially in the 1970s where you can't just do some CFD simulations on your computer. There also weren't cheap solid state strain gauges to outfit wind tunnels or the bike drivetrain. Since only tiny aero gains are available without banned aerodynamic devices, there isn't much optimization you can do and need sensitive tools. reply cenamus 10 hours agoparentprevMaybe that's just mostly due to the UCI regulations? No point to develop a fully fitted 5kg bike if it has to be 7kg anyways I suppose reply jdietrich 1 hour agorootparentMost competition bikes weigh significantly more than the 6.8kg limit, because weight just doesn't matter very much. A lot of state-of-the-art road and track bikes weigh around 8kg. On the flat, weight only affects you during accelerations - at a steady speed, it has no significant impact on performance. Aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance are constantly sapping away power, so features that reduce these losses are nearly always worthwhile even if they increase weight. Even on a moderately hilly road stage, aero trumps weight by a considerable margin; on the track, weight is almost entirely irrelevant, particularly in longer events. A lot of riders like the feel of a lightweight bike, a lot of them believe that light bikes are faster, but that's only true on exceptionally steep stages or hill climbs. reply loeg 1 hour agorootparentprevIf it mattered, though, every track bike would be exactly 6.8 kg -- and they aren't. reply ndsipa_pomu 4 hours agorootparentprevUnless you can hide away a 2kg battery/motor combo.

I don't think those mods helped. Weight has no impact on sustained speed. reply xpe 16 hours agorootparent> Weight has no impact on sustained speed. On a nice track, assuming a perfectly smooth surface and zero elevation change, I'm willing to accept the effect may not matter enough to care. But introduce even just a little bumpiness or some elevation change (perhaps in the track curves), and it might matter for someone pursuing the hour record. reply ndsipa_pomu 10 hours agorootparentSurface irregularities (bumpiness) are the reason why lower pressure tyres are now preferred on bikes. The idea is that a very rigid tyre will deflect the bike and rider up and down which wastes some energy/momentum as well as fatiguing the rider, whereas a lower pressure tyre can absorb those irregularities and \"roll-over\" the bumps. This is part of the reason that recent thinking has moved from skinny high pressure tyres, to wider medium pressure tyres. (Wider tyres will tend to roll quicker than a thin tyre at the same pressure - something to do with how the contact patch deforms the rubber). However, cycling tracks are designed to be very smooth which is why high pressure tyres are still used there. reply xpe 3 hours agorootparentprevAny bump results in some energy transfer. In the case of small enough bumps and tires at ideal pressures, most energy is returned, but not all. These losses accumulate. The question is \"how much does it add up to?\" This is why I recommend using the phrase \"negligible effect\" instead of \"no effect\". reply loeg 15 hours agorootparentprevYou're not going up and down the track during an hour record. Just doing laps at the bottom (zero elevation change). Track surfaces aim to be very smooth in general. reply xpe 2 hours agorootparent> You're not going up and down the track during an hour record. Here the English language obscures the physics. Sure, the black line on the track is at a constant elevation. But the tire's point of contact is different from the system's center of mass (CoM). CoM is key here. When a rider tilts in the turns, the CoM lowers. In the straights, it raises. So, you _are_ going up and down during the hour record. The question now becomes: how much effect does this elevation change have? It is one thing to be aware of the effect, run the calculations, and find the result is negligible. Has anyone done this? That would be an interesting analysis, and I'd like to see it. With this in mind, I will make another claim: for a particular rider, there is an ideal line around a velodrome that would minimize center-of-mass elevation change. This line would be faster than the current black line. How much faster? This would be a fun simulation problem. Another interesting connection: center of mass and bicycling explains why pumping works on a BMX track, a pump track, a trail, and so on. (There are other mainstream explanations, but I think the CoM explanation is the most elegant.) reply dahart 1 hour agorootparentIt’s an interesting question & thought experiment! To the degree that it even matters compared to all the other bigger forces, I would put money on riders naturally adjusting for CoM changes by riding slightly higher during the turns; I’d bet they already take approximately the ideal racing line you suggest. I just watched a couple of velodrome rides on YouTube, and it does seem like riders are often closer to the red line during the turn and the black line during the straightaway, statistically, but it’s noisy and would need to be measured. The CoM’s elevation change on a velodrome track is due to roll rotation around the direction of travel, not to climb & descent. You can’t pedal harder to recover from a lean, so this is a different kind of up and down than straight line elevation changes. It makes sense that work is being done somehow if the CoM moves up and down, but the turns come with necessary changes to the higher moments of inertia anyway that flattening the CoM elevation doesn’t change. I’d speculate that the ideal CoM line might not be flat, in the presence of mandatory high speed banked turns; the fastest line and the line minimizing CoM elevation change might be two different lines. Do also keep in mind that on a velodrome track, a higher elevation line is a slightly larger radius turn & longer travel path. It’s also possible that trying to compensate for CoM elevation change adds as much time as it saves. reply hackingonempty 15 hours agorootparentprevRolling resistance increases linearly with weight, so it does have some impact. reply loeg 15 hours agorootparentOk. Almost no impact. Worth keeping in mind we're talking about a system weight of like 180 lb vs at most 185 lb here (Merckx was ~163 lb), for a relative difference of up to 3%. reply kevin_thibedeau 16 hours agorootparentprevYou slow down incrementally between every power stroke. reply sudosysgen 15 hours agorootparentA heavier bike would slow down less.

You could probably throw head tubes in here too; split races to avoid reaming, molded bare pseudo-press fit “cups”, and the absolute ridiculous sizes like IS47 and larger.

A heavier bicycle is cheaper, less fragile, and also increases the workout effect. As long as a bicycle isn't 20 kg / 50 lbs, what is the real problem? I believe the real goal for lightness is luxury conspicuous consumption to maximize cost using exotic materials like beryllium. reply tomaskafka 6 hours agoparentprevThat’s what I tell myself when picking the bike - just get a competent basic $700-ish bike, and if you want it 2 kg lighter, lose those 2 kg instead of paying thousands. reply briansm 6 hours agorootparentIn evolutionary terms, being taller, fatter and more muscular is advantageous, but in practical terms it's just a lot of extra weight to drag around for a lifetime, along with all the extra calories of energy needed to do so. reply magic_smoke_ee 1 hour agorootparentYep. That's what I keep telling myself. ;) In the end, those will all kill me sooner because they're each opposed to longevity in a safe environment. reply ndsipa_pomu 6 hours agoparentprevWeight isn't that important for bike racing unless you're specifically doing hill climbs. Aerodynamics will make more of a difference, so there might be some advantage in having a bit of belly fat to enable a smooth airflow. Also, heavier riders are generally faster downhill as they have a greater terminal velocity. reply magic_smoke_ee 1 hour agorootparent> have a greater terminal velocity No, unless they're Russian, they're not free falling. They have greater potential energy. And also increased traction, increased rolling resistance, and increased losses in wheel bearings and drive components due to friction. reply wink 6 hours agoparentprevIt's not bike weight per se, but there's also a somewhat direct link between weight and component quality and age. I.e. no one really tests a 20y old bike with current top-end components, no one really puts 10y old groupsets on a 2024 frame. Yes, rider weight trumps it, but modern bikes in general just ride nicer and most of us who are not pros only test a dozen different bikes at most.

Of course, the main aerodynamic advantage to be gained is from the human sat on top of the bike. reply benj111 7 hours agoprevWhat was the patent for?

I'm less convinced. Firstly, I'm not convinced by the frame flex theory of ride comfort - I believe that the tyres are by far the biggest contribution to ride comfort due to the amount that they can flex which is far more than the tiny amount that the frame can. Secondly, aerodynamics is far more important (if you care about speed/effort) and titanium is tricky to get into highly tailored shapes unless you resort to fancy 3d-printed frames. Carbon would be my choice due to the design flexibility - by orienting the carbon fibres differently, components can provide strength/stiffness in one direction whilst allowing for compliance in other directions. Also the shape can be relatively easily changed - no need to always use circular tubes. It'd be interesting to see a 3d-printed titanium frame that uses some kind of honeycomb internal structure to provide super strong/light frames, but I suspect it would be exorbitantly expensive. reply xpe 15 hours agoparentprevTitanium frames have a devoted fan base. Personally, I tried to notice the difference back when I did road racing but didn't.

You can get a whole crappy bike for a couple hundred bucks. Higher end steel isn't as cheap but is still relatively heavy (compared to aluminum or carbon). You can get this kind of bike in the $1000-2000 price range (e.g. Surly). Aluminum bikes tend to be inexpensive, but also not the lightest. These can also be priced at $1000-2000 (Specialized, Trek, Giant, ...). Carbon comes in a range of prices with various tradeoffs. You can get very budget carbon frames at like $1500 (Winspace) or whole bikes at like $3000 (Giant) (maybe $2000 in non-major brands, very discounted during current market conditions). For titanium, I'm seeing Black Friday deals starting at like, $3200-3500 (Lynskey / Litespeed). But they're often sold at higher prices than carbon bikes. (For my money, I prefer carbon frames -- you get more flexibility in tube shapes and the end result can be lighter and stronger than titanium.) reply grogenaut 12 hours agorootparentCheck these out https://www.rodbikes.com/profiles/profiles.php?tag=ultra-lig... steel bikes ~13.5 lbs. reply loeg 1 hour agorootparentYeah.

The specific 2000EUR figure might be European pricing. The lowest I'm seeing for any carbon road bike from e.g. Specialized with US pricing is $2400 for a two generation old Tarmac SL6 (this generation was current 2019-2021) or $2800 for a current Roubaix. The least expensive carbon road bike offering from Giant is $3300 US (TCR or Defy).

I'm a sucker for 80s road bikes; $200 gets you something decent, bring it to a shop for a tune up and probably new brakes. 10-speeds are most common, so you have to be ok with that; although some vintage bikes did have 3 chain rings. Older road bikes tend to have narrow tires, because everybody thought they were faster; 1/4\" tires are workable on unpaved mixed use trails, but 1/8\" will be pushed around easily by tree roots and ruts. reply gield 10 hours agoparentprevYou wouldn't feel the stiffness of an aluminium frame as much on a track.

I really want steel poles now, yet can't find them to the point of pondering DYI-ing from some Home Depot steel tubing. reply ndsipa_pomu 8 hours agoparent [–] That's a problem with aluminium - no fatigue limit. This means that cyclic loads on an aluminium frame (or pole) will eventually cause it to fail. Steel does have a fatigue limit such that cyclic loads below that threshold won't cause eventual failure. There's some good info on bike frame materials here: https://bike.bikegremlin.com/11144/bicycle-frame-materials-e... reply prmoustache 1 hour agorootparentIt is only really an issue with aluminium forks and non traditionnal construction. With a \"diamond shaped\" traditionnal cycling frame you have nearly 0 chance of a frame failing catastrophically.

    "originBody": "HISTORY OF TECHNOLOGY FEATURE THE FORGOTTEN STORY OF HOW IBM INVENTED THE AUTOMATED FAB Fifty years ago, a brash middle manager had a vision: a chip in a day JESSE ARONSTEIN27 NOV 202415 MIN READ The Project SWIFT fabrication line was based on sectors, as shown in this patent diagram of the system from 1973. Each sector contained in an enclosure all of the wafer-processing equipment needed to accomplish a segment of the fabrication process between lithographic-pattern exposures. IBM/U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE IN 1970, BILL HARDING envisioned a fully automated wafer-fabrication line that would produce integrated circuits in less than one day. Not only was such a goal gutsy 54 years ago, it would be bold even in today’s billion-dollar fabs, where the fabrication time of an advanced IC is measured in weeks, not days. Back then, ICs, such as random-access memory chips, were typically produced in a monthlong stop-and-go march through dozens of manual work stations. At the time, Harding was the manager of IBM’s Manufacturing Research group, in East Fishkill, N.Y. The project he would lead to make his vision a reality, all but unknown today, was called Project SWIFT. To achieve such an amazingly short turnaround time required a level of automation that could only be accomplished by a paradigm shift in the design of integrated-circuit manufacturing lines. Harding and his team accomplished it, achieving advances that would eventually be reflected throughout the global semiconductor industry. Many of SWIFT’s groundbreaking innovations are now commonplace in today’s highly automated chip fabrication plants, but SWIFT’s incredibly short turnaround time has never been equaled. SWIFT averaged 5 hours to complete each layer of its fabrication process, while the fastest modern fabs take 19 hours per processing layer, and the industry average is 36 hours. Although today’s integrated circuits are built with many more layers, on larger wafers the size of small pizzas, and the processing is more complex, those factors do not altogether close the gap. Harding’s automated manufacturing line was really, truly, swift. A Semiconductor Manufacturing Manifesto I encountered Harding for the first time in 1962, and hoped it would be the last. IBM was gearing up to produce its first completely solid-state computer, the System/360. It was a somewhat rocky encounter. “What the hell good is that?” he bellowed at me as I demonstrated how tiny, unpackaged semiconductor dice could be automatically handled in bulk for testing and sorting. Author Jesse Aronstein [at far right, in top photo] took a break from managing the equipment group of Project SWIFT to play French horn one evening a week with the Southern Dutchess Pops Orchestra. Another key manager, Walter J. “Wally” Kleinfelder [bottom left], standing at right, headed the process group of Project SWIFT. William E. “Bill” Harding [bottom right], seen here in 1973, was a brusque WW II combat veteran and creative innovator. He conceived and directed IBM’s Project SWIFT, which succeeded in fabricating integrated circuits in one day.CLOCKWISE FROM TOP: IBM/COMPUTER HISTORY MUSEUM; IBM (2) William E. (“Bill”) Harding was an innovative thinker and inventor. He had been developing semiconductors and their manufacturing technology at IBM for three years when the company’s new Components Division was formed in 1961. Harding became a midlevel manager in the new division, responsible for developing and producing the equipment required to manufacture the System/360’s solid-state devices and circuit modules. He was rough around the edges for an IBM manager. But perhaps it was to be expected of someone who had grown up in Brooklyn, N.Y., and was wounded three times in combat in World War II while serving in General George S. Patton’s Third Army. After the war, Harding earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mathematics and physics and became a member of IEEE. I joined IBM in 1961, coming from rocket-engine development at General Electric. Like most engineers at the time, I knew nothing about semiconductor manufacturing. Five years prior, I had attended a vacuum-tube electronics course in which the professor described the transistor as “a laboratory curiosity, which may or may not ever amount to anything.” Project SWIFT occupied a small space, shown here in yellow, in building 310 at IBM’s sprawling East Fishkill semiconductor facility. IBM Harding’s rough and crude manner surfaced every time I crossed paths with him. If he ever went to IBM “charm school” (management training), there was no discernible evidence of it. Nevertheless, he succeeded in his mission. By 1964, solid-state logic modules for System/360s were flowing from the Components Division’s new facility on a former farm in East Fishkill. In July 1970, I returned to IBM after three years of graduate study. I was a first-level manager for four years prior to that educational break, and did not want another management job. I wanted a purely technical career, and I joined East Fishkill’s Manufacturing Research (MR) group hoping to get one. Harding and I then crossed paths again. In mid-August of 1970, he became MR’s top manager. Prior to that, he spent a year developing an IBM corporate strategy for the future manufacturing and use of very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits. He was given command of MR to demonstrate the viability of his manufacturing concepts. An assembly of MR personnel was convened to announce the management change. After being introduced, Harding described his view of future VLSI applications and manufacturing. These were his key points: VLSI circuits would be based on field-effect transistor technology (at the time, bipolar-junction transistors were dominant); Defect-free high yields would be paramount; Manufacturing would be fully automated; Best results would accrue from processing one wafer at a time; Short turnaround times would confer important benefits; Volume would scale up by replicating successful production lines. After the educational lecture, Harding changed from professor to commander, General Patton–style. MR’s sole mission was to demonstrate Harding’s ideas, and ongoing projects not aligned with that goal would be transferred elsewhere within IBM or abandoned. MR would prove that an automated system could be constructed to process about 100 wafers a day, one at a time, with high yield and a one-day turnaround time. What? Did I hear that right? One-day turnaround from bare wafer to finished circuits was what we would now call a moon shot. Remember, at the time, it typically took more than a month. Did he really mean it? Harding knew that it was theoretically possible, and he was determined to achieve it. He declared that IBM would have a substantial competitive advantage if prototype experimental IC designs could be produced in a day, instead of months. He wanted the circuit designer to have testable circuits the day after submitting the digital description to the production line. One-day turnaround from bare wafer to finished circuits was what we would now call a moon shot. Harding immediately organized an equipment group and a process group within MR, naming me to manage the equipment group. I did not want to be a manager again. Now, reluctantly, I was a second-level manager, responsible for developing all the processing and wafer-handling equipment for a yet-to-be-defined manufacturing line that I had barely started to visualize. My dream research job had lasted little more than a month. Walter J. (“Wally”) Kleinfelder transferred into MR to manage the process group. They would select the product to manufacture and define the process by which it would be made—the detailed sequence of chemical, thermal, and lithographic steps required to take a blank silicon wafer and build integrated circuits on its surface at high yield. Kleinfelder selected a random-access memory chip, the IBM RAM II, for our demonstration. This product was being produced on-site at East Fishkill, so we would have everything we needed to build it and evaluate our results relative to those of the existing nonautomated manufacturing line. IBM’s SWIFT Pilot Wafer Fab Had a Monorail “Taxi” Integrated-circuit manufacturing involves first creating the transistors and other components in their proper places on the silicon wafer surface, and then wiring them together by adding a thin film of aluminum selectively etched to create the required wiring pattern. That thin film of conductor is known as the wiring, or metallization, layer. IC manufacturing uses photolithography to create the many layers, each with a distinctive pattern, needed to fabricate an IC. These include the metal wiring layers, of which there can be more than a dozen for an advanced chip today. For these steps, the metal layer on the wafer is coated with a light-sensitive photoresist material, after which an image of the pattern is exposed on to it. The areas where conductors will be formed are blocked from the light. When the image is developed, the resist is removed from the pattern areas that were exposed, enabling these areas to be etched by an acid. The rest of the surface remains protected by the acid-proof resist. After etching is completed, the remaining protective resist is removed, leaving just the wiring layer in the required pattern. Project SWIFT at a Glance The Project SWIFT fabrication line was based on five “sectors.” Each was an enclosed automobile-size machine that performed all of the process steps between lithographic mask-pattern exposures. Other than sectors one and five, wafers entered a sector with pattern-exposed photoresist ready for development and exited the sector with fresh photoresist ready for the next pattern exposure. The taxi conveyed individual wafers from a sector to the lithographic-pattern expose station, and subsequently to the next sector in the sequence. The SWIFT fabrication line was controlled by a three-level hierarchy of control systems. At the highest level, an IBM 1800 computer managed the line overall. It communicated with controllers for each of the five processing sectors, within which were processing- and wafer-handling subsectors, some with their own controllers. The IC process also uses lithography to create transistors and other components on the silicon wafer. Here, openings are etched in insulating layers through which tiny amounts of specific impurities can be infused into the exposed spots of pure silicon to change the electrical properties. Producing the RAM-II ICs required four separate lithographic operations using four different patterns: three for creating the transistors and other components, and one to create the metal wiring layer. The four patterns had to be exactly aligned with one another to successfully create the chips. Lithography is only part of the IC manufacturing process, however. In the existing production line, it took many weeks to process a RAM-II wafer. But the raw process time—the time a wafer spent actually being worked on at various thermal, lithographic, chemical, and deposition stations—was less than 48 hours. Most of a wafer’s time was spent waiting to undergo the next process step. And some steps, chemical cleaning in particular, could be eliminated if wafers progressed quickly from one step to the next. It was the responsibility of Kleinfelder’s group to determine which steps could be eliminated and which could be accelerated. The resulting raw process time was less than 15 hours. It then fell to Maung Htoo, my manager of chemical-equipment development, to test the proposed process. His people hustled 1.25-inch-diameter wafers through a “pots and pans” lab setup to evaluate and refine it. The abbreviated procedure successfully produced working circuits in about 15 hours, as anticipated. The architecture of an automated system materialized. It was initially envisioned as a series of linked machines, each performing one step of the process, like an automobile assembly line. But equipment downtime for preventative maintenance and repair of breakdowns had to be accommodated. This was achieved by the insertion of short-term storage “buffers” that would temporarily store wafers at selected points in the process chain when necessary. This process chain concept was further disrupted by considerations related to lithographic-pattern imaging. Exposure of the photoresist on wafers was commonly accomplished at the time by a process analogous to photographic contact printing. The lithographic mask, through which light shone when exposing the photoresist, was the equivalent of a photographic negative. Any defect or particle on the mask would result in a corresponding defect on a chip, at the same location, wafer after wafer. The East Fishkill lithography group had developed a noncontact 10:1 reduction step-and-repeat image projector. Think of it as a sort of photographic slide projector that produced a shrunken image containing the pattern for a single layer on a chip. It then “stepped” across the wafer, exposing one chip location at a time. Relative to contact masking, the stepper promised lower sensitivity to particulate contamination, because the size of the shadow of any stray particle would be reduced by 10:1. Other advantages included higher optical resolution and longer mask life. - YouTubeWWW.YOUTUBE.COM Because it was slow, though, multiple steppers would be needed to meet the throughput target. Achieving the best pattern alignment on each wafer for multiple pattern exposures required that a wafer be routed back to the same stepper for exposure of each layer in the process chain. That would cancel the effect of image distortions introduced by slight variations from one machine to another. Building the RAM-II circuits then required that a wafer make four separate trips to its assigned stepper. That divided the linear sequence into five sectors. A monorail “taxi” would take a wafer from one processing sector to its assigned stepper, and return later to take it to its next sector. Each of the five sectors was envisioned to be an enclosure containing all of the automated wafer-processing and handling equipment required to accomplish that segment of the process chain. The sector enclosures and the taxi would be designed to provide a clean-room-quality local environment for the wafers. Within a sector enclosure, typically, a wafer would pass directly from a wet-chemistry module to miniature furnaces to a photoresist application module, and, finally, to the taxi pickup port. Inside the wet-chemistry module, for example, the wafer would undergo cleaning, development of the photoresist and its removal, and etching, among other procedures. Control of the entire line was to be accomplished at three levels. Overall production-line management, recordkeeping, taxi logistics, and process monitoring would be handled by a central computer-based system. Dedicated controllers, one for each sector, would manage wafer logistics within the sector and feed wafer traffic and processing data to the central system. The individual processing and wafer-handling modules inside each sector enclosure would have their own specialized controls, as needed, for independent setup and maintenance. Finally configured, our automated demonstration line for the RAM-II chips would consist of five sectors, a taxi, and a lithographic-pattern imaging center, all managed by computer. Six months after Harding took command, MR started to design and build the actual system. The Brash Middle Manager Found Inspiration in Literature Harding made frequent trips to IBM’s headquarters, in Armonk, N.Y., to report progress, request resources, rebut challenges, and convince the top brass that the money being spent was a good investment in the future. It was a tough mission. His lengthy weekly staff meetings often reflected the pressure he was under. He lectured at length on things he knew we knew, told allegorical stories, and spun analogies. At the time, I did not realize that he was using his staff meetings to develop and refine ideas for the presentations at Armonk. He was noting our reactions and adjusting his presentation ideas accordingly. His presentations to the top brass were effective. For the duration of the project, spanning about three years, MR had all the funding and support it needed to develop, design, build, and operate the entire system. At one staff meeting, Harding read aloud Heywood Broun’s short story “ The 51st Dragon,” to emphasize the power of a name or slogan to motivate people to achieve the impossible. His point, of course, was that we needed a really good name for the project. “SWIFT” was eventually chosen. Harding always insisted that it was not an acronym, but nevertheless people figured it was shorthand for “Semiconductor Wafer Integrated Factory Technology.” SWIFT’s incredibly short turnaround time has never been equaled. SWIFT’s processing and wafer-handling equipment was custom designed entirely within IBM’s Components Division. The primary design objectives were to process wafers automatically, consistently, and uniformly and keep them clean and undamaged. Wafer-handling experiments sorted out the cleanest and gentlest techniques. Handling equipment was designed to support the wafer rather than grip it. A novel wafer handler that used a flow of air above the wafer to lift it, without physical contact, was successfully incorporated for some of the wafer-transport moves. There was one exception to the “clean and gentle” design of SWIFT’s handling apparatus. Management at the Components Division’s Burlington, Vt., site pressured Harding to use “air-track” wafer-transport equipment that they had developed. This equipment used airflow to lift and move wafers, much like a puck in a game of air hockey. Harding needed Burlington’s continued support, so he decreed that some air-track equipment be used in SWIFT. And it was, even though wafer-contamination and reliability questions were unresolved. Another top-down decree explains why SWIFT ended up with two different types of sector control systems—the antithesis of good design for maintainability. A custom controller had been designed, and five units were being built (one for each sector), when HQ required that we incorporate the newly announced IBM System/7, which had been developed specifically for factory-equipment and process-control applications. After all, if IBM itself didn’t use the computer in its own advanced production line, potential customers would wonder “why not?” But if SWIFT used a System/7 and the project proved to be successful, it would help sell System/7s. And so for the five sectors, SWIFT ended up with four custom controllers and one System/7. Both types worked well. Equipment reliability was SWIFT’s Achilles’ heel. To help achieve high reliability and ease of maintenance, certain mechanisms and controls were standardized for use throughout the system, and they were chosen for reliability and simplicity rather than novelty or elegance. For example, a person observing the system in operation would notice that many motions were accomplished in discrete smooth steps rather than a single traverse. Underlying that peculiarity was the extensive use of the simple, robust, and reliable Geneva drive, originally developed centuries ago for clocks, but now adapted for linear and rotary motions that had to be smooth and precisely locked in at the end points. Each easily controlled turn of the Geneva drive’s input shaft made one step. Long traverses required multiple turns of the shaft, resulting in the odd-looking motions. Inside a sector’s enclosed chamber, a wafer went through a series of entirely automated processing steps. Two of the early concept sketches are represented here. The wafers came into the upper chamber with a pattern exposed onto the resist and underwent a series of processing steps that included development, hardening, etching, and others, as indicated. Another simplification involved spinning the wafers to centrifugally spread liquid photoresist that was dropped onto the center of the wafer. In existing lines, “wrong spin speed” was frequently cited as the cause of resist-related wafer-processing rejects. Spin speed was eliminated as a variable by driving SWIFT’s spinners with synchronous AC motors locked to 3,600 rpm by their 60-hertz AC power source, just as phonograph turntables are driven. No speed controllers would be required. The desired photoresist film thickness would be achieved by adjusting the remaining variables—temperature, viscosity, and/or spin time. In the end, system reliability was improved by the elimination of four separate speed controllers. As SWIFT progressed from blue-sky concept to actual hardware implementation, Harding adjusted MR’s organization and gained the cooperation of supporting groups. He saw to it that his people had the resources to do the job and could focus on the project. I came to admire his organizational skills and his ability to single out and recruit top-notch talent from within the company. Harding established a group to develop SWIFT’s master control system, which monitored the progress on each and every wafer as it moved through the sectors. This Execution Control System (ECS) was based on an IBM 1800. Each wafer had a serial number and was tracked at every step through the line. The ECS stored and monitored each wafer’s processing parameters, detecting and reacting quickly to out-of-spec situations. Its punch cards and tape cartridges seem quaint by today’s measure, but it was a major advance in production control and monitoring for a wafer line. He also transferred an entire instrumentation department, managed by Sam Campbell, from IBM Endicott to East Fishkill. Campbell’s department subsequently developed groundbreaking methods for real-time, in-situ process control for SWIFT. A Short Life but an Enduring Legacy in Semiconductor Manufacturing Mockups of furnaces and chemical processors were built and tested. Robert J. Straub’s department in East Fishkill’s Manufacturing Engineering group designed and built the sectors and the processing equipment modules within them. Harding brought in Bevan P.F. Wu to manage the installation, debugging, and operation of the line. As equipment and facilities coalesced in SWIFT’s dedicated 4,000-square-foot space, Rolf H. Brunner, who had managed a good portion of the sector designs along with development of the vacuum metal-deposition equipment, took responsibility under Wu for equipment installation, startup, and debugging. Only one operation in the entire process was not fully automated. Alignment of the wafer for exposing the pattern on the photoresist still depended on a well-trained operator. In its final form, SWIFT had both a 10:1 optical stepper and also a 1:1 contact-mask machine, but as it happened, most of the chips produced were with the 1:1 machine, because the throughput was higher that way. By the end of 1973, IBM HQ was already convinced that full automation of wafer processing could succeed. So much so that this goal was adopted as a primary objective for a new wafer-processing line to produce the circuits for IBM’s next-generation computer, the “FS” ( Future System). The proposed new line was dubbed “FMS” (Future Manufacturing System), and SWIFT was renamed “FMS Feasibility Line.” Bevan Wu successfully managed the line’s completion, test runs, personnel training, and refinements of equipment, process, and procedures. He brought the line to the point of being qualified to produce circuits for IBM products. The system made five continuous-operation runs between mid-1974 and early 1975. Between runs, his group analyzed results and implemented improvements. The longest continuous run spanned 12 days. Wafer throughput averaged 58 wafers per day, 83 percent of its designed maximum. Average turnaround time from bare-wafer input to testable-circuits output was about 20 hours. The raw process time was 14 hours. The yield ultimately equaled the best ever achieved by East Fishkill’s conventional RAM-II production line. A total of 135 technicians, engineers, and managers from IBM locations worldwide were trained on the operation of the system. They produced 600 product-quality wafers with 17,000 RAM-II FET memory chips. But like his WWII commander, General Patton, Harding was bypassed to lead “the big show”—in Harding’s case, the creation of the new FMS automated line. Leaving the management career ladder behind, he was promoted to IBM Fellow, the highest nonmanagement level in the company. The FMS Feasibility Line, originally SWIFT, made its last continuous run in early 1975. It had accomplished its objectives. Its people were now needed to help create the FMS line to produce FS computers. But later in 1975, the FS project was canceled, and FMS became superfluous. A portion of the equipment destined for FMS became East Fishkill’s QTAT (Quick Turn Around Time) line, a groundbreaking IBM showpiece that is better remembered than its obscure predecessor, Project SWIFT. Although SWIFT’s life was short, and it was never in the limelight, its many innovations are clearly visible in today’s semiconductor fabs. Like SWIFT, these fabs are highly automated and computer controlled; have a central transport system and “Bernoulli” handlers, which exploit the flow of air to lift wafers without making physical contact; apply resist immediately after oxide or metal film formation; use steppers for lithographic pattern exposure; and employ real-time process control. All of these were groundbreaking features of Project SWIFT 50 years ago. The experience of working under Harding on SWIFT for three years was, for me, transformative. What had started with trepidation ended with admiration. I have come to consider Bill Harding a true genius, in his own way. Spurred on and supported by his unique management style, a small group of dedicated people achieved far more than anyone initially envisioned. More than even we ourselves thought possible. We think of the first achievers in an industry as the “fathers” of the modern embodiment of their inventions. Edison, Bell, Ford, and the Wright brothers, are commonly spoken of this way. In that sense, William E. Harding is clearly the father of the modern, automated, billion-dollar fab.

IBM was really invested on being \"vertically\" integrated \"from sand to software\" as they would say. One wonders what another run at this concept would be like given advances in semiconductor manufacture. I have often wondered if a chip fab that could make 1,000 chips of a given type economically (which is to say using your custom chip in your system was less expensive than adopting an off the shelf chip) would be a thing. The whole 'tiny tapeout' thing would be a lot more interesting too. reply MarkusWandel 6 hours agoparentI worked at a company that was vertically integrated. The fab was across the road from where ASICs were designed. The last technology node, I believe, was 130nm on 6\" wafers. To go the next step would have cost something like $1B in 1990s dollars. That's a tall order for an in-house fab; if you're going to spend that kind of money the fab had better be doing something all the time. So either you take on foundry work, or you get rid of the fab and farm out your work to a foundry elsewhere. As far as I know, the same thing happened up the food chain; the company that did make our next ASICs (IBM, Essex Junction Vermont) has spun off that fab as well. So it goes. reply topspin 16 hours agoparentprevJim Keller is working on a small fab design that is intended to make small runs economic. Atomic Semi.

And that's not necessary. If you could get a chip much more expensive but with specific advantages, you'd already have a business. See FPGAs. reply michaelt 6 hours agorootparentI've always found it amusing that somehow custom silicon makes economic sense in the absolute cheapest products. You look inside a child's toy? A musical greeting card? A remote control? A $5 multimeter? ASIC. Often in the form of a black epoxy blob 'chip on board'. You look inside a $30,000 industrial robot arm? No no no, we couldn't possibly afford custom silicon, FPGAs are the only option. reply MarkusWandel 6 hours agorootparentFirst of all the epoxy blob may well contain a mostly off-the-shelf SOC, maybe lightly customized (mask programmed ROM, choice of peripherals). Not a full custom design. Second, volume! If you're going to make a million of something, the NRE of a relatively low-tech chip isn't so bad. Also, FPGAs can be reprogrammed in the field if necessary. reply mjevans 21 minutes agorootparentVolume dominates here for the same reasons a standard sized screw / bolt will be used anywhere possible. (If even needed at all, the analogy falls apart for seam welded plastics.) The toys are also designed as make once and trash, since that's their sales model. The environmental costs of the resources aren't correctly factored in to the overall price. That super expensive robot arm is a tool that needs to work, it's economic value is in continued production. Modular components that can be replaced are more valued here to make warranty repairs and out of warranty field service possible. The customers literally demand and pay for that functionality. reply silisili 12 hours agoparentprevGiven that there are only three companies in the world even capable of competing on the sand side, I'd say that window of opportunity is increasingly shrinking. reply llm_trw 11 hours agorootparentYou can quite easily compete on old nodes and we will have to when old paid off hardware starts dying. reply silisili 11 hours agorootparentFull vertical integration implies big iron, or something like it. Nobody is going to buy TI 45nm today when 3nm exists and runs circles around it, no matter how good the software is. Old nodes are fine for a lot of industrial applications, but they don't care about the full stack software as much. The best seem to be those contracting the sand out and doing the rest. Nvidia, AMD, and all the new AI players.

It's the AMD GloFo all over again.

The masks (the \"negatives\" for the lithography) are the problem. A mask set (you need multiple exposures for one device) for a modern EUV node costs 20-30m$. That's the limiting factor. You can't get cheaper than that. As a sibling comment notes, multi-product wafers are a theoretical answer. However, since you have process corners (manufacturing defects aren't uniformly distributed on the wafer), it is unfeasible for anything but the cheapest parts. The real next moonshot in the foundry business would be to lower the respin costs, i.e., the amount of money it costs when your fabbed first silicon doesn't yield or validate functionally in the way you had expected/planned. If I were the US government (or any other), I'd focus on that. Subsidize the respin cost to zero in the short-term, given certain prerequisites for start-ups, and push an all-out Manhatten project RnD effort to lower the respin cost in the long run. reply mjevans 16 minutes agorootparentMasks make sense the same way mega-print runs with similar fixed plates / other high yield copy operations make sense. Offhand I'm not aware of a chip fab tech similar to the Laser Printer, not in a literal laser used to print but in a 'low run of tolerable quality' approach. The equivalent to a small print shop locally that has a medium-small range printer that does not use masks but churns out at high quality and speed. reply morcheeba 11 hours agorootparentprev>lower the respin costs You might be interested in structured ASICs, which allow for substantial reuse of masks between different products. At the extreme was a via-only definition product where all interconnects were specified with one mask (and the via masks were among the cheapest to make since they are very uniform). In regular ASIC development, we've had extra unrouted transistors available to wire in case of a mistake (so hopefully the respin involved just some new metal layers). Techniques like FIB can be used to test fixes to lower the number of respins, too. I'm not sure how much of this was automated to maximize chances of being useful. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_ASIC_platform reply ChuckMcM 15 hours agorootparentprevI get that for state of the art fabs. Those optimize for long runs on big wafers. My question though is can you find a solution at a different node which favors cost/turnaround at the expense of not scaling? For example, could one make a 200nm node with conventional UV masks and a limit of say 10 layers? Non mask lithography options?

But if you share a (Tower Semi, for instance) PDK, your device can have shuttle wafers with multiple designs from different companies.

    "originBody": "Games Publishers are absolutely terrified \"preserved video games would be used for recreational purposes,\" so the US copyright office has struck down a major effort for game preservation News By Dustin Bailey published October 25, 2024 \"This fails the needs of citizens in favor of a weak sauce argument from the industry, and it's really disappointing\" COMMENTS When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. (Image credit: Future) A three-year fight to help support game preservation has come to a sad end today. The US copyright office has denied a request for a DMCA exemption that would allow libraries to remotely share digital access to preserved video games. \"For the past three years, the Video Game History Foundation has been supporting with the Software Preservation Network (SPN) on a petition to allow libraries and archives to remotely share digital access to out-of-print video games in their collections,\" VGHF explains in its statement. \"Under the current anti-circumvention rules in Section 1201 of the DMCA, libraries and archives are unable to break copy protection on games in order to make them remotely accessible to researchers.\" Essentially, this exemption would open up the possibility of a digital library where historians and researchers could 'check out' digital games that run through emulators. The VGHF argues that around 87% of all video games released in the US before 2010 are now out of print, and the only legal way to access those games now is through the occasionally exorbitant prices and often failing hardware that defines the retro gaming market. Still, the US copyright office has said no. \"The Register concludes that proponents did not show that removing the single-user limitation for preserved computer programs or permitting off-premises access to video games are likely to be noninfringing,\" according to the final ruling. \"She also notes the greater risk of market harm with removing the video game exemption’s premises limitation, given the market for legacy video games.\" That ruling cites the belief of the Entertainment Software Association and other industry lobby groups that \"there would be a significant risk that preserved video games would be used for recreational purposes.\" We cannot, of course, entertain the notion that researchers enjoy their subjects for even a moment. More importantly, this also ignores the fact that libraries already lend out digital versions of more traditional media like books and movies to everyday people for what can only be described as recreational purposes. Members of the VGHF are naturally unhappy with the decision. \"Unfortunately, lobbying efforts by rightsholder groups continue to hold back progress,\" the group says in its statement, noting the ESA's absolutist position that it would not support a similar sort of copyright reform under any circumstances. \"I'm proud of the work we and the orgs we partnered with did to try and change copyright law,\" VGHF founder and director Frank Cifaldi says on Twitter. \"We really gave it our all, I can't see what else we could have done. This fails the needs of citizens in favor of a weak sauce argument from the industry, and it's really disappointing.\" Sign up to the GamesRadar+ Newsletter Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors By submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.

They think these older games would cannibalize sales from newer releases. I play retro games. Mostly on Retroarch. I play those games because I genuinely think they are better and more enjoyable than the vast majority of crap released nowadays.

They would just get me to stop playing videogames. reply sevensor 22 hours agoparentIndeed; I’m still enjoying games from 1994. They haven’t stopped being fun simply because they’re old. They also represent a significant learning effort over the years. One of the things that makes a game enjoyable is having learned how to play it well. I’m not likely to make that kind of investment in too many more games in my life. I haven’t got that kind of free time. So for me as well, it’s not old games versus new, it’s old games or nothing. reply mcronce 20 hours agorootparentThe learning effort thing is a solid point.

Obviously the level design and whatnot aren't the same as the original, but the controls and physics are and I learned those as a fairly young child in the 90s.

That was a rhetoric question, because I think they would only be happy if retro games became unavailable, so their profit grew a bit next quarter.

It's an argument for why the rules shouldn't be loosened for the preservation foundation. > Still, the US copyright office has said no. \"The Register concludes that proponents did not show that removing the single-user limitation for preserved computer programs or permitting off-premises access to video games are likely to be noninfringing,\" according to the final ruling. \"She also notes the greater risk of market harm with removing the video game exemption’s premises limitation, given the market for legacy video games.\" That quote (from the GamesRadar article) to me, makes it clear that the \"[...] preserved video games would be used for recreational purposes\" quote is being used as a gotcha. It's not that they don't want you to play old games, it's that they don't want copyright restrictions to be loosened. It's a very similar situation to the recent Internet Archive book. Current copyright law doesn't let you loan out format-shifted works. Copyright length is too long, but within the copyright framework, the restrictions seem sensible to me. reply ericra 21 hours agoprevThis is not surprising, and unfortunately, this situation is unlikely to get better any time soon given our increasingly conservative (corp friendly) federal courts. It's really a shame because these corps have shown they can't be trusted to properly archive their own games, and any change of ownership or economic fortune can mean they are lost forever. From a personal level, I'll just keep doing what I've always done. Help archive the things I can. Support and buy games from smaller devs or publishers who care about their games. And if you want to play something from a shitty AAA dev, nothing is stopping you from playing it anyway for free and just giving the money to your favorite charity instead. Consumers can have a lot of power if they choose to exercise it. reply ryandrake 17 hours agoparent> This is not surprising, and unfortunately, this situation is unlikely to get better any time soon given our increasingly conservative (corp friendly) federal courts.

That’s the primary reason they don’t still sell their old games. reply jmiskovic 21 hours agorootparentIMO the primary reason is the difficulty of supporting older titles across various modern systems, for a too small of an audience. If older games were so popular GOG would dominate the market by now. reply thot_experiment 19 hours agorootparentThey don't *need* to support shit, I would pay for the rom dumps if there was a way for me to do so.

They don't need to spend even one cent of their money on this stuff. The world is literally filled with people who love these games so much they learned computer hardware and programming because of it. People who love these things to the point they'll reverse engineer the consoles and make emulators to make sure they are playable again long after the hardware has crumbled to dust. People who obsess about things like cycle accuracy and undocumented hardware behavior in order to make sure even the nonsensical bugs in the system are recreated because there were games out there relying on those things to do something awesome with limited resources. People who will reverse engineer the games themselves and make open source engines for the content. These people are beyond awesome, they literally do this because they enjoy it. All these corporations have to do is get the hell out of these people's way, for they are doing god's work. That's literally all they have to do. They just gotta shut up, stop whining about their \"lost sales\" and let these people do what they gotta do. reply BriggyDwiggs42 21 hours agorootparentprevYeah you’re probably right. Nevermind. reply jeffreyrogers 22 hours agoprevI think this is the correct thing to do as far as copyright law goes, but it seems to me that copyright terms are far too long to fulfill their original purpose: incentivize the distribution of creative works. Originally copyright was for relatively short terms (20 years IIRC). It is now life of the author + 70 years or 95 years from publication if the copyright holder is a corporation. Some organizations advocate for perpetual copyright terms as well. Given the extremely long terms now available there is little incentive to quickly extract value from the copyrighted work. Patents exist for the same reason and have been similarly coopted by their holders. Edit: if copyright terms were shorter publishers would be incentivized to keep their games in print and to update them for newer media/platforms. reply wvenable 22 hours agoparentThere are so many ways that copyright duration could be adjusted to dramatically reduce the duration for out-of-print not-for-sale works while simultaneously allowing Disney to keep Mickey Mouse. The fact that it's a single fixed duration that continues to be extended for just a minuscule fraction of works is ultimately the issue. reply BriggyDwiggs42 22 hours agorootparentWhy do we want disney to keep mickey though? Just make it a flat 10-15 years and never extend it. reply jeffreyrogers 22 hours agorootparentprevMickey Mouse is in the public domain now (the original one at least), but I agree with your argument. reply wvenable 22 hours agorootparentI'm totally okay with Mickey Mouse being copyrighted again if we could find a system that allowed for abandoned works to be out of copyright. It would be a huge boon to human culture. reply vunderba 22 hours agoparentprevHonestly, I'd like to see something more along the lines of the copyright lasts the lifetime of the author unless it gets sold. Once it gets sold it immediately starts a shot clock of exactly 20 years. Though honestly anything would be better than what we have now. reply extraduder_ire 15 hours agorootparentWouldn't that give an advantage to any copyright assigned to a company, or subsidiary thereof? Or lead to lengthy licencing deals rather than outright sales? reply hakfoo 14 hours agorootparentThe idea is solid, I suspect it just needs some tweaks to the language. \"It's not a sale, it's a license\", ironically reminds me of sovereign-citizen \"I'm not driving, I'm travelling and don't need a license, Officer\" BS. reply BLKNSLVR 21 hours agoprevIt's funny how they keep actively pushing normal people towards, rather than away from, piracy (or copyright infringement). From a certain angle it could be seen that they're backing people into a corner from which the only escape is piracy, and once the convenience of that apple has been tasted, it's difficult to go back to the sub-standard service provision and heavy usage restrictions of the 'legitimate' world. reply raxxorraxor 6 hours agoparentValve isn't in this horror cabinet of an industry lobbying group because they have customer orientation. Against all odds, they pioneered online distribution. They had a secret though and that was to not being shitty to their customers.

Every year some or the other group begs the copyright office for some minor exception and most of them get denied. This is the wrong game. To win at this, you need to create your own market and succeed in it. And then you can buy your own politicans. Imagine if uber had asked the taxi board for exceptions for ride sharing. Or if Tesla had waited till states allowed them to sell (they didn't; they started selling on Indian land).

It's an open secret that despite constant public statements from games publishers about their old IP still having value that it's actually a scheme to push consumers on the new content treadmill. Now we have someone confirming in court that it's exactly that. Which is a terrible misuse of copyright that goes against even its most publisher-friendly interpretation. Meta: I don't think the phrase is actually overused, I think it's used so much due to so many companies all discovering at once that they don't have to spend time crafting a plausible cover narrative, and that nothing will happen if they just say they're being shitty and there's nothing you can do about it. reply ndriscoll 20 hours agorootparentObviously there is something you can do about it though: casually ignore copyright law because the government is acting illegitimately, just like people do with drugs. If you're interested in, say, ROMs, it doesn't take much work to find a community (say, a subreddit) that's interested in that topic and will tell you where to find what you want. Or if you're too lazy for that, you can search for retro games on amazon and find consoles with 10s of thousands of them preloaded. The quiet part that citizens can say out loud is that for individuals, copyright basically runs on the honor system. If you don't think the situation is fair, you can just ignore those restrictions. reply jmward01 22 hours agoprevPatent, trademark, copyright, etc are all supposed to benefit society as a whole. The point isn't that corporations get to lock things away forever. The goal is to incentivize innovation, both technological and cultural. The more companies make the argument that 'thing x from a long time ago is crucial to us now' the more I think that our current IP laws are actually slowing down innovation instead of incentivizing it. Maybe we need a new system that starts costing money after a point to maintain IP rights. That system would recognize the value taken by private companies holding on to old IP to the detriment of society and force them to come up with new things to justify their existence instead of living off of that one thing they did right 100 years ago. reply nine_k 22 hours agoparent(Repeating for n-th time:) I like the idea of exponential cost of IP protection. First 10 or so years the protection is free. Then, on the first year of paid protection, you pay $10. On the second, $20. On the tenth, $10,240. On the sixteenth, $655,360. The year you miss a payment the protection ceases. If your IP is immensely valuable and is bringing you gobs of money, you can continue paying and keep your monopoly. But the case of keeping reams of stuff under the lock \"just in case\" would be largely eliminated. Anything that's not a cash cow currently being milked and paid for would get released to the public domain. On top of that, the federal budget would receive some extra money, but only from those who is making money, and not the small guy who just has published an indie game on Steam. reply pixelpoet 21 hours agorootparentThat sounds like a really good idea, one problem though: this doesn't benefit the lawmaking and law-exploiting classes, so why would it happen? It's pretty clear that the legal system mostly exists to preserve big financial interests. I spent much of my adult life watching SCO play the system... reply bluGill 21 hours agorootparentVoters need to make it clear that it does benefit the lawmaking class. Votes are more powerful than money in politics - but only if you use them. If you fall for one party is all good you have lost power. The hard part is getting enough other voters to care. If it is just you money is more important. If it is you and many others though you beat money. reply nwiswell 21 hours agorootparentprevThis clearly benefits wealthy owners of IP (disney, movie studios, game publishers, etc) over small-time artists (self-published authors, small bands, etc) since the period of time that IP protection remains an economic choice is strongly tied to the value of the IP. E.g., if you write a book and realize $5,000 in sales per year, then 10 * 2^x=5000 where x is 8.97, so you only enjoy 8 years of revenues ($40,000) and you've paid Σ(1->8) 10 * 2^x = $5,100 for the privilege, for a net $34,900 or 6.98x the yearly royalty value. If Dreamworks sees $500M a year in Minions merchandising, then 10 * 2^x=500,000,000 where x = 25.56 and so Dreamworks realizes 25 years of revenues ($12,500,000,000) and pays Σ(1->25) 10 * 2^x = $671,088,620 for the privilege, for a net $11,828,911,380 or 23.66x the yearly royalty value. This is backward, in my opinion. reply nine_k 14 hours agorootparentBig acts grossing colossal figures can continue that for a longer time. But the growth of the fee is exponential, while sales never grow exponentially for indefinite time. I can agree that the base of 2 may be too low; let's take 4 instead. Let's assume that Dreamworks are so good that they get $500M a year for a particular IP. For 10 years they enjoy free coverage. But even if on year 25 of coverage they would still have been making some money on the franchise, next year they go badly into the red.

Rowling doesn't have exclusive rights to her books, past the first couple. Lots of copyright-related suits (most?) are made by Warner Bros.

Do you want a Spotify playlist? reply wormius 21 hours agorootparentprevThere are no residuals for game devs. It's work for hire, so holding on to this idea that they will get paid money for every sale (even after it's no longer sold - but maybe somehow once these assholes \"resurrect\" a game they never bothered to bring back after 30 years, will somehow benefit the actual people who made it is a joke). This has nothing to do \"their livelihood and retirement\"It's about protecting corporate profits in the very slim case they may discover that bringing something back (ha sure) will benefit the corporation that OWNS the rights. IP isn't the same across the board it's not like game devs are singers who have ASCAP/BMI etc protections. Game devs are code jockeys who get shit on by the corporations with NO rights to the actual work THEY produced. Why do you act like this is the same as music with perpetual rights to the actual creators? It rarely if ever is. You can go ahead and \"blame\" the workers you claim to support for failing to \"put that in their employment contract, it is a \"free market\" for labor, after all\" or you can work on changing the system to at least let the past be free and open and history have a chance of being important or just let it all be locked in a vault, in disuse in the \"hope\" that maybe someday a corporation will \"release\" it again as a game. Or you can let people who ARE passionate about it work on it and let the public have the right to it. As the parent comments point out, the LITERAL REASON OF COPYRIGHT IN THE US CONSTITUTION is to benefit the public. It has nothing to do with giant corps getting rich as fuck off other people's labor. Contract law gets in the way and lets these pricks steal the work and wealth, deny people the rights and only THEY get the benefit, this is the precise opposite of the public benefit intended. Culture happens on faster and faster cycles than ever before, yet instead of admitting the speed of it, these behemoths who own IP, demand continual extensions (well until the most recent time when Disney finally relented and let Steamboat Willy enter the Public Domain recently). Instead of promoting \"innovation\" (as phrased in the US Constitution), it promotes lethargy slouch and continued re-use of the same things. It's the exact opposite of the intent. And no, this bullshit about \"livelihoods and retirement\" mean jackshit in game dev. You shit your game out, you got paid for that work, and that's it. All the excess profits go to the corp, not the actual devs. IP in this case is not about humans owning/making, and it's corporations through and through, and unless you held onto the same corporation for 40 years, as the creator, it's not going to be you getting the supposed benefit of this. reply BriggyDwiggs42 22 hours agoparentprevIp rights should just end after a relatively quick slice of time.

Eg, the name “Kleenex” is (was?) a granted trademark, to help customers identify products from that specific company. “Kleenex” has somewhat become generic, but I don’t think this is really better or worse for humanity in general — it just removes some branding strength from Kleenex. - copyright lasts life of author +70 years.

Giving somebody a monopoly on an idea for that amount of time is a huge impediment on the free market. The other issue with patents is that the whole underlying idea is questionable. You're supposed to give people access to your idea in return for protection. But what is the value of that access? In a lot of areas, the value is zero, since reverse-engineering (or just looking at something) will give you all the information contained in the patent. I suspect that most patents are giving companies a long-term monopoly on an idea, and providing absolutely no, or close to no value in return. reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 21 hours agorootparentI think it's the other way around. Patents are hard work, often you make a physical product and you get a measly 20 years. Meanwhile, copyrighted material flows out of my ass and gets 70+ years. Ridiculous. Why bother making anything? reply adrian_b 20 hours agorootparentI think that you have not read many patents. There have been patents that are the result of hard work, but there is a deluge of patents that contain only ideas that are so obvious that nobody was shameless enough to attempt to patent them before. Moreover the majority of patents contain extraordinarily broad claims, which cover many things that the authors of the patent have never succeeded to make, but they include the claims in the patent with the hope that someone else will find a way to make those things and then they will reveal the patent and blackmail those who have actually made a real device. In the old times, for a patent to be granted there was a condition to present a working prototype embodying the claims of the patent. Unfortunately this condition has gone a long time ago, otherwise it would have filtered most ridiculous patent claims. reply pinkmuffinere 19 hours agorootparentThese sorts of patents do exist, but they are not made “correctly”. Patents are supposed to contain novel ideas that are not obvious to experienced practitioners in the field. I think I agree with your criticism, except I feel it is a criticism of the execution of the law/system, rather than the law itself. reply ndriscoll 19 hours agorootparentThe law itself is broken, at least when combined with trade secret law. When you look at the incentive structure, you see the no one would apply for a patent if they thought it was actually difficult for others to independently figure out or reverse engineer; it's better to simply keep it a secret, and anyone sharing it will be liable for civil action and criminal prosecution. If you believe that others will figure it out on their own anyway, then it makes sense to patent it to deny them the ability to do so. Pretty much the entirety of IP law is a farce. The whole story about wanting to incentivize companies to share their secrets doesn't even make sense. If we want the body of public knowledge to grow, don't legally protect secrets. Make non-competes illegal and make NDAs have a short maximum time limit, and you won't need to do anything special for knowledge to proliferate. The nerds that actually make things tend to like talking about how it works. reply eikenberry 21 hours agorootparentprevThe problem with patents is not the length, it is that they are being applied to a general ideas and not implementations of those ideas.

This has an extreme effect compared to the natural state (no IP restrictions). I argue that the effects of patents is actually poorly understood, and most arguments for how they work fail to explain how and why open source works, revealing serious flaws in the foundational theories of IP restrictions. The sole function of a patent is to restrict innovation. That’s the only direct result of patents. All other claims about encouraging innovation rely on beliefs about secondary and tertiary effects which I believe are incomplete, out of date, and often simply incorrect.

You _could_ write a story similar to Harry Potter without infringing copyright, but it isn’t just the name “harry potter” or some other substring that’s protected.

Assumption 2: Without IP laws, people would not produce works(aside from credits and attribution). Engineers will stop engineering. Lawyers will stop writing opinions. Scientists won't write research papers. Assumption 3: IP laws did work to incentivize production and technological advancement, and they are only or the primary means to do so. We just need to reign in the excess. Assumption 4: People who created useful works for its own sake are not valuable(open source software/hardware, inventors inventing things and freely publishing information, etc). Patents and copyright laws should favors the people who use copyright and patents over them, and the profit motive should reign supreme. reply BriggyDwiggs42 22 hours agorootparentIs this meant to be a rewording of the parent comment as a critique, or is it meant to be an expression of your views? I’d probably contest assumptions 3 and 4, but I’m not sure if you yourself even support them. reply kiba 21 hours agorootparentHow about both? You are welcome to critique my opinion. As for assumption 3, there's SpaceX. They don't open their design of their rockets to the public where their competitors, such as the Chinese can copy them. Neither the US government nor SpaceX wants that. So there's a large amount of innovations, probably countless designs that went into these rockets. Maybe in a better geopolitical situation, patents would be respected, but why would SpaceX gives everyone the blueprint to catch up? Patents make more sense if designs are easily reverse engineered and you still want a monopoly to make back your investment. That is clearly false as people have made innovation in 3D printing where new designs are standardized for the benefit of the whole market. Assumption 4 is the defacto state of things even if it were not the intention. People who invent useful things for the sake of useful things are clearly at a disadvantage against corporations or entities who have more money to hire lawyers. There's already at least one case of a trivial patent for 3D printing stronger layers that expired being repatented again by another company, increasing legal uncertainty from implementing the technique in slicers and other software. Most slicer these days are open source, generally don't make money for its developers(at least not directly), but they do grow the 3D printing market through its active development. The slicers also happen to share code, unsurprising given that they are forks of one another. Clearly, this model is incompatible with the patent system as it stands. reply tastyfreeze 21 hours agorootparentOn the SpaceX example, they couldn't release their designs even if they wanted to. ITAR prohibits it. If they weren't prohibited from sharing rocket technology SpaceX might share. Tesla patents are open. I don't see why Musk wouldn't do the same for SpaceX if the government allowed it. reply kiba 21 hours agorootparentI don't see Musk doing that as he directly stated it himself. As for Tesla patents, I would speculate that it's more about companies not willing copy Tesla which is why Telsa doesn't really care if they open source the information. Copying isn't always so easy especially if there are structural issues involved. Recall the superchargers that became standard. Other companies were using a different connector, but the supercharger connector was obviously superior and they relented after many years. Patents are more useful in situation in which your designs are easily reverse engineered and there's little barrier in copying. In any case, there are firms in the automative industry that specialized in doing the teardown of cars and doing cost estimation. Such a firm would tell their competitors how Tesla actually make their cars, so there's not much value in publishing their patents anyway, other than PR stunts. Patents are not as useful in scenarios in which trade secrets provide a strong and durable barrier to entry. They also require lawsuits to enforce, which is rather costly and imposes cost on our economy, so there's inefficiency to consider as well. Theoretically, a monopoly in this instance would incentivize R&D effort but we know that monopolies has various nasty side effects and not everybody have money to hire lawyers and enforce them. reply nox101 20 hours agorootparentprevThere's lots mixed up with IP laws. Are talking inventions (patents) or works of art (books, movies, music, games) I certainly know that most games and movies wouldn't exist without a monetary incentive. They take too much work to make. There are exceptions. You can make pong in a few hours and you can shoot a movie of yourself talking. You can also do both as a hobby a few hours a night. But, most movies require sets, costumes, props, and lots of other equipment and labor. Most games also require many person years of work. It's unlikely people would put in that much work if they couldn't make a living from it as it allows them to do it full time so they actually have the time needed. OTOH, music \"can\" take a few hours and so could be done more easily as a hobby so while not all forms of music would continue I suspect we'd still get tons of it with without monetary incentives..

Are there good examples of history where a society that didn't have some similar system out-innovated one that did? Are there good parallels today? reply zjuventus14 21 hours agorootparentHighly recommend the book “Against Intellectual Monopoly” which argues against IP law with a lot of historical references. One such example is paint & coloring in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. From the book - “In 1862, British firms controlled about 50 percent of the world market and French firms another 40 percent, with Swiss and German companies as marginal players. By 1873, German companies had 50 percent of the market, while French, Swiss, and British firms controlled between 13 percent and 17 percent each. In 1913, German firms had a market share of more than 80 percent, the Swiss had about 8 percent, and the rest of the world had disappeared.” Switzerland at the time had no patent protection, and Germany allowed processes to be patented in 1877 but not products themselves. Parallels are harder to find today due to the expansion of IP law as a condition of trade with many developed nations, but the book does have some more recent examples. reply heysammy 22 hours agorootparentprevHow could we have gotten great works like Canterbury Tales or Beowulf without rent-seeking copyright protectionism? reply nickff 22 hours agorootparentI am not a die-hard supporter of IP protection laws, but your examples are classic survivorship bias, as well as falling victim to the broken windows fallacy. reply kiba 21 hours agorootparentIt is not a given that we should incentivize the production of cultural good beyond of what is already achievable. I should note that there is already strong intrinsic motivation to create and there are already too many works to read, watch, or listen, and a lot of slops created clearly to make money. People are willing to accept deplorable working conditions to pursue their dreams, such as developing video games.

The main problems with current copyright laws, I think, is the creators need to sell their right to one of a handful of powerful corporations to make money at all, then those corporations grip on their rights and monopolize it, even if it means something isn't available at all. A better idea would be author's rights that can't be sold, and licensing that can't be denied.

    "originBody": "Article Open access Published: 03 January 2024 Inferring neural activity before plasticity as a foundation for learning beyond backpropagation Yuhang Song, Beren Millidge, Tommaso Salvatori, Thomas Lukasiewicz, Zhenghua Xu & Rafal Bogacz Nature Neuroscience volume 27, pages 348–358 (2024)Cite this article 58k Accesses 7 Citations 439 Altmetric Metrics details Abstract For both humans and machines, the essence of learning is to pinpoint which components in its information processing pipeline are responsible for an error in its output, a challenge that is known as ‘credit assignment’. It has long been assumed that credit assignment is best solved by backpropagation, which is also the foundation of modern machine learning. Here, we set out a fundamentally different principle on credit assignment called ‘prospective configuration’. In prospective configuration, the network first infers the pattern of neural activity that should result from learning, and then the synaptic weights are modified to consolidate the change in neural activity. We demonstrate that this distinct mechanism, in contrast to backpropagation, (1) underlies learning in a well-established family of models of cortical circuits, (2) enables learning that is more efficient and effective in many contexts faced by biological organisms and (3) reproduces surprising patterns of neural activity and behavior observed in diverse human and rat learning experiments. Similar content being viewed by others Backpropagation and the brain Article 17 April 2020 Learning efficient backprojections across cortical hierarchies in real time Article 06 June 2024 Loss of plasticity in deep continual learning Article Open access 21 August 2024 Main The credit assignment problem1 lies at the very heart of learning. Backpropagation2, as a simple yet effective credit assignment theory, has powered notable advances in artificial intelligence since its inception3,4,5 and has also gained a predominant place in understanding learning in the brain1,6,7,8. Due to this success, much recent work has focused on understanding how biological neural networks could learn in a way similar to backpropagation9,10,11,12; although many proposed models do not implement backpropagation exactly, they nevertheless try to approximate backpropagation, and much emphasis is placed on how close this approximation is9,11,13,14. However, learning in the brain is superior to backpropagation in many critical aspects. For example, compared to the brain, backpropagation requires many more exposures to a stimulus to learn15 and suffers from catastrophic interference of newly and previously stored information16. This raises the question of whether using backpropagation to understand learning in the brain should be the main focus of the field. Here, we propose that the brain instead solves credit assignment with a fundamentally different principle, which we call ‘prospective configuration’. In prospective configuration, before synaptic weights are modified, neural activity changes across the network so that output neurons better predict the target output; only then are the synaptic weights (hereafter termed ‘weights’) modified to consolidate this change in neural activity. By contrast, in backpropagation, the order is reversed; weight modification takes the lead, and the change in neural activity is the result that follows. We identify prospective configuration as a principle that is implicitly followed by a well-established family of neural models with solid biological groundings, namely, energy-based networks. These networks include Hopfield networks17 and predictive coding networks18, which have been successfully used to describe information processing in the cortex19. To support the theory of prospective configuration, we show that it can both yield efficient learning, which humans and animals are capable of, and reproduce data from experiments on human and animal learning. Thus, on the one hand, we demonstrate that prospective configuration performs more efficient and effective learning than backpropagation in various situations faced by biological systems, such as learning with deep structures, online learning, learning with a limited amount of training examples, learning in changing environments, continual learning with multiple tasks and reinforcement learning. On the other hand, we demonstrate that patterns of neural activity and behavior in diverse human and animal learning experiments, including sensorimotor learning, fear conditioning and reinforcement learning, can be naturally explained by prospective configuration but not by backpropagation. Guided by the belief that backpropagation is the foundation of biological learning, previous work showed that energy-based networks can closely approximate backpropagation. However, to achieve it, the networks were set up in an unnatural way, such that the neural activity was prevented from substantially changing before weight modification by constraining the supervision signal to be infinitely small (for example, as in equilibrium propagation11 and in previous studies using predictive coding networks12,20) or last an infinitely short time14,21. By contrast, we reveal that energy-based networks without these unrealistic constraints follow the distinct principle of prospective configuration rather than backpropagation and are superior in both learning efficiency and accounting for data on biological learning. Here, we introduce prospective configuration with an intuitive example, show how it originates from energy-based networks and describe its advantages and quantify them in a rich set of biologically relevant learning tasks. We show that prospective configuration naturally explains patterns of neural activity and behavior in diverse learning experiments. Results Prospective configuration: an intuitive example To optimally plan behavior, it is critical for the brain to predict future stimuli, for example, to predict sensations in some modalities on the basis of other modalities22. If the observed outcome differs from the prediction, the weights in the whole network need to be updated so that predictions in the ‘output’ neurons are corrected. Backpropagation computes how the weights should be modified to minimize the error on the output, and this weight update results in a change in neural activity when the network next makes the prediction. By contrast, we propose that neural activity is first adjusted to a new configuration so that the output neurons better predict the observed outcome (target pattern); the weights are then modified to reinforce this configuration of neural activity. We call this configuration of neural activity ‘prospective’ because it is the neural activity that the network should produce to correctly predict the observed outcome. In agreement with the proposed mechanism of prospective configuration, it has indeed been widely observed in biological neurons that presenting the outcome of a prediction triggers changes in neural activity; for example, in tasks requiring animals to predict a juice delivery, the reward triggers rapid changes in activity not only in the gustatory cortex but also in multiple cortical regions23,24. To highlight the difference between backpropagation and prospective configuration, consider a simple example (Fig. 1a). Imagine a bear seeing a river. In the bear’s mind, the sight generates predictions of hearing water and smelling salmon. On that day, the bear indeed smelled the salmon but did not hear the water, perhaps due to an ear injury, and thus the bear needs to change its expectation related to the sound. Backpropagation (Fig. 1b) would proceed by backpropagating the negative error to reduce the weights on the path between the visual and auditory neurons. However, this also entails a reduction of the weights between visual and olfactory neurons that would compromise the expectation of smelling the salmon the next time the river is visited, even though the smell of salmon was present and correctly predicted. These undesired and unrealistic side effects of learning with backpropagation are closely related with the phenomenon of catastrophic interference, where learning a new association destroys previously learned memories16. This example shows that, with backpropagation, even learning one new aspect of an association may interfere with the memory of other aspects of the same association. Fig. 1: Prospective configuration avoids interference during learning. a, Abstract (top) and concrete (bottom) examples of a task inducing interference during learning. One stimulus input (seeing the water) triggers two prediction outputs (hearing the water and smelling the salmon). One output is correct (smelling the salmon), whereas the other output is an error (not hearing the water). b,c, Backpropagation produces interference during learning; not hearing the water reduces the expectation of smelling the salmon (b), although the salmon was indeed smelled. Prospective configuration, on the other hand, avoids such interference (c). In backpropagation, negative error propagates from the error output to hidden neurons (b; left). This causes a weakening of some connections, which, on the next trial, improves the incorrect output but also reduces the prediction of the correct output, thus introducing interference (b; middle and right). In prospective configuration, neural activity settles into a new configuration (different intensities of purple) before weight modification (c; left). This configuration corresponds to the activity that should be produced after learning, that is, is ‘prospective’. Hence, it foresees the positive error on the correct output and modifies the connections to improve the incorrect output while maintaining the correct output (c; middle and right). Full size image By contrast, prospective configuration assumes that learning starts with the neurons being configured to a new state, which corresponds to a pattern enabling the network to correctly predict the observed outcome. The weights are then modified to consolidate this state. This behavior can ‘foresee’ side effects of potential weight modifications and compensate for them dynamically (Fig. 1c). To correct the negative error on the incorrect output, the hidden neurons settle to their prospective state of lower activity, and, as a result, a positive error is revealed and allocated to the correct output. Consequently, prospective configuration increases the weights connecting to the correct output, whereas backpropagation does not (Fig. 1b,c). Hence, prospective configuration is able to correct the side effects of learning an association effectively and efficiently and with little interference. Origin of prospective configuration: energy-based networks To show how prospective configuration naturally arises in energy-based networks, we introduce a physical machine analog, which provides an intuitive understanding of energy-based networks and how they produce the mechanism of prospective configuration. Energy-based networks have been widely and successfully used in describing biological neural systems17,25. In these models, a neural circuit is described by a dynamical system driven by reducing an abstract ‘energy’, for example, reflecting errors made by neurons (Methods). Neural activity and weights change to reduce this energy; hence, they can be considered ‘movable parts’ of the dynamical system. We show that energy-based networks are mathematically equivalent to a physical machine (we call it ‘energy machine’), where the energy function has an intuitive interpretation, and its dynamics are straightforward; the energy machine simply adjusts its movable parts to reduce energy. The energy machine includes nodes sliding on vertical posts connected with each other via rods and springs (Fig. 2a,b). Translating from energy-based networks to the energy machine, neural activity maps to the vertical position of a solid node, a connection maps to a rod (blue arrow) pointing from one node to another (where the weight determines how the end position of the rod relates to the initial position), and the energy function maps to the elastic potential energy of springs with nodes attached on both ends (the natural length of the springs is 0). Different energy functions and network structures result in different energy-based networks, corresponding to energy machines with different configurations and combinations of nodes, rods and springs. In Fig. 2, we present the energy machine of predictive coding networks12,18 because they are most accessible and are established to be closely related to backpropagation12,14. Fig. 2: The energy machine reveals a new understanding of energy-based networks, the mechanism of prospective configuration and its theoretical advantages. A subset of energy-based networks can be visualized as mechanical machines that perform equivalent computations. Here, we present the energy machine corresponding to predictive coding networks12,18. In the energy machine, the activity of a neuron corresponds to the height of a node (represented by a solid circle) sliding on a post. The input to the neuron is represented by a hollow node on the same post. A synaptic connection corresponds to a rod pointing from a solid node to a hollow node. The weight determines how the input to a postsynaptic neuron depends on the activity of a presynaptic neuron; hence, it influences the angle of the rod. In energy-based networks, relaxation (that is, neural dynamics) and weight modification (that is, weight dynamics) are both driven by minimizing the energy, which corresponds to relaxation of the energy machine by moving the nodes and tuning the rods, respectively. a,b, Predictions (a) and learning (b) in energy-based networks visualized by the energy machine. The pin indicates that neural activity is fixed to the input or target pattern. Here, it is revealed that relaxation infers prospective neural activity, toward which the weights are then modified, a mechanism that we call prospective configuration. c, Physical implementation (top) and connectivity of a predictive coding network12,18 (bottom), which has dynamics mathematically equivalent to those of the energy machine in the middle (see Methods for details). d, The learning problem in Fig. 1 visualized by the energy machine, which learns to improve the incorrect output while not interfering with the correct output, thanks to the mechanism of prospective configuration. Full size image The dynamics of energy-based networks, which are driven by minimizing the energy function, map to relaxation of the energy machine, which is driven by reducing the total elastic potential energy on the springs. A prediction with energy-based networks involves clamping the input neurons to the provided stimulus and updating the activity of the other neurons, which corresponds to fixing one side of the energy machine and letting the energy machine relax by moving nodes (Fig. 2a). Learning with energy-based networks involves clamping the input and output neurons to the corresponding stimulus, first letting the activities of the remaining neurons converge and then updating weights, which corresponds to fixing both sides of the energy machine and letting the energy machine relax first by moving nodes and then tuning rods (Fig. 2b). The energy machine reveals the essence of energy-based networks; relaxation before weight modification lets the network settle to a new configuration of neural activity corresponding to the neural activity that would have occurred after the error was corrected by the modification of weights, that is, prospective activity (thus, we call this mechanism prospective configuration). For example, the second-layer ‘neuron’ in Fig. 2b increases its activity, and this increase in activity would also be caused by the subsequent weight modification (of the connection between the first and second neurons). In simple terms, relaxation in energy-based networks infers the prospective neural activity after learning, toward which the weights are then modified. This distinguishes it from backpropagation, where weight modification takes the lead, and the change in neural activity is the result that follows. The bottom of Fig. 2c shows the connectivity of a predictive coding network12,18, which has dynamics mathematically equivalent to those of the energy machine shown above it. Predictive coding networks include neurons (blue) corresponding to nodes on the posts and separate neurons encoding prediction errors (red) corresponding to springs. For details, see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1, where we list equations describing predictive coding networks and show how they map on the neural implementation and the proposed energy machine. Using the energy machine, Fig. 2d simulates the learning problem from Fig. 1. Here, we can see that prospective configuration indeed foresees the result of learning and its side effects through relaxation. Hence, it corrects the side effects within one iteration, which would otherwise take multiple iterations for backpropagation. Advantages of prospective configuration: reduced interference and faster learning Here, we quantify interference in the above scenario and demonstrate how reduced interference translates into an advantage in performance. In all simulations in the main text, prospective configuration is implemented in predictive coding networks (other energy-based models are considered in the Supplementary Notes, Section 2.1). We also compare the performance of predictive coding networks against artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained with backpropagation because they are closely related, which makes the comparisons fair. In particular, although predictive coding networks include recurrent connections, they generate the same prediction for a given input (when inputs are constrained but outputs are not; Fig. 2a) as standard feedforward ANNs if their weights are set to corresponding values12,14. Therefore, loss is the same function of weights in both models, so direct minimization of loss with gradient descent in predictive coding networks (which is not their natural way of training) would produce the same weight changes as backpropagation in ANNs. Hence, comparing predictive coding networks and backpropagation enables isolation of the effects of the learning algorithm (prospective configuration versus direct minimization of loss as in backpropagation). In Fig. 3a, we compare the activity of output neurons in the example in Fig. 1 between backpropagation and prospective configuration. Initially both output neurons are active (top right), and the output should change toward a target in which one of the neurons is inactive (red vector). Learning with prospective configuration results in changes on the output (purple solid vector) that are aligned better with the target than those for backpropagation (purple dotted vector). Fig. 3: Learning with prospective configuration changes the activity of output neurons in a direction more aligned toward the target. a, Simulation of the network from Fig. 1 showing changes in the correct and incorrect output neurons during training (‘Iteration’) trained with both learning rules. Here, learning with prospective configuration (purple solid vector) aligns better with the target (red vector) than learning with backpropagation (purple dashed vector). b, Interference can be quantified by ‘target alignment’, the cosine similarity of the direction of the target (red vector) and the direction of learning (purple vector). c, Higher target alignment indicates less interference and vice versa. d, The same experiment as in a repeated with a learning rate ranging from 0.005 to 0.5 represented by the size of the markers, where it is shown that the choice of learning rate changes the trajectories for both methods slightly, but the conclusion holds irrespective of the learning rate. e, Target alignment of randomly generated networks trained with both learning rules as a function of depth of the network. Each symbol shows target alignment resulting from training on a single randomly generated pattern. f, Test error during training on the FashionMNIST60 dataset containing images of clothing belonging to different categories for both learning rules with a deep neural network of 15 layers. Here, ‘test error’ refers to the ratio of incorrectly classified samples among all samples in the test set. g, Mean of the test error over training epochs (reflecting how fast test error drops) as a function of learning rate. Results in f and h are for the learning rates giving the minima of the corresponding curves in g. h, Mean of test error of other network depths. Each point is from a learning rate independently optimized for each learning rule in the corresponding setup of network depth. In e–h, prospective configuration demonstrates a notable advantage as the structure gets deeper. Each experiment in f–h was repeated with n = 3 random seeds. Error bars and bands represent the 68% confidence interval. Source data Full size image Following the first weight update, we simulate multiple iterations until the network is able to correctly predict the target. Here, ‘iteration’ refers to each time the agent is presented with stimuli and conducts one weight update because of the stimulus. Although the output from backpropagation can reach the target after multiple iterations, the output for the ‘correct neuron’ diverges from the target during learning and then comes back; this is a particularly undesired effect in biological learning, where networks can be ‘tested’ at any point during the learning process, because it may lead to incorrect decisions affecting chances for survival. By contrast, prospective configuration substantially reduces this effect. Although backpropagation modifies weights to directly reduce cost in the space of weights (that is, performs gradient descent), surprisingly, and rather subversively, it does not push the resulting output activity directly toward the target. To illustrate this, Fig. 3a visualizes the cost with contour lines. Changing the activity of output neurons according to the gradient of the cost would correspond to a change orthogonal to the contour lines, that is, that indicated by the red arrow. However, backpropagation changes the output in a different direction shown by a dashed arrow. Optimizing the weights independently, without considering the effect of updating other weights, leads to output activity not updating toward the target directly due to different weight updates to different layers interfering with each other. By contrast, prospective configuration considers the results of updating other weights by finding a desired configuration of neural activity first. Such a mechanism is missing in backpropagation but is natural in energy-based networks. Supplementary Fig. 2 shows a direct comparison of how these two models evolve in weight and output spaces during learning. Interference can be quantified by the angle between the direction of the target (from current output to target) and learning (from current output to output after learning, both measured without the target provided), and we define ‘target alignment’ as the cosine of this angle (Fig. 3b); hence, high interference corresponds to low target alignment (Fig. 3c). It is useful to highlight that target alignment is affected little by the learning rate (Fig. 3d), demonstrating that the learning rate has little effect on the direction and trajectory that output neurons take. The difference in target alignment demonstrated in Fig. 3a is also present for deeper and larger (randomly generated) networks (Fig. 3e). When a network has no hidden layers, the target alignment is equal to 1 (Supplementary Notes, Section 2.4.1). The target alignment drops for backpropagation as the network gets deeper because changes in weights in one layer interfere with changes in other layers (Fig. 1), and the backpropagated errors do not lead to appropriate modification of weights in hidden layers (Supplementary Fig. 2). Because backpropagation modifies the weights in the direction reducing loss, it has positive target alignment for small learning rates but not necessarily close to 1. By contrast, prospective configuration maintains a much higher value along the way. This higher target alignment of prospective configuration can be theoretically explained by the following: (1) there exists a close link between prospective configuration and an algorithm called target propagation26 (shown in Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Notes, Section 2.2), and (2) under certain conditions, target propagation26 has a target alignment of 1 (ref. 27; demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Notes, Section 2.4.2). Thus, the link with target propagation provides theoretical insight (with numerical verification) into why prospective configuration has a higher target alignment. Higher target alignment directly translates to the efficiency of learning. Test error during training in a visual classification task with a deep neural network of 15 layers decreases faster for prospective configuration than for backpropagation (Fig. 3f). Throughout the data presented here, if learning rate is not presented in a plot, the plot corresponds to the best learning rate optimized independently for each rule under the setup via a grid search. The optimization target is either learning performance or similarity to experimental data (details can be found in the methods for each experiment). Thus, for example, Fig. 3f shows the test errors as training progress, with the learning rates optimized independently for each learning rule. The optimization target is the ‘mean of test error’ during training, reflecting how fast the test error decreases during training. Fig. 3g plots this mean of test error for different learning rates for both learning rules, and the learning rates giving the minima of the curves were used in Fig. 3f. Fig. 3h repeats the experiment on networks of other depths and shows the mean of the test error during training as a function of network depth. The mean error is higher for lower depths, as these networks are unable to learn the task, and for greater depths, as it takes longer to train deeper networks. Importantly, the gap between backpropagation and prospective configuration widens for deeper networks, paralleling the difference in target alignment. Efficient training with deeper networks is important for biological neural systems known to be deep, for example, the primate visual cortex28. In Section 2.3 of the Supplementary Notes, we develop a formal theory of prospective configuration and provide further illustrations and analyses of its advantages. Supplementary Fig. 5 formally defines prospective configuration and demonstrates that it is indeed commonly observed in different energy-based networks. Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7 empirically verify and generalize the advantages expected from the theory and show that prospective configuration yields more accurate error allocation and less erratic weight modification, respectively. Advantages of prospective configuration: effective learning in biologically relevant scenarios Inspired by these advantages, we show empirically that prospective configuration indeed handles various learning problems that biological systems would face better than backpropagation. Because the field of machine learning has developed effective benchmarks for testing learning performance, we use variants of classic machine learning problems that share key features with learning in natural environments. Such problems include online learning, where weights must be updated after each experience (rather than a batch of training examples)29, continual learning with multiple tasks30, learning in changing environments31, learning with a limited amount of training examples and reinforcement learning4. In all aforementioned learning problems, prospective configuration demonstrates a notable superiority over backpropagation. First, based on the example in Fig. 1, we expect prospective configuration to require fewer episodes for learning than backpropagation. Before presenting the comparison, we describe how backpropagation is used to train ANNs. Typically, the weights are only modified after a batch of training examples based on the average of updates derived from individual examples (Fig. 4a). In fact, backpropagation relies heavily on averaging over multiple experiences to reach human-level performance32, as it needs to stabilize training33. By contrast, biological systems must update the weights after each experience, and we compare learning performance in such a setting. Sampling efficiency can be quantified by mean of test error during training, which is shown in Fig. 4b as a function of batch size (number of experiences that the updates are averaged over). Efficiency strongly depends on batch size for backpropagation because it requires batch training to average out erratic weight updates, whereas this dependence is weaker for prospective configuration, where weight changes are intrinsically less erratic and batch averaging is required less (Supplementary Fig. 7). Importantly, prospective configuration learns faster with smaller batch sizes, as in biological settings. Additionally, final performance can be quantified by the minimum of the test error, which is shown in Fig. 4c, when trained with a batch size equal to 1. Here, prospective configuration also demonstrates a notable advantage over backpropagation. Fig. 4: Prospective configuration achieves a superior performance over backpropagation in various learning situations faced by biological systems. a–k, Learning situations include online learning29 (a–c), continual learning of multiple tasks30 (d–e), learning in changing environments31 (f–g), learning with a limited amount of training examples (h) and reinforcement learning4 (k). Graphs corresponding to each situation are grouped together with the same background color. Simulations of each situation differ from the ‘default setup’ described in the Methods in a single aspect unique to this task. For example, the default setup involves training with minibatches, so the batch size was only set to 1 in a–c for investigating online learning, whereas it was set to a larger default value in rest of the groups. In supervised learning setups, fully connected networks (a–h) were evaluated on the FashionMNIST60 dataset, and convolutional neural networks35 (i and j) were evaluated on the CIFAR-10 (ref. 36) dataset. In the reinforcement learning setup (k), fully connected networks were evaluated on three classic control problems. If the learning rate was not presented, each point (a setup of an experiment) in the plot corresponds to the best learning rate optimized independently for each rule under that setup. a, Difference in training setup between computers that can average weight modifications for individual examples to get a ‘statistically good’ value and biological systems that must apply one modification before computing another. b, Mean of the test errors during training as a function of batch size. c, Minimum of test error during training as a function of learning rate. d, Test error during continual learning of two tasks. e, Mean of test error of both tasks during training as a function of learning rate. f, Test error during training when learning with concept drifting. g, Mean of test error during training with concept drifting as a function of learning rate. h, Minimum of test error during training with different amounts of training examples (data points per class). i, Minimum of test error during training of a convolutional neural network trained with prospective configuration and backpropagation on the CIFAR-10 (ref. 36) dataset. j, Structure detail of the convolutional neural network used in i. k, Sum of rewards per episode during training on three classic reinforcement learning tasks (insets). An episode is a period from initialization of environment to reaching a terminate state. Each experiment in a–h was repeated with n = 10 random seeds. Each experiment in i–k was repeated with n = 3 random seeds because these experiments are more expensive. Error bars and bands represent the 68% confidence interval. Source data Full size image Second, biological organisms need to sequentially learn multiple tasks, while ANNs show catastrophic forgetting. When trained on a new task, performance on previously learned tasks is largely destroyed16,34. The data in Fig. 4d show performance when trained on two tasks alternately (task 1 is classifying five randomly selected classes in the FashionMNIST dataset, and task 2 is classifying the remaining five classes). Prospective configuration outperforms backpropagation both in terms of avoiding forgetting previous tasks and relearning current tasks. The results are summarized in Fig. 4e. Third, biological systems often need to rapidly adapt to changing environments. A common way to simulate this is ‘concept drifting’31, where a part of the mapping between the output neurons to the semantic meaning is shuffled regularly, each time a certain number of training iterations has passed (Fig. 4f). Test error during training with concept drifting is presented in Fig. 4f. Before epoch 0, both learning rules are initialized with the same pretrained model (trained with backpropagation); thus, epoch 0 is the first time the model experiences concept drift. The results are summarized in Fig. 4g and show that, for this task, there is a particularly large difference in mean error (for optimal learning rates). This large advantage of prospective configuration is related to it being able to optimally detect which weights to modify (Supplementary Fig. 6) and to preserve existing knowledge while adapting to changes (Fig. 1). This ability to maintain important information while updating other information is critical for survival in natural environments that are bound to change, and prospective configuration has a very substantial advantage in this respect. Furthermore, biological learning is also characterized by limited data availability. Prospective configuration outperforms backpropagation when the model is trained with fewer examples (Fig. 4h). To demonstrate that the advantage of prospective configuration also scales up to larger networks and problems, we evaluated convolutional neural networks35 on CIFAR-10 (ref. 36) trained with both learning rules (Fig. 4i), where prospective configuration showed notable advantages over backpropagation. The detailed structure of the convolutional networks is provided in Fig. 4j. Another key challenge for biological systems is to decide which actions to take. Reinforcement learning theories (for example, Q learning) propose that it is solved by learning the expected reward resulting from different actions in different situations37. Such prediction of rewards can be made by neural networks4, which can be trained with prospective configuration or backpropagation. The sum of rewards per episode during training on three classic reinforcement learning tasks is reported in Fig. 4k, where prospective configuration demonstrates a notable advantage over backpropagation. This large advantage may arise because reinforcement learning is particularly sensitive to erratic changes in network weights (as the target output depends on reward predicted by the network itself for a new state; Methods). Based on the superior learning performance of prospective configuration, we may expect that this learning mechanism has been favored by evolution; thus, in the next sections, we investigate if it can account for neural activity and behavior during learning better than backpropagation. Evidence for prospective configuration: inferring the latent state during learning Prospective configuration is related to theories proposing that before learning, the brain first infers a latent state of the environment from feedback38,39,40. Here, we propose that this inference can be achieved in neural circuits through prospective configuration, where, following feedback, neurons in ‘hidden layers’ converge to a prospective pattern of activity that encodes this latent state. We demonstrate that data from various previous studies, which involved the inference of a latent state, can be explained by prospective configuration. These data were previously explained by complex and abstract mechanisms, such as Bayesian models38,39, whereas here, we mechanistically show with prospective configuration how such inference can be performed by minimal networks encoding only the essential elements of the tasks. The dynamical inference of a latent state from feedback has been recently proposed to take place during sensorimotor learning39. In this experiment, participants received different motor perturbations in different contexts and learned to compensate for these perturbations. Behavioral data suggest that, after receiving feedback, participants first used the feedback to infer context and then adapted the force for the inferred context. We demonstrate that prospective configuration is able to reproduce these behavioral data, whereas backpropagation cannot. Specifically, in the task (Fig. 5a), participants were asked to move a stick from a starting point to a target point while experiencing perturbations. The participants experienced a sequence of blocks of trials (Fig. 5c–e), including training, washout and testing. During the training session, different directions of perturbations, positive (+) or negative (–), were applied in different contexts, blue (B) or red (R) backgrounds, respectively. We denote these trials as B+ and R–. These trials may be associated with latent states, which we denote [B] and [R]; for example, the latent state [B] may be associated with both background B and perturbation +. The next stage of the task was designed to investigate if the latent state [B] can be activated by perturbation + even if no background B is shown. Thus, participants experienced different trials including R+ (that is, perturbation + but no background B). Specifically, after a washout session (during which no perturbation was provided), in the testing session, participants experienced one of the four possible test trials: B+, R+, B– and R–. To evaluate learning on the test trials, motor adaptation (that is, the difference between the final and target stick positions) was measured before and after the test trial in two trials with the blue background (Fig. 5e). Change in the adaptation between these two trials is a reflection of learning about blue context that occurred at the test trial. If participants only associated feedback with the background color (B), then the change in adaptation would only occur with test trials B+ and B–. However, experimental data (Fig. 5f) show that there was also substantial adaptation change with R+ trials (which was even bigger than with B– trials). Fig. 5: Prospective configuration explains contextual inference in human sensorimotor learning. a, Structure of an experimental trial where participants were asked to move a stick from the starting point to the target point while experiencing perturbations. b, The minimal network for the task, including six connections encoding the associations from the backgrounds (B and R) to the belief of contexts ([B] and [R]) and from the belief of contexts to the prediction of perturbations (+ and –). c–e, Sequence of sessions the participants experienced, including training (c), washout (d) and testing (e). Darker gray boxes show the expected network after the session, where thickness represents the strength of connections. In the testing session, the darker box explains how the two learning rules learn differently on the R+ trial, leading to the differences in f. f, Predictions of the two learning rules compared to behavioral data measured from human participants, where prospective configuration reproduces the key patterns of data, but backpropagation does not. Each experiment was repeated with n = 24 random seeds, as there were 24 participants in the behavioral experiment. Source data Full size image To model learning in this task, we considered a neural network (Fig. 5b) where input nodes encode the background color, and outputs encode movement compensations in the two directions. Importantly, this network also includes hidden neurons encoding belief of being in the contexts associated with the two backgrounds ([B] and [R]). Trained with the exact procedure of the experiment39 from randomly initialized weights, prospective configuration with this minimal network can reproduce the behavioral data, whereas backpropagation cannot (Fig. 5f). Prospective configuration can produce change in adaptation with the R+ test trial because after + feedback, it is able to also activate context [B] that was associated with this feedback during training and then learn compensation for this latent state. To shed light on how this inference takes place in the model, schematics in Fig. 5c,d show evolution of the weights of the network over sessions (thickness represents the strength of connections). The schematic in Fig. 5e shows the difference between the two learning rules after exposure to R+; although B is not perceived, prospective configuration infers a moderate excitation of the belief of blue context [B] because the positive connection from [B] to + was built during the training session. The activity of [B] enables the learning of weights from [B] to + and –, while backpropagation does not modify any weights originating from [B]. For simplicity of explanation, we presented simulations with minimal networks; however, Supplementary Fig. 8 shows that networks with a general fully connected structure and more hidden neurons can replicate the above data when using prospective configuration but not when using backpropagation. Studies of animal conditioning have also observed that feedback in learning tasks involving multiple stimuli may trigger learning about non-presented stimuli41,42. One example is provided in Supplementary Fig. 9, where we show that it can be explained by prospective configuration but not by backpropagation. Evidence for prospective configuration: discovering task structure during learning Prospective configuration is also able to discover the underlying task structure in reinforcement learning. Specifically, we consider a task where reward probabilities of different options were not independent38. In this study, humans were choosing between two options where the reward probabilities were constrained such that one option had a higher reward probability than the other (Fig. 6a). Occasionally the reward probabilities were swapped, so if one probability was increased, the other was decreased by the same amount. Remarkably, the recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data suggested that participants learned that the values of the two options were negatively correlated and on each trial updated the value estimates of both options in opposite ways. This conclusion was drawn from analysis of the signal from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which encoded the expected value of reward. The data presented in Fig. 6c compare this signal after making a choice on two consecutive trials: a trial in which the reward was not received (‘punish trial’) and the next trial. If the participant selected the same option on both trials (‘stay’), the signal decreased, indicating that the reward expected by the participant was reduced. Remarkably, if the participant selected the other option on the next trial (‘switch’), the signal increased, suggesting that negative feedback for one option increased the value estimate for the other. Such learning is not predicted by standard reinforcement learning models38. Fig. 6: Prospective configuration can discover the underlying task structure during reinforcement learning. a, Reinforcement learning task. Human participants were required to choose between two options, leading to either reward (gaining coins) or punishment (losing coins) with different probabilities. The probability of reward was occasionally reversed between the two options. b, The minimal network encoding the essential elements of the task. c, Activity of the output neuron corresponding to the selected option from networks trained with prospective configuration and backpropagation compared with fMRI data measured in human participants (that is, peak blood oxygenation level-dependent (%BOLD) signal in the mPFC). Prospective configuration reproduces the key finding that the expected value (encoded in %BOLD signal in the mPFC) increases if the next choice after a punishing trial is to switch to the other option. The number of trials is not mentioned in the original paper, so we simulated for n = 128 trials for both learning rules. Error bars represent the 68% confidence interval. Source data Full size image This task can be conceptualized as having a latent state encoding which option is superior, and this latent state determines the reward probabilities for both options. Consequently, we consider a neural network reflecting this structure (Fig. 6b) that includes an input neuron encoding being in the task (equal to 1 in simulations), a hidden neuron encoding the latent state and two output neurons encoding the reward probabilities for the two options. Trained with the exact procedure of the experiment38 from randomly initialized weights, prospective configuration with this minimal network can reproduce the data, whereas backpropagation cannot (Fig. 6c). In Supplementary Fig. 10, we show that prospective configuration reproduces these data because it can infer the rewarded choice by updating the activity of the hidden neuron based on feedback. Taken together, the presented simulations illustrate that prospective configuration is a common principle that can explain a range of surprising learning effects in diverse tasks. Discussion Our paper identifies the principle of prospective configuration, according to which learning relies on neurons first optimizing their pattern of activity to match the correct output and then reinforcing these prospective activities through synaptic plasticity. Although it was known that in energy-based networks the activity of neurons shifts before weight update, it has been previously thought that this shift is a necessary cost of error propagation in biological networks, and several methods have been proposed to suppress it11,12,14,20,21 to approximate backpropagation more closely. By contrast, we demonstrate that this reconfiguration of neural activity is the key to achieving learning performance superior to that of backpropagation and to explaining experimental data from diverse learning tasks. Prospective configuration further offers a range of experimental predictions distinct from those of backpropagation (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12). Together, we have demonstrated that prospective configuration enables more efficient learning than backpropagation by reducing interference, demonstrates superior performance in situations faced by biological organisms, requires only local computation and plasticity and matches experimental data across a wide range of tasks. Our theory addresses a long-standing question of how the brain solves the plasticity-stability dilemma, for example, how it is possible that, despite adjustment of representation in the primary visual cortex during learning43, we can still understand the meaning of visual stimuli we learned over our lifetime. According to prospective configuration, when some weights are modified, compensatory changes are made to other weights to ensure the stability of correctly predicted outputs. Thus, prospective configuration reduces interference between different weight modifications while learning a single association. Previous computational models have proposed mechanisms that reduce interference between new and previously acquired information while learning multiple associations34,44. It is highly likely that such mechanisms and prospective configuration operate in the brain in parallel to minimize both types of interference. Prospective configuration is related to inference and learning procedures in statistical modeling. If the ‘energy’ in energy-based schemes is variational free energy, prospective configuration can be seen as an implementation of variational Bayes that subsumes inference and learning45. For example, dynamic expectation maximization46,47 can be regarded as a generalization of predictive coding networks in which the D-step optimizes representations of latent states (analogously to relaxation until convergence during inference) while the E-step optimizes model parameters (analogously to weight modification during learning). Other recent work48,49 also noticed that the natural form of energy-based networks (‘strong control’ in their words) performs different learning than backpropagation. Their analysis concentrates on an architecture of deep feedback control, and they demonstrated that a particular form of their model is equivalent to predictive coding networks49. The unique contribution of our paper is to show the benefits of such strong control and explain why they arise. The principle of prospective configuration is also present in other recent models. For example, Gilra and Gerstner50 developed a spiking model in which feedback about the error on the output directly affects the activity of hidden neurons before plasticity takes place. Haider et al.51 developed a faster inference algorithm for energy-based models that computes a value to which the activity is likely to converge, termed latent equilibrium51. Iteratively setting each neuron’s output based on its latent equilibrium leads to much faster inference51 and enables efficient computation of the prospective configuration. Predictive coding networks require symmetric forward and backward weights between layers of neurons, so a question arises concerning how such symmetry may develop in the brain. If predictive coding networks are initialized with symmetric weights (as in our simulations), the symmetry will persist because the changes in weight between neurons A and B are the same as those for feedback weight (between neurons B and A). Even if the weights are not initialized symmetrically, the symmetry may develop if synaptic decay is included in the model52 because then the initial asymmetric values decay away, and weight values become more influenced by recent changes that are symmetric. Nevertheless, weight symmetry is not generally required for effective credit assignment53,54. Here, we assumed for simplicity that the convergence of neural activity to an equilibrium happens rapidly after the stimuli are provided so that the synaptic weight modification after convergence may take place while the stimuli are still present. Nevertheless, predictive coding networks can still work even if weight modification takes place while the neural activity is converging. Specifically, Song et al. demonstrated that if neural activities are only updated for the first few steps, the update of the weights is equivalent to that in backpropagation14. As a reminder, we demonstrate here that if the neural activities are updated to equilibrium, the update of the weights follows the principle of prospective configuration and possesses the desirable demonstrated properties. Thus, a learning rule where neural activities and weights are updated in parallel will experience a weight update that is equivalent to backpropagation at the start and then move to prospective configuration as the system converges to equilibrium55. Furthermore, predictive coding networks have been extended to describe recurrent structures56,57,58, and it has been shown that such networks can learn to predict dynamically changing stimuli even if weights are modified before the activity converged for a given ‘frame’ of the stimulus57. The advantages of prospective configuration suggest that it may be profitably applied in machine learning to improve the efficiency and performance of deep neural networks. An obstacle for this is that the relaxation phase is computationally expensive. However, recent work demonstrated that by modifying weights after each step of relaxation, the model becomes comparably fast to backpropagation and easier for parallelization55. Most intriguingly, it has been demonstrated that the speed of energy-based networks can be greatly increased by implementing the relaxation on analog hardware59, potentially resulting in energy-based networks being faster than backpropagation. Therefore, we anticipate that our discoveries may change the blueprint of next-generation machine learning hardware, switching from the current digital tensor base to analog hardware and being closer to the brain and potentially far more efficient. Methods This section provides the necessary details for replication of the results described in the main text. Models Throughout this work, we compare the established theory of backpropagation to the proposed new principle of prospective configuration. As explained in the main text, backpropagation is used to train ANNs, where the activity of a neuron is fixed to a value based on its input, whereas prospective configuration occurs in energy-based networks, where the activity of a neuron is not fixed. Because in ANNs the activity of neurons x is determined by their input, the output of the network can be obtained by propagating the inputs ‘forward’ through the computational graph. The output can then be compared to a target pattern to get a measure of difference known as a loss. Because the value of a node (activity of a neuron) in the computational graph is explicitly computed as a function of its input, the computational graph is usually differentiable. Thus, training ANNs with backpropagation modifies the weights w to take a step toward the negative gradient of loss \\({{{\\mathcal{L}}}}\\), $${{\\Delta }}{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}=-\\alpha \\frac{\\partial {{{\\mathcal{L}}}}}{\\partial {{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}},$$ (1) during which the activities of neurons x are fixed, and α is the learning rate. The weights w requiring modification might be many steps away from the output on the computational graph, where the loss \\({{{\\mathcal{L}}}}\\) is computed; thus, \\(\\frac{\\partial {{{\\mathcal{L}}}}}{\\partial {{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}\\) is often obtained by applying the chain rule of computing a derivative through intermediate variables (activity of output and hidden neurons). For example, consider a network with four layers, and let xl denote the activity of neurons in layer l and wl denote the weights of connections between layers l and l + 1. The change in weights originating from the first layer is then computed: \\(\\frac{\\partial {{{\\mathcal{L}}}}}{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{1}}=\\frac{\\partial {{{\\mathcal{L}}}}}{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{4}}\\cdot \\frac{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{4}}{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{3}}\\ldots \\frac{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{2}}{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{1}}\\). This enables the loss to be backpropagated through the graph to provide a direction of update for all weights. In contrast to ANNs, in energy-based networks, the activity of neurons x is not fixed to the input from a previous layer. Instead, an energy function E is defined as a function of the neural activity x and weights w. For networks organized in layers (considered in this paper), the energy can be decomposed into a sum of local energy terms El, $$E=\\mathop{\\sum}\\limits_{l}{E}^{l}\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l},{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l-1},{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l-1}\\right).$$ (2) Here, El is called local energy because it is a function of xl, xl − 1 and wl − 1, which are neighbors and connected to each other. This ensures that the optimization of energy E can be implemented by local circuits because the derivative of E with respect to any neural activity (or weights) results in an equation containing only the local activity (or weights) and the activity of adjacent neurons. Predictions with energy-based networks are computed by clamping the input neurons to an input pattern and then modifying the activity of all other neurons to decrease the energy: $${{\\Delta }}{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}=-\\gamma \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial {{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}},$$ (3) where γ is the integration step of the neural dynamics. Because the terms in E can be divided into local energy terms, this results in an equation that can be implemented with local circuits. This process of modifying neural activity to decrease the energy is called relaxation, and we refer to the equation describing relaxation as neural dynamics because it describes the dynamics of the neural activity in energy-based networks. After convergence of relaxation, the activities of the output neurons are taken as the prediction made by the energy-based network. Different energy-based networks are trained in slightly different ways. For predictive coding networks12,18, training involves clamping the input and output neurons to input and target patterns, respectively. Then, relaxation is run until convergence (\\({{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}=\\mathop{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}\\limits^{* }\\)), after which the weights are updated using the activity at convergence to further decrease the energy: $${\\Delta }{\\boldsymbol{w}}=-\\alpha \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial {\\boldsymbol{w}}}{\\vert }_{{\\boldsymbol{x}} = \\mathop{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\limits^{*}}.$$ (4) This will also result in an equation that can be implemented with local plasticity because it is just a gradient descent on the local energy. We refer to such an equation as weight dynamics, because it describes the dynamics of the weights in energy-based networks. Backpropagation and prospective configuration are not restricted to specific models. Depending on the structure of the network and the choice of the energy function, one can define different models that implement the principle of backpropagation or prospective configuration. In the main text and most of the Supplementary Notes, we investigate the most standard layered network. In this case, both ANNs and energy-based networks include L layers of weights w1, w2, …, wL and L + 1 layers of neurons x1, x2, …, xL + 1, where x1 and xL + 1 are the input and output neurons, respectively. We consider the relationship between activities in adjacent layers for ANNs given by $${{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}={{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l-1}f\\,\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l-1}\\right),$$ (5) and the energy function for EBNs described by $${E}^{l}=\\frac{1}{2}{\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}-{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l-1}f\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l-1}\\right)\\right)}^{2}.$$ (6) This defines the ANNs to be the standard multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and the energy-based networks to be the predictive coding network. In Eq. (6) and below, the square operator (v)2 denotes the inner product of vector v with itself. The comparison between backpropagation and prospective configuration in the main text is thus between the above MLPs and predictive coding networks; this choice is justified as (1) they are the most standard models61 and (2) it is established that the two are closely related12,14 (that is, they make the same prediction with the same weights and input pattern), thus enabling a fair comparison. Nevertheless, we show that the theory (Supplementary Fig. 5) and empirical comparison (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7) between backpropagation and prospective configuration generalize to other choices of network structures and energy functions, that is, other energy-based networks and ANNs, such as GeneRec62 and Almeida–Pineda63,64,65. Putting Eqs. (5) and (6) into the general framework, we can obtain the equations that describe MLPs and predictive coding networks, respectively. Assume that the input and target patterns are sin and starget, respectively. Prediction with MLPs is $${{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{1}={{{{\\boldsymbol{s}}}}}^{{{{\\rm{in}}}}}\\,{{{\\rm{and}}}}\\,{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}={{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l-1}{f}\\,\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l-1}\\right){{{\\rm{for}}}}\\,l > 1,$$ (7) where xL + 1 is the prediction. Training MLPs with backpropagation is described by $${{\\Delta }}{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}=-\\alpha \\frac{\\partial {{{\\mathcal{L}}}}}{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}}=-\\alpha \\frac{\\partial {{{\\mathcal{L}}}}}{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{L+1}}\\cdot \\frac{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{L+1}}{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{L}}\\ldots \\frac{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l+1}}{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}}\\,{{{\\rm{where}}}}\\,\\,{{{\\mathcal{L}}}}=\\frac{1}{2}{\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{s}}}}}^{{{{\\rm{target}}}}}-{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{L+1}\\right)}^{2},$$ (8) which backpropagates the error \\(\\frac{\\partial {{{\\mathcal{L}}}}}{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}}\\) layer by layer from output neurons. The neural dynamics of predictive coding networks can be obtained using Eq. (2): $${{\\Delta }}{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}=-\\gamma \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}}=-\\gamma \\frac{\\partial ({E}^{l}+{E}^{l+1})}{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}}.$$ (9) Similarly, the weight dynamics of predictive coding networks can be found, $${{\\Delta }}{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}=-\\alpha \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}}=-\\alpha \\frac{\\partial {E}^{l+1}}{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}}.$$ (10) To reveal the neural implementation of predictive coding networks, we define the prediction errors to be $${{{{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon }}}}}^{l}={{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}-{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l-1}{f}\\,\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l-1}\\right).$$ (11) The neural and weight dynamics of predictive coding networks can be expressed (by evaluating derivatives in Eqs. (9) and (10)) as $${{\\Delta }}{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}=-\\gamma {{{{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon }}}}}^{l}+{f}^{{\\prime} }\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}\\right)\\circ {\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}\\right)}^{T}{{{{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon }}}}}^{l+1}\\,{\\mathrm{and}}$$ (12) $${{\\Delta }}{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}=\\alpha {{{{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon }}}}}^{l+1}{\\left({f}\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}\\right)\\right)}^{T},$$ (13) where the symbol ∘ denotes element-wise multiplication. Assuming that εl and xl are encoded in the activity of error and value neurons, respectively, Eqs. (11) and (12) can be realized with the neural implementation in Fig. 2c. In particular, error ε and value x neurons are represented by red and blue nodes, respectively; excitatory + and inhibitory − connections are represented by connections with solid and hollow nodes, respectively. Thus, Eqs. (11) and (12) are implemented with red and blue connections, respectively. It should also be noted that the weight dynamics are also realized locally. The weight change described by Eq. (13) corresponds to simple Hebbian plasticity66 in the neural implementation of Fig. 2c; that is, the change in a weight is proportional to the product of activity of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. Thus, a predictive coding network, as an energy-based network, can be implemented with local circuits only due to the local nature of energy terms (as argued earlier in this section). Note that when the network is expressive enough such that learning can reduce the energy E to 0, the loss \\({{{\\mathcal{L}}}}\\) must also become 0 as \\({{{\\mathcal{L}}}}\\) is one of the terms in energy E, that is \\({{{\\mathcal{L}}}}={E}^{L+1}\\), and, in this case, the predictive coding network is guaranteed to minimize the loss, just like backpropagation67. The full algorithm of the predictive coding network is summarized in Algorithm 1. In all simulations in this paper (unless stated otherwise), the integration step of the neural dynamics (that is, relaxation) is set to γ = 0.1, and the relaxation is performed for 128 steps (\\({{{\\mathcal{T}}}}\\) in Algorithm 1). During relaxation, if the overall energy is not decreased from the last step, the integration step is reduced by 50%; if the integration step is reduced two times (that is, reaching 0.025), relaxation is terminated early. By monitoring the number of relaxation steps performed, we notice that in most of the tasks we performed, relaxation is terminated early at around 60 iterations. Algorithm 1 Learn with a predictive coding network12,18 In the Supplementary Information, we also investigate other choices of network structures and energy functions, resulting in other ANNs and energy-based networks. Overall, the energy-based networks investigated include predictive coding networks12,18, target predictive coding networks and GeneRec62, and the ANNs investigated include backpropagation and Almeida–Pineda63,64,65. Details of all the models can be found in corresponding previous work and are also given in the Supplementary Notes, Section 2.1. Interference and measuring interference (that is, target alignment) In Fig. 3a, because it simulates the example in Fig. 1, the network has one input neuron, one hidden neuron and two output neurons; weights were all initialized to 1, the input pattern was \\(\\left[1\\right]\\), and the target pattern was \\(\\left[0,1\\right]\\). Learning rates of both learning rules were 0.2, and the weights were updated for 24 iterations. Fig. 3d repeated the same experiment as in Fig. 3a but with the learning rate searched from \\(\\left(0.005,0.01,0.05,0.1\\right)\\), which is wide enough to cover essentially all learning rates used to train deep neural networks in practice. In Fig. 3e, there were 64 neurons in each layer (including input and output layers) for each network; weights were initialized via standard Xavier uniform initialization68. No activation function was used, that is, linear networks were investigated. Depths of networks (L) took values from \\(\\left\\{1,2,\\ldots ,24,25\\right\\}\\), as reported on the x axis. Input and target patterns were a pair of randomly generated patterns with a mean of 0 and standard deviation (s.d.) of 1. Learning rates of both learning rules were 0.001. Weights were updated for one iteration, and target alignment was measured. The whole experiment was repeated 27 times with each individual experiment reported as a point. Simulations in Fig. 3f–h followed the experimental setup in Fig. 4a–h; these are described at the end of Biologically relevant tasks. Biologically relevant tasks In supervised learning simulations, fully connected networks in Fig. 4a–h were trained and tested on FashionMNIST60, and convolutional neural networks35 (Fig. 4i,j) were trained and tested on CIFAR-10 (ref. 36). With FashionMNIST, models were trained to perform classification of gray-scaled fashion item images into ten categories, such as trousers, pullovers and dresses. FashionMNIST was chosen because it is of moderate and appropriate difficulty for multilayer non-linear deep neural networks so that the comparisons with energy-based networks are informative. Classification of the data in CIFAR-10 is more difficult, as it contains colored natural images belonging to categories such as cars, birds and cats and is thus only evaluated with convolutional neural networks. Both datasets consist of 60,000 training examples (that is, training set) and 10,000 test examples (that is, test set). The experiments in Fig. 4a–h followed the configurations described below, except for the parameters investigated in specific panels (such as batch size, size of the dataset and size of the architecture), which were adjusted as stated in the descriptions of the specific experiments. The neural network was composed of four layers and 32 hidden neurons in each hidden layer. Note that the state-of-the-art MLP models of FashionMNIST are all quite large69. However, they are highly overparameterized and thus are not suitable to base our comparison on because the accuracy reaches more than 95% regardless of the learning rule due to the overparameterization. Thus, there was no space for demonstrating any meaningful comparison in these state-of-the-art overparameterized models. Overall, the size of the model on FashionMNIST demonstrated in this paper was a reasonable choice, with baseline models reaching reasonable performance (~0.12 test error for the standard machine learning setup) while maintaining enough room for demonstrating performance differences for different learning rules. The size of the input layer was 28 × 28 for FashionMNIST60 gray scaled, and the size of the output layer was ten as the number of classes for both datasets. The weights were initialized from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and s.d. of \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{{n}^{l}+{n}^{l+1}}}\\), where nl and nl + 1 are the numbers of neurons in the layer before and after the weight, respectively. This initialization is known as Xavier normal initialization68. The activation function \\({f}\\,\\left(\\right)\\) is sigmoid. We defined one iteration as updating the weights for one step based on a minibatch. Each iteration contained (1) a numerical integration procedure of relaxation of energy-based networks, which captures its continuous process; and (2) one update of weights at the end of the above procedure. The number of examples in a minibatch, called the batch size, was by default 32. One epoch comprised presenting the entire training set split over multiple minibatches. At the end of each epoch, the model was tested on the test set, and the classification error was recorded as the ‘test error’ of the epoch. The neural network was trained for 64 epochs, thus yielding 64 test errors. The mean of the test error over epochs, that is, during training progress, is an indicator of how fast the model learns, and the minimum of the test errors over epochs is an indicator of how well the model can learn, ignoring the possibility of overfitting due to training for too long. Learning rates were optimized independently for each configuration and each model. Each experiment was repeated ten times (unless stated otherwise), and the error bars represent the 68% confidence interval computed using bootstrap. We now describe settings specific to individual experiments. In Fig. 4b, different batch sizes were tested (as shown on the x axis). In Fig. 4c, the batch size was set to 1. In continual learning of Fig. 4d, training alternated between two tasks. Task 1 involved classifying five randomly selected classes in a dataset, and task 2 involved classifying the remaining five classes. The whole network was shared by the two tasks; thus, different from the network used in other panels, the network only had five output neurons. This better corresponds to continual learning with multiple tasks in nature, because, for example, if humans learn to perform two different tasks, they typically use one brain and one pair of hands (that is, the whole network is shared), as they do not have two different pairs of hands (that is, humans share the output layers across tasks). Task 1 was trained for four iterations, task 2 was trained for four iterations, and the training continued until a total of 84 iterations was reached. After each iteration, error on the test set of each task was measured as ‘test error’. In Fig. 4e, the mean of test error of both tasks during training of Fig. 4d at different learning rates is reported. In Fig. 4d–g investigating concept drifting31,70,71, changes to class labels were made every 64 epochs, and the models were trained for 3,000 epochs in total. Thus, every 64 epochs, five of ten output neurons were selected, and the mapping from these five output neurons to the semantic meaning was pseudorandomly shuffled. In Fig. 4h, different numbers of data points per class (shown on the x axis) were included in the training set (subsets were randomly selected according to different seeds). In Fig. 4i, we trained a convolutional network with prospective configuration and backpropagation, with the structure detailed in Fig. 4j. For each learning rule, we independently searched seven learning rates ranging from \\(\\left\\{0.0005,0.00025,0.0001,0.000075,0.00005,0.000025,0.00001\\right\\}\\). Both learning rules were trained for 80 epochs, with a batch size of 200. Because training deep convolutional networks is more difficult and slower than training shallow fully connected networks, a few improvements were applied to both learning rules. Specifically, a weight decay of 0.01 and an Adam optimizer72 were applied for both learning rules. To reduce running time, the weights were updated more frequently in predictive coding networks; that is, the weights were updated at all steps of inference instead of at the last step of inference. Inference was run for a fixed number of 16 iterations; thus, weights were updated 16 times for each batch of data. Thus, for fair comparison, backpropagation also updated weights 16 times on each batch of data. Training in each configuration (each learning rule and each learning rate) was repeated three times with different seeds. To extend a predictive coding network to a convolutional neural network (or to any network with a layered structure58,73), we can define the forward function of a layer (that is, how the input of layer l + 1 is computed from the neural activity of layer l) with weights wl to be \\({{{{\\mathcal{F}}}}}_{{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}}\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}\\right)\\). For example, for the MLPs described above, \\({{{{\\mathcal{F}}}}}_{{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}}\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}\\right)={{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}{f}\\,\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}\\right)\\). For a convolutional network, \\({{{{\\mathcal{F}}}}}_{{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}}\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}\\right)\\) is a more complex function of wl and xl, and also wl and xl are not simple matrix and vector anymore (to be defined later). Defining an ANN with \\({\\mathcal{F}}()\\) would be (that is, Eq. (5) becomes) \\({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}={{{{\\mathcal{F}}}}}_{{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l-1}}\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l-1}\\right)\\). Defining an energy function of a predictive coding network with \\({\\mathcal{F}}()\\) would be (that is, Eq. (6) becomes) \\({E}^{l}=\\frac{1}{2}{\\left[{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}-{{{{\\mathcal{F}}}}}_{{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l-1}}\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l-1}\\right)\\right]}^{2}\\). Thus, neural and weight dynamics would be (that is, Eqs. (12) and (13) become) \\({{\\Delta }}{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}=-\\gamma {{{{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon }}}}}^{l}+\\frac{\\partial {{{{\\mathcal{F}}}}}_{{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}}\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}\\right)}{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}}{{{{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon }}}}}^{l+1}\\) and \\({{\\Delta }}{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}=\\alpha {{{{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon }}}}}^{l+1}\\frac{\\partial {{{{\\mathcal{F}}}}}_{{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}}\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}\\right)}{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}},\\) respectively. As \\({{{{\\mathcal{F}}}}}_{{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}}\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}\\right)\\) is defined, \\(\\frac{\\partial {{{{\\mathcal{F}}}}}_{{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}}\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}\\right)}{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial {{{{\\mathcal{F}}}}}_{{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}}\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}\\right)}{\\partial {{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}}\\) are obtained via auto differentiation in PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/autogradqs_tutorial.html). Thus, training a convolutional predictive coding network is as simple as replacing lines 11 and 16 in Algorithm 1 with the above corresponding equations. In the following, we define \\({{{{\\mathcal{F}}}}}_{{{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}}\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}\\right)\\) for convolutional networks. First, \\({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{{c}_{l}\\times {h}_{l}\\times {w}_{l}}\\), where cl, hl and wl are the number of features, height and width of the feature map, respectively. The numbers for each layer are presented in Fig. 4j in the format cl@hl × wl. For example, for the first layer (input layer), the shape was 3@32 × 32 as it is 32 × 32 colored images, that is, with three feature maps representing red, green and blue. We denote kernel size, stride and padding of this layer as kl, sl and pl, respectively. The numbers for each layer are presented in Fig. 4j. Thus, \\({{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{{c}_{l+1}\\times {c}_{l}\\times {k}_{l}\\times {k}_{l}}\\). Finally, xl + 1 is obtained via $$\\begin{array}{l}{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{\\;l+1}[c,x,y]={f}\\,\\left({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{\\;l}\\left[:,x{s}_{l}-{p}_{l}:x{s}_{l}-{p}_{l}+{k}_{l},y{s}_{l}-{p}_{l}:y{s}_{l}-{p}_{l}+{k}_{l}\\right]\\right)\\\\\\cdot {{{{\\boldsymbol{w}}}}}^{l}\\left[c,:,:,:\\right],\\end{array}$$ (14) where \\(\\left[a,b,\\ldots \\right]\\) means indexing the tensor along each dimension, : means all indexes at that dimension, a: b means slice of that dimension from index a to b − 1, and ⋅ is dot product. In the above equation, if the slicing of xl on the second and third dimensions, that is, \\({{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}^{l}\\left[:,x{s}_{l}-{p}_{l}:x{s}_{l}-{p}_{l}+{k}_{l},y{s}_{l}-{p}_{l}:y{s}_{l}-{p}_{l}+{k}_{l}\\right]\\), is outside its defined range \\({{\\mathbb{R}}}^{{c}_{l}\\times {h}_{l}\\times {w}_{l}}\\), the entries outside range are considered to be 0, known as padding mode of zeros. In Fig. 3f, networks of 15 layers were trained and tested on the FashionMNIST60 dataset. Learning rates in Fig. 3f were optimized independently by a grid search over (5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001, 0.0005, 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.00001, 0.000005) for each learning rule, as shown Fig. 3g; that is, each learning rule in Fig. 3f used the learning rate that gave a minimal point in the corresponding curve in Fig. 3g. The experiment in Fig. 3h investigated other network depths (\\(\\left\\{1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,15\\right\\}\\)) in the same setup. Similar to Fig. 3f, the learning rate for each learning rule and each ‘number of layers’ was the optimal value (in terms of mean of test error as the y axis of the figure) independently searched from (5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001, 0.0005, 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.00001, 0.000005). Hidden layers were always of size 64 in the above experiments. In the above experiment, only a part of the training set was used (60 data points per class) so that the test error was evaluated more frequently to reflect the difference on efficiency of the investigated learning rules. The activation function \\({f}\\,\\left(\\right)\\) used is LeakyReLU instead of the standard sigmoid because sigmoid results in difficulty in training deep neural networks. Other unmentioned details followed the defaults, as described above. In the reinforcement learning experiments (Fig. 4k), we evaluated performance on three classic reinforcement learning problems: Acrobot74,75, MountainCar76 and CartPole77. We interacted with these environments via a unified interface by OpenAI Gym78. The observations st of these environments are vectors describing the status of the system, such as velocities and positions of different moving parts (for details, refer to the original articles or documentation from OpenAI Gym). Each entry of the observation st is normalized to mean 0 and s.d. 1 via Welford’s online algorithm79,80. The action space of these environments is discrete. Thus, we can have a network taking in observation st and predicting the value (Q) of each action at with different output neurons. Such a network is known as an action-value network, in short, a Q network. In our experiment, the Q network contained two hidden layers, each of which contained 64 neurons, initialized the same way as the network used for supervised learning, described before. One can acquire the value of an action at at a given observation st by feeding st into the Q network and reading out the prediction on the output neuron corresponding to the action at; such a value is denoted \\(Q\\left({s}_{t},{a}_{t}\\right)\\). The training of Q is a simple regression problem to target \\({\\hat{R}}_{t}\\), obtained via Q learning with experience replay (summarized in Algorithm 2). Considering st to be sin and \\({\\hat{R}}_{t}\\) to be starget, the Q network can be trained with prospective configuration or backpropagation. Note that \\({\\hat{R}}_{t}\\) is the target of the selected action at (that is, the target of one of the output neurons corresponds to the selected action at); thus, \\({\\hat{R}}_{t}\\) is, in practice, considered to be \\({{{{\\boldsymbol{s}}}}}^{{{{\\rm{target}}}}}\\left[{a}_{t}\\right]\\). For prospective configuration, it means that the rest of the output neurons except the one corresponding to at are freed; for backpropagation, it means that the error on these neurons is masked out. A predictive coding network with slightly different settings from the defaults was used for prospective configuration. The integration step was fixed to be half of the default (γ = 0.05), and relaxation was performed for a fixed and smaller number of steps (\\({{{\\mathcal{T}}}}=32\\)). This change was introduced because Q learning is more unstable (smaller integration step) and more expensive (smaller number of relaxation steps) than supervised learning tasks. To produce a smoother curve of ‘sum of rewards per episode’ in Fig. 4k from SumRewardPerEpisode in Algorithm 2, the SumRewardPerEpisode curve was averaged along TrainingEpisode with a sliding window with a length of 200. Each experiment was repeated with three random seeds, and the shadows represent 68% confidence interval across them. Learning rates were searched independently for each environment and each model from the range \\(\\left\\{0.05,0.01,0.005,0.001,0.0005,0.0001\\right\\}\\). The results reported in Fig. 4k are for the learning rates yielding the highest mean of ‘sum of rewards per episode’ over training episodes. Algorithm 2 Q learning with experience replay Simulation of motor learning As shown in Fig. 5, we trained a network that included two input neurons, two hidden neurons and two output neurons. The two input neurons were one-to-one connected to the two hidden neurons, and the two hidden neurons were fully connected to the two output neurons. The two input neurons were considered to encode presenting the blue and red background, respectively. The two output neurons were considered to encode the prediction of the perturbations toward positive and negative directions, respectively. Presenting and not presenting a background color were encoded 1 and 0, respectively; presenting and not presenting perturbations of a particular direction were encoded 1 and 0, respectively. The weights were initialized from a normal distribution with mean 0 and an s.d. fitted to the behavioral data (see below), simulating that the participants had not built any associations before the experiments. Learning rates were independent for the two layers, as we expected the connections from perception to belief and from belief to predictions to have different degrees of plasticity. The two learning rates were also fitted to the data (see below). The number of participants and training and testing trials follow exactly as described for the human experiment38. In particular, for each of the 24 simulated participants, the weights were initialized with a different seed of the random number generator. They each experienced two stages: training and testing. Note that the pretraining stage performed in the human experiment was not simulated here as its goal was to make human participants familiar with the setup and devices. In the training stage, the model experienced 24 blocks of trials. In each block, the model was presented with the following sequence of trials, matching the original experiment38: The model was trained with two trials without perturbation, B0 and R0, with the order counterbalanced across consecutive blocks. Note that, in the human experiment, there were two trial types without perturbations (channel and washout trials), but they were simulated in the same way here as B0 or R0 trials because they both did not include any perturbations. The model was trained with 32 trials with perturbations, where there were equal numbers of B+ and R– within each of the 8 trials in a pseudorandom order. The model experienced two trials, B0 and R0, with the order counterbalanced across consecutive blocks. The model experienced n ← {14, 16, 18} washout trials (equal numbers of B0 and R0 trials in a pseudorandom order), where n ← {a, b, c} denotes sampling without replacement from a set of values a, b and c and replenishing the set whenever it becomes empty. The model experienced one triplet, where the exposure trial was either B+ or R–, counterbalanced across consecutive blocks. Here, a triplet consisted of three sequential trials: B0, the specified exposure trial and B0 again. The model experienced additional n ← {6, 8, 10} washout trials (equal numbers of B0 and R0 trials in a pseudorandom order). The model experienced one triplet again, where the exposure trial was either B+ or R–, whichever was not used on the previous triplet. In the testing stage, the model then experienced eight repetitions of four blocks of trials. In each block, one of the combinations of B+, R+, B– and R– was tested. The order of the four blocks was shuffled in each of the eight repetitions. In each block, the model first experienced n ← {2, 4, 6} washout trials (equal numbers of B0 and R0 trials in a pseudorandom order). The model then experienced a triplet of trials, where the exposure trial was the combination (B+, R+, B– or R–) tested in a given block to assess single-trial learning of this combination. The change in adaption in the model was computed as the absolute value of the difference in the predictions of perturbations on the two B0 trials in the above triplet, where the prediction of perturbation was computed as the difference between the activities of the two output neurons. The predictions were averaged over participants and the above repetitions. The parameters of each learning rule were chosen such that the model best reproduced the change in adaptation shown in Fig 5f. In particular, we minimized the sum over set C of the four exposure trial types of the squared difference between average change in adaptation in experiment (dc) and model (xc): $$\\mathop{\\sum}\\limits_{c\\in C}{\\left(a{x}_{c}-{d}_{c}\\right)}^{2}.$$ (15) The model predictions were additionally scaled by a coefficient a fitted to the data because the behavioral data and model outputs had different scales. An exhaustive search was performed over model parameters. The s.d. of initial weights could take values from \\(\\left\\{0.01,0.05,0.1\\right\\}\\), and two learning rates for two layers could take values from \\(\\left\\{0.00005,0.0001,0.0005,0.01,0.05\\right\\}\\). For each learning rule and each combination of the above model parameters, the coefficient a was then resolved analytically (restricted to be positive) to minimize the sum of the squared errors of Eq. (15). Simulation of human reinforcement learning As shown in Fig. 6b, we trained a network that included one input neuron, one hidden neuron and two output neurons. The input neuron was considered to encode being in the task, so it was set to 1 throughout the simulation. The two output neurons encoded the prediction of the value of the two choices. Reward and punishment were encoded as 1 and −1, respectively, because the participants were either winning or losing money. The model selected actions stochastically based on the predicted value of the two choices (encoded in the activity of two output neurons) according to the softmax rule (with a temperature of 1). The weights were initialized from a normal distribution of mean 0 and an s.d. fitted to experimental data (see below), simulating that the human participants had not built any associations before the experiments. The number of simulated participants (number of repetitions with different seeds) was set to 16, as in the human experiment38. The number of trials was not mentioned in the original paper, so we simulated for 128 trials for both learning rules. To compare the ability of the two learning rules to account for the pattern of signal from the mPFC, for each of the rules, we optimized the parameters describing how the model is set up and learns (the s.d. of initial weights and the learning rate). Namely, we searched for the values of these parameters for which the model produces the most similar pattern of its output activity to that in the experiment. In particular, we minimized the sum over set C of four trial types in Fig. 6c of the squared difference between model predictions xc and data dc on mean mPFC signal: $$\\mathop{\\sum}\\limits_{c\\in C}{\\left(a{x}_{c}+b-{d}_{c}\\right)}^{2}.$$ (16) The model predictions were additionally scaled by a coefficient a and offset by a bias b because the fMRI signal had different units and baseline than the model. To compute the model prediction for a given trial type, the activity of the output neuron corresponding to the chosen option was averaged across all trials of this type in the entire simulation. The scaled average activity from the model is plotted in Fig. 6c, where the error bars show the 68% confidence interval of the scaled activity. To fit the model to experimental data, the values of model parameters and the coefficient were found as described in the previous section. In particular, we used exhaustive grid search on the parameters. The models were simulated for all possible combinations of s.d. of initial weights and the learning rate from the following set: \\(\\left\\{0.01,0.05,0.1\\right\\}\\). For each learning rule and each combination of the above model parameters, the coefficient a (restricted to be positive) and the bias b were then resolved analytically to minimize the sum of the squared error of Eq. (16). Statistics and reproducibility The work in this paper involved computer simulations, but due to random initialization of weight parameters, the simulations were repeated multiple times. No statistical method was used to predetermine the number of repetitions, but for simulations corresponding to behavioral or neurophysiological experiments, the number of repetitions was matched to the number of participants in the given experiment. No data were excluded from the analyses. Because the order of execution has no effect on the results of the numeric experiments, they were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to outcome assessment. To visualize the variability of simulation results, we either presented individual data points or error bars showing confidence intervals or box plots. Confidence intervals were computed using bootstrap throughout the paper, and detailed descriptions of the implementation can be found at https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/error_bars.html#confidence-interval-error-bars. The details of the methods used to produce the box plots are available at https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.boxplot.html.

[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13276#Sec20 reply roenxi 15 hours agorootparentprevI'd be willing to be proven wrong, but as a starting point I'd suggest it obviously isn't optimal for what it is being used for. The performance on tasks of AI seems to be quite poor relative to the time spent training. For example, when AIs overtake humans at Baduk it is normal for the AI to have played several orders of magnitude more games than elite human players. The important thing is backprop does work and so we're just scaling it up to absurd levels to get good results. There is going to be a big step change found sooner or later where training gets a lot better. Maybe there is some sort of threshold we're looking for where a trick only works for models with lots of parameters or something before we stumble on it, but if evolution can do it so will researchers. reply mrfox321 19 hours agorootparentprevSecond order methods, and their approximations, can be used in weight updating, too. reply ergonaught 18 hours agoparentprev> The HN title makes it sound like differences between the brain and ANNs were previously unknown and is misleading IMO There are no words in the title which express this.

Making the 'fundimental difference' the focus seems like laying the foundation to a claim that AI lacks some ability because of the difference. The difference does mean you cannot infer abilities present in one by detecting them in the other. This is the similar to, and as about as profound as, saying that you cannot say that rocks can move fast because of their lack of legs. Which is true, but says nothing about the ability of rocks to move fast by other means. reply robwwilliams 18 hours agoprevNot my area of expertise, but this paper may be important for the reason that it is more closely aligned with the “enactive” paradigm of understand brain-body-behavior and learning than a backpropogation-only paradigm. (I like enactive models of perception such as those advocated by Alva Noe, Humberto Maturana, Francisco Valera, and others. They get us well beyond the straightjacket of Cartesian dualism.) Rather than have error signals tweak synaptic weights after a behavior, a cognitive system generates a set of actions it predicts will accommodate needs. This can apparently be accomplished without requiring short term synaptic plasticity. Then if all is good, weights are modified in a secondary phase that is more about asserting utility of the “test” response. More selection than descent. The emphasis is more on feedforward modulation and selection. Clearly there must be error signal feedback so some if you may argue that the distinction will be blurry at some levels. Agreed. Look forward to reading more carefully to see how far off-base I am. reply pharrington 20 hours agoprevTheories that brains predict the pattern of expected neural activity aren't new, (eg this paper cites work towards the Free Energy Principle, but not Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding works).

By contrast, in backpropagation, the order is reversed; weight modification takes the lead, and the change in neural activity is the result that follows.

Even using terms like neurons and synapses. Artificial neural networks originated as simplified models of how the brain actually works. So they really do \"work like the brain\" in the sense of taking inspiration from certain rudiments of its workings. The problem is \"like\" can mean anything from \"almost the same as\" to \"in a vaguely resembling or reminiscent way\".

They work like how people assumed the brain actually works. We still don't understand how the brain works. You're too early to even make this claim reply nickpsecurity 18 hours agorootparentprevBrain-inspired, neuromorphic architectures are usually very different from neural networks in machine learning. They’re so different (and better) that people who know both keep trying to reproduce brain-like architecture to gain its benefits. One of my favorite features is how they use local, likely Hebbian, learning instead of global with backpropagation. (I won’t rule out some global mechanism, though.) The local learning makes their training much more efficient. Even if a global mechanism exists (eg during sleep?), brain architectures could run through more training data faster and cheaper. Expensive step just tidies it up in shorter periods of time. They are also more analog, parallel, sparse, and flexible. They have feedback loops (IIRC). Multiple tiers of memory integrated with their internal representation with hallucination mitigation. They also have many specialized components that automatically coordinate to do the work without being externally trained to. All in around 100 watts. Brains are both different from and vastly superior to ANN’s. Similarities do exist, though. They both have cells, connections, and change connections based on incoming data. Quite abstract. Past that, I’m not sure what other similarities they have. Some non-brain-inspired ANN’s have memory in some form but I don’t know if it’s as effective and integrated as the brain’s yet. reply jmchambers 11 hours agorootparentTotally agree! The \"fire together, wire together\" approach to training weights is super easy to parallelize, and you can design custom silicon to make it ridiculously efficient. Back when I was a Computational Neuroscience (CN) researcher, I worked with a team in Manchester that was exploring exactly that—not sure if they ever nailed it... Funny enough, I actually worked with Rafal Bogacz, the last-named author of the paper we’re discussing, during his Basal Ganglia (BG) phase. He’s an incredibly sharp guy and made a pretty compelling argument that the BG implement the multihypothesis sequential probability ratio test (MSPRT) to decide between competing action plans in an optimal way. Back then, there was another popular theory that the BG used an actor-critic learning model—also quite convincing. But here’s the rub: in CN, the trend is to take algorithms from computer science and statistics and map them onto biology. What’s far rarer is extracting new ML algorithms from the biology itself. I got into CN because I thought the only way we’d ever crack AGI was by unlocking the secrets of the best example we’ve got—the mammalian brain. Unfortunately, I ended up frustrated with the biology-led approach. In ten years in the field, I didn’t see anything that really felt like progress toward AGI. CN just moves so much slower than mainstream ML! Still, I hope Rafal’s onto something with this latest idea. Fingers crossed it gives ML researchers a shiny new algorithm to play with. reply anon291 21 hours agoparentprev> Even using terms like neurons and synapses. With those claims getting widespread, people also start building theories on top of them that make AI’s more like humans. Except the networks studied here for prospective configuration are ... neural networks. No changes to the architecture have been proposed, only a new learning algorithm. If anything, this article lends credence to the idea that ANNs do -- at some level -- simulate the same kind of thing that goes on in the brain. That is to say that the article posits that some set of weights would replicate the brain pretty closely. The issue is how to find those weights. Backprop is one of many known -- and used -- algorithms . It is liked because the mechanism is well understood (function minimization using calculus). There have been many other ways suggested to train ANNs (genetic algorithms, annealing, etc). This one suggests an energy based approach, which is also not novel. reply nickpsecurity 14 hours agorootparent\"Except the networks studied here for prospective configuration are ... neural networks. No changes to the architecture have been proposed, only a new learning algorithm.\" In scientific investigations, it's best to look at one component, or feature, at a time. It's also common to put the feature in an existing architecture to assess the difference that feature makes in isolation. Many papers trying to imitate brain architecture only use one feature in the study. I've seen them try stateful neurons, spiking, sparsity, Hebbian learning, hippocampus-like memory, etc. Others will study combinations of such things. So, the field looks at brain-inspired changes to common ML, specific components that closely follow brain design (software or hardware), and whole architectures imitating brain principles with artificial deviations. And everything in between. :) reply anon291 11 hours agorootparentI'm not sure what you're trying to say here. Hebbian learning is the basis for current ANNs. Spiking neural nets again an adaptation of neural nets.

No way that's crazy /s tl;dr: paper proposes a principle called 'prospective configuration' to explain how the brain does credit assignment and learns, as opposed to backprop. Backprop can lead to 'catastrophic interference' where learning new things abalates old associations, which doesn't match observed biological processes. From what I can tell, prosp. config learns by solving what the activations should have been to explain the error, and then updates the weights in accordance, which apparently somehow avoids abalating old associations. They then show how prosp. config explains observed biological processes. Cool stuff, wish I could find the code.

Only the training mechanism changes. As for a direct addressing of the claim... if the article is on point, then 'learning' has a much more encompassing physical manifestation than was previously thought.
