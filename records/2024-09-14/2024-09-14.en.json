Read it now. Your Email addressSign Up The Scoop Software engineers at the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike complained about rushed deadlines, excessive workloads, and increasing technical problems to higher-ups for more than a year before a catastrophic failure of its software paralyzed airlines and knocked banking and other services offline for hours. “Speed was the most important thing,” said Jeff Gardner, a senior user experience designer at CrowdStrike who said he was laid off in January 2023 after two years at the company. “Quality control was not really part of our process or our conversation.” The issues were raised during meetings, in emails, and in exit interviews, ex-employees told Semafor. Almost two dozen former software engineers, managers and other staff described a workplace where executives prioritized speed over quality, workers weren’t always sufficiently trained, and mistakes around coding and other tasks were rising. One former senior manager said they sat in multiple meetings where staff warned company leaders that CrowdStrike would “fail” its customers by releasing products that couldn’t be supported. AD Of the 24 former employees who spoke to Semafor, 10 said they were laid off or fired and 14 said they left on their own. One was at the company as recently as this summer. Three former employees disagreed with the accounts of the others. Joey Victorino, who spent a year at the company before leaving in 2023, said CrowdStrike was “meticulous about everything it was doing.” CrowdStrike disputed much of Semafor’s reporting and said the information came from “disgruntled former employees, some of whom were terminated for clear violations of company policy.” The company told Semafor: “CrowdStrike is committed to ensuring the resiliency of our products through rigorous testing and quality control, and categorically rejects any claim to the contrary.” Founded in 2011, CrowdStrike quickly rose as an industry leader in cybersecurity with the 2013 launch of its Falcon antivirus package. It went public in 2019, kicking off a massive growth spurt, adding thousands of workers and increasing revenue by more than a thousand percent by the end of fiscal year 2024. AD A bad software update by CrowdStrike in July caused what may be the biggest IT outage in history, shutting down 8.5 million computers and costing Fortune 500 companies as much as $5.4 billion in damages. It stranded travelers at airports, locked customers out of online banking accounts, and took emergency call centers offline. The incident cost CrowdStrike about $60 million in deals it had expected to close during the fiscal quarter that ended July 31, Chief Financial Officer Burt Podbere told analysts on its Aug. 28 earnings call, when the company lowered its revenue and profit guidance for the rest of the year. Adam Meyers, senior vice president of counter adversary operations, will testify in front of Congress later this month. “The magnitude of the July 19th incident will never be lost on me, and my commitment is to make sure this never happens again,” CEO George Kurtz told analysts on the call. “Beyond apologies, I want our actions to speak even louder than our words. We work to recover customers quickly no matter the location or need.” The former employees Semafor spoke to described a range of issues that long preceded the outage at the company. There’s been no determination that those problems were related to the July incident. AD Know More Some former employees said quality checks on software were rushed at times to get products launched quickly. “It was hard to get people to do sufficient testing sometimes,” said Preston Sego, who worked at CrowdStrike from 2019 to 2023. His job was to review the tests completed by user experience developers that alerted engineers to bugs before proposed coding changes were released to customers. Sego said he was fired in February 2023 as an “insider threat” after he criticized the company’s return-to-work policy on an internal Slack channel. That’s the company’s designation for employees who present security risks. CrowdStrike declined to comment, saying it does not “discuss individual personnel matters.” There were other issues. In one incident in the professional services department, one former employee described how a customer’s private information was accidentally uploaded to the wrong client’s folder three times, narrowly escaping sharing private client data with the wrong customer each time. CrowdStrike confirmed the incidents and said they occurred because of a “manual data entry error.” It said the data was “basic information like host names, IP addresses, and domain names,” and “checks are now run” to ensure private customer data isn’t sent to the wrong client. Multiple people also cited issues with CrowdStrike’s Falcon LogScale service, which uncovers security and reliability issues in a customer’s systems. One recalled at least two instances where bad updates to LogScale briefly turned off its real-time alerts that notify customers of potentially malicious activity, which some of the engineers who built the updates blamed in internal meetings on tight deadlines. CrowdStrike denied the instances, saying it is not aware of any “‘bad update’ where alerts were lost and not received by customers.” The company also said the service isn’t designed to alert customers to potential data breaches in “real time.” It, instead, is designed to “rapidly shut down threats with real-time detection and blazing-fast search,” according to the company website. A separate ex-employee said CrowdStrike rushed the 2022 launch of its cloud threat hunting service, called Falcon OverWatch Cloud Threat Hunting, where the company’s security professionals look for suspicious behavior that could indicate a breach on customers’ cloud setups, like Amazon Web Services. Engineers and threat hunters were given just two months for work that would normally take a year, according to a former senior manager who worked on the project. When the service launched, he said it lacked the internal tools that threat hunters used to fully monitor customers’ cloud systems for threats; employees ended up responding to alerts from existing security systems until at least last summer, about a full year after it was launched. The former senior manager said CrowdStrike also used staff who had been trained to monitor customers’ computer systems — like laptops and desktops — and tasked them with looking for threats in cloud setups without mandating new training. “AWS is a beast, and it takes a very special staff to be able to do that,” he said. CrowdStrike “took people who were like cops, looking for threats on the ground all day, and asked them to fly an airplane and look for threats in the sky.” CrowdStrike confirmed that it used existing engineers instead of hiring a new team of “cloud threat hunters.” As a new service, it said, “there were no experienced ‘cloud threat hunters’ to be had, and it would not have been possible to hire individuals with specific training in a field that did not exist until CrowdStrike developed it.” The SANS Institute has been teaching courses and giving talks on cloud security since at least 2020, more than two years before the launch of CrowdStrike’s service. “Any statement implying CrowdStrike employees were not trained to do their jobs is false,” CrowdStrike told Semafor. While the company confirmed that it didn’t mandate new training, it provided it for anyone who wanted it, the company said. “Employees routinely attend training appropriate to their position.” “This service has worked as intended at all times,” CrowdStrike said. “Even before this novel service offering was launched the Falcon Overwatch team hunted on all public cloud environments and released research into this area.” CrowdStrike also denied that its systems lacked the tools threat hunters needed and that it rushed the project. The company said the OverWatch product line has been around for more than a decade “and is routinely enhanced to meet the evolving threats and needs of our customers.” Sego said temporary coding meant to keep projects moving — a common practice at tech companies — was often never improved. One former senior engineer said he asked unsuccessfully to be given time to fix old coding more than 20 times. CrowdStrike said “coding is an iterative process, and it is commonplace in the software industry to release and continuously improve upon code based on real-world experience with the product.” Ex-employees cited increased workloads as one reason they didn’t improve upon old code. Several said they were given more work following staff reductions and reorganizations; CrowdStrike declined to comment on layoffs and said the company has “consistently grown its headcount year over year.” It added that R&D expenses increased from $371.3 million to $768.5 million from fiscal years 2022 to 2024, “the majority of which is attributable to increased headcount.” CrowdStrike said it “receives, evaluates, and incorporates a range of feedback from its team,” and that it “focuses on always maintaining a high-performance culture.” The company also noted that it “has been recognized as one of the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For for the last four years.” For the July outage, CrowdStrike has blamed a defect in an update to its Falcon Sensor. The episode has cost the company more than $21 billion in stock-market value and brought on a slew of lawsuits, including one potential suit by Delta Airlines, which pegged its losses at $550 million after thousands of flights were canceled. At a hacker convention in August, CrowdStrike President Michael Sentonas accepted an award on stage for “Most Epic Fail.” He said it’s “super-important to own it when you do things horribly wrong.”",

    "commentBody": "CrowdStrike ex-employees: 'Quality control was not part of our process' (semafor.com)513 points by everybodyknows 22 hours agohidepastfavorite262 comments hitekker 3 hours agoI was surprised by how dismissive these comments are. Former staff members, engineers included, are claiming that their former company's unsafe development culture contributed to a colossal world-wide outage & other previous outages. These employee's allegations ought to be seen as credible, or at least as informative. Instead, many seem to be attacking the UX designer commenting on 'Quality control was not part of our process'. My guess is that people are identifying with sentence said just before: \"Speed [of shipping] is everything.\" Aka \"Move fast and break things.\" The culture described by this article must mirror many of our lived experiences. The pure pleasure of shipping code, putting out fires, making an impact (positive or negative)... and then leaving it to the next engineers & managers to sort out, ignoring the mess until it explodes. Even when it does, no one gets blamed for the outage and soon everyone goes back to building features that get them promoted, regardless of quality. Through that ZIRP light, these process failures must look like a feature, not a bug. The emphasis on \"quality\" must also look like annoying roadblocks in the way of having fun on the customer's dime. reply wesselbindt 3 hours agoparentThere's folks out there who enjoy putting out proverbial fires? I find rework like that quite frustrating reply hitekker 3 hours agorootparentAbsolutely. Some people are born firefighters. Nothing wrong with that. I once worked with a senior engineer who loved running incidents. He felt it was real engineering. He loved debugging thorny problems on a strict timeline, getting every engineer in a room and ordering them about, while also communicating widely to the company. Then, there's the rush of the all-clear and the kudos from stakeholders. Specific to his situation, I think he enjoyed the inflated ownership that the sudden urgency demanded. The system we owned was largely taken for granted by the org; a dead-end for a career. Calling incidents was a good way to get visibility at low-cost, i.e., no one would follow-up on our postmortem action items. It eventually became a problem, though, when the system we owned was essentially put into maintenance mode, aka zero development velocity. Then I estimate (balancing for other variables) the rate the senior engineer called an incident for not-incidents went up by 3x... reply oooyay 1 hour agorootparentThat's called hero culture and there's definitely something wrong with it. reply jamesmotherway 34 minutes agorootparentprevSome people rise to the occasion during crises and find it rewarding. There's a lot of pop science around COMT (the \"warrior gene\" associated with stress resilience), which I take with a grain of salt. There does seem to be something there, though, and it overlaps with my personal experience that many great security operations people tend to have ADHD traits. reply MichaelZuo 3 hours agorootparentprevWell there are a handful of expert consultants who do, since they charge an eye watering price per hour for putting out fires. reply Alupis 22 hours agoprev> “Speed was the most important thing,” said Jeff Gardner, a senior user experience designer at CrowdStrike who said he was laid off in January 2023 after two years at the company. “Quality control was not really part of our process or our conversation.” This type of article - built upon disgruntled former employees - is worth about as much as the apology GrubHub gift card. Look, I think just as poorly about CrowdStrike as anyone else out there... but you can find someone to say anything, especially when they have an axe to grind and a chance at some spotlight. Not to mention this guy was a designer and wouldn't be involved in QC anyway. > Of the 24 former employees who spoke to Semafor, 10 said they were laid off or fired and 14 said they left on their own. One was at the company as recently as this summer. Three former employees disagreed with the accounts of the others. Joey Victorino, who spent a year at the company before leaving in 2023, said CrowdStrike was “meticulous about everything it was doing.” So basically we have nothing. reply nyc_data_geek1 21 hours agoparent>>So basically we have nothing. Except the biggest IT outage ever. And a postmortem showing their validation checks were insufficient. And a rollout process that did not stage at all, just rawdogged straight to global prod. And no lab where the new code was actually installed and run prior to global rawdogging. I'd say there's smoke, and numerous accounts of fire, which this can be taken in the context of. reply sundvor 20 hours agorootparent\"Everyone\" piles on Tesla all the time; a worthwhile comparison would be how Tesla roll out vehicle updates. Sometimes people are up in arms \"where's my next version\" (eg when adaptive headlights was introduced), yet Tesla prioritise a safe, slow roll out. Sometimes the updates fail (and get resolved individually), but never on a global scale. (None experienced myself, as a TM3 owner on the \"advanced\" update preference). I understand the premise of Crowdstrike's model is to have up to date protection everywhere but clearly they didn't think this through enough times, if at all. reply kccqzy 20 hours agorootparentYou can also say the same thing about Google. Just go look at the release notes on the App Store for the Google Home app. There was a period of more than six months where every single release said \"over the next few weeks we're rolling out the totally redesigned Google Home app: new easier to navigate 5-tab layout.\" When I read the same release notes so often I begin to question whether this redesign is really taking more than six months to roll out. And then I read the Sonos app disaster and I thought that was the other extreme. reply cesarb 9 hours agorootparent> Just go look at the release notes on the App Store for the Google Home app. [...] When I read the same release notes so often I begin to question whether this redesign is really taking more than six months to roll out. Google is terrible at release notes. Since several years ago, the release notes for the \"Google\" app on the Android app store always shows the exact same four unchanging entries, loosely translating from Portuguese: \"enhanced search page appearance\", \"new doodles designed for app experience\", \"offline voice actions (play music, enable Wi-Fi, enable flashlight) - available only in the USA\", \"web pages opened directly within the app\". I heavily doubt it's taking these many years to roll out these changes; they probably simply don't care anymore, and never update these app store release notes. reply quietbritishjim 21 hours agorootparentprevThe sentence you quoted clearly meant, from the context, \"clearly we have nothing [to learn from the opinions of these former employees]\". Nothing in your comment is really anything to do with that. reply tomrod 20 hours agorootparentTriangulation versus new signal. reply mewpmewp2 21 hours agorootparentprevThere definitely was a huge outage, but based on the given information we still can't know for sure how much they invested in testing and quality control. There's always a chance of failure even for the most meticulous companies. Now I'm not defending or excusing the company, but a singular event like this can happen to anyone and nothing is 100%. If thorough investigation revealed poor quality control investment compared to what would be appropriate for a company like this, then we can say for sure. reply daedrdev 21 hours agorootparentTwo things are clear though Nobody ran this update The update was pushed globally to all computers With that alone we know they have failed the simplest of quality control methods for a piece of software as widespread as theirs. This is even excluding that there should have been some kind of error handling to allow the computer to boot if they did push bad code. reply hn_throwaway_99 19 hours agorootparentWhile I agree with this, from a software engineering perspective I think it's more useful to look at the lessons learned. I think it's too easy to just throw \"Crowdstrike is a bunch of idiots\" against the wall, and I don't think that's true. It's clear to me that CrowdStrike saw this as a data update vs. a code update, and that they had much more stringent QA procedures for code updates that they did data updates. It's very easy for organizations to lull themselves into this false sense of security when they make these kinds of delineations (sometimes even subconsciously at first), and then over time they lose site of the fact that a bad data update can be just as catastrophic as a bad code update. I've seen shades of this issue elsewhere many times. So all that said, I think your point is valid. I know Crowdstrike had the posture that they wanted to get vulnerability files deployed globally as fast as possible upon a new threat detection in order to protect their clients, but it wouldn't have been that hard to build in some simple checks in their build process (first deploy to a test bed, then deploy globally) even if they felt a slower staged rollout would have left too many of their clients unprotected for too long. Hindsight is always 20/20, but I think the most important lesson is that this code vs data dichotomy can be dangerous if the implications are not fully understood. reply GuB-42 6 hours agorootparentIt could have been ok to expedite data updates, should the code treat configuration data as untrusted input, as if it could be written by an attacker. It means fuzz testing and all that. Obviously the system wasn't very robust, as a simple, within specs change could break it. A company like CrowdStrike, which routinely deals with memory exploits and claims to do \"zero trust\" should know better. As often, there is a good chance it is an organization problem. The team in charge of the parsing expected that the team in charge of the data did their tests and made sure the files weren't broken, while on the other side, they expected the parser to be robust and at worst, a quick rollback could fix the problem. This may indeed be the sign of a broken company culture, which would give some credit to the ex-employees. reply Izkata 10 minutes agorootparent> Obviously the system wasn't very robust, as a simple, within specs change could break it. From my limited understanding, the file was corrupted in some way. Lots of NULL bytes, something like that. reply GuB-42 1 minute agorootparentFrom the report, it seems the problem is that they added a feature that could use 21 arguments, but there was only enough space for 20. Until now, no configuration used all 21 (the last one was a wildcard regex, which apparently didn't count), but when they finally did, it caused a buffer overflow and crashed. abraae 18 hours agorootparentprev> It's clear to me that CrowdStrike saw this as a data update vs. a code update, and that they had much more stringent QA procedures for code updates that they did data updates. It cannot have been a surprise to Crowdstrike that pushing bad data had the potential to bork the target computer. So if they had such an attitude that would indicate striking incompetence. So perhaps you are right. reply RaftPeople 3 hours agorootparentprev> It's clear to me that CrowdStrike saw this as a data update vs. a code update > Hindsight is always 20/20, but I think the most important lesson is that this code vs data dichotomy can be dangerous if the implications are not fully understood. But it's not some new condition that the industry hasn't already been dealing with for many many decades (i.e. code vs config vs data vs any other type of change to system, etc.). There are known strategies to reduce the risk. reply mavhc 8 hours agorootparentprevIf they weren't idiots they wouldn't be parsing data in the kernel level module reply Comma2976 13 hours agorootparentprevCrowdstrike is a bunch of idiots reply llm_trw 18 hours agorootparentprevI'm sorry but there comes a point where you have to call a spade a spade. When you have the trifecta of regex, *argv packing and uninitialized memory you're reaching levels of incompetence which require being actively malicious and not just stupid. reply busterarm 21 hours agorootparentprevAlso it's the _second_ time that they had done this in a few short months. They had previous bricked linux hosts earlier with a similar type of update. So we also know that they don't learn from their mistakes. reply rblatz 20 hours agorootparentThe blame for the Linux situation isn’t as clear cut as you make it out to be. Red hat rolled out a breaking change to BPF which was likely a regression. That wasn’t caused directly by a crowdstrike update. reply IcyWindows 19 hours agorootparentAt least one of the incidents involved Debian machines, so I don't understand how Red Hat's change would be related. reply rblatz 19 hours agorootparentSorry, that’s correct it was Debian, but Debian did apply a RHEL specific patch to their kernel. That’s the relationship to red hat. reply busterarm 17 hours agorootparentprevIt's not about the blame, it's about how you respond to incidents and what mitigation steps you take. Even if they aren't directly responsible, they clearly didn't take proper mitigation steps when they encountered the problem. reply roblabla 7 hours agorootparentHow do you mitigate the OS breaking an API below you in an update? Test the updates before they come out? Even if you could, you'd still need to deploy a fix before the OS update hits the customers, and anyone that didn't update would still be affected. The linux case is just _very_ different from the windows case. The mitigation steps that could have been taken to avoid the linux problem would not have helped for the windows outage anyways, the problems are just too different. The linux update was about an OS update breaking their program, while the windows issue was about a configuration change they made triggering crashes in their driver. reply busterarm 5 hours agorootparentYou're missing the forest for the trees. It's: a) an update, b) pushed out globally without proper testing, c) that bricked the OS. It's an obvious failure mode that if you have a proper incident response process would be revealed from that specific incident and flagged for needing mitigation. I do this specific thing for a living. You don't just address the exact failure that happened but try to identify classes of risk in your platform. > Even if you could, you'd still need to deploy a fix before the OS update hits the customers, and anyone that didn't update would still be affected. And yet the problem would still only affect Crowdstrike's paying customers. No matter how much you blame upstream your paying customers are only ever going to blame their vendor because the vendor had discretion to test and not release the update. As their customers should. reply ScottBurson 19 hours agorootparentprev> there should have been some kind of error handling This is the point I would emphasize. A kernel module that parses configuration files must defend itself against a failed parse. reply idkwhatimdoin 20 hours agorootparentprev> If thorough investigation revealed poor quality control investment compared to what would be appropriate for a company like this, then we can say for sure. We don't really need that thorough of an investigation. They had no staged deploys when servicing millions of machines. That alone is enough to say they're not running the company correctly. reply dartos 20 hours agorootparentTotally agree. I’d consider staggering a rollout to be the absolute basics of due diligence. Especially when you’re building a critical part of millions of customer machines. reply mewpmewp2 20 hours agorootparentI would say that canary release is an absolute must 100%. Except I can think of cases where it might still not be enough. So, I just don't feel comfortable judging them out of the box. Does all the evidence seem to point against them? For sure. But I just don't feel comfortable giving that final verdict without knowing for sure. Specifically because this is about fighting against malicious actors, where time can be of essence to deploy some sort of protection against a novel threat. If there's deadlines that you can go over, and nothing bad happens, for sure. Always have canary releases, and perfect QA, monitoring everything thoroughly, but I'm just saying, there can be cases where damage that could be done if you don't act fast enough, is just so much worse. And I don't know that it wasn't the case for them. I just don't know. reply dartos 20 hours agorootparentIn this case, they pretty much caused a worst case scenario… reply canucker2016 18 hours agorootparentprevThey literally half-assed their deployment process - one part enterprisey, one part \"move fast and break things\". Guess which part took down much of the corporate world? from Preliminary Post Incident Review at https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediatio... : \"CrowdStrike delivers security content configuration updates to our sensors in two ways: Sensor Content that is shipped with our sensor directly, and Rapid Response Content that is designed to respond to the changing threat landscape at operational speed. ... The sensor release process begins with automated testing, both prior to and after merging into our code base. This includes unit testing, integration testing, performance testing and stress testing. This culminates in a staged sensor rollout process that starts with dogfooding internally at CrowdStrike, followed by early adopters. It is then made generally available to customers. Customers then have the option of selecting which parts of their fleet should install the latest sensor release (‘N’), or one version older (‘N-1’) or two versions older (‘N-2’) through Sensor Update Policies. The event of Friday, July 19, 2024 was not triggered by Sensor Content, which is only delivered with the release of an updated Falcon sensor. Customers have complete control over the deployment of the sensor — which includes Sensor Content and Template Types. ... Rapid Response Content is used to perform a variety of behavioral pattern-matching operations on the sensor using a highly optimized engine. Newly released Template Types are stress tested across many aspects, such as resource utilization, system performance impact and event volume. For each Template Type, a specific Template Instance is used to stress test the Template Type by matching against any possible value of the associated data fields to identify adverse system interactions. Template Instances are created and configured through the use of the Content Configuration System, which includes the Content Validator that performs validation checks on the content before it is published. On July 19, 2024, two additional IPC Template Instances were deployed. Due to a bug in the Content Validator, one of the two Template Instances passed validation despite containing problematic content data. Based on the testing performed before the initial deployment of the Template Type (on March 05, 2024), trust in the checks performed in the Content Validator, and previous successful IPC Template Instance deployments, these instances were deployed into production.\" reply hello_moto 14 hours agorootparent> one part enterprisey, one part \"move fast and break things\".

This is a ludicrous position, and has been proven obviously false by the proceedings: all systems that were crashed by this critical failure were not, in fact, attacked with ransomware once the CS agent was un-installed (at great pain). reply xeromal 3 hours agorootparentprevThat's a false dichotomy reply Aeolun 18 hours agorootparentprevNonsense.

It's the disgruntled employees that I think would have the most clear picture of what was going on, regardless of them being in QA/QC or not because they, at that point, don't really care any more and will be more forthright with their thoughts. I'd certainly trust their info more than a company yes-man which is probably where some of that opposing messaging came from. reply paulcole 18 hours agorootparentWhy would you trust a company no-man any more than a company yes-man? They both have agendas and biases. Is it just that you personally prefer one set of biases (anti-company) more than the other (pro-company)? reply theideaofcoffee 17 hours agorootparentYes, I am very much biased toward being anti-company and I make no apologies for that. I've been in the corporate world long enough to know first-hand the sins that PR and corporate management commits on the company's behalf and the harm it does. I find information coming from the individual more reliable than having it filtered through corpo PR, legal, ass-covering nonsense, the latter group often wanting to preserve the status quo than getting out actual info. reply paulcole 17 hours agorootparentOK just checking. Nice that you at least acknowledge your bias. reply noisy_boy 14 hours agorootparentprevBecause there is still an off-hand chance that an employee who has been let go isn't speaking out of spite and merely stating the facts - depends on a combination of their honesty and the feeling they harbor about being let go. Everyone who is let go isn't bitter and/or a liar. However, every company yes-man is paid to be a yes-man and will speak in favor of the company without exception - that literally is the job. Otherwise they will be fired and will join the ranks of the aforementioned people. So logically it makes more sense for me to believe the former more than the latter. The two-sides are not equivalent (as you may have alluded) in term of trustworthiness. reply nullvoxpopuli 6 hours agorootparentAgreed. As a data point, i'm not disgruntled (i'm quoted in this article). Mostly disappointed. reply insane_dreamer 2 hours agorootparentprevWell, in this case, we know one side (pro-company) fucked up big time. The other side (anti-company) may or may not have fucked up. That makes it easier to trust one side over another. reply wpietri 6 hours agoparentprev> So basically we have nothing. No, what we have is a publication who is claiming that the people they talked to were credible and had points that were interesting and tended to match one another and/or other evidence. You can make the claim that Semafor is bad at their jobs, or even that they're malicious. But that's a hard claim to make given that in the paragraph you've quoted they are giving you the contrary evidence that they found. And this is a process many of us have done informally. When we talk to one ex-employee of a company, well maybe it was just that guy, or just where he was in the company. But when a bunch of people have the same complaint, it's worth taking it much more seriously. reply iudqnolq 2 hours agoparentprevThere are some very specific accusations backed up by non-denials from crowdstrike. Ex-employees said bugs caused the log monitor to drop entries. Crowdstrike responded the project was never designed to alert in real time. But Crowdstrike's website currently advertises it as working in real time. Ex-employees said people trained to monitor laptops were assigned to monitor AWS accounts with no extra training. Crowdstrike replied that \"there were no experienced ‘cloud threat hunters’ to be had\" in 2022 and that optional training was available to the employees. reply _fat_santa 4 hours agoparentprev> Quality control was not really part of our process or our conversation. Is anyone really surprised or learned any new information? For us that have worked for tech companies, this is one of those repeating complaints that you hear across orgs that indicates a less than stellar engineering culture. I've worked with numerous F500 orgs and I would say 3/5 orgs that I worked in, their code was so bad that it made me wonder how they haven't had a major incident yet. reply tooltower 19 hours agoparentprevThis is like online reviews.

Are you sure the answer is simply more of the same? reply 0xbadcafebee 16 hours agorootparentI've worked in these enterprise organizations for a long time. They don't run on common sense, or even what one might consider \"business sense\". Their existing incentives create bizarre behavior. For example, you might think \"if a big security exploit happens, the stock price might tank\". So if they value the stock price, they'll focus on security, right?. In reality what they do is focus on burying the evidence of security exploits. Because if nobody finds out, the stock price won't tank. Much easier than doing the work of actually securing things. And apparently it's often legal. And when it's not a bizarre incentive, often people just ignore risks, or even low-level failures, until it's too late. Four-way intersections can pile up accidents for years until a school bus full of kids gets T-boned by a dump truck. We can't expect people to do the right thing even if they notice a problem. Something has to force the right thing. The only thing I have ever seen force an executive to do the right thing is a law that says they will be held liable if they don't. That's still not a guarantee it will actually happen correctly, course. But they will put pressure on their underlings to at least try to make it happen. On top of that, I would have standards that they are required to follow, the way building codes specify the standard tolerances, sizes, engineering diagrams, etc that need to be followed and inspected before someone is allowed into the building. This would enforce the quality control (and someone impartial to check it) that was lacking recently. This will have similar results as building codes - increased bureaucracy, cost, complexity, time... but also, more safety. I think for critical things, we really do need it. Industrial controls, like those used for water, power (nuclear...), gas, etc, need it. Tanker and container ships, trains/subways, airlines, elevators, fire suppressants, military/defense, etc. The few, but very, very important, systems.

Remember that good product is not necessarily equal or even a subset of the easy to sell product. Only once the incentives are aligned towards building quality software that lasts will we see change. reply abbadadda 12 hours agorootparentprevProbably there should be an independent body that oversees postmortems on tech issues, with the ability to suggest changes. This is what airlines face during crash investigations and often new rules are put in place (e.g., don’t let the shift manager self-certify his own work in the incident where the pilot’s window popped off). How this would look like with software companies, and what the bar is for being subject to this rigor I don’t know (I suspect not for a Candy Crush outage though). In general, the biggest problem I see with late stage capitalism, and a lack of accountability in general, is that given the right incentives people will “fuck things up” faster than you can stop them. For example, say CrowdStrike was skirting QA - what’s my incentive as an individual employee versus the incentive of an executive at the company? If the exec can’t tell the difference between good QA and bad QA, but can visually see the accounting numbers go up when QA is underfunded, he’s going to optimize for stock price. And as an IC there’s not much you can do unless you’re willing to fight the good fight day in and day out. But when management repeatedly communicates they do not reward that behavior, and indeed may not care at all about software quality over a 5 year time horizon, what do you do? The key lies in finding ways to convince executives or short of that holding them to account like you say. reply acdha 18 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not true that “common sense” is being overridden: most companies and sysadmins do need that baseline to avoid “forgetting” about things which aren’t trivial to implement (if you didn’t work in the field 10+ years ago, it was common to see systems getting patched annually or worse, people opening up SSH/Remote Desktop to the internet for convenience, shared/short passwords even for privileged accounts, vendors would require horribly insecure configuration because they didn’t want to hire anyone who knew how to do things better, etc.). There are drawbacks to compliance security but it has been useful for flushing all of that mess out. Even if it wasn’t wrong, that’s still the wrong reaction. We’re in this situation because so many companies were negligent in the past and the status quo was obviously untenable. If there is a problem with a given standard the solution is to make a better system (e.g. like Apple did) rather than to say one of the most important industries in the world can’t be improved because that’d require a small fraction of its budget. reply sitkack 17 hours agorootparentprevI sure noticed how much snark you packed into two sentences! reply tedk-42 14 hours agoparentprevLike everything, cheap, quick or good rule applies (pick 2).

The word disgruntled is a bit strange, in that it uses \"dis-\" not as a reversal prefix (such as in dissatisfied or dissimilar), but as an intensifier. The original \"gruntle\" was related to grunt, grunting, it was similar to \"grumble\", denoting the sounds an annoyed crowd might make. But this old sense of gruntle, gruntling, gruntled has not been used since the 16th century. And in the past century, people have started back-forming a new \"gruntle\" by analyzing \"dis-gruntled\" as using the more common meaning of \"dis-\". A similar use of dis- as an intensifier apparently happened in \"dismayed\" (here from an Old French verb, esmaier , which meant to trouble, to disturb), and in \"disturbed\" (from Latin a word, turba, meaning turmoil).

On the one hand I tend to agree with the \"Anti AV camp\" that a sufficiently maintained machine can do well when following best practices. Of course that includes SIEM which can also be run on-premise and doesn't necessarily have to decrypt traffic if it just consumes properly formatted logs. On the other hand there was e.g. WannaCry in 2017 where 200,000 systems across 150 countries running Windows XP and other unsupported Windows Server versions had crypto miners installed. It shows that companies world-wide had trouble properly maintaining the life cycle of their systems.

The plaintext part is not okay. reply notepad0x90 13 hours agorootparentThank you, that's a sound perspective, but it is the responsibility of the security staff who deploy EDRs like Crowdstrike to scrub any data at ingestion time into their SIEM. but within CS's platform, it makes little sense to talk about scrubbing, since CS doesn't know what you want scrubbed unless it is standardized data forms (like SSNs,credit cards,etc..). Another way to look at it is, the CS cloud environment is effectively part of your environment. the secrets can get scrubbed, but CS still has access to your devices, they can remotely access them and get those secrets at any time without your knowledge. that is the product. The security boundary of OP's mac is inclusive of the CS cloud. reply st3fan 7 hours agorootparentUnfortunately the software doesn’t allow for scrubbing or redacting to be configured. Those features simply do not exist. reply notepad0x90 13 hours agoparentprevthat's what EDRs do. anyone with access to your SIEM or CS data should also be trusted with response access (i.e.: remotely access those machines). If you want this redacted, it is a SIEM functionality not Crowdstrike's. Depends on the SIEM but even older generation SIEMs have a data scrubbing feature. This isn't a Crowdstrike design decision as you've put it. any endpoint monitoring too, including the free and open source ones behave just as you described. You won't just see env vars from macs but things like domain admin creds and PKI root signing private keys.

It’s stupidity and makes auditing worse reply cj 15 hours agorootparentSIEM = Security Information & Event Management Factually, it is necessary for auditing and absolutely correlates with the extreme of needing to monitor the “usage” of “secrets”. In a highly auditable/“secure” environment, you can’t give secrets to employees with no tracking of when the secrets are used. reply halayli 14 hours agorootparentThat's far from factual and you are making things up. You don't need to send the actual keys to a siem service to monitor the usage of those secrets. You can use a cryptographic hash and send the hash instead. And they definitely don't need to dump env values and send them all. Sending env vars of all your employees to one place doesn't improve anything. In fact, one can argue the company is now more vulnerable. It feels like a decision made by a clueless school principle, instead of a security expert. reply smolder 13 hours agorootparentprevA secure environment doesn't involve software exfiltrating secrets to a 3rd party. It shouldn't even centralize secrets in plaintext. The thing to collect and monitor is behavior: so-and-so logged into a dashboard using credentials user+passhash and spun up a server which connected to X Y and Z over ports whatever... And those monitored barriers should be integral to an architecture, such that every behavior in need of auditing is provably recorded. If you lean in the direction of keylogging all your employees, that's not only lazy but ineffective on account of the unnecessary noise collected, and it's counterproductive in that it creates a juicy central target that you can hardly trust anyone with. Good auditing is minimally useful to an adversary, IMO. reply davorak 14 hours agorootparentprev> In a highly auditable/“secure” environment, you can’t give secrets to employees with no tracking of when the secrets are used.

If you’re a PCI company then ending up with a credit card number in your SIEM can be a massive disaster. Because you’re never allowed to store that in plaintext, and your SIEM data is supposed to be immutable. In theory that puts you out of compliance for a minimum of one year with no way to fix it, in reality your QSAs will spend some time debating what to do about it and then require you to figure out some way to delete it, which might be incredibly onerous.

They certainly wouldn’t let you keep it there, but if your SIEM was absolutely full of cardholder data, I imagine they’d require you to extract ALL of it, redact the cardholder data, and the import it to a new instance, nuking the old one.

Their excuses for keeping the chain of thought hidden are dubious at best [1], and honestly just seemed anti-competitive if anything. Worst is their argument that they want to monitor it for attempts to escape the prompt, but you can't. However the weirdest is that they note that: > for this to work the model must have freedom to express its thoughts in unaltered form, so we cannot train any policy compliance or user preferences onto the chain of thought. Which makes it sound like they really don't want it to become public what the model is 'thinking'.

Like they hired a few hundred professors, journalists and writers to work with the model and create material for it, so you just get various combinations of their contributions. It's very telling that this model, for instance, is extraordinarily good at STEM related queries, but much worse (and worse even in comparison to GPT4) than English composition, probably because the former is where the money is to be made, in automating away essentially almost all engineering jobs. reply COAGULOPATH 21 hours agorootparent>but much worse (and worse even in comparison to GPT4) than English composition O1 is supposed to be a reasoning model, so I don't think judging it by its English composition abilities is quite fair.

Everyone complains about the \"ChatGPTese\" writing style, and surely they'll fix that eventually. >Like they hired a few hundred professors, journalists and writers to work with the model and create material for it, so you just get various combinations of their contributions. I'm doubtful. The most prolific (human) author is probably Charles Hamilton, who wrote 100 million words in his life. Put through the GPT tokenizer, that's 133m tokens. Compared to the text training data for a frontier LLM (trillions or tens of trillions of tokens), it's unrealistic that human experts are doing any substantial amount of bespoke writing.

Some of the bad writing does from things they can't/don't want to solve - \"harmlessness\" RLHF especially makes them all cornier.

Which would be ChatGPT chat logs, correct? It would be interesting if people started feeding ChatGPT deliberately bad repairs due it's \"lack of reasoning capabilities\" (e.g. get a local LLM setup with some response delays to simulate a human and just let it talk and talk and talk to ChatGPT), and see how it affects its behavior over the long run. reply vidarh 20 hours agorootparentThese logs get manually reviewed by humans, sometimes annotated by automated systems first. The setups for manual reviews typically involve half a dozen steps with different people reviewing, comparing reviews, revising comparisons, and overseeing the revisions (source: I've done contract work at every stage of that process, have half a dozen internal documents for a company providing this service open right now). A lot of money is being pumped into automating parts of this, but a lot of money still also flows into manually reviewing and quality-assuring the whole process.

You'd need to produce data that is more expensive to review and improve than random crap from users who are often entirely clueless, and/or that produces worse output of the training process to make using the real prompts as part of that process problematic. Trying to compete with real users on producing junk input would prove a real challenge in itself - you have no idea the kind of utter incomprehensible drivel real users ask LLMs. But part of this process also already includes writing a significant number of prompts from scratch, testing them, and then improving the response, to create training data. From what I've seen, I doubt there is much of a cost saving in using real user prompts there - the benefit you get from real user prompts is a more representative sample, but if that sample starts producing shit you'll just not use it or not use it as much, or only use e.g. prompts from subsets of users you have reason to believe are more likely to be representative of real use. Put another way: You can hire people to write prompts to replace that side of it far cheaper than you can hire people who can properly review the output of many of the more complex prompts, and the time taken to review the responses is far higher than the time to address issues with the prompts. One provider often tell people to spend up to ~1h to review responses that involve simple coding tasks, for example, but the prompt might be \"implement BTree.\" reply exe34 21 hours agorootparentprevi suspect they can detect that in a similar way to capchas and \"verify you're human by clicking the box\". reply tivert 21 hours agorootparent> i suspect they can detect that in a similar way to capchas and \"verify you're human by clicking the box\".

The model constructs abstracted representations of the domain-specific reasoning traces. Then it applies these reasoning traces in various combinations to solve unseen problems. If you want to call that sampling, then you might as well call everything sampling. reply mjburgess 21 hours agorootparentThey're generative models. By definition, they are sampling from a joint distribution of text tokens fit by approximation to an empirical distribution. reply accountnum 21 hours agorootparentAgain, you're stretching definitions into meaninglessness. The way you are using \"sampling\" and \"distribution\" here applies to any system processing any information. Yes, humans as well. I can trivially define the entirety of all nerve impulses reaching and exiting your brain as a \"distribution\" in your usage of the term. And then all possible actions and experiences are just \"sampling\" that \"distribution\" as well. But that definition is meaningless. reply mjburgess 20 hours agorootparentNo, causation isnt distribution sampling. And there's a difference between, say, an extrinsic description of a system and it's essential properties. Eg., you can describe a coin flip as a sampling from the space, {H,T} -- but insofar as we're talking about an actual coin, there's a causal mechanism -- and this description fails (eg., one can design a coin flipper to deterministically flip to heads). In the case of a transformer model, and all generative statistical models, these are actually learning distributions. The model is essentially constituted by a fit to a prior distribution. And when computing a model output, it is sampling from this fit distribution. ie., the relevant state of the graphics card which computes an output token is fully described by an equation which is a sampling from an empirical distribution (of prior text tokens). Your nervous system is a causal mechanism which is not fully described by sampling from this outcome space. There is no where in your body that stores all possible bodily states in an outcome space: this space would require more atoms in the universe to store. So this isn't the case for any causal mechanism. Reality itself comprises essential properties which interact with each other in ways that cannot be reduced to sampling. Statistical models are therefore never models of reality essentially, but basically circumstantial approximations. I'm not stretching definitions into meaninglessness, these are the ones given by AI researchers, of which I am one. reply accountnum 19 hours agorootparentI'm going to simply address what I think are your main points here. There is nowhere that an LLM stores all possible outputs. Causality can trivially be represented by sampling by including the ordering of events, which you also implicitly did for LLMs. The coin is an arbitrary distinction, you are never just modeling a coin, just as an LLM is never just modeling a word. You are also modeling an environment, and that model would capture whatever you used to influence the coin toss. You are fundamentally misunderstanding probability and randomness, and then using that misunderstanding to arbitrarily imply simplicity in the system you want to diminish, while failing to apply the same reasoning to any other. If you are indeed an AI researcher, which I highly doubt without you providing actual credentials, then you would know that you are being imprecise and using that imprecision to sneak in unfounded assumptions. reply mjburgess 11 hours agorootparentLLMs are just modelling token order. The weights are a compression of the outcome space. No, causality is not just an ordering. reply accountnum 7 hours agorootparentnext [2 more] [flagged] mjburgess 7 hours agorootparentIt's not a matter of making points, it's at least a semester's worth of courses on causal analysis, animal intelligence, the scientific method, explanation. Causality isnt ordering. Take two contrary causal mechanisms (eg., filling a bathtube with a hose, and emptying it with a bucket). The level of the bath is arbitrarily orderable with respect to either of these mechanisms. cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collider_(statistics) Go on youtube and find people growing a nervous system in a lab, and you'll notice its an extremely plastic, constantly physically adapting, and so on system. You'll note the very biochemcial \"signalling\" you're talking about itself is involved in the change to the physical structure of the system. This physical structure does not encode all prior activations of the system, nor even a compression of them. To see this consider Plato's cave. Outside the cave passes by a variety of objects which cast a shadow on the wall. The objects themselves are not compressions of these shadows. Inside the cave, you can make one of these yourself: take clay from the floor and fashion a pot. This pot, like the one outside, are not compressions of their shadows. All statistical algorithms which average over historical cases are compressions of shadows, and replay these shadows on command, ie., they learn the distribution of shadows and sample from this distribution demand. Animals, and indeed all science, is not concerned with shadows. We don't model patterns in the night sky -- this is astrology -- we model gravity: we build pots. The physical structure of our bodies encodes their physical structure and that of reality itself. They do so by sensor-motor modulation of organic processes of physical adaption. If you like: our bodies are like clay and this is fashioned by reality into the right structure. In any case, we haven't the time or space to convince you of this formally. Suffice it to say that it is a very widespread consensus that modelling conditional probabilities with generative models fails to model causality. You can read Judea Pearl on this if you want to understand more. Perhaps more simply: a video game model of a pot can generate an infinite number of shadows in an infinite number of conditions. And no statistical algorithm with finite space and finite time requirements will ever model this video game. The video game model does not store a compression of past frames -- since it has a real physical model, it can create new frames from this model. reply sandspar 19 hours agorootparentprevIt's been out for 24 hours and you make an extremely confident and dismissive claim.

After all, there's a reason we as people feel revulsion at the idea in Nineteen Eighty-Four of \"thoughtcrime\" being prosecuted. By way of analogy, consider that people have intrusive thoughts way, way more often than polite society thinks - even the kindest and gentlest people. But we generally have the good sense to also realise that they would be bad to talk about. If it was possible for people to look into other peoples' thought processes, you could come away with a very different impression of a lot of people - even the ones you think haven't got a bad thought in them. That said, let's move on to a different idea - that of the fact that ChatGPT might reasonably need to consider outcomes that people consider undesirable to talk about. As people, we need to think about many things which we wish to keep hidden. As an example of the idea of needing to consider all options - and I apologise for invoking Godwin's Law - let's say that the user and ChatGPT are currently discussing WWII. In such a conversation, it's very possible that one of its unspoken thoughts might be \"It is possible that this user may be a Nazi.\" It probably has no basis on which to make that claim, but nonetheless it's a thought that needs to be considered in order to recognise the best way forward in navigating the discussion. Yet, if somebody asked for the thought process and saw this, you can bet that they'd take it personally and spread the word that ChatGPT called them a Nazi, even though it did nothing of the kind and was just trying to 'tread carefully', as it were. Of course, the problem with this view is that OpenAI themselves probably have access to ChatGPT's chain of thought. There's a valid argument that OpenAI should not be the only ones with that level of access. reply Vegenoid 21 hours agoparentprev> Honestly with all the hubbub about superintelligence you'd almost think o1 is secretly plotting the demise of humanity but is not yet smart enough to completely hide it I think the most likely scenario is the opposite: seeing the chain of thought would both reveal its flaws and allow other companies to train on it. reply javaunsafe2019 20 hours agoparentprevIn regards of super intelligent it’s still just a language model.

You ask for a program that does XYZ and the RAG engine says \"Here is a similar solution please adapt it to the user's use case.\" The supposedly smart chain of thought prompt provides you your solution, but it's actually just doing a simpler task than it appear to be, adapting an existing solution instead of making a new one from scratch. Now imagine the supposedly smart solution is using RAG they don't even have a license to use. Either scenario would give them a good reason to try to keep it secret. reply furyofantares 21 hours agoparentprevEh. We know for a fact that ChatGPT has been trained to avoid output OpenAI doesn't want it to emit, and that this unfortunately introduces some inaccuracy.

Banning seems more aimed at preventing working around this by throwing massive volume at it to see what eventually slips through, as requiring a new payment account integration puts a \"significantly better than doing nothing\" hamper on that type of exploiting.

I wonder how they approach API model pinning though, perhaps the safety check is separated from the main parts of the model and can be layered in.

The probability for the next token is influenced based on the input. So far so good, if I now ask a question, the probability that I generate the corresponding answer increases. But is it the right one? This is exactly where CoT tries to start, in which context is generated you change the probability of the tokens for the answer and we can at least experimentally show that the answers get better. Perhaps it is easier to speak of a kind of refinement, the more context is generated, the more focused the model is on the currently important topic. reply jdiff 18 hours agorootparentprevEnglish is turing complete. reply Kim_Bruning 2 hours agorootparentI'm beginning to suspect natural languages have some additional properties. reply ericlewis 18 hours agorootparentprev [–] The theory is that you increase the context with more relevant tokens to the problem at hand, as well as its solutions, which in theory makes it more likely to predict the correct solution. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "Louwrentius Home Solar About My 71 TiB ZFS NAS After 10 Years and Zero Drive Failures Sat 14 September 2024 Category: hardware My 4U 71 TiB ZFS NAS built with twenty-four 4 TB drives is over 10 years old and still going strong. Although now on its second motherboard and power supply, the system has yet to experience a single drive failure (knock on wood). Zero drive failures in ten years, how is that possible? Let's talk about the drives first The 4 TB HGST drives have roughly 6000 hours on them after ten years. You might think something's off and you'd be right. That's only about 250 days worth of runtime. And therein lies the secret of drive longevity (I think): Turn the server off when you're not using it. According to people on Hacker News I have my bearings wrong. The chance of having zero drive failures over 10 years for 24 drives is much higher than I thought it was. So this good result may not be related to turning my NAS off and keeping it off most off the time. My NAS is turned off by default. I only turn it on (remotely) when I need to use it. I use a script to turn the IoT power bar on and once the BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) is done booting, I use IPMI to turn on the NAS itself. But I could have used Wake-on-Lan too as an alternative. Once I'm done using the server, I run a small script that turns the server off, wait a few seconds and then turn the wall socket off. It wasn't enough for me to just turn off the server, but leave the motherboard, and thus the BMC powered, because that's just a constant 7 watts (about two Raspberry Pis at idle) being wasted (24/7). This process works for me because I run other services on low-power devices such as Raspberry Pi4s or servers that use much less power when idling than my 'big' NAS. This proces reduces my energy bill considerably (primary motivation) and also seems great for hard drive longevity. Although zero drive failures to date is awesome, N=24 is not very representative and I could just be very lucky. Yet, it was the same story with the predecessor of this NAS, a machine with 20 drives (1 TB Samsung Spinpoint F1s (remember those?)) and I also had zero drive failures during its operational lifespan (~5 years). The motherboard (died once) Although the drives are still ok, I had to replace the motherboard a few years ago. The failure mode of the motherboard was interesting: it was impossible to get into the BIOS and it would occasionally fail to boot. I tried the obvious like removing the CMOS battery and such but to no avail. Fortunately, the [motherboard]1 was still available on Ebay for a decent price so that ended up not being a big deal. ZFS ZFS worked fine for all these years. I've switched operating systems over the years and I never had an issue importing the pool back into the new OS install. If I would build a new storage server, I would definitely use ZFS again. I run a zpool scrub on the drives a few times a year2. The scrub has never found a single checksum error. I must have run so many scrubs, more than a petabyte of data must have been read from the drives (all drives combined) and ZFS didn't have to kick in. I'm not surprised by this result at all. Drives tend to fail most often in two modes: Total failure, drive isn't even detected Bad sectors (read or write failures) There is a third failure mode, but it's extremely rare: silent data corruption. Silent data corruption is 'silent' because a disk isn't aware it delivered corrupted data. Or the SATA connection didn't detect any checksum errors. However, due to all the low-level checksumming, this risk is extremely small. It's a real risk, don't get me wrong, but it's a small risk. To me, it's a risk you mostly care about at scale, in datacenters4 but for residential usage, it's totally reasonable to accept the risk3. But ZFS is not that difficult to learn and if you are well-versed in Linux or FreeBSD, it's absolutely worth checking out. Just remember! Sound levels (It's Oh So Quiet) This NAS is very quiet for a NAS (video with audio). But to get there, I had to do some work. The chassis contains three sturdy 12V fans that cool the 24 drive cages. These fans are extremely loud if they run at their default speed. But because they are so beefy, they are fairly quiet when they run at idle RPM5, yet they still provide enough airflow, most of the time. But running at idle speeds was not enough as the drives would heat up eventually, especially when they are being read from / written to. Fortunately, the particular Supermicro motherboard I bought at the time allows all fan headers to be controlled through Linux. So I decided to create a script that sets the fan speed according to the temperature of the hottest drive in the chassis. I actually visited a math-related subreddit and asked for an algorithm that would best fit my need to create a silent setup and also keep the drives cool. Somebody recommended to use a \"PID controller\", which I knew nothing about. So I wrote some Python, stole some example Python PID controller code, and tweaked the parameters to find a balance between sound and cooling performance. The script has worked very well over the years and kept the drives at 40C or below. PID controllers are awesome and I feel it should be used in much more equipment that controls fans, temperature, and so on, instead of 'dumb' on/of behaviour or less 'dumb' lookup tables. Networking I started out with quad-port gigabit network controllers and I used network bonding to get around 450 MB/s network transfer speeds between various systems. This setup required a ton of UTP cables so eventually I got bored with that and I bought some cheap Infiniband cards and that worked fine, I could reach around 700 MB/s between systems. As I decided to move away from Ubuntu and back to Debian, I faced a problem: the Infiniband cards didn't work anymore and I could not figure out how to fix it. So I decided to buy some second-hand 10Gbit Ethernet cards and those work totally fine to this day. The dead power supply When you turn this system on, all drives spin up at once (no staggered spinup) and that draws around 600W for a few seconds. I remember that the power supply was rated for 750W and the 12 volt rail would have been able to deliver enough power, but it would sometimes cut out at boot nonetheless. UPS (or lack thereof) For many years, I used a beefy UPS with the system, to protect against power failure, just to be able to shutdown cleanly during an outage. This worked fine, but I noticed that the UPS used another 10+ watts on top of the usage of the server and I decided it had to go. Losing the system due to power shenanigans is a risk I accept. Backups (or a lack thereof) My most important data is backed up trice. But a lot of data stored on this server isn't important enough for me to backup. I rely on replacement hardware and ZFS protecting against data loss due to drive failure. And if that's not enough, I'm out of luck. I've accepted that risk for 10 years. Maybe one day my luck will run out, but until then, I enjoy what I have. Future storage plans (or lack thereof) To be frank, I don't have any. I built this server back in the day because I didn't want to shuffle data around due to storage space constraints and I still have ample space left. I have a spare motherboard, CPU, Memory and a spare HBA card so I'm quite likely able to revive the system if something breaks. As hard drive sizes have increased tremendously, I may eventually move away from the 24-drive bay chassis into a smaller form-factor. It's possible to create the same amount of redundant storage space with only 6-8 hard drives with RAIDZ2 (RAID 6) redundancy. Yet, storage is always expensive. But another likely scenario is that in the coming years this system eventually dies and I decide not to replace it at all, and my storage hobby will come to an end. I needed the same board, because the server uses four PCIe slots: 3 x HBA and 1 x 10Gbit NIC. ↩ It takes ~20 hours to complete a scrub and it uses a ton of power while doing so. As I'm on a dynamic power tariff, I run it on 'cheap' days. ↩ every time I listen to ZFS enthusiasts you get the impression you are taking insane risks with your data if you don't run ZFS. I disagree, it all depends on context and circumstances. ↩ enterprise hard drives used in servers and SANs had larger sector sizes to accommodate even more checksumming data to prevent against silent data corruption. ↩ Because there is little airflow by default, I had to add a fan to cool the four PCIe cards (HBA and networking) or they would have gotten way too hot. ↩ Comments Solar Status 71 TiB NAS 20C/40T 128G Server Projects fio-plot Showtools Storage Fan Control Grafana Dasboard for storage metrics Categories Apple Development hardware IT Linux Networking Projects Security Solar Storage Uncategorized ZFS Archive 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 Social louwrentius Proudly powered by Pelican, which takes great advantage of Python.

Back in the noughties they built a home NAS similar to the one in the article, using fewer (smaller) drives. It was in RAID5 configuration.

I have 5 80mm and one 120mm PWM fans in my NAS and they are essentially silent as they can't be heard over the sound of the drives (which is essentially the noise floor for a NAS). It is necessary to use good PWM fans though if concerned about noise as cheaper ones can \"tick\" annoyingly. Two brands I know to be good in this respect are Be Quiet! and Noctua.

Depends on the size of the server: can't really expand fans with 1U or even 2U pizza boxes. And for general purpose servers, I'm not sure how many 4U+ systems are purchased—perhaps some more now that perhaps GPUs cards may be a popular add-on.

Going from what i see at eCycle places, 4U dried up years ago. Everything is either 1 or 2U or massive blade receptacles (10+ U). We (the home-lab on a budget people) may see a return to 4U now that GPUs are in vogue but i'd bet that the hyper scalers are going to drive that back down to something that'll be 3U with water cooling or so over the longer term.

He sadly didn't respond after that, so I wiped and switched back to a plain mdadmin raid after a few days of waiting. I had everything important backed up, obviously (though I did lose some unimportant data), but it did remind me that bleeding edge is indeed ...

It's not like switching from Nvidia's proprietary drivers to nouveau and then back if it turns out they don't work that well. Switching filesystems, especially in larger raid setups where you desperately need more testing and real world usage feedback, is pretty involved, and even if you have everything backed up it's pretty time consuming restoring everything should things go haywire. And even if you have the time and patience to be one of these early adopters, debugging any issues encountered might also be difficult, as ideally you want to give the devs full access to your filesystem for debugging and attempted fixes, which is obviously not always feasible. So anything beyond the most trivial setups and usage patterns gets a miniscule amount of testing.

You have an important core of truth to your argument about polarization. But... Strongly disagree. I think that is a very unfair reading of what I wrote. I feel that you might have a bias which shows but that would be the same class of ad hominem as you have just displayed. That is why I choose to react even though it might be wise to let slepping dogs lie. We should minimize polarization but not to a degree where we cannot have civilized disagreement. You are then doing exactly what you preach not to do. Is that then FUD with FUD on top? Two wrongs make a right? I was reacting on the implicit approval in mentioning that it had been upstreamed in the kernel. The reason for the first link. Regrets where clearly expressed. Another HN trope is rehashing the same discussions over and over again. That was the reason for the second link. I would like to avoid yet another discussion on a topic which was put into light less than 14 days ago. Putting that more bluntly would have been impolite and polarizing. Yet here I am. The sad part is that my point got through to you loud and clear. Sad because rather than simply dismissing as polarizing that would have been a great opener for a discussion. Especially in the context of ZFS and durability. You wrote: > Linus \"regretted\" it in the sense \"it was a bit too early because bcachefs is moving at such a fast speed\", and not in the sense \"we got a second btrfs that eats your data for lunch\". If you allow me a little lighthearted response. The first thing which comes to mind was the \"They're the same picture\" meme[1] from The Office. Some like to move quickly and break things. That is a reasonable point of view. But context matters. For long term data storage I am much more conservative. So while you might disagree; to me it is the exact same picture. Hence I very much object to what I feel is an ad hominem attack because your own worldview was not reflected suitably in my response. It is fair critique that you feel it is FUD. I do however find it warranted for a filesystem which is marked experimental. It might be the bees knees but in my mind it is not ready for mainstream use. Yet. That is an important perspective for the OP to have. If the OP just want to play around all is good. If the OP does not mind moving quickly and break things, fine. But for production use? Not there yet. Not in my world. Telling people to ignore my comment because you know people cannot be bothered to actually read the links?

Not sure what to believe, but I like having my ZFS NAS running so it can regularly run scrubs and check the data. FWIW, I’ve run my 4 drive system for 10 years with 2 drive failures in that time, but they were not enterprise grade drives (WD Green). reply CTDOCodebases 17 hours agoparentI think a lot of the advice around keeping the drives running is about avoiding wear caused by spin downs and startups i.e. keeping the \"Start Stop Cycles\" low. Theres a difference between spinning a drive up/down once or twice a day and spinning it down every 15 minutes or less. Also WD Green drives are not recommended for NAS usage. I know in the past they used to park the read/write head every few seconds or so which is fine if data is being accessed infrequently but continuously however a server this can result in continuous wear which leads to premature failure. reply cm2187 12 hours agorootparentAgree. I do weekly backups, the backup NAS is only switched on and off 52 times a year. After 5-6 years the disks are probably close to new in term of usage vs disks that have been running continuously over that same period. Which leads to another strategy which is to swap the primary and the backup after 5 years to get a good 10y out of the two NAS. reply larusso 14 hours agorootparentprevThere used to be some tutorials going around to flash the firmware to turn greens into reds I believe.

Why?: * The read/write heads experience literally next to no wear while they are floating above the platters. They physically land onto shelves or onto landing zones on the platters themselves when turned off; landing and takeoff are by far the most wear the heads will suffer. * Following on the above, in the worst case the read/write heads might be torn off during takeoff due to stiction. * Bearings will last longer; they might also seize up if left stationary for too long. Likewise the drive motor. * The rush of current when turning on is an electrical stressor, no matter how minimal.

Counterpoints for each: Heads don't suffer wear when parking. The armature does. If the platters are not spinning fast enough, or the air density is too low: the heads will crash into the sides of the platters. The main wear on platter bearings is vibration, it takes an extremely long time for the lube to \"gum up.\" If its still a thing at all. I suspect it used to happen because they were petroleum distilate lubes. So, shorter chains would evaporate/sublimate leaving longer more viscous chains. Or straight polymerize. With fully synthetic PAO oils, and other options they won't do that anymore. What inrush? They're polyphase steppers. The only reason for inrush is that the engineers didn't think it'd affect lifetime.

OTOH, when the NAS spins up a single disk again, I haven't notice any additional load. Presumably, the read operation just waits until the disk is ready. reply bongodongobob 15 hours agoparentprevThis is completely dependant on access frequency. Do you have a bunch of different people accessing many files frequently? Are you doing frequent backups? If so then yes, keeping them spinning may help improve lifespan by reducing frequent disk jerk. This is really only applicable when you're at a pretty consistent high load and you're trying to prevent your disks from spinning up and down every few minutes or something. For a homelab, you're probably wasting way more money in electricity than you are saving in disk maintenance by leaving your disks spin. reply rnxrx 17 hours agoprevIn my experience the environment where the drives are running makes a huge difference in longevity. There's a ton more variability in residential contexts than in data center (or even office) space. Potential temperature and humidity variability is a notable challenge but what surprised me was the marked effect of even small amounts of dust.

Run very cool as well (I think they're 5400 rpm not 7200 rpm).

ZFS handles this without an issue. The main gotchas tend to be: if you use the array for many things, especially stuff that throws off log files, you will constantly be accessing that array and resetting the spin down timers. Or you might be just at the threshold for spindown and you'll put a ton of cycles on it as it bounces from spindown to access to spin up.

It's a whitebox RAID6 running NTFS (tried ReFS, didn't like it), and has been around for 12+ years, although I've upgraded the drives a couple times (2TB --> 4TB --> 16TB) - the older Areca RAID controllers make it super simple to do this. Tools like Hard Disk Sentinel are awesome as well, to help catch drives before they fail. I have an additional, smaller array that runs 24x7, which has been through similar upgrade cycles, plus a handful of clients with whitebox storage arrays that have lasted over a decade. Usually the client ones are more abused (poor temperature control when they delay fixing their serveroom A/C for months but keep cramming in new heat-generating equipment, UPS batteries not replaced diligently after staff turnover, etc...). Do I notice a difference in drive lifespan between the ones that are mostly-off vs. the ones that are always-on? Hard to say. It's too small a sample size and possibly too much variance in 'abuse' between them. But definitely seen a failure rate differential between the ones that have been maintained and kept cool, vs. allowed to get hotter than is healthy.

A typical 7200 rpm disk consumes about 5W when idle. For 24 drives, it's 120W. Rather substantial, but not an electric kettle level. At $0.25 / kWh, it's $0.72 / day, or about $22 / mo, or slightly more than $260 / year. But this is only the disks; the CPU + mobo can easily consume half as much on average, so it would be more like $30-35 / mo. And if you have electricity at a lower price, the numbers change accordingly. This is why my ancient NAS uses 5400 RPM disks, and a future upgrade could use even slower disks if these were available. The reading bandwidth is multiplied by the number of disks involved. reply louwrentius 18 hours agoparentprevOn the original blog it states that the machine used 200W idle.

It's an availability solution to reduce downtime in event of disk failure. Many things can go wrong with your files and filesystem besides disk failure, eg user error, userspace software/script bugs, driver or FS or hardware bugs, ransomware, etc) The article mentions backups near the end saying eg \"most of the data is not important\" and the \"most important\" data is backed up. Feeling lucky I guess. reply lonjil 6 hours agoparentZFS can help you with backups and data integrity beyond what RAID provides, though. For example, I back up to another machine using zfs's snapshot sending feature. Fast and convenient. I scrub my machine and the backup machine every week, so if any data has become damaged beyond repair on my machine, I know pretty quickly. Same with the backup machine. And because of the regular integrity checking on my machine, it's very unlikely that I accidentally back up damaged data. And finally, frequent snapshots are a great way to recover from software and some user errors. Of course, there are still dangers, but ZFS without backup is a big improvement over RAID, and ZFS with backups is a big improvement over most backup strategies. reply louwrentius 9 hours agoparentprevI’m well aware of the risks, I just accept it.

I'm sure there are some other hobbies that routinely work with large file sizes. Storage is cheap enough that rather than deleting 1000's of photos and never be able to reclaim or look at them again I'd rather buy another drive. I'd rather have a RAW of an 8 year old photo that I overlooked and decide I really like and want to edit/work with than a 87kb resized and compressed JPG of the same file. Same for a mostly-edited 240GB video file. What if I want or need to make some changes to it in the future? May as well hold onto it than have to re-edit the video or re-shoot the video if the original footage was also deleted. Content creators have deleted their content often enough that if I enjoyed a video and think future me might enjoy rewatching the video - I download it rather than trust that I can still watch it in the future. Sites have been taken offline frequently enough that I download things. News sites keep restructuring and breaking all their old article links so I download the articles locally. JP artists are notorious for deleting their entire accounts and restarting under a new alias that I routinely archive entire Pixiv/Twitter accounts if I like their art as there is no guarantee it will still be there to enjoy the next day. It all adds up and I'm approaching 2 million well-organized and (mostly) tagged media files in my Hydrus client [0]. I have many scripts to automate downloading and tagging content for these purposes. I very, very rarely delete things. My most frequent reason for deleting anything is \"found in higher quality\" which conceptually isn't really deleting.

I know it's not a guarantee of no-corruption, and ZFS without ECC is probably no more dangerous than any other file system without ECC, but if data corruption is a major concern for you, and you're building out a pretty hefty system like this, I can't imagine not using ECC. Slow on-disk data corruption resulting from gradual and near-silent RAM failures may be like doing regular 3-2-1 backups -- you either mitigate against the problem because you've been stung previously, or you're in that blissful pre-sting phase of your life. EDIT: I found TFA's link to the original build out - and happily they are in fact running a Xeon with ECC. Surprisingly it's a 16GB box (I thought ZFS was much hungrier on the RAM : disk ratio.) Obviously it hasn't helped for physical disk failures, but the success of the storage array owes a lot to this component. reply Filligree 17 hours agoparentIt's difficult as a home user to find ECC memory, harder to make sure it actually works in your hardware configuration, and near-impossible to find ECC memory that doesn't require lower speeds than what you can get for $50 on amazon.

I'd started to add an aside to the effect of 'ten years ago it was probably easier to go ECC'. I'll add it here instead. A decade ago if you wanted ECC your choice was basically Xeon, and all() Xeon motherboards would accept ECC. I agree that these days it's much more complex, since you are ineluctably going get sucked into the despair-spiral of trying to work out what combination of Ryzen + motherboard + ECC RAM will give you actual, demonstrable* ECC (with correction, not just detection). reply rpcope1 14 hours agorootparentSounds like the answer is to just buy another Xeon then, even if it's a little older and maybe secondhand.

There is the 1 GB of RAM per 1TB of storage rule of thumb, but that was for a specific context.

I'd heard the original ZFS memory estimations were somewhat exuberant, and recommendations had come down a lot since the early days, but I'd imagine given your usage pattern - powered on periodically - a performance hit for whatever operations you're doing during that time wouldn't be problematic.

This actually happened with 3 different hubs, so I since stopped trying to expand that monstrosity and just replace drives with larger ones instead. Don't use hubs for storage, majority of them are shitty. Currently ~64TiB (less with redundancy). Same as OP. No data loss, no broken drives. A couple of years ago I also added an off-site 46TiB system with similar software, but a regular ATX with 3 or 4 internal drives because the spiderweb of mini PC + dangling USBs + power supplies for HDDs is too annoying.

I've given up on striped RAID. Residential use requires easy expandability to keep costs down. Expanding an existing parity stripe RAID setup involves failing every drive and slowly replacing them one by one with bigger capacity drives while the whole array is in a degraded state and incurring heavy I/O load. It's easier and safer to build a new one and move the data over. So you pretty much need to buy the entire thing up front which is expensive. Btrfs has a flexible allocator which makes expansion easier but btrfs just isn't trustworthy. I spent years waiting for RAID-Z expansion only for it to end up being a suboptimal solution that leaves the array in some kind of split parity state, old data in one format and new data in another format. It's just so tiresome. Just give up on the \"storage efficiency\" nonsense. Make a pool of double or triple mirrors instead and call it a day. It's simpler to set up, easier to understand, more performant, allows heterogeneous pools of drives which lowers risk of systemic failure due to bad batches, gradual expansion is not only possible but actually easy and doesn't take literal weeks to do, avoids loading the entire pool during resilvering in case of failures, and it offers so much redundancy the only way you'll lose data is if your house literally burns down. https://jrs-s.net/2015/02/06/zfs-you-should-use-mirror-vdevs... reply louwrentius 9 hours agoparentI dislike that article/advice because it’s dishonest / downplaying a limitation of ZFS and advocating that people should spend a lot more money, that may likely not be necessary at all. reply snvzz 17 hours agoprev [–] >but for residential usage, it's totally reasonable to accept the risk.

You’re not allowed to redistribute it with changes — but you, as an entity, can freely use ZFS and the kernel together without restriction. Linux plus zfs works fine. reply louwrentius 8 hours agorootparentprevI feel that on HN people tend to be a bit pedantic about topics like data integrity, and in business settings I actually agree with them. But for residential use, risks are just different and as you point out, you have no options except to only use a desktop workstation with ECC. People like/need laptops so that’s not realistic for most people. Just run Linux/freebsd with ZFS isn’t reasonable advice to me. What I feel most strongly about is that it’s all about circumstances, context and risk evaluation. And I see so much blanket absolutist statements that don’t think about the reality of life and people’s circumstances. reply simoncion 7 hours agorootparentprev> I never had the guts to try btrfs in production after all the horror stories I've heard over the decade+. I've been running btrfs as the primary filesystem for all of my desktop machines since shortly after the on-disk format stabilized and the extX->btrfs in-place converter appeared [0], and for my home servers for the past ~five years. In the first few years after I started using it on my desktop machines, I had four or five \"btrfs shit the bed and trashed some of my data\" incidents. I've had zero issues in the past ~ten years. At $DAYJOB we use btrfs as the filesystem for our CI workers and have been doing so for years. Its snapshot functionality makes creating the containers for CI jobs instantaneous, and we've had zero problems with it. I can think of a few things that might separate me from the folks who report issues that they've had within the past five-or-ten years: * I don't use ANY of the built-in btrfs RAID stuff. * I deploy btrfs ON TOP of LVM2 LVs, rather than using its built-in volume management stuff. [1] * I WAS going to say \"I use ECC RAM\", but one of my desktop machines does not and can never have ECC RAM, so this isn't likely a factor. The BTRFS features I use at home are snapshotting (for coherent point-in-time backups), transparent compression, the built-in CoW features, and the built-in checksumming features. At work, we use all of those except for compression, and don't use snapshots for backup but for container volume cloning. [0] If memory serves, this was around the time when the OCZ Vertex LE was hot, hot shit.

I think that the author may not have experienced these sorts of errors before. Yes, the average person may not care about experiencing a couple of bit flips per year and losing the odd pixel or block of a JPEG, but they will care if some cable somewhere or transfer or bad RAM chip or whatever else manages to destroy a significant amount of data before they notice it. reply AndrewDavis 13 hours agorootparentI had a significant data loss years ago. I was young and only had a deskop, so all my data was there. So I purchased a 300GB external usb drive to use for periodic backup. It was all manual copy/paste files across with no real schedule, but it was fine for the time and life was good. Over time my data grew and the 300GB drive wasn't large enough to store it all. For a while some of it wasnt backed up (I was young with much less disposable income). Eventually I purchased a 500GB drive. But what I didn't know is my desktop drive was dying. Bits were flipping, a lot of them. So when I did my first backup with the new drive I copied all my data off my desktop along with the corruption. It was months before I realised a huge amount of my files were corrupted. By that point I'd wiped the old backup drive to give to my Mum to do her own backups. My data was long gone. Once I discovered ZFS I jumped on it. It was the exact thing that would have prevented this because I could have detected the corruption when I purchased the new backup drive and did the initial backup to it. (I made up the drive sizes because I can't remember, but the ratios will be about right). reply 369548684892826 10 hours agorootparentThere’s something disturbing about the idea of silent data loss, it totally undermines the peace of mind of having backups. ZFS is good, but you can also just run rsync periodically with checksum and dryrun args and check the output for diffs. reply AndrewDavis 9 hours agorootparentAbsolutely, if you can't use a filesystem with checksums (zfs, btrfs, bcachefs) then rsync is a great idea. I think filesystem checksums have one big advantage vs rsync. With rsync if there's a difference it isn't clear which one is wrong. reply bombcar 8 hours agorootparentprevI have an MP3 file that still skips to this day, because a few frames were corrupted on disk twenty years ago. I could probably find a new copy of it online, but that click is a good reminder about how backups aren’t just copies but have to be verified. reply willis936 10 hours agorootparentprevIt happens all the time. Have a plan, perform fire drills. It's a lot of time and money, but there's no equivalent feeling to unfucking yourself quite like being able to get your lost, fragile data back. reply lazide 9 hours agorootparentThe challenge with silent data loss is your backups will eventually not have the data either - it will just be gone, silently. After having that happen a few times (pre-ZFS), I started running periodic findmd5sum > log.txt type jobs and keeping archives. It’s caught more than a few problems over the years, and allows manual double checking even when using things like ZFS. In particular, some tools/settings just aren’t sane to use to copy large data sets, and I only discovered that when… some of it didn’t make it to it’s destination. reply taneq 9 hours agorootparentprevMy last spinning hard drive failed silently like this, but I didn’t lose too much data… I think. The worst part is not knowing. reply Timshel 12 hours agoparentprevJust checked my scrub history, for 20TB on consumer hardware during the last two years it repaired twice around 2 and 4 blocks each time. So not much but at the same time with a special kind of luck might have been on an encrypted archive ^^. reply nolok 11 hours agorootparentThat's all fine and good until that one random lone broken block stops you from opening that file you really need. reply mrjin 9 hours agorootparentWhat you need is backup. RAID is not backup and is not for most home/personal users. I learnt that the hard way. Now my NAS use simple volumes only, after all, I really don't have many things I cannot lose on it. If it's something really important, I have multiple copies on different drives, and some offline cold backup. So now if any of my NAS drive is about to fail, I can just copy out the data and replace the drive, instead of spending weeks trying to rebuild the RAID and ended with a total loss as multiple drives failed in a row. The funny thing is that, after moving to simply volumes approach, I never had a drive with even a bad sector since. reply nolok 9 hours agorootparentOh I have backups myself. But parent is more or less talking about a 71TiB NAS for residential usage and being able to ignore the bit rot; in that context such a person probably wouldn't have backup. Personnaly I have long since moved out of raid 5/6 into raid 1 or 10 with versionned backup, at some level of data raid 5/6 just isn't cutting it anymore in case anything goes slightly wrong. reply lazide 11 hours agorootparentprevOr in my case, a key filesystem metadata block that ruins everything. :s reply pbhjpbhj 10 hours agorootparentI only know about FAT but these \"key file metadata blocks\" are redundant, so you need really special double-plus bad luck to do that. reply Szpadel 10 hours agorootparentso I can consider myself very lucky and unlucky at the same time. I had data corruption on zfs filesystem that destroyed whole pool to unrecoverable state (zfs was segfaulting while trying to import, all recovery zfs features where crashing zfs module and required reboot) the lucky part is that this happened just after (something like next day) I migrated whole pool to another (bigger) server/pool so that system was already scheduled for full disk wipe reply howard941 1 hour agorootparentThis happened to me too. The root cause was a bad memory stick. reply lazide 10 hours agorootparentprevIt was ext4, and I’ve had it happen two different times - in fact, I’ve never had it happen in a ‘good’ recoverable way before that I’ve ever seen. It triggered a kernel panic in every machine that I mounted it in, and it wasn’t a media issue either. Doing a block level read of the media had zero issues and consistently returned the exact same data the 10 times I did it. Notably, I had the same thing happen using btrfs due to power issues on a Raspberry Pi (partially corrupted writes resulting in a completely unrecoverable filesystem, despite it being in 2x redundancy mode). Should it be impossible? Yes. Did it definitely, 100% for sure happen? You bet. I never actually lost data on ZFS, and I’ve done some terrible things to pools before that took quite awhile to unbork, including running it under heavy write load with a machine with known RAM problems and no ECC. reply hulitu 9 hours agorootparentGood to know. Ext2 is much more robust against corruption. Or at least it was 10 years ago when i had kernel crashes or power failures. reply mustache_kimono 15 hours agoparentprev> Data integrity is the natural expectation humans have from computers I've said it once, and I'll say it again: the only reason ZFS isn't the norm is because we all once lived through a primordial era when it didn't exist.

ZFS has identified corruption caused by bad memory and a bad CPU and let me know immediately which files were damaged. reply KMag 11 hours agorootparentprev> No serious person designing a filesystem today would say it's okay to misplace your data. Former LimeWire developer here... the LimeWire splash screen at startup was due to experiences with silent data corruption. We got some impossible bug reports, so we created a stub executable that would show a splash screen while computing the SHA-1 checksums of the actual application DLLs and JARs. Once everything checked out, that stub would use Java reflection to start the actual application. After moving to that, those impossible bug reports stopped happening. With 60 million simultaneous users, there were always some of them with silent disk corruption that they would blame on LimeWire. When Microsoft was offering free Win7 pre-release install ISOs for download, I was having install issues. I didn't want to get my ISO illegally, so I found a torrent of the ISO, and wrote a Python script to download the ISO from Microsoft, but use the torrent file to verify chunks and re-download any corrupted chunks. Something was very wrong on some device between my desktop and Microsoft's servers, but it eventually got a non-corrupted ISO. It annoys me to no end that ECC isn't the norm for all devices with more than 1 GB of RAM. Silent bit flips are just not okay. Edit: side note: it's interesting to see the number of complaints I still see from people who blame hard drive failures on LimeWire stressing their drives. From very early on, LimeWire allowed bandwidth limiting, which I used to keep heat down on machines that didn't cool their drives properly. Beyond heat issues that I would blame on machine vendors, failures from write volume I would lay at the feet of drive manufacturers. Though, I'm biased. Any blame for drive wear that didn't fall on either the drive manufacturers or the filesystem implementers not dealing well with random writes would probably fall at my feet. I'm the one who implemented randomized chunk order downloading in order to rapidly increase availability of rare content, which would increase the number of hard drive head seeks on non-log-based filesystems. I always intended to go back and (1) use sequential downloads if tens of copies of the file were in the swarm, to reduce hard drive seeks and (2) implement randomized downloading of rarest chunks first, rather than the naive randomization in the initial implementation. I say naive, but the initial implementation did have some logic to randomize chunk download order in a way to reduce the size of the messages that swarms used to advertise which peers had which chunks. As it turns out, there were always more pressing things to implement and the initial implementation was good enough. (Though, really, all read-write filesystems should be copy-on-write log-based, at least for recent writes, maybe having some background process using a count-min-sketch to estimate locality for frequently read data and optimize read locality for rarely changing data that's also frequently read.) Edit: Also, it's really a shame that TCP over IPv6 doesn't use CRC-32C (to intentionally use a different CRC polynomial than Ethernet, to catch more error patterns) to end-to-end checksum data in each packet. Yes, it's a layering abstraction violation, but IPv6 was a convenient point to introduce a needed change. On the gripping hand, it's probably best in the big picture to raise flow control, corruption/loss detection, retransmission (and add forward error correction) in libraries at the application layer (a la QUIC, etc.) and move everything to UDP. I was working on Google's indexing system infra when they switched transatlantic search index distribution from multiple parallel transatlantic TCP streams to reserving dedicated bandwidth from the routers and blasting UDP using rateless forward error codes. Provided that everyone is implementing responsible (read TCP-compatible) flow control, it's really good to have the rapid evolution possible by just using UDP and raising other concerns to libraries at the application layer. (N parallel TCP streams are useful because they typically don't simultaneously hit exponential backoff, so for long-fat networks, you get both higher utilization and lower variance than a single TCP stream at N times the bandwidth.) reply pbhjpbhj 10 hours agorootparentIt sounds like a fun comp sci exercise to optimise the algo for randomised block download to reduce disk operations but maintain resilience. Presumably it would vary significantly by disk cache sizes. It's not my field, but my impression is that it would be equally resilient to just randomise the start block (adjust spacing of start blocks according to user bandwidth?) then let users just run through the download serially; maybe stopping when they hit blocks that have multiple sources and then skipping to a new start block? It's kinda mindbogglingly to me too think of all the processes that go into a 'simple' torrent download at the logical level. If AIs get good enough before I die then asking it to create simulations on silly things like this will probably keep me happy for all my spare time! reply KMag 10 hours agorootparentFor the completely randomized algorithm, my initial prototype was to always download the first block if available. After that, if fewer than 4 extents (continuous ranges of available bytes) were downloaded locally, randomly chose any available block. (So, we first get the initial block, and 3 random blocks.) If 4 or more extents were available locally, then always try the block after the last downloaded block, if available. (This is to minimize disk seeks.) If the next block isn't available, then the first fallback was to check the list of available blocks against the list of next blocks for all extents available locally, and randomly choose one of those. (This is to chose a block that hopefully can be the start of a bunch of sequential downloads, again minimizing disk seeks.) If the first fallback wasn't available, then the second fallback was to compute the same thing, except for the blocks before the locally available extents rather than the blocks after. (This is to avoid increasing the number of locally available extents if possible.) If the second fallback wasn't available, then the final fallback was to randomly uniformly pick one of the available blocks. Trying to extend locally available extents if possible was desirable because peers advertised block availability as pairs of , so minimizing the number of extents minimized network message sizes. This initial prototype algorithm (1) minimized disk seeks (after the initial phase of getting the first block and 3 other random blocks) by always downloading the block after the previous download, if possible. (2) Minimized network message size for advertising available extents by extending existing extents if possible. Unfortunately, in simulation this initial prototype algorithm biased availability of blocks in rare files, biasing in favor of blocks toward the end of the file. Any bias is bad for rapidly spreading rare content, and bias in favor of the end of the file is particularly bad for audio and video file types where people like to start listening/watching while the file is still being downloaded. Instead, the algorithm in the initial production implementation was to first check the file extension against a list of extensions likely to be accessed by the user while still downloading (mp3, ogg, mpeg, avi, wma, asf, etc.). For the case where the file extension indicates the user is unlikely to access the content until the download is finished (the general case algorithm), look at the number of extents (continuous ranges of bytes the user already has). If the number of extents is less than 4, pick any block randomly from the list of blocks that peers were offering for download. If there are 4 or more extents available locally, for each end of each extent available locally, check the block before it and the block after it to see if they're available for download from peers. If this list of available adjacent blocks is non-empty, then randomly chose one of those adjacent blocks for download. If the list of available adjacent blocks is empty, then uniformly randomly chose from one of the blocks available from peers. In the case of file types likely to be viewed while being downloaded, it would download from the front of the file until the download was 50% complete, and then randomly either download the first needed block, or else use the previously described algorithm, with the probability of using the previous (randomized) algorithm increasing as the percentage of the download completed increased. There was also some logic to get the last few chunks of files very early in the download for file formats that required information from a file footer in order to start using them (IIRC, ASF and/or WMA relied on footer information to start playing). Internally, there was also logic to check if a chunk was corrupted (using a Merkle tree using the Tiger hash algorithm). We would ignore the corrupted chunks when calculating the percentage completed, but would remove corrupted chunks from the list of blocks we needed to download, unless such removal resulted in an empty list of blocks needed for download. In this way, we would avoid re-downloading corrupted blocks unless we had nothing else to do. This would avoid the case where one peer had a corrupted block and we just kept re-requesting the same corrupted block from the peer as soon as we detected corruption. There was some logic to alert the user if too many corrupted blocks were detected and give the user options to stop the download early and delete it, or else to keep downloading it and just live with a corrupted file. I felt there should have been a third option to keep downloading until a full-but-corrupt download was had, retry downloading every corrupt block once, and then re-prompt the user if the file was still corrupt. However, this option would have resulted in more wasted bandwidth and likely resulted in more user frustration due to some of them hitting \"keep trying\" repeatedly instead of just giving up as soon as it was statistically unlikely they were going to get a non-corrupted download. Indefinite retries without prompting the user were a non-starter due to the amount of bandwidth they would waste. reply Too 13 hours agorootparentprevThe reason ZFS isn't the norm is because it historically was difficult to set up. Outside of NAS solutions, it's only since Ubuntu 20.04 it has been supported out of the box on any high profile customer facing OS. The reliability of the early versions was also questionable, with high zsys cpu usage and some times arcane commands needed to rebuild pools. Anecdotally, I've had to support lots of friends with zfs issues, never so with other file systems. The data always comes back, it's just that it needs petting. Earlier, there used to be lot of fears around the license, with Torvalds advising against its use, both for that reason and for lack of maintainers. Now i believe that has been mostly ironed out and should be less of an issue. reply mustache_kimono 11 hours agorootparent> The reason ZFS isn't the norm is because it historically was difficult to set",

    "commentBody": "Meet.hn – Meet the Hacker News community in your city345 points by sirobg 7 hours agohidepastfavorite183 comments Hey HN! I just published https://meet.hn, a map to find hackers in your city. How it works? Demo of the signup process: https://x.com/meet_hn/status/1834918518904746329 1. Fill the form: username, city+country 2. Copy the text generated in the box below the form, and paste it in your HN description. 3. Click \"Add me on the map\" Optionnaly (it's recommended!) you can add links to your socials as well as some tags to showcase your interests. Why does it exist? I created this because, despite its harsh reputation on the internet, I love the HN community. I have fewer than a handful of friends who are as curious and eager to think and reflect as the people on HN. Also, the city I currently live in is more focused on industry than on technology and entrepreneurship, which are core to HN. This led me to want to meet the HN community IRL. After trying `site:news.ycombinator.com/user toulouse` on Google and getting only one result, I decided to create meet.hn. My first goal with this is to meet at least one HN member in my city: Toulouse, France. If you are ever in the area, hit me up!

The map just refreshes if I check that, but it seems kinda unbelievable given how isolated the country is and how heavily monitored the folks living there are. Either way, had a bit of trouble adding myself due to the tool expecting this data to be the only thing in the user's bio. Could it be updated to check if the text exists anywhere at all? Because quite a few people here will want to discuss their side projects and startups first, not start off with a random block of tags. reply GTP 1 hour agoparentI was able to add myself even though I have another unrelated sentence in my bio. But I think the tool fails to show my interests. reply CM30 1 hour agorootparentHmm perhaps it fails with two or more lines at the start of the user bio? I had an extra paragraph or two of text before. But maybe it's only looking for a certain number of lines and cutting off anything after that, hence why the interests don't show up for you and the tool fails for anyone with a lot of text before the block. reply spencerchubb 5 hours agoprevThere are multiple cities in the U.S. with the name of my city, so unfortunately this doesn't work for me. reply sirobg 3 hours agoparentI'm sorry about that. I didn't realize it would be a problem. It's been reported before and I'll work on this. Thanks for sharing! reply lolinder 3 hours agorootparentIt's a funny cultural thing that it wouldn't have even occurred to me that someone in Europe wouldn't realize city names can conflict—it's a chronic problem here in the states. There are some ridiculously common city names here, but one that's been in the news lately and probably confusing a lot of people is Springfield, which is the name of at least 42 different cities in the US [0], including 5 just in Wisconsin. Most of them are small, but 5 of them (Massachusetts, Missouri, Illinois, Oregon, Ohio) have more the 20k residents. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield reply mrweasel 2 hours agorootparentPlenty of European countries have conflicting city/town/village names as well. If they grow to large they are sometimes specified by adding more locality to their name. Denmark has three cities names Nykøbing, typically specified as Nykøbing Mors, Nykøbing Sjælland or Nykøbing Falser. Small places are just allowed to conflict as long as they aren't in the same postcode. reply chgs 2 hours agorootparentprevEvery time o put directions to my local market town of Newport in Shropshire, google insists on thinking I want to travel two hours to Wales. I guess it could be worse and I’d end up in the Isle of Wight. Reused names isn’t just an American thing. reply rootusrootus 2 hours agorootparentprev> It's a funny cultural thing that it wouldn't have even occurred to me that someone in Europe wouldn't realize city names can conflict The irony is that a lot of our city names came from Europe. reply Muromec 1 hour agorootparentprevThe amount of cities called \"white city\" around here is annoying to, but at least they have the decency to be spelled differently. reply 1over137 2 hours agorootparentprevI knew city names were repeated in different US states, but they repeat even within a state? reply Tomte 2 hours agorootparentprevWe usually don’t think much about duplicate city names in America, but we sure notice that you‘ve taken all of ours! reply AyyEye 1 hour agorootparentprevCheck out how many \"greenville\" s there are.

He apparently makes direct references to local landmarks and establishments, and certain characters are rumored to have been based off of locals. reply woodson 1 hour agorootparentPortland embraces it, see for example the Ned Flanders Crossing, on Flanders St, no less: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Flanders_Crossing (The Simpsons character is named after the street.) reply OptionOfT 43 minutes agoparentprevSame in Europe.

Szczecin, Poland is found but handle is pl-undefined as for you...

Good luck and I hope we can someday meet up if I'm in Toulouse! reply Cosi1125 3 hours agorootparentprevEven worse than that, it's not possible to view cities with non-English characters in their names – like Łódź, but also Jyväskylä or İzmir. reply cpa 4 hours agoparentprevAlso, I can't click on users that are in cities containing a diacritic (Pégomas, France) or a space (La Ciotat, France).

I'm curious how this error occurs For anyone else having this, the \"add me\" button will enable itself again, but it does take a while. Not that retrying seems to work for me Edit: nvm I'm being stupid, I did not see the \"copy and paste the text below into your HN account\" instruction. Thanks also to those who replied with that info, though while playing with the browser dev tools to figure out what the issue might be, I spotted that text eventually reply lifty 5 hours agoparentYou have to add the link to your bio.

I then went to see who the nearest other HN profiles and see what they're into. Looks like their hobby is developing meet.hn! Nice work neighbor :D! reply dr_kiszonka 2 hours agoprevWell done! I have one suggestion. Given how geographically sparse HN users are, you could consider listing nearby users too. For example: 2 hackers in Ankh-Morpork: - Lord Vetinari - Igor 3 hackers within 10 mi (16 km): - Susan (Sto Helit) - Princess Keli (Sto Lat) - Lord Rodley (Quirm) (It can be a bit tricky, though.) reply rkagerer 2 hours agoparentThose guys are just scroll urchins. Those in the know will tell you the real clackers are Winton, Carlton and Emery of the Smoking Gnu. reply Fileformat 2 hours agoprevFeature suggestion: a \"my location\" button on the map, so you can zoom in to your current location.

I wanted a city and country to have a nice and simple URL though. If you have any suggestion, please do share it! - Every time I speak with people about HN, I get something along the line: \"They criticize everything, and very easily\". reply sebastiennight 1 hour agorootparentProbably city-zipcode-country would disambiguate effectively both for the US (where you could have several Springfield cities in different states) and Europe (where there are probably, for instance, quite a number of `Sainte-Anne` cities on top of Guadeloupe's) I think we're probably going to get a blog post from you a couple weeks from now titled \"falsehoods programmers believe about cities\"! reply salomonk_mur 1 hour agorootparentMany countries don't have zip codes or they are not widely used or known. My country (Colombia) relatively recently assigned them but no one uses them or require them, so no one knows which zip code they are living in reply djbusby 5 hours agorootparentprev> They criticize everything, and very easily I think that is a feature, not a bug. reply dylan604 4 hours agorootparentIt's also confusion that reporting of a bug is not criticism. It's a Show HN. You've asked for the feedback. People that get twisted when the feedback is anything other than pablum like \"great job\" need not be a developer. If you can't handle being told that something isn't working, then how do you ever expect to improve? Or maybe you've moved from being a dev and are now trying to be a founder? reply atmanactive 4 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely a feature. reply sirobg 3 hours agorootparentprevI 100% agree reply berdon 5 hours agorootparentprevIn the US you could just use “zipcode-us”. It’s not ideal though. Otherwise just “city-stateabbr-us” - e.g. “SiouxFalls-SD-US” reply grishka 5 hours agoprevFeature request: please add Mastodon/fediverse as a type of social media account.

Saint Petersburg is fixed now, and most should be as well, but not all. I implemented some kind of quick fix for now, but I will investigate further when this settles down a bit. Thanks for reporting! reply delta_p_delta_x 5 hours agoprev> City not found. Make sure you use the format: City, Country (Paris, France) It might be good to rework this—cities only, and provide a drop-down box for users to select.

Or both. reply atmanactive 4 hours agoprevWhat about security? How is this protected from abuse? Why is this all public information? It feels like a honeypot to be honest. My suggestion would be to hide the names unless visitor is logged in AND there is a match in their city. reply Aachen 4 hours agoparentThat just gives a false sense of security. Someone who means harm would simply set themselves to each city successively, while people believe it to be private (similar to the location feature in dating apps that keeps being broken to find people's exact addresses). Not that I see what harm there is in associating a username with a (nearby) city when one makes that choice consciously, so it's not like the dating app situation where you (1) believe the location will remain secret and (2) it being revealed means your exact address is now known reply atmanactive 3 hours agorootparentAn app that would allow an account to change it's location more than 3 times in a year is a broken app in my book. reply tacitusarc 3 hours agorootparentPeople move all the time. People also often have multiple accounts, which they could use to determine which accounts are located where. reply atmanactive 2 hours agorootparentThen it would need a GPS-backed proof to allow more location changes while preventing abuse. There's always an intended use case and corner cases which could be handled via support ticket, thus passing through human judgement. If there is a secure app on your phone, then how can you have multiple accounts? reply RadiozRadioz 4 hours agoparentprev> hide the names unless visitor is logged in I hate websites that do this. People know that what they're putting here will be public, they make the judgment themselves if they're okay with that. reply atmanactive 3 hours agorootparentWhy do you care if the screen shows 5 people in city X (which is not your city anyway)? What use do you have of knowing exact names of people in city X half way acros the globe? reply RadiozRadioz 2 hours agorootparentIt is interesting to me and others. There's a person living in Vila do Corvo. I didn't know that was a place. What are they interested in? What do the technical people of Vila do Corvo post about? (In this case, not much, but it was fun to find out.) reply atmanactive 2 hours agorootparentExactly. A _person_. That's enough information to satisfy curiosity. No need to publish exact names. reply RadiozRadioz 2 hours agorootparentIf I don't know their username, how can I look at what they post about? I think lots of people on HN are curious and inquisitive by nature reply j_maffe 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's interesting to know what that person is up to (from what they publically share online). reply codingdave 3 hours agorootparentprevTravel - it seems that if this app takes off, catching up with people as you travel is a solid use case. reply donatj 4 hours agoparentprevIt's all data you chose to share publicly. I wouldn't have put myself on the map if I hadn't been comfortable doing so. reply TekMol 4 hours agoparentprevWhat abuse? Your HN profile is public anyhow. All this does is show who put a city in their profile. You could find those via Google as well. reply atmanactive 4 hours agorootparentI misunderstood then. I thought this is a brand new data collector. Thank you. reply rogerdickey 1 hour agoprevGreat idea! Interest-based communities have a lot more trust so things like meeting up, transacting, or dating can happen with less friction. reply CaptainOfCoit 2 hours agoprevNice little thing, congrats to shipping :) I find it ironic that there are many cities with N hackers on meet.hn, yet most are not attaching any way of contacting them, nor do their profile have a way to contact them. How are you (the people without contact details) expecting us to meet you if you don't add a way of meeting you? :) reply Towaway69 1 hour agoparentFor those with github, I guess one could create a pull request ;) /s reply amadeuspagel 5 hours agoprevGreat idea. I think it would be cool if you couldn't just add socials but a personal webpage and email (with mailto link). reply sirobg 5 hours agoparentGood idea, thanks! I was scared to allow any URL, to be honest. That's why I restricted this to a set of allowed domains. But as it's open source maybe I'll have the chance to get it pair reviewed before shipping it if this gets traction. reply amadeuspagel 3 hours agorootparentTwo more things on the socials: - Most socials use square icons, but Cal.com uses the logo, so it breaks the layout. - I think it's worth adding YouTube, not just YouTube Music. reply sickcodebruh 5 hours agoprevThis is neat. I added myself. I'm hitting a bug where clicking New York just refreshes the page instead of loading the city's page. Los Angeles, San José, and... most cities seem to exhibit it. Chicago seems to work? Picking a city was tough. It insisted on the more general New York instead of the more specific Long Island City. reply drzzhan 1 hour agoprevGreat tool! But the City, Country box is a bit unintuitive. I am not sure how to fill my place in. I live in the US so it is \"city, state, country\" reply zschuessler 3 hours agoprevThis is really neat. Well done on the UX and functionality. I saw others already mentioned uniqueness of city names. In the US there is no guarantee a state, zip code, or even county won't have a duplicate city name. To solve this one must store the lat/lng coordinates instead. Then offer users a search list of matched cities, so they can select the right geographic location.

    "title": "Lisp implemented in Rust macros",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/RyanWelly/lisp-in-rs-macros",
    "originBody": "lisp-in-rs-macros A simple, lexically scoped Lisp interpreter that operates fully in Rust's declarative macros. The lisp! macro expands to the lisp value computed by the code, and then stringifies it. This means that lisp!(CAR (CONS (QUOTE A) (QUOTE (B)))) expands to the string \"A\" and that all this computation happens at compile time by rustc expanding macros. Why It's a lisp interpreter written fully in Rust's macros, I think that's pretty cool. It's also less than 250 lines, which is neat. Example let output = lisp!(CAR (LIST (QUOTE A) (QUOTE B) (QUOTE C))); assert_eq!(output, \"A\"); lisp!(PROGN (DEFINE message (LAMBDA () (QUOTE \"hello there\"))) (DISPLAY (message)) (DEFINE NOT (LAMBDA (X) (COND (X NIL) (TRUE TRUE))) ) (DISPLAY (NOT NIL)) ); // will print \"hello there\" and \"TRUE\" // \"DISPLAY\" forms first evaluate their arguments, then expand to a println!(\"{}\", stringify!(evaled_argument)) As another fun example, here is a quine: lisp! ((LAMBDA (s) (LIST s (LIST (QUOTE QUOTE) s))) (QUOTE (LAMBDA (s) (LIST s (LIST (QUOTE QUOTE) s))))); This code expands to: stringify!(((LAMBDA (s) (LIST s (LIST (QUOTE QUOTE) s))) (QUOTE (LAMBDA (s) (LIST s (LIST (QUOTE QUOTE) s)))))); In other words, the code evaluates to itself. Isn't that wonderful? Recursion This lisp does not currently support any explicit form of recursion. Luckily, explicit recursion is not needed, all we need is lambda. You can write a simple function that appends two lists by using self application: lisp!(PROGN (DEFINE append (LAMBDA (self X Y) (COND ((EQ X NIL) Y) (TRUE (CONS (CAR X) (self self (CDR X) Y))) ))) (append append (QUOTE (A B)) (QUOTE (C D))) ) This results in \"(A B C D)\". The append function does not mention append in its body, yet we can call it recursively. Wonderful! Notes for use The lisp! macro only evaluates a single expression; if you want to evaluate multiple expressions, use (PROGN expr1 expr2 expr3). This evaluates all the expressions, and returns the value of the last expression. The DISPLAY form evaluates a single expression, then generates a println!(\"{}\", stringify!(...)) statement which prints the stringified version of the tokens. The empty list is not self evaluating, you can use NIL or (QUOTE ()) to obtain an empty list value. The empty list is the sole \"falsy\" object. Dotted lists aren't supported, cons assumes its last argument is a list. The define form can be used anywhere and evaluates to the empty list, but does not support recursion. TRUE is the only self evaluating atom (that isn't a function). Supported forms DEFINE QUOTE LAMBDA LET PROGN CAR CDR CONS LIST EQ ATOM APPLY Note: dotted lists are not supported, CONS assumes its latter argument is a list. Define does not handle recursive definitions, it's more like internal definitions in Scheme than a true lispy define. Metacircular interpreter Here is a lisp interpreter written in my lisp: lisp!(PROGN // Y \"combinator\" for two arguments (DEFINE Y2 (LAMBDA (h) ((LAMBDA (x) (h (LAMBDA (a b) ((x x) a b))))(LAMBDA (x) (h (LAMBDA (a b) ((x x) a b))))))) (DEFINE CADR (LAMBDA (X) (CAR (CDR X)))) (DEFINE CAAR (LAMBDA (X) (CAR (CAR X)))) (DEFINE CADAR (LAMBDA (X) (CAR (CDR (CAR X))))) (DEFINE CADDR (LAMBDA (X) (CAR (CDR (CDR X))))) (DEFINE CADDAR (LAMBDA (X) (CAR (CDR (CDR (CAR X)))))) (DEFINE CAADAR (LAMBDA (X) (CAR (CAR (CDR (CAR X)))))) (DEFINE ASSOC (Y2 (LAMBDA (ASSOC) (LAMBDA (X ENV) (IF (EQ (CAAR ENV) X) (CADAR ENV) (ASSOC X (CDR ENV))) ))) ) (DEFINE eval (Y2 (LAMBDA (EVAL) (LAMBDA (E A) (COND ((ATOM E) (ASSOC E A)) ((ATOM (CAR E)) (COND ((EQ (CAR E) (QUOTE quote)) (CADR E)) ((EQ (CAR E) (QUOTE atom)) (ATOM (EVAL (CADR E) A))) ((EQ (CAR E) (QUOTE car)) (CAR (EVAL (CADR E) A))) ((EQ (CAR E) (QUOTE cdr)) (CDR (EVAL (CADR E) A))) ((EQ (CAR E) (QUOTE equal)) (EQ (EVAL (CADR E) A) (EVAL (CADDR E) A))) ((EQ (CAR E) (QUOTE cons)) (CONS (EVAL (CADR E) A) (EVAL (CADDR E) A))) (TRUE (EVAL (CONS (ASSOC (CAR E) A) (CDR E)) A)) ) ) ((EQ (CAAR E) (QUOTE lambda)) (EVAL (CADDAR E) (CONS (LIST (CAADAR E) (EVAL (CADR E) A)) A) )) //Evaluate the inner expression of the lambda, in the environment with the argument bound to the parameter) )))) (eval (QUOTE (quote (A))) NIL) // (eval (QUOTE (atom (quote A))) NIL ) // (eval (QUOTE (cdr (cdr (quote (A B))))) NIL) // (eval (QUOTE (cons (quote a) (quote (a)))) NIL) // (eval (QUOTE ((lambda (x) (quote a)) (quote b))) NIL) (eval (QUOTE ((lambda (X) X) (quote a))) NIL) ); It appears to work, but trying to evaluate ((lambda (X) X) (quote a)) in the interpreter takes more than 30 seconds and generates far more than a million tokens before cargo gets sigkilled. Using the explicit y combinator for recursion isn't particularly efficient here! To fix this, I should add an explicit recursion primitive. If you want a wonderful walktrhough of how to write something like a metacircular evaluator, Paul Graham's \"Roots of Lisp\" is awesome. Technical explanation Look at EXPLANATION.md. The macro essentially simulates a SECD machine, which is a simple stack-basd abstract machine for evaulating lambda calculus terms.

Greenspun's Tenth Rule is not meant to be interpreted as applying to projects that are consciously creating a Lisp implementation. It's about programs which are not meant to be language implementations at all reinventing ad hoc infrastructure that is designed in Lisps according to established patterns. For instance, badly reinventing something that functions as symbols. reply Nevermark 11 hours agorootparentI conjecture the line is not so easy to draw. If you are creating Lisp because you want to create Lisp, like creating Lisp, want to show off creating Lisp, that obviously is not what the Law is about. Furthermore, if you create Lisp because you know the Law, know it is inevitable, and want to avoid the caveats and missed bars by doing so explicitly, well then that also is not what the Law is about. But if you are going about your business, focused on your independent goal, realize you need Lisp like lists, and then 250 lines of code later realize you have created a solid Lisp unintentionally? Well, congrats on falling into the trap but not getting hurt! — Personally, I have created both Lisp and Forth multiple times for suitable projects where I wanted some flexible runtime scripting.

I've no idea why they don't introduce car/cdr functions and nil for empty parameter packs and allow to store parameter packs instead of the current syntax insanity. reply otabdeveloper4 1 hour agorootparentStore where? C++ templates are a lambda calculus, there's no notion of memory cells or state. reply jasfas 42 minutes agorootparentIn a struct!

There are two issues here: You can't store the parameter pack in Foo() which is later required by the continuation in visit(). And you would have to use tuples and tuple_cat() instead of UntypedList. Why can the compiler not infer the types in such an UntypedList? Why is there no car/cdr for tuples? reply gpderetta 4 hours agorootparentprevC++ metaprogramming was done with cons cells already back in '98.

Seems like a shit definition. reply kazinator 13 hours agorootparentThat's explicitly encoded right in the rule itself! When the program contains a bug-ridden, ad-hoc simulacrum of half (or more) of Common Lisp, then it has become sufficiently complicated. When it has less than half, it is not yet sufficiently complicated. reply StableAlkyne 20 hours agorootparentprevIt's just a funny observation he made, it's not meant to be a rigorous academic definition :) reply ithkuil 11 hours agorootparentprev\"for any sufficiently X the Y\" just means that if you don't observe Y right now, just increase the magnitude of X and you'll inevitably reach the conditions for Y to happen. Famous use of that pattern is Arthur's Clarke \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\". As with OP's quote, this is also vague and imprecise but the point of the idea is that there is a gradient towards which advancements in technology bring us towards a situation where the average person no longer understands how it works and it may as well be magic (while not necessarily defining exactly when does that transition happen) reply munificent 19 hours agorootparentprevI like that the \"sufficiently complicated\" part bothered you, but not the \"ad hoc\", \"informally-specified\", \"bug-ridden\", or \"slow\" parts. reply krick 14 hours agorootparentNo, I think it's pretty fair. One could argue about these, but except for \"slow\" these are more quality qualifiers, rather than quantity. So you either agree it's \"bug-ridden\" or not (i.e. the number and seriousness of bugs in it is negligible by whatever standards). And I think even \"slow\" can be discussed in the same manner, the actual speed is quantitative, of course, but in the end one either argues that this speed is \"slow\" or isn't. So, given some rhetoric skills of your opponent it's at least possible for that statement to be proven false, if he convinces you the implementation actually isn't slow nor bug-ridden, or at least if there's no Lisp-implementation indeed. But what is \"sufficiently\" complicated? Now it's a silly statement that just doesn't pass Popper criterion: even if nobody dares to deny your program is complicated, one can always say it isn't sufficiently complicated, hence the fact it doesn't contain Lisp-interpreter disproves nothing. A man of culture wouldn't use such definitions. reply samatman 3 hours agorootparentA man of culture would never refer to an epigram as a definition. reply devjab 13 hours agorootparentprevIsn’t that sort of the point? It makes the argument impossible to dispute. If it’s not slow or big-ridden, then it’s just not sufficiently complicated. Which you’re correct to call out. I think what makes it work is that Common Lisp very quickly becomes a faster way to do things because of how insanely efficient it is. reply eyelidlessness 20 hours agorootparentprevThe rule defines it tautologically. Which is sufficiently unambiguous for its purpose! reply throw-the-towel 18 hours agorootparentGreenspun's tenth rule, corollary: Any sufficiently precise definition of \"complex system\" contains an ad hoc, informal, bug-ridden, slow specification of half of Common Lisp. reply orwin 9 hours agorootparentprevMy experience is: once you have enough different FSM and reducers that you need to abstract them, the 'sufficiently complicated' criterion is made. reply celeritascelery 17 hours agoprevI tried doing something similar to this once. I ran into an issue where I couldn’t define symbols with a dash in them (DEFINE MY-FN…). This is because rust will split the tokens on a dash. It was a small thing, but it meant I couldn’t just copy and paste snippets from a real lisp, I had to transform everything to underscore. Is it the same in your implementation? reply quasigloam 17 hours agoparentYes, at the moment I just assume that all atoms are rust idents because that makes it easier to implement (I can just match against $x:ident), so it doesn't support dashes in atoms. I guess you could match against `$x:ident $(- $y:ident)*` instead? That should work I think, I'd have to change some details in some of the arms but it seems like that would be possible. reply throwup238 15 hours agorootparentWouldn’t that match “(foo - bar)” as well as “(foo-bar)”? I don’t think you can get around token whitespace in macro_rules reply quasigloam 15 hours agorootparentYes it would match both, this would require us to assume that \"foo - bar\" can only be an atom. It's not a great solution. reply celeritascelery 12 hours agorootparentprevIt would, but lisp has prefix operators, so you wouldn’t have to worry about it getting confused. reply quasigloam 12 hours agorootparentAlthough in a Lisp such as Scheme, you could pass around the negation operator in something like (map - '(1 2 3)), so it would be a valid concern that it might clash. reply tmtvl 8 hours agorootparentThe problem with that is that there are spaces between map, -, and '(1 2 3). The only way to get spaces into a name is by using vertical bars: (defvar |do i 10| 1.100) reply anothername12 15 hours agorootparentprevDoes Rust have something like a reader macro where you can have arbitrary syntax for a bit? reply throwup238 15 hours agorootparentIt's almost but not quite arbitrary. It still has to be a valid Rust token stream with matching braces/parens. Since it's whitespace insensitive with respect to tokens and \"-\" is its own token, \"(foo-bar)\" and \"(foo - bar)\" result in the same token stream minus the span information. You can use proc_macro::Span.line()/column() [1] to track how much whitespace there is between tokens and merge them, but the macro will have to rename them to valid Rust identities (\"foo-bar\" to \"foo_bar\") and make sure there's no collisions. [1] https://doc.rust-lang.org/proc_macro/struct.Span.html#method... reply zozbot234 11 hours agoparentprev> I ran into an issue where I couldn’t define symbols with a dash in them I'm not seeing any issue? (DEFINE MYᜭFN...) works just fine. reply gleenn 21 hours agoprevI wish there was a well-supported Lisp in Rust, not just the macros. I wonder how much memory safety you would retain or lose being based in Rust. Is it even possible to leverage the borrow checker any any sane way? reply dokyun 18 hours agoparentSome Lisp compilers like SBCL are already capable of more extensive compile-time type-checking, but its information that the programmer is up to supply, and tends to be the part of the optimization stage rather than normal, incremental development. Lisp is usually defined by its dynamic nature, and run-time type checking is a big part of this. Making the programmer have to worry about how objects are managed before the fact would conflict with the freedom and expressibility one would expect from such a system. It also makes the compilers themselves simpler in comparison: Normal code without any extra declarations is safe by default, some systems might ignore such declarations for always being 'safe' (say if you're on a bytecode VM like CLISP or a Lisp machine that does hardware type-checking). SBCL compiles code quite quickly--so I've heard others tend to be even faster; the Rust compiler on the other hand is more likely to introduce a young programmer to the concept of thrashing. I really see them as two mutually incompatible worlds although they may not seem to be at first glance. One thing to remember is that Lisp is essentially the flagship \"The Right Thing\" language, while C is the \"Worse is Better\" language. Rust is neither, it is something entirely different which I think is overdue for a name, perhaps something that reflects the losing characteristics of both philosophies. (This isn't to discredit the OP article: it's still a cool hack!) reply wild_egg 14 hours agorootparent> perhaps something that reflects the losing characteristics of both philosophies. Oof. With how much love Rust gets here, I didn't expect to see it being called out like that. How about \"The Worse Thing\"? reply BoingBoomTschak 10 hours agorootparentprev> Some Lisp compilers like SBCL are already capable of more extensive compile-time type-checking, but its information that the programmer is up to supply Which is nice and all, but very much gimped by the glaring holes in CL's typing tooling: you can't create actual types, only derived types (deftype) and struct/class types. The two consequences of that is that you can't type cons-based lists/trees (arguably THE Lisp data structure) because deftype can't be recursive and you can't create parametric types, it's an internal thing only used for https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/t_arr...

It never truly was a simple language, but I think it started as something way more manageable than what it has become. reply zxexz 13 hours agoparentRust is definitely not a simple language, I agree there. I am quite likely a bit naïve here, but I'm having trouble understanding why you hate that this is possible. Now, the macro system definitely can generate near infinitely-complex code, but I'm not getting how implementing a sandboxed lisp using macros is a particularly potent example of the language being less manageable than at its genesis. On another note, the fact that the type system is turing-complete, like with C++ templates or the Haskell type system (variously dependent on which GHC languages extensions you're using...), makes me want to see a lisp implemented that way! reply quasigloam 13 hours agorootparentImplementing a lisp in the type system would be fun, that's originally what this project was about until I got distracted with macros. Awesome projects like fortraith (https://github.com/Ashymad/fortraith) already exist, and even far more useful projects like dimensioned (compile time dimensional analysis using type level numbers) are inspiring.

I had fun making it, for such a silly little project it's given me a surprising amount of joy. If you want to look at another cool project that's tangentially related, have a look at Sectorlisp. reply zxexz 11 hours agorootparentOh, I'm very well acquainted with Sectorlisp - I even have a scrappy local package on nixos to build, boot and launch a qemu repl for it locally! Somewhere around here there's an HDD in an X200 that probably still has it in the boot sector on its HDD. I think I objectively suck at lisp, but that doesn't preclude me from being a \"Greenspan enjoyer\" :) I think all of my projects that used Selenium ended up with a haphazardly-pieced-together lisp interpreter as their scripting tool after I realized whatever I was writing was effectively becoming a DSL in a .ini/.yaml/.toml file. These days, I mostly use nix, but my dream is a lispy NixOS (yes, I know of and have used Guix, but I really just want a lispNix 'native' compiler, and to be able to use it with nixpkgs without hassle). reply pkolaczk 12 hours agoparentprev> but I think it started as something way more manageable than what it has become. Hard disagree here. Rust team is continuously making the language easier to work with by removing limitations and making features more orthogonal. A notable example is non lexical lifetimes, impl Trait in return position or async traits. Also they have removed some features eg before it went 1.0, it even had GCed references built in with special syntax. reply rapsey 10 hours agoparentprevThe only real change since 1.0 was async. If you want to live without async that is completely up to you. It is an entirely optional part of the language. If you want a language guided by the principle of simplicity Rust was never that and you have plenty of options elsewhere. reply xedrac 6 hours agorootparentExcept that many crates only provide an async interface. I actually use async for many things, but the whole colored functions thing is really annoying. reply chickdilla 3 hours agorootparentOne trick to get out of this is to wrap any function with an asynchronous interface with pollster::block_on which turns the call back into exactly how it would have run if it had been synchronous (which leads to no color leaking). reply xedrac 1 hour agorootparentYes, easy enough but annoying. Going the other direction (async -> sync) is a bit more problematic though.

    "originBody": "Degrees of deception: How America’s universities became debt factories September 14, 2024 · education, Universities Here’s a puzzle: how do you create a trillion-dollar debt bubble that can’t be popped? Answer: make student loans non-dischargeable in bankruptcy. Now, here’s a trickier one: how do you fix this mess when the solution threatens a multibillion-dollar industry? This isn’t just a theoretical exercise. It’s the reality we’re living in. The U.S. student loan system is a perfect storm of misaligned incentives, regulatory capture, and unintended consequences. The solutions are surprisingly straightforward – make loans dischargeable, tie lending to degree value, hold institutions accountable. But implementing them? That’s where things get complicated. You see, there’s a reason this broken system persists. It’s not just inertia or incompetence. It’s because there are powerful, entrenched interests that profit handsomely from the status quo. They cloak themselves in the noble rhetoric of education, but their actions tell a different story: skyrocketing tuition, subpar outcomes, and a generation drowning in debt. It’s not about enlightenment; it’s about enrichment – theirs, not yours. The Numbers Don’t Lie The results were predictable, if you knew where to look. In 2003, total student loan debt was around $250 billion. Today? It’s over $1.7 trillion. That’s not growth; that’s an explosion. But here’s the real kicker: this debt isn’t just a personal burden. It’s propping up a deeply flawed system. The results are insidious: Millions of Americans graduate from college overloaded with debt and underprepared for the job market. The institutions that create these outcomes are not held to account because market forces are not at play. Colleges have no incentive to control costs or improve outcomes, as they get paid regardless. Lenders keep issuing loans without regard for the borrower’s ability to repay, knowing the debt can’t be discharged. In essence, the non-dischargeability of student loans has created a perfect storm of misaligned incentives. It’s a system that rewards failure and punishes success. Consider these facts: Only 41% of college students graduate within 4 years, yet colleges face no consequences for low completion rates.[1] The average student loan debt for the Class of 2023 is $37,574, but 43% of recent graduates are underemployed in their first job.[2][3] Despite skyrocketing tuition, only 60% of college graduates feel their education was worth the cost.[4] From 1980 to 2020, the cost of college tuition increased by 180%, while the quality of education and job market preparation have not seen comparable improvements.[5] These aren’t just numbers. They’re evidence of a system that’s fundamentally broken. The Institutional Shield But why don’t market forces correct these issues? The answer lies in the unique shield that non-dischargeable student loans provide to educational institutions and lenders. In a normal market, if a product consistently fails to deliver value, consumers stop buying it. Producers either improve or go out of business. But in the world of higher education, this feedback loop is broken. Colleges and universities, shielded by the guarantee of student loan money, have no real incentive to improve their product or direct students to majors that have an ability to pay back their loans. They can raise tuition year after year, even as the value of their degrees stagnates or declines. They can offer degrees with poor job prospects knowing that students will still come—and still be able to borrow. This data by the NY Fed highlights the majors with the worst underemployment, i.e. graduates working in jobs that don’t require a degree. Criminal justice, performing arts and art history have an over 60%+ underemployment rate with performing arts and art history majors being upsold into graduate school piling on even more debt. Meanwhile, lenders—both government and private—keep the money flowing. Why wouldn’t they? With loans that can’t be discharged in bankruptcy, they’re guaranteed a return, even if it takes decades to collect. This perverse system means that the very institutions that should be preparing students for success are instead setting them up for a lifetime of debt. And they’re doing it with impunity. But Wait, There’s More! In a twist that would be comical if it weren’t so cruel, these loans can follow borrowers into retirement, threatening the very safety net meant to protect them. Yes, you read that right. The federal government can and does garnish Social Security benefits to repay defaulted federal student loans.[6] Up to 15% of a person’s Social Security check can be seized, though the government must leave the borrower with at least $750 a month. Let that sink in for a moment. The system is so ruthless in its pursuit of repayment that it’s willing to take money from retirees’ already modest Social Security checks. It’s a stark reminder that in the world of student loans, there’s no such thing as a fresh start. Not even in your golden years. Consider these sobering facts: As of 2015, 114,000 older Americans had their Social Security benefits garnished due to defaulted student loans.[7] The number of Americans aged 60 and older with student loan debt quadrupled from 2005 to 2015.[8] Nearly 40% of federal student loan borrowers aged 65 and older are in default.[9] This isn’t just a young person’s problem anymore. It’s a crisis that spans generations, threatening the financial security of Americans from cradle to grave. The Birth of a Monster The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and the student loan crisis is no exception. It started innocently enough in 1976 with the Education Amendments. The goal? Prevent students from gaming the system by declaring bankruptcy right after graduation. Seems reasonable, right? But then came the creep. Five years of non-dischargeability became seven. Then, in 1998, it became forever. The final nail in the coffin was the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, which extended this rule to private student loans. Suddenly, lenders had a captive market. No matter how bad things got, borrowers couldn’t escape. It was a lender’s dream and a borrower’s nightmare. The Unseen Victims But the damage goes beyond the obvious. Student loan debt is a silent killer of American competitiveness and risk-taking. The reality is we’re churning out millions of graduates with no discernible skills drowning in debt. 4 in 10 per the NY Fed are underemployed working in retail or as baristas making zero use of their criminal justice degrees. Smart graduates laden with debt also can’t afford to take risks. They can’t start businesses. They can’t buy homes. They can’t invest in their futures. They’re too busy paying for their past. And it’s not just individuals who suffer. The entire economy takes a hit. When a significant portion of the population is funneling its income into loan payments rather than spending or investing, it’s a drag on everyone – even those who never set foot in a college classroom. The Entrenched Powers Now, you might be thinking: “This is clearly broken. Why hasn’t it been fixed?” The answer is as old as politics itself: follow the money. The student loan system has created a powerful alliance of interests: Colleges and Universities: They get guaranteed money, regardless of the quality of education they provide. Lenders: They get guaranteed returns, backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Politicians: They get donations from the first two groups, ensuring the status quo remains intact. This unholy trinity has no incentive to change the system. In fact, they have every reason to keep it exactly as it is. The Way Out So, what’s the solution? It’s simple, but not easy: Make student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy again. Tie lending terms to the value of the degree. Impose risk-sharing requirements on educational institutions – Schools would face financial penalties or need to contribute to a risk-sharing pool if their graduates default at high rates. But here’s the rub: implementing these changes would cause a massive shake-up. Colleges would have to rethink their entire financial models. They’d have to rethink the majors they offer, their tuition fees and have to dramatically reduce their administrative bloat. Lenders would face actual risk. Politicians would lose a reliable source of campaign contributions. In other words, the very people who have the power to fix the system are the ones who benefit from keeping it broken. The Fork in the Road We’re at a crossroads. We can continue down this path, creating a permanent debtor class and stifling economic growth. Or we can make the hard choices necessary to create a sustainable, equitable system of higher education. The choice is ours. But make no mistake: the clock is ticking. Every day we delay, another student signs on the dotted line, committing to a lifetime of debt they will likely never escape. —- If you read this far, some related essays you might like: Harvard: The Birkin Bag of Education Your kids grades are bullshit The School of Entrepreneuring The perverse incentives driving America’s government schools Bread, circuses and education The endless ladder Solving the wrong problems Sources [1] National Center for Education Statistics.

Let's say we reformed both higher education and student loans - does that have any meaningful impact on the demand side beyond pushing the salaries of degree holders up (thus increasing the value of a degree, thus...) reply scoofy 1 hour agoparentprevYou forgot the most important part. The people agreeing to these debts, by definition, do not have an education in complex debt instruments that cannot be discharged. Taking our a vast loan to study English literature might seem unwise, but it’s something I could definitely see a starry eyed 17 year old deciding to do. reply jancsika 1 minute agorootparent> The people agreeing to these debts, by definition, do not have an education in complex debt instruments that cannot be discharged. I guarantee you that law/med school students have an education in \"complex debt instruments that cannot be discharged.\" Because before the current law was passed, they were the ones abusing the old \"complex debt instruments\" to discharge debt they knew they'd be able to pay back once they started making bank. The law was passed because they were doing this in large numbers. For these serious med/law students, the old system was free money. The new system is a reasonable risk. Did you know this? If so, why did you write \"by definition?\" And why go off on a tangent about English literature students? reply NemoNobody 15 minutes agorootparentprevExactly - 12 years of education to get children ready to be citizens and not single class on how to manage a bank account, or even the most basic education about investments or actual wealth building. Instead, all I was told was to go to college. So... the people that made me woefully sheep like and \"financially innocent\" then sent me to the wolves because they believed in me. Seriously, they made huge changes to the way people were accepted into college - created High School \"career counseling\" (college/University recruiters) to tell everyone kid they were smart enough to go, and the dumber down tests convinced enough to convince the rest. The loans went up each year - the costs more than doubled between my Freshman and Sophomore year and just never stopped going up - the more you owe the more you HAVE to finish to get the job to pay the loans. Before all this, when less than 1% of all student loans had been defaulted on, the loan debt was made unforgivable by 6 people - a committee of bankers created by the people in Congress they bought. It was setup so that of a millennial \"Wins\" it means they can afford to pay their loans - so the bank wins. If we lose we still have to pay/often must pay more with all the fees and added interest - bank still wins. During the time I lived thru all this I was reading shit about how lazy all f are bc we don't own as many houses as we are supposed at our age - this is still true to this day actually. This is an intolerable and disgusting thing for a society to do to an entire generation - any group is wrong but to plan out the demise of a generation of, at the time all this was first set in motion, we were literal Elementary Students. These loans destroyed lives, relationships, sets parents against their children, divided families. - All just part of the plan. reply paulcole 49 minutes agorootparentprevI took out around $20k in loans to study literature starting in 2001. Graduated in 2005. Rent was $150 a month. Played a lot of poker and disc golf. Studied and learned a bit. Had a 75% scholarship to help with tuition. Had a $300/semester book stipend as part of that and just bought penny books off Amazon (one of the benefits of an English degree) and pocketed the difference. Basically for 5-8% or so of my (estimated) lifetime I was completely free to goof around. Great value for someone who dislikes working. Consolidated the loans after I graduated at 1.5% interest. Finished paying them off in 2021 with the Biden Bucks. Pretty sure that kind of deal doesn’t exist anymore. reply airstrike 28 minutes agorootparent> Had a 75% scholarship to help with tuition. reply paulcole 9 minutes agorootparentState school was hella cheap (it was back when Florida’s lotto money mostly went to scholarships for in-state students). I think full sticker price would’ve been around $2500/year for tuition+fees at the time? I also started with enough credits to be nearly to (the equivalent of being in) junior year and took the bare minimum credits to keep the scholarship. reply Avicebron 47 minutes agorootparentprevI'm trying to figure out if you missed a 0 at the end of your rent... reply giantg2 4 minutes agorootparentI remember rent was $1800 per semester for my friends, and they split that 3 ways. So about $600 for 4 months, or $150/month. To be fair, it was a bit of a dump. But that's less you have to worry about when having parties. I had a slightly nicer single room and closer to campus with parking and it was $1200 per semester, or $300 month. This was slightly over a decade ago. I was curious and did a quick check - seems the single rooms are about $600/mo and I saw a 3 bed for $800/mo. Still really cheap considering all the inflation that happened over the past decade. reply gfs 34 minutes agorootparentprevI don't think $150 is out of the question over twenty years ago with roommates and a LCOL region. reply sevensor 33 minutes agorootparentprevBig state U is in the middle of nowhere, and in those years I was paying closer to $250, but I could see if you were willing to compromise on quality or quantity of personal space, getting that down to $150 without even hitting bottom. reply paulcole 36 minutes agorootparentprevLol no it was $150. This was Gainesville, Florida and I split a horrible studio apartment with a friend of mine. It was located in a low lying area and once after a tropical storm we had to wade through hip-deep water to get to class (the apartment itself was miraculously high and dry). Coming home one night I saw a little gator swimming along near me as I trudged through it. After we graduated my roommate moved to Manhattan for an engineering job. His month’s rent up there was significantly more than he paid for a year in college. I ended up moving to Portland, Oregon in 2007 and my first rent here was $550. Now in 2024, I’ve finally tacked on that missing 0 and my rent is now around $1500. reply grecy 34 minutes agorootparentprevWoah, you were paying off that debt with interest from 2005 to 2021? Damn I’m happy to live in a country with free university. reply paulcole 29 minutes agorootparent1.5% interest is well under the rate of return I got in the market over that period. I was making minimum payments the whole time. The payments were tiered somehow. I think I was paying around $50 a month when I graduated and that ended up at like $140 by the time I paid it off. reply bufferoverflow 1 hour agoparentprevI would also add 5) Don't educate young people on what their degree would earn them. So many young people think their hobby can become their career and pay for a nice life style. Unfortunately, it's not the case for many majors. reply kraussvonespy 52 minutes agorootparentWhich is bad too because if you turn your hobby into your career, you end up not having a hobby anymore. In order to have a happy life, you have to have a vocation and an avocation that are separate from each other. reply brigadier132 44 minutes agoparentprevIn your 4 step process where do you blame the not for profit schools for raising tuition by completely absurd and unsustainable amounts? If we are going to forgive student loans, tax payers should not be on the hook. The loan originators and most importantly the schools should pay since they are both the primary beneficiaries of this disastrous policy. reply JoBrad 31 minutes agorootparentThe cost of student loans is nothing compared to the value that those degree holders will provide. In my opinion, your first degree at a public university or community college should be paid for by the Federal government as long as you keep a certain grade average, and stick to a reasonable timeline. If it matters to anyone, I paid off my loans entirely, but also received Pell grants. reply brigadier132 5 minutes agorootparentIf your opinion were correct the degrees would pay for themselves and we wouldn't be having these discussions. We have people paying $160k a year to study in fields that are increasingly having their fundamental research completely debunked and exposed as fraudulent (see Political Science and Pyschology). There is also absolutely 0 reason these degrees should cost so much. If we want to keep a guaranteed student loan program it should be restricted in the amount that can be borrowed and it should only be usable at local community colleges that cost under $5k a year. Nothing about education necessitates spending more than that. reply spencerchubb 48 minutes agoparentprevUnless I missed it in the article, I don't think the author mentioned one of the biggest factors. The big lenders in America are effectively extensions of the US government, and the government guarantees over 90% of loans. That means there is no risk (for the lender) to give out student loans. The taxpayers take on the risk reply skrebbel 54 minutes agoparentprevI don't like this type of comment because it's makes it seem like that this was all planned like this on purpose (by some cabal of evil schemers, I suppose?), but without the need to provide any evidence that that's indeed how it went, because nothing of the kind of is explicitly claimed. Things can go wrong without people scheming to do evil. It's not helpful to twist \"these and these circumstances combined to produce a bad outcome\" into a plan description unless you bring at least some evidence that it was, in fact, planned to go like that. reply freshtake 1 hour agoparentprev5) Do nothing about the problem until the debt becomes too large, then attempt to blanket cancel the debt without expecting any fallout. All the while doing nothing to fix the underlying issues. reply api 20 minutes agoparentprevYou forgot: 5) Systematically under-build housing so that future generations will be unable to simultaneously repay these loans and afford a place to live. reply cruffle_duffle 1 hour agoparentprevI mean for fucks sake we were pushing 18 year old teenagers into tens of thousands of dollars of debt! I dunno about most people but at 18 I had absolutely no clue about anything, especially the concept of money nor career. How the fuck does an 18 year old comprehend why taking $60,000 to get a degree in “Latin Dance” is not a good idea (and we all know many people who fall into this bucket too!). And yet parents, councilors, teachers, and “the whole system” pushed this onto every kid in high school. And then society turns around and mocks them later on for being “stupid” and “lazy” or whatever… fuck that shit. Society strongly told kids that college, any college, was the only way to have a future. reply lispisok 50 minutes agorootparentYou are being downvoted but that was exactly my experience. It wasnt hyperbole. I was told my entire time in k-12 you need to get a college degree by everybody. Parents, teachers, counselors. Additionally they said, with no exaggeration, to get any degree, at any school, and take out as many loans as you need. So yes an entire generation of kids were told the $60,000 in debt for a latin dance degree at a no-name school was better than no degree at all. reply advael 2 hours agoprevWe should be way more willing to straight up kill multi-billion dollar industries. Without that willingness, most modern problems are impossible for governments to solve, and such industries and even their potential competitors are incentivised mostly to exacerbate the problem. I love a good market as much as anyone but there really are problems markets will never solve reply mchusma 1 hour agoparentBut…the whole point is that it is NOT a market. If student debt is dischargeable and the government guarantee is removed or dramatically reduced, pretty much all problems are “solved”. Universities will have to start focusing on ROI. Universities that provide a poor ROI will shut down. Universities will need to reduce costs for traditional coursework, cut courses with poor returns, add courses with higher returns. The inflation in higher education that has run rampant due to subsidized demand being removed. reply tway_GdBRwW 1 hour agorootparent> Universities will have to start focusing on ROI. In Europe, they have a simpler system. Education is paid for from taxes. If a student does well, they pay for it via taxes. If they don't, then they aren't crippled by debt. The problem with the ROI approach is it still places too much burden on the student, and, well, life happens. Say you major in comp sci (or some other high-paying field) but shortly after graduation something happens which prevents you from working in the field. Sucks to be you. And likewise it sets up universities to, as you say, \"cut courses with poor returns.\" Like for example \"teaching\", because school teacher pay is crap, so it has a poor ROI. reply gruez 1 hour agorootparent>In Europe, they have a simpler system. Education is paid for from taxes. If a student does well, they pay for it via taxes. If they don't, then they aren't crippled by debt.

Sounds like the solution is to raise teacher pay, which would also have the added benefit of retaining teachers after they graduate. Giving teachers cheap training but paying them poorly seems worse than the status quo because you end up shoveling money into training teachers that'd end up dropping out anyways. reply crazygringo 1 hour agorootparent> That's all well and good for the student, but what about for taxpayers/governments who's funding that education? We can say the same thing about K-12 education -- it's just something we choose to fund collectively, because that's the kind of society we want to be. But also, progressive taxation means that the rich fund it more than the poor. So the general idea is that if law school and medical school are expensive to provide but result in vastly higher salaries, then it gets paid for in the end out of those lawyers' and doctors' taxes. Not the taxes from average Americans. reply gruez 48 minutes agorootparent>We can say the same thing about K-12 education -- it's just something we choose to fund collectively, because that's the kind of society we want to be. But in K-12 education, the taxpayer/state has strong control over what's taught. In the last few years there's some latitude by the students, but nothing close the panoply of programs offered by universities. If education is state funded, but only for programs with proven ROI (eg. STEM), I'd be fine with that. reply oldprogrammer2 57 minutes agorootparentprevBut it’s not the same as K-12.

That’s part of the problem, in fact. Since the loan to the college is always paid for by the government, the college is effectively handed a blank check. Said check, now filled in with an arbitrarily high amount, is handed to the student as a bill to pay back to the government.

Incentives on taxpayers thereafter who want to minimize their tax burden would therefore be optimizing primarily toward cheapness of the educational process, rather than efficacy and quality of the education which outbound students received.

The idea of the public university is to bring a traditionally aristocratic practice - the devotion of several years of one’s young life to not-necessarily-practical intellectual pursuits - to the middle class. I think our civilization would lose something worthwhile by returning this practice to the exclusive domain of rich families. Much the same as if we sold off all our public parks for development. The issue is that we have democratized not only the class background part but also the “intellectual pursuits” part. College should be a lot more selective and a lot more rigorous; only a small minority of students have any business attending.

Universities used to be expensive schools for rich people's failsons to \"find themselves\". That's why there's a lot of focus on \"well-rounded\" educations even today. Then western governments started offering taxpayer-funded tuition, which resulted in a new wave of educated kids who refused to believe government narratives regarding wars and refused to comply with conscription and drafts. This came to a head during the Vietnam War, where the US found that it's usual ability to start wars against labor in other countries had been stymied by them educating the enemy (their own workers). While the draft has been relegated to a vestigial function in the US today, the people in power were able to shut the people down. Saudi Arabia, a theocratic dictatorship that belongs in the 10th century, not the 20th, did the American ruling class a solid by embargoing the US and shutting down our economy for a decade. This gave cover for the complete overturning of Progressive Era policies. Most importantly for this subject, public state universities were stripped of their government funding. Instead, they would charge ever-increasing tuition which students would pay for with loans. This ensured that the poor could not access education and that the educated middle class would be in permanent debt slavery. Public universities went along with this because they were promised more money than they could get from public funding. This is why you see massive amounts of money being wasted by universities on bullshit. The ruling class gave universities a seat at the table of lavish excess in exchange for, y'know, letting the cops shoot their students with rubber bullets any time they get antsy. Your student debt is a bribe from the military-industrial complex to the university system that you pay for. However, this gambit did not fully succeed. For one, students are still protesting, despite the debt noose around their necks, and university officials' best efforts to rubber-bullet their students into compliance. So there's a lot of politicians who want to get rid of university education altogether and replace it with trade schools. I may have harshed the concept of a \"well-rounded\" education before, but it does mean universities still have to teach things like history and economics, which is the sort of thing that makes the lower classes resist their social programming. So a lot of people in power want to get rid of universities and replace them with trade schools. Now, I actually don't have a problem with trade schools; a lot of good paying jobs are going undone because they don't confer the kinds of status middle-class families want. But there's a lot of right-wingers who want kids in trade schools solely because trade schools generally do not teach all the problematic subjects and forbidden knowledge (aka \"traditional coursework\") that makes tools of society start asking questions. If you want an actual way to fix universities (without just turning them into trade schools): - Have a ONE TIME student debt forgiveness event, contingent on shutting down the student loan system, so this shit doesn't happen twice. - Restore public university funding sufficient to allow tuition-free education for all poor and middle class students. - Purge the university administrative class, they've grown overbloated and turned universities into their own personal hedge funds. Once this is done, then we can start talking about what classes and degrees actually have good ROI on the public money the universities will be getting again. The thing is, though, the existing \"low ROI\" degrees mainly existed so the university administrative class could pump up admissions numbers. Remember, that was part of the deal they made with the devil. Taking away the student loan system means there's less incentive to admit students to prop up numbers, but if that becomes an issue again, we can further require minimum standards for students or courses through the university funding mechanism. reply davidgay 2 minutes agorootparent> Universities used to be expensive schools for rich people's failsons to \"find themselves\".

It also goes for housing, hospitals, banks, ISPs and so on; 2. Nationalize failing industries rather than providing them loans for no reason. Banks fail in 2008? Well, you belong to the state now.

If 10% top graders go to college from school as it was in the boomers' era, ROI of higher education will be enormous (as there won't be an oversupply of useless graduates), and costs will be low (as low demand always reduces prices). We shouldn't punish people who take the money because people are willing to pay it. Who's fault it is that they are dumb?

Specifically, the government made it so college loans can't be discharged in bankruptcy, and backs many student loans.

For God's sake, it will even kill custom software development which most people sitting here, do for a living - because it is the same exact thing - vast majority of clients never get what they want and even if they did they won't be able to make the money on the useless \"products\" they invented, because this is nothing but a systematic delusion that's moving them. Almost all of them see themselves as genius inventors of the next world-changing thing but they are in fact random nobodies who raised cash from other random nobodies, to waste it on something that makes their contractors laugh so badly they even refrain from doing video calls.

I don't think universities provide much value at all to the common student who is not going to be a PhD. I went to a very well-known institution known for putting the students in a room with the professors, maybe two or three students, to one professor. My economics professor taught me one on one. I still think, in the end, the work is mostly done alone, in a pile of books, on your own time. Not with other students, and not in lectures, and not in tutorials. This is a bit different from school where you can actually learn the material in class because, let's face it, school doesn't have a very deep curriculum. So at university my impression is that they mainly tell you what to go and read about, and then you read about it yourself. The tutor is there to course correct you a bit, but they aren't going to do much other than save you a bit of time learning the orthodoxy of your subject. The lectures are a table of contents. At most, it's really just a guy telling you that you should know what an eigenvalue is, or you should have read about the ISLM model, and so on. For you to actually understand something, well, you have to have spent a lot of time in the books rearranging your mind. Given that this is what you actually do at university, why have it this way? Make an examination authority. \"Here is the national linear algebra test. Anyone who wants to try it, sign up, and come to this hall on this date.\" Everyone who passes, whether they studied at home or went to fancy U, gets a paper that says they passed it. Do it as a 12 year old prodigy or a 75 year old grandma, you get a diploma. Now, maybe there is already an authority that does this, I don't know. But it isn't very well known or authoritative. The current incumbents are gatekeepers. Everybody thinks that smart kids go to the most prestigious universities, and that includes employers. It's a Schelling point that doesn't need to be there, and it allows the universities to extract a great deal of value from the kids. If you made this authority of examinations, many people could learn the material and show their competence without incurring huge costs. People could start working earlier.

In general I read what they say as solely relating to what I'd categorize as \"undergrad or non-specialized track students\". I agree with you there is a lot universities have to offer students though. Your examples of equipment are a great highlight. On the other hand I think when you weight the ever growing cost of attendance with the amount of unique values provided it has been shrinking quite a bit, in favor of the \"not providing much value\" side. This is especially true for the relative lack of unique values brought for the vast majority of students during the first ~2 years of general education. It's difficult or impossible to get many of these organizations to let you just jump in at that point though. Overall I think, for many at least, the biggest value is an environment which helps guide them to doing the self learning. Many (most?) can't just sit down to write and then follow their own multi year study plan and end up with something comparable to what they'd get out of going to a university, even if they end up spending the majority of their time there self learning.

If you can drop 90% of administrators and real estate by moving online, student loans become a thing of the past. College becomes a halfway house commune for young people to who want to leave their parents nest. So the way you fix a broken system is to replace it with something cheaper and better. The issue of course is that 99% of people who start online courses don't finish them. Universities provide motivation for learning, which is required for many learners. reply andreyk 1 hour agoprevSeems like a good overview, but I do find this bit unclear: \"But why don’t market forces correct these issues? The answer lies in the unique shield that non-dischargeable student loans provide to educational institutions and lenders. In a normal market, if a product consistently fails to deliver value, consumers stop buying it. Producers either improve or go out of business. But in the world of higher education, this feedback loop is broken. Colleges and universities, shielded by the guarantee of student loan money, have no real incentive to improve their product or direct students to majors that have an ability to pay back their loans. They can raise tuition year after year, even as the value of their degrees stagnates or declines. \" Sure, colleges can charge a lot due to loans, but they are still competing with each other and differences in tuition could make a big difference. I went to Georgia Tech over other universities because it was in-state and Georgia has generous scholarships for students with good grades. So why does competition among schools not lower costs? reply tway_GdBRwW 1 hour agoparent> But why don’t market forces correct these issues? Another theory: The value creation is not linked to the value capture. So market forces make a bad feedback loop. Look, I'm totally pro business, but business is only \"good\" at allocating capital when value capture and creation are linked. Education isn't like that. The closest we have are the bootcamp schools, where they take a cut out of your first 2 year's salary if you find a job or nothing if you don't. When capture/creation are not linked, you need a different social organization method. \"Government\" or \"Religion/non-profit\" come to mind. Perhaps others have additional suggestions. reply MarketingJason 1 hour agorootparentI ran a coding bootcamp school that had both your typical pay-upfront and later added an option like you outline. I can't speak for all programs, but schools use an affiliate third party lender for those \"free\" loan programs. It was relatively new for us when I left, so I never saw the aftermath. I know it worked out well for some students, but my biggest concern was ensuring payments only kicked in if the job was \"in-industry or field\". My logic was the value isn't there if you go to a coding bootcamp only to not use the skills. I was still worried they'd basically ask \"do you use a computer?\" and consider it in-field. Another issue here is we had folks just looking to up-skill and the value return was harder to gauge if they were returning or continuing to work their job. This was mostly limited to our part-time program so we didn't offer the delayed-loan for it. reply imtringued 44 minutes agorootparentprevThe fundamental problem in job education is that it needs to be linked to the needs of future employers, but those employers do not have an incentive to hire workers and train them, thereby aligning the education program with the needs of the employers. Employers do not want to pay for training, because employees can leave at any point, so they decided to let employees go to university and pay for their own education. This then leads to a misalignment between what people elect to receive an education in and what employers want, because people aren't mind readers and know exactly what will make their boss five years into the future happy. So what happens instead is that higher education becomes purely about standardising worker skills, so that each worker is a replaceable cog according to their degree. This means you can just hire X amount of Y degree holders instead of caring about their individual skills. reply agosz 29 minutes agoparentprev> I went to Georgia Tech over other universities because it was in-state and Georgia has generous scholarships for students with good grades. So why does competition among schools not lower costs? All the schools have access to loans that are guaranteed to be repaid. We still have the mindset that degrees are required for employment (I'm not commenting on whether that's good or bad; that's just the current cultural mindset). Because of this, schools have no incentives to control costs. The students will go regardless because they have access to money that will pay for the tuition, no matter how much it costs. There's no penalty for the universities to raise costs because they will get students anyways. reply hinkley 49 minutes agoparentprevAlso people get their first loan when they’ve just been legally considered adults.

If the time is limited and one only need to pay a % over a threshold pay, the uni has some skin in the game and can lose on the gamble.

Entry required good grades but tuition was free and there was a reasonable grant to live on. Twenty or so years ago the grant became a loan and, more recently, tuition fees were introduced. Nowadays way more people go to uni but come out saddled with debt.

I would like to see the author back this up with more considerations. Bankruptcy disappears from all credit reports after seven years. The average age of first time home buyers is 35. So if a new grad’s credit is trashed from the age of 23-30, it makes no difference to them - they are not planning on using credit for anything substantial anyways. What is going to stop every single student from declaring bankruptcy immediately after graduation? reply mezzie2 22 minutes agoparentI feel like allowing bankruptcy in certain situations would make sense. For example, I took out undergraduate and graduate loans to train for a career that, due to a freak health event (I got MS) in my last semester of grad school, I couldn't actually do. Currently, the disability discharge works in a way where if you can do any work at all you're on the hook for the full amount. So someone who went to school to become an actuary/doctor/lawyer/etc, suffered a severe head injury and afterwards can only work a retail or fast food job is still on the hook for all their loans and has to pay them off on poverty wages. Another case is people for whom the economic landscape changed so drastically so quickly that the decisions they made when entering school might not be relevant when they leave school. Think people who started undergrad in 2005/2006/2007 - they might have made perfectly reasonable decisions about what college to go to and how much debt to take out based on expected future return, and then that return tanked while they were in school + there were several years of scraping by during which interest accumulated due to no fault of their own. reply hypeatei 52 minutes agoparentprev> What is going to stop every single student from declaring bankruptcy immediately after graduation?

Universities give students a ton of control over their education. Where do you live, what classes do you take, when can you unenroll, etc. Want higher graduation rates without lowering the grading bar? Simple, do not permit part time enrollment, even for one term. Sounds harsh. Want better job prospects on graduation? Simple, kill off 90% of majors (dance, sociology, etc.) The reality is that people generally think of college was a guarantee of success (it isn't). Many people would do better going to trade schools. Attending an elite university will always be expensive (in HCOL cities, high demand for students and professors, etc.) We need to stop treating college like a basic right, or a place for people to chase their dreams.

Loans are supposed to be inherently risky to the bank issuing the loan. Managing that risk is their business, and the reward for doing it right is the interest payments. I remember people back then talking about \"if the loans are non-dischargeable, then the bank is pretty much guaranteed it's money back, making it a no risk proposition to them. What's stopping them from becoming student loan mills? What's stopping colleges from asking for more and more money if the banks just lend it no risk?\" These ideas were out there, but get drowned out by the voices of the big pocket companies that are proposing the legislation.

There are various ways to protect against this, easiest being to just limit the top volume.

Whenever my colleague and I stand up (or also sit down?) on the desk, his Dell monitor would turn black for a few seconds. I don't remember the specifics, but I think it was mostly just the two of us, when other people say down if was fine. Even if he's sitting on a different table, the moment I sit down his screen would blank for a few seconds then continue to work normally. I also get electrocuted easily when I use the escalator.

Unfortunately, the story is a complete myth. > You can calculate what the resonant frequency of the bridge would be, and there was nothing driving at that frequency.

That of a combined aeroelastic system not simply mechanical inertial-elastic. reply WalterBright 18 hours agoparentprevAt Boeing, I worked on proving the elevators would not flutter. It wasn't about a driving force being at the resonant frequency. It was about the interaction of spring rate of the system and the force pushing on it. The same thing happens if you stretch a rubber band in front of your lips and blow on it. Increasing the stretch will increase the frequency. Musical wind instruments work the same way. P.S. the elevators did not flutter in flight test or in service. Phew! reply colechristensen 19 hours agoparentprevThis is a pretty... dubious refutation. The wind excited a vibrational mode of the bridge which caused it to kind of fail and when parts started breaking more modes were activated and it fell apart. It's being sold as this gotcha! it's a myth! it wasn't _really_ resonant frequency! And like... I studied aerospace structures... sure \"flutter\" is a bit of a better explanation, but saying \"resonance\" is a myth is a bit silly. Complex structures have lots of vibration modes. The first fundamental frequency can be picked usually and called _THE Resonance Frequency_ or whatever, but it's not like something anybody really places that much emphasis on being the boss in charge of all the vibration. Myth != terminology nitpick in a layman's explanation But you get a lot of layman going around correcting people and calling things myths. It's like Internet people arguing about \"just a theory\", nobody who actually does science really cares at all about the precise meaning of the word \"theory\". reply WalterBright 18 hours agorootparentThe movie of the galloping bridge looked like resonant frequency to me. Back at Caltech, the dorm halls had poured concrete walls. Naturally, some students got a signal generator, a power amplifier, some speakers, and installed the speakers at the node of one of the halls (the halfway point). Then turned it on, and tuned the frequency until it matched the resonant frequency of the hall. The energy in the halls quickly built up until the entire building was going whomp whomp whomp. Except that the frequency was too low to hear. You just got a feeling that something was very very wrong. Residences would come out of their rooms wondering what the heck was going on. A fine prank! Of course, that was exciting the resonant response with a driving resonance frequency, which is not what happened at the Tacoma Narrows bridge, which had a different way of exciting it as already explained. reply ryandrake 20 hours agoprevMy first thought was that filtering a set of frequencies out from the laptop's sound output doesn't seem to be a good solution that addresses the root cause. This only corrects it for those laptops running that OS software, and does it at the cost of reducing the quality of the device's audio for all applications. What about other laptops playing the song, or just living room speakers playing it? What if I, as a user of the laptop, was doing audio processing and needed the sound card to faithfully output frequencies that I commanded it to play? But there's a follow-up article that addresses all of that: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20220920-00/?p=10... TLDR is it's cheaper to throw your audio quality under the bus than to recall the defective laptops/drives and replace them with a design that works. :( reply avianlyric 19 hours agoparentYou’re making the assumption the tweaks to the audio subsystem made a material change to the quality of the audio output. It’s not like laptop speakers are very good to start with, or like laptop sound cards ever faithfully reproduce the sound they’re asked too. Getting good audio out of a laptops speaker in 20% hardware and 80% audio filtering anyway. No laptop speaker (even Macs[1]) sounds good without significant processing to workaround the physical limitations of tiny speakers mounted in a non-ideal chassis. As for other speakers, sound pressure drops off following the cube law. So a speaker millimetres away from the hard drives which have substantially greater impact than speakers outside of the laptop. Of course if you crank the volume enough it’ll eventually cause an issue, but given there doesn’t seem to be widespread reporting of this issue, it looks like that wasn’t too much of an issue.

    "originBody": "Home ARC-AGI Leaderboard ARC Prize 2024 Technical Guide ARC-AGI-Pub Play Blog AGI progress has stalled. New ideas are needed. Presented by Home ARC-AGI Leaderboard ARC Prize 2024 Technical Guide ARC-AGI-Pub Play Blog Sign up Sign up By Mike Knoop Published 13 Sep 2024 OpenAI o1 Results on ARC-AGI-Pub ARC Prize testing and notes on OpenAI's new o1 model Over the past 24 hours, we got access to OpenAI's newly released o1-preview and o1-mini models specially trained to emulate reasoning. These models are given extra time to generate and refine reasoning tokens before giving a final answer. Hundreds of people have asked how o1 stacks up on ARC Prize. So we put it to test using the same baseline testing harness we've used to assess Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Gemini 1.5. Here are the results: Is o1 a new paradigm towards AGI? Will it scale up? What explains the massive difference between o1's performance on IOI, AIME, and many other impressive benchmark scores compared to only modest scores on ARC-AGI? There's a lot to talk about. Chain-of-Thought o1 fully realizes the \"let's think step by step\" chain-of-thought (CoT) paradigm by applying it at both training time and test time inference. Source: OpenAI \"Learning to Reason with LLMs\". In practice, o1 is significantly less likely to make mistakes when performing tasks where the sequence of intermediate steps is well-represented in the synthetic CoT training data. At training time, OpenAI says they've built a new reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm and a highly data-efficient process that leverages CoT. The implication is that the foundational source of o1 training is still a fixed set of pre-training data. But OpenAI is also able to generate tons of synthetic CoTs that emulate human reasoning to further train the model via RL. An unanswered question is how OpenAI selects which generated CoTs to train on? While we have few details, reward signals for RL were likely achieved using verification (over formal domains like math and code) and human labeling (over informal domains like task breakdown and planning.) At inference time, OpenAI says they're using RL to enable o1 to hone its CoT and refine the strategies it uses. We can speculate the reward signal here is some kind of actor + critic system similar to ones OpenAI previously published. And that they're applying search or backtracking over the generated reasoning tokens at inference time. Test-Time Compute The most important aspect of o1 is that it shows a working example of applying CoT reasoning search to informal language as opposed to formal languages like math, code, or Lean. While added train-time scaling using CoT is notable, the big new story is test-time scaling. We believe iterated CoT genuinely unlocks greater generalization. Automatic iterative re-prompting enables the model to better adapt to novelty, in a way similar to test-time fine-tuning leveraged by the MindsAI team. If we only do a single inference, we are limited to reapplying memorized programs. But by generating intermediate output CoTs, or programs, for each task, we unlock the ability to compose learned program components, achieving adaptation. This technique is one way to surmount the #1 issue of large language model generalization: the ability to adapt to novelty. Though like test-time fine-tuning it does ultimately remain limited. When AI systems are allowed a variable amount of test-time compute (e.g., the amount of reasoning tokens or the time to search), there is no objective way to report a single benchmark score because it's relative to the allowed compute. That is what this chart shows. More compute means more accuracy. When OpenAI released o1 they could have allowed developers to specify the amount of compute or time allowed to refine CoT at test-time. Instead, they've \"hard coded\" a point along the test-time compute continuum and hid that implementation detail from developers. With varying test-time compute, we can no longer just compare the output between two different AI systems to assess relative intelligence. We need to also compare the compute efficiency. While OpenAI's announcement did not share efficiency numbers, it's exciting we're now entering a period where efficiency will be a focus. Efficiency is critical to the definition of AGI and this is why ARC Prize enforces an efficiency limit on winning solutions. Our prediction: expect to see way more benchmark charts comparing accuracy vs test-time compute going forward. ARC-AGI-Pub Model Baselines OpenAI o1-preview and o1-mini both outperform GPT-4o on the ARC-AGI public evaluation dataset. o1-preview is about on par with Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet in terms of accuracy but takes about 10X longer to achieve similar results to Sonnet. Name Score (public eval) Verification Score (semi-private eval) Avg Time/Task (mins) o1-preview 21.2% 18% 4.2 Claude 3.5 21% 14% 0.3 o1-mini 12.8% 9.5% 3.0 GPT-4o 9% 5% 0.3 Gemini 1.5 8% 4.5% 1.1 To get the baseline model scores on the ARC-AGI-Pub leaderboard, we're using the same baseline prompt we used to test GPT-4o. When we test and report results on pure models like o1, our intention is to get a measurement of base model performance, as much as that is possible, without layering on any optimization. Others may discover better ways to prompt CoT-style models in the future, and we are happy to add those to the leaderboard if verified. o1's performance increase did come with a time cost. It took 70 hours on the 400 public tasks compared to only 30 minutes for GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. You can use our open source Kaggle notebook as a baseline testing harness or starting point for your own approach. The SOTA submission on the public leaderboard is the result of clever techniques in addition to cutting edge models. Maybe you can figure out how to leverage o1 as a foundational component to achieve a higher score in a similar way! Test o1 now Is AGI Here? On this chart, OpenAI shows a log-linear relationship between accuracy and test-time compute on AIME. In other words, with exponentially increasing compute, accuracy goes up linearly. A new question many are asking: how far does this scale? The only conceptual limit to the approach is the decidability of the problem posed to the AI. So long as the search process has an external verifier which does contain the answer, you will see accuracy scale up logarithmically with compute. In fact, the reported results are extremely similar to one of ARC Prize's top approaches by Ryan Greenblatt. He achieved a score of 43% by having GPT-4o generate k=2,048 solution programs per task and deterministically verifying them against the task demonstrations. Then he assessed how accuracy varied for different values of k. Source: Ryan Greenblatt. Ryan found an identical log-linear relationship between accuracy and test-time compute on ARC-AGI. Does all this mean AGI is here if we just scale test-time compute? Not quite. You can see similar exponential scaling curves by looking at any brute force search which is O(x^n). In fact, we know at least 50% of ARC-AGI can be solved via brute force and zero AI. To beat ARC-AGI this way, you'd need to generate over 100 million solution programs per task. Practicality alone rules out O(x^n) search for scaled up AI systems. Moreover, we know this is not how humans beat ARC tasks. Humans do not generate thousands of potential solutions, instead we use the perception network in our brains to \"see\" a handful of potential solutions and deterministically check them with system 2-style thinking. We can get smarter. New Ideas Are Needed Intelligence can be measured by looking at how well a system converts information to action over a space of situations. It's a conversion ratio and thus approaches a limit. Once you have perfect intelligence, the only way to progress is to go collect new information. There are a couple ways a less intelligent system could appear more intelligent without actually being more intelligent. One way is a system that just memorizes the best action. This kind of system would be very brittle, appearing intelligent in one domain, but fall over easily in another. Another way is through trial and error. A system might appear intelligent if it eventually gets the right answer, but not if it needs 100 guesses first. We should expect future test-time compute research to look at how to scale search and refinement more efficiently, perhaps using deep learning to guide the search process. That said, we don't believe this alone explains the big gap between o1's performance on ARC-AGI and other objectively difficult benchmarks like IOI or AIME. A more sufficient way to explain this is that o1 still operates primarily within distribution of its pre-training data, but now inclusive of all the newly generated synthetic CoTs. The additional synthetic CoT data increases focus on the distribution of CoTs as opposed to just the distribution of answers (more compute is spent on how to get the answer vs what is the answer). We expect to see systems like o1 do better on benchmarks that involve reusing well-known emulated reasoning templates (programs) but will still struggle to crack problems that require synthesizing brand new reasoning on the fly. Test-time refinement on CoT can only correct reasoning mistakes so far. This also suggests why o1 is so impressive in certain domains. Test-time refinement on CoT gets an additional boost when the base model is pre-trained in a similar way. Either approach alone would not get you the big leap. In summary, o1 represents a paradigm shift from \"memorize the answers\" to \"memorize the reasoning\" but is not a departure from the broader paradigm of fitting a curve to a distribution in order to boost performance by making everything in-distribution. We still need new ideas for AGI. Take Action Deep CoT integration is an exciting, new direction and there's much more to be discovered. ARC Prize exists to bring this energy to open source so that all can benefit from open AGI in our lifetime. Do you have ideas on how to push these new ideas further?

    "commentBody": "OpenAI o1 Results on ARC-AGI-Pub (arcprize.org)183 points by z7 20 hours agohidepastfavorite100 comments killthebuddha 15 hours agoIn my opinion this blog post is a little bit misleading about the difference between o1 and earlier models. When I first heard about ARC-AGI (a few months ago, I think) I took a few of the ARC tasks and spent a few hours testing all the most powerful models. I was kind of surprised by how completely the models fell on their faces, even with heavy-handed feedback and various prompting techniques. None of the models came close to solving even the easiest puzzles. So today I tried again with o1-preview, and the model solved (probably the easiest) puzzle without any kind of fancy prompting: https://chatgpt.com/share/66e4b209-8d98-8011-a0c7-b354a68fab... Anyways, I'm not trying to make any grand claims about AGI in general, or about ARC-AGI as a benchmark, but I do think that o1 is a leap towards LLM-based solutions to ARC. reply kobe_bryant 14 hours agoparentSo it gives you the wrong answer and then you keep telling it how to fix it until it does? What does fancy prompting look like then, just feeding it the solution piece by piece? reply killthebuddha 14 hours agorootparentBasically yes, but there's a very wide range of how explicit the feedback could be. Here's an example where I tell gpt-4 exactly what the rule is and it still fails: https://chatgpt.com/share/66e514d3-ca0c-8011-8d1e-43234391a0... and an example using gpt-4o: https://chatgpt.com/share/66e515da-a848-8011-987f-71dab56446... I'd share similar examples using claude-3.5-sonnet but I can't figure out how to do it from the claud.ai ui. To be clear, my point is not at all that o1 is so incredibly smart. IMO the ARC-AGI puzzles show very clearly how dumb even the most advanced models are. My point is just that o1 does seem to be noticeably better at solving these problems than previous models. reply rahimnathwani 1 hour agorootparentThe easiest way I know of to share Claude chats is by using this Chrome extension to create a GitHub gist: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claudesave/bmdnfhji...

Which aspects are misleading? How can it be improved? reply killthebuddha 13 hours agorootparentI think the post is great, clear and fair and all that. And I definitely agree with the general point that o1 shows some amount of improvement on generality but with a massive tradeoff on cost. I'm going to think through what I find \"misleading\" as I write this... Ok so I guess it's that I wouldn't be surprised at all if we learn that models can improve a ton w.r.t. human-in-the-loop prompt engineering (e.g. ChatGPT) without a commensurate improvement in programmatic prompt engineering. It's very difficult to get a Python-driven claude-3.5-sonnet agent to solve ARC tasks and it's also very difficult to get claude-3.5-sonnet to solve ARC tasks via the claude.ai UI. The blog post shows that it's also very difficult to get a Python-driven o1-preview agent to solve ARC tasks. From a cursory exploration of o1-preview's capabilities in the ChatGPT UI my intuition is that it's significantly smarter than claude-3.5-sonnet based on how much better it responds to my human-in-the-loop feedback. So I guess my point is that many people will probably come away from the blog post thinking \"there's nothing to see here\", o1-preview is more of the same thing, but it seems to me that it's very clearly qualitatively different than previous models. Aside: This isn't a problem with the blog post at all IMO, we don't need to litter every benchmark post with a million caveats/exceptions/disclaimers/etc. reply wokwokwok 14 hours agorootparentprevI think the parent post is complaining that insufficient acknowledgement is given to how good o1 is, because in their contrived testing, it seems better than previous models. I don’t think that’s true though, it’s hard to be more fair and explicit than: > OpenAI o1-preview and o1-mini both outperform GPT-4o on the ARC-AGI public evaluation dataset. o1-preview is about on par with Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet in terms of accuracy but takes about 10X longer to achieve similar results to Sonnet. Ie. it’s just not that great, and it’s enormously slow. That probably wasn’t what people wanted to hear, even if it is literally what the results show. You cant run away from the numbers: > It took 70 hours on the 400 public tasks compared to only 30 minutes for GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. (Side note: readers may be getting confused about what “test-time scaling” is, and why that’s important. TLDR: more compute is getting better results at inference time. That’s a big deal, because previously, pouring more compute at inference time didn’t seem to make much real difference; but overall I don’t see how anything you’ve said is either inaccurate or misleading) reply mikeknoop 14 hours agorootparentI personally am slightly surprised at o1's modest performance on ARC-AGI given the large leaps in performance on other objectively hard benchmarks like IOI and AIME. Curiosity is the first step towards new ideas. ARC Prize's whole goal is to inspire curiosity like this and to encourage more AI researchers to explore and openly share new approaches towards AGI. reply HeatrayEnjoyer 14 hours agorootparentprevWhat does minutes and hours even mean? Software comparison using absolute time duration is meaningless without a description of the system it was executed on; e.g. SHA256 hashes per second on a Win10 OS and i7-14100 processor. For a product as complex as multiuser TB-sized LLMs, compute time is dependent on everything from the VM software stack to the physical networking and memory caching architecture. CPU/GPU cycles, FLOPs, IOPs, or even joules would be superior measurements. reply achierius 13 hours agorootparentThese are API calls to a remote server. We don't have the option of scaling up or even measuring the compute they use to run them, so for better or worse the server cluster has to be measured as part of their model service offering. reply tsimionescu 8 hours agorootparentprevYou're right about local software comparisons, but this is different. If I'm comparing two SaaS platforms, wall clock time to achieve a similar task is a fair metric to use. The only caveat is if the service offers some kind of tiered performance pricing, like if we were comapring a task performed on an AWS EC2 instance vs Azure VM instance, but that is not the case with these LLMs. So yes, it may be that the wall clock time is not reflective of the performance of the model, but it is reflective of the performance of the SaaS offerings. reply dr_dshiv 9 hours agorootparentprevI mean, “scaling compute at inference” actually means “using an LLM agent system.” Haven’t we known that chains of agents can be useful for a while? reply killthebuddha 13 hours agorootparentprevI agree with basically everything you said but I think you've misunderstood my point.

However, considering how many atoms there are in a cubic foot of meat, this isn't very possible even with current compute. Even trying to solve a PDE with, I don't know, 1e7 factors, is already a hard to crack issue although technically, it is computable.

However, this is still pattern matching, and I suspect that this approach may not be very effective for creating true generalization.

I think if a team is fine-tuning specifically to beat ARC that could be true but when you look at Sonnet and o1 getting 20%, I think a standalone frontier model beating it would mean we are close or already at AGI. reply authorfly 11 hours agorootparentThe creation and iteration of ARC has been designed in part to avoid this. Francis talks in his \"mid-career\" work (2015-2019) about priors for general intelligence and avoiding allowing them. While he admits ARC allows for some priors, it was at the time his best reasonable human effort in 2019 to put together and extremely prior-less training set, as he explained on podcasts around that time (e.g. Lex Fridman). The point of this is that humans, with our priors, are able to reliably get the majority of the puzzles correct, and with time, we can even correct mistakes or recognise mistakes in submissions without feedback (I am expanding on his point a little here based on conference conversations so don't take this as his position or at least his position today). 100 different humans will even get very different items correct/incorrect. The problem with AI getting 21% correct is that, if it always gets the same 21% correct, it means for 79% of prior-less problems, it has no hope as an intelligent system. Humans on the other hand, a group of 10000 could obviously get 99% or 100% correct despite none of them having priors for all of them in all liklihood given humans don't tend to get them all right (and well - because Francis created 100% of them!). The goal of ARC as I understood it in 2019, is not to create a single model that gets a majority correct, to show AGI, it has to be an intelligent system, which can handle prior or priorless situations, as good as a group of humans, on diverse and unseen test sets, ideally without any finetuning or training specifically on this task, at all. From 2019 (I read his paper when it came out believe it or not!), he held a secret set that he alone has that I believe is still unpublished, and at the time the low number of items (hundreds) was designed to prevent effective finetuning(then 'training') but nowadays few shot training shows that it is clearly possible to do on-the-spot training, which is why in talks Francis gave, I remember him positing that any advanced in short term learning via examples should be ignored e.g. each example should be zero shot, which I believe is how most benchmarks are currently done. The puzzles are all \"different in different ways\" besides the common element of dynamic grids and providing multiple grids as input. It's also key to know Francis was quite avant-garde in 2019: his work was ofcourse respected, but he became more prominent recently. He took a very bullish/optimistic position on AI advances at the time (no doubt based on keras and seeing transformers trained using it), but he has been proven right. reply glial 17 hours agorootparentprevIs that mainly because AGI is one of those \"I'll know it when I see it\" things? reply typon 13 hours agorootparentprevI think solving ARC-AGI will be necessary but not sufficient. My bet is that the converse will not be true - a model that will be considered \"AGI\" but does poorly on ARC-AGI. So in that sense, I think this is an important benchmark. reply ithkuil 9 hours agorootparentOne of the key aspects of ARC is that its testing dataset is secret. The usefulness of the ARC challenge is to figure out how much of the \"intelligence\" that current models trained on the entire internet is an emergent property and true generalization or how much it is just due to the fact that the training set truly contains an unfathomable amount of examples and thus the models may surprise us with what appears to be genuine insight but it's actually just lookup + interpolation. reply benreesman 16 hours agoprevThe test you really want is the apples-to-apples comparison between GPT-4o faced with the same CoT and other context annealing that presumably, uh, Q* sorry Strawberry now feeds it (on your dime). This would of course require seeing the tokens you are paying for instead of being threatened with bans for asking about them. Compared to the difficulty in assembling the data and compute and other resources needed to train something like GPT-4-1106 (which are staggering), training an auxiliary model with a relatively straightforward, differentiable, well-behaved loss on a task like \"which CoT framing is better according to human click proxy\" is just not at that same scale. reply Terretta 16 hours agoprevTL;DR (direct quote): “In summary, o1 represents a paradigm shift from \"memorize the answers\" to \"memorize the reasoning\" but is not a departure from the broader paradigm of fitting a curve to a distribution in order to boost performance by making everything in-distribution.” “We still need new ideas for AGI.” reply sashank_1509 15 hours agoparentThis sounds very fair, but I think fundamentally humans memorize reasoning a lot more than you’d expect. A spark of inspiration is not memorized reasoning, but not many people can claim to enjoy that capability. reply ec109685 15 hours agoprevWhy is this considered such a great AGI test? It seems possible to extensively train a model on the algorithms used to solve these cases, and some cases feel beyond what a human could straightforwardly figure out. reply isotypic 14 hours agoparentDo you have some examples of ones you found beyond what a human could straightforwardly figure out? I tried a bunch and they all seemed reasonable, so I would be interested in seeing - I didn't try all 400, for obvious reasons, so I don't doubt there are difficult ones. I think regardless one of the reasons people are interested in it is that is a fairly simple logic puzzle - given some examples, extrapolate a pattern, execute the pattern - that humans achieve high accuracy on (a study linked on the website has ~84% accuracy for humans, some more recent study seems to put it closer to 75%). Yet ML approaches have yet to reach that level, in contrast to other problems ML has been applied to. Given there is a large prize pool for the challenge, I would imagine actually training a model in the way you describe would already have been tried and is more difficult that it seems. reply ec109685 1 hour agorootparentI realize I didn’t scroll to other examples for one I found very hard. I guess the question is whether someone who solves this will have cracked AGI as a necessary precondition or like other Turing tests that have been solved, someone will find a technique that isn’t broadly applicable to general intelligence. reply visarga 14 hours agoparentprevThere is a hidden test set with new puzzle types not seen in the open part. It's designed so that humans do well and AI models have a hard time. reply YeGoblynQueenne 8 hours agorootparent\"Designed\" is not right. What gives \"AI models\" (i.e. deep neural nets) a hard time is that there are very few examples in the public training and evaluation set: each task has three examples. So basically it's not a test of intelligence but a test of sample efficiency. Besides which, it is unfair because it excludes an entire category of systems, not to mention a dominant one. If F. Chollet really believes ARC is a test of intelligence, then why not provide enough examples for deep nets or some other big data approach to be trained effectively? The answer is: because a big data approach would then easily beat the test. But if the test can be beaten without intelligence, just with data, then it's not a test of intelligence. My guess for a long time has been that ARC will fall just like the Winograd Schema challenge (WSC) [1] fell: someone will do the work to generate enough (tens of thousands) examples of ARC-like tasks, then train a deep neural net and go to town. That's what happened with the WSC. A large dataset of Winograd schema sentences was crowd-sourced and a big BERT-era Transformer got around 90% accuracy on the WSC [2]. Bye bye WSC, and any wishful thinking about Winograd schemas requiring human intuition and other undefined stuff. Or, ARC might go the way of the Bongard Problems [3]: the original 100 problems by Bongard still stand unsolved, but the machine learning community has effectively sidestepped them. Someone made a generator of Bongard-like problems [4], and while this was not enough to solve the original problems, everyone simply switched to training CNNs and reporting results on the new dataset [5]. We basically have no idea how to create a test for intelligence that computers cannot beat by brute force or big data approaches so we have no effective way to test computers for (artificial) intelligence. The only thing we know humans can do that computers can't is identify undecidable problems (like Barber Paradoxes i.e. statements of the form \"this sentence is false\", as in Gödel's second incompleteness theorem). Unfortunately we already know there is no computer that can ever do that, and even if we observe say ChatGPT returning the right answer we can be sure it has only memorised, not calculated it, so we're a bit stuck. ARC won't get us unstuck in any way shape or form and so it's just a distraction. _____________________ [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winograd_schema_challenge [2] WinoGrande: An Adversarial Winograd Schema Challenge at Scale https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10641 Although note the results are interpreted to mean LLMs are more or less memorising answers, which is right of course.

Potentially not great. If you look at the AIME accuracy graph on the OpenAI page [1] you will notice that the x-axis is logarithmic. Which is a problem because (a) compute in general has never scaled that well and (b) semiconductor fabrication will inevitably get harder as we approach smaller sizes. So it looks like unless there is some ground-breaking research in the pipeline the current transformer architecture will likely start to stall out. [1] https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/ reply accountnum 14 hours agorootparentIt's not a problem, because the point at which we are in the logarithmic curve is the only thing that matters. No one in their right mind ever expected anything linear, because that would imply that creating a perfect oracle is possible. More compute hasn't been the driving factor of the last developments, the driving factor has been distillation and synthetic data. Since we've seen massive success with that, I really struggle to understand why people continue to doomsay the transformer.

How? reply devit 9 hours agoprev [–] Am I missing something or this \"ARC-AGI\" thing is so ludicrously terrible that it seems to be completely irrelevant? It seems that the tasks consists of giving the model examples of a transformation of an input colored grid into an output colored grid, and then asking it to provide the output for a given input. The problem is of course that the transformation is not specified, so any answer is actually acceptable since one can always come up with a justification for it, and thus there is no reasonable way to evaluate the model (other than only accepting the arbitrary answer that the authors pulled out of who knows where). It's like those stupid tests that tell you \"1 2 3 ...\" and you are supposed to complete with 4, but obviously that's absurd since any continuation is valid given that e.g. you can find a polynomial that passes for any four numbers, and the test maker didn't provide any objective criteria to determine which algorithm among multiple candidates is to be preferred. Basically, something like this is about guessing how the test maker thinks, which is completely unrelated to the concept of AGI (i.e. the ability to provide correct answers to questions based on objectively verifiable criteria). And if instead of AGI one is just trying to evaluate how the model predicts how the average human thinks, then it makes no sense at all to evaluate language model performance by performance on predicting colored grid transformations. For instance, since normal LLMs are not trained on colored grids, it means that any model specifically trained on colored grid transformations as performed by humans of similar \"intelligence\" as the ARC-\"AGI\" test maker is going to outperform normal LLMs at ARC-\"AGI\", despite the fact that it is not really a better model in general. reply YeGoblynQueenne 7 hours agoparent [–] No no, that's not right.

We caught up with one of this year’s winners, Saul Justin Newman, a senior research fellow at the University College London Centre for Longitudinal Studies. His research finds that most of the claims about people living over 105 are wrong. How did you find out about your award? I picked up the phone after slogging through traffic and rain to a bloke from Cambridge in the UK. He told me about this prize and the first thing I thought of was the lady who collected snot off of whales and the levitating frog. I said, “absolutely I want to be in this club”. What was the ceremony like? The ceremony was wonderful. It’s a bit of fun in a big fancy hall. It’s like you take the most serious ceremony possible and make fun of every aspect of it. But your work is actually incredibly serious? I started getting interested in this topic when I debunked a couple of papers in Nature and Science about extreme ageing in the 2010s. In general, the claims about how long people are living mostly don’t stack up. I’ve tracked down 80% of the people aged over 110 in the world (the other 20% are from countries you can’t meaningfully analyse). Of those, almost none have a birth certificate. In the US there are over 500 of these people; seven have a birth certificate. Even worse, only about 10% have a death certificate. The epitome of this is blue zones, which are regions where people supposedly reach age 100 at a remarkable rate. For almost 20 years, they have been marketed to the public. They’re the subject of tons of scientific work, a popular Netflix documentary, tons of cookbooks about things like the Mediterranean diet, and so on. Okinawa in Japan is one of these zones. There was a Japanese government review in 2010, which found that 82% of the people aged over 100 in Japan turned out to be dead. The secret to living to 110 was, don’t register your death. The Japanese government has run one of the largest nutritional surveys in the world, dating back to 1975. From then until now, Okinawa has had the worst health in Japan. They’ve eaten the least vegetables; they’ve been extremely heavy drinkers. What about other places? The same goes for all the other blue zones. Eurostat keeps track of life expectancy in Sardinia, the Italian blue zone, and Ikaria in Greece. When the agency first started keeping records in 1990, Sardinia had the 51st highest old-age life expectancy in Europe out of 128 regions, and Ikaria was 109th. It’s amazing the cognitive dissonance going on. With the Greeks, by my estimates at least 72% of centenarians were dead, missing or essentially pension-fraud cases. Sardinia is another place whose longevity data is highly questionable. David Burton/Alamy What do you think explains most of the faulty data? It varies. In Okinawa, the best predictor of where the centenarians are is where the halls of records were bombed by the Americans during the war. That’s for two reasons. If the person dies, they stay on the books of some other national registry, which hasn’t confirmed their death. Or if they live, they go to an occupying government that doesn’t speak their language, works on a different calendar and screws up their age. According to the Greek minister that hands out the pensions, over 9,000 people over the age of 100 are dead and collecting a pension at the same time. In Italy, some 30,000 “living” pension recipients were found to be dead in 1997. Regions where people most often reach 100-110 years old are the ones where there’s the most pressure to commit pension fraud, and they also have the worst records. For example, the best place to reach 105 in England is Tower Hamlets. It has more 105-year-olds than all of the rich places in England put together. It’s closely followed by downtown Manchester, Liverpool and Hull. Yet these places have the lowest frequency of 90-year-olds and are rated by the UK as the worst places to be an old person. The oldest man in the world, John Tinniswood, supposedly aged 112, is from a very rough part of Liverpool. The easiest explanation is that someone has written down his age wrong at some point. But most people don’t lose count of their age… You would be amazed. Looking at the UK Biobank data, even people in mid-life routinely don’t remember how old they are, or how old they were when they had their children. There are similar stats from the US. What does this all mean for human longevity? The question is so obscured by fraud and error and wishful thinking that we just do not know. The clear way out of this is to involve physicists to develop a measure of human age that doesn’t depend on documents. We can then use that to build metrics that help us measure human ages. Life expectancy goes to the heart of the global economy. Simon Pilolla 2 Longevity data are used for projections of future lifespans, and those are used to set everyone’s pension rate. You’re talking about trillions of dollars of pension money. If the data is junk then so are those projections. It also means we’re allocating the wrong amounts of money to plan hospitals to take care of old people in the future. Your insurance premiums are based on this stuff. What’s your best guess about true human longevity? Longevity is very likely tied to wealth. Rich people do lots of exercise, have low stress and eat well. I just put out a preprint analysing the last 72 years of UN data on mortality. The places consistently reaching 100 at the highest rates according to the UN are Thailand, Malawi, Western Sahara (which doesn’t have a government) and Puerto Rico, where birth certificates were cancelled completely as a legal document in 2010 because they were so full of pension fraud. This data is just rotten from the inside out. Do you think the Ig Nobel will get your science taken more seriously? I hope so. But even if not, at least the general public will laugh and think about it, even if the scientific community is still a bit prickly and defensive. If they don’t acknowledge their errors in my lifetime, I guess I’ll just get someone to pretend I’m still alive until that changes.

Oddly specific things at that, like prices of goods and salaries from the time. Also grandpa has 7 siblings, with his older sister already being 100. Interestingly their own parents didn't live nearly that long. My paternal grandmother on the other hand died one week before turning 97 and only after that it was revealed that she actually lied about her age, claiming to be six years younger, so as to not cause a scandal when my grandparents announced their marriage. The common theme among them is that they are/were all active working manually and would neither drink nor smoke, but that's no revelation. reply pclmulqdq 4 hours agoparentAs I watch people around me reach their senior years, it increasingly seems like life is \"use it or lose it\" with your body and brain function. If you really want to extend your \"healthspan\" it seems the correct solution is to do full-body work-outs a lot, eat a really clean diet, avoid drugs, and keep using your brain actively into your 80's and 90's. reply Tade0 4 hours agorootparentA major component of that for my grandparents is that they live four floors up without an elevator. Interestingly, their next door neighbour is also still among us and the general pattern was that people in that block would start passing away starting from the lowest floors. It's a small thing, but I can see how it works - living on the third floor I see that my joints are better lubricated than back when I was living on the ground floor, so taking long walks is also no issue. reply ghastmaster 3 hours agorootparentThe first thing to come to my mind is water flows down and mold/mildew would be more present in lower floors.

They were also the healthiest in their 90s compared to the smokers. reply DrBazza 3 hours agorootparentprevMy grandmother would walk 4-5 miles to visit us, well into her 80s, and the route included a rather substantial hill. She lived into her 90s. Similarly, my grandfather was docker, and then a very active gardener walking to his allotment a few times day, a good few miles round-trip, and lived into his 90s as well. They were all what might be 'underweight' by the BMI measurements these days. War diets, perhaps, but they were both healthy and fit. Not sure I buy the restricted diet idea for longevity though. reply jajko 4 hours agorootparentprevWell yes, but you need to be smart about it, just like about everything else in life. People read full body workout and start some super intense training regimen which for some may be great, and for others it may be too much. Instead its more like some gardening efforts - every day a bit, not too much. My late grandparents are an example - obviously no smoking and absolute minimum alcohol and 0 other drugs ever, regular good sleep, and garden (plus a bit of nature which was just walks or foraging mushrooms). Understanding how body degenerates with age and injuries, especially joints and connective tissue. Workouts great for 20 years old are sometimes pretty bad for 40+. Don't stress heart too much, just enough, for long periods. Plenty of weightlifters who have messed up their shoulders, spines, knees etc. although at their peak they lifted impressive weights and looked accordingly. Guess what, this adds 0 in longevity, whatever effect was there is 100% gone in 5-10 years from all tissues and bones as cells fully renew, and messing up core of your movement can easily negatively impair lifespan. reply pclmulqdq 3 hours agorootparentIt does appear from my anecdata that large amounts of mild exercise actually seem to be better, like yoga, golf, mild hikes, or yard work/gardening. Manual labor of various kinds fits this pattern, too. reply pessimizer 3 hours agorootparentprev> do full-body work-outs a lot, eat a really clean diet, avoid drugs Could it be that older people were less likely to be able to avoid physical work (even their chores were far more of a workout), were relatively more religious and conservative than current generations, and grew up with fewer processed foods and more home cooking by stay-at-home moms? What I mean by this is are you just describing people who were born in the 1930s? The fact that the ones that are left are mostly typical would be expected. > keep using your brain actively into your 80's and 90's. This could be seen as a symptom of aging well, rather than a cause. People whose brains don't work well aren't studied as examples of aging well. The person I know who most fits this description is my dad, he had a swimmer's body in his 60s, worked out every morning since high school, has kept a dead center BMI his entire life, has never done a drug and probably only had a sip or two of beer, always had a gym guy diet that has gradually become more vegan, and was a math major and computer programmer, plays chess etc.. He's totally falling apart in his late 70s and becoming very frail. Seems like he's having nerve and neurological issues, and having problems with his connective tissue and with arthritis in his hands and knees. I don't know how you eat, work out, and think yourself into avoiding that. Half of his joint problems are caused from having been athletic, just like my super-athletic Army grandpa, whose knees would bend backwards for the last years of his life from football when he was young.

The fact that the ones that are left are mostly typical would be expected. People born in the 1930's were 30 in the 1960's, and if you think that means a lot of religious/social conservatism, you probably don't know much about American history. Most of these people adopted more conservative ideals later in life, which happens to literally every generation. By the way, it sounds like the people who you are talking about have a history of very much overworking their bodies to the point of injury, and that is also pretty clearly bad for you. I don't think you are guaranteed to live a long time if you take care of yourself, but I think it's pretty clearly true that you will maximize your chances if you do. > Protestantism isn't a law of nature. You aren't automatically rewarded for sacrifice and suffering, at least while you're alive.

My paternal grandfather lived well into his nineties, even as a smoker, as he was very active well into his 80s. Even when he touched 90, he could still pretty much walk around in his forest land to explore his property. On the other hand, my paternal grandmother had a severe sweet tooth, and passed away from a heart condition. Her diabetes kept her very inactive for the most part, but even at 80, she could do a LOT of activities independently with little help. Passed away at 84. My maternal grandfather was very active in his 70s, but he became sedentary and reclusive (partly because of my caretaker uncle who is an asshole, coupled with messy infamily fighting). Passed away at 82, after his second(!) heart attack. My maternal grandmother is still alive and kicking ass, travelling the world over.

These sources are quite firm on \"Liverpool,\" although I don't see anyone directly saying what part of Liverpool. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tinniswood https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-68741070 The hypothesis Newman is implicitly presenting in TFA is that Tinniswood is indeed very old, but — instead of being born in 1912, married at age 30, and now age 112 — perhaps he was really born in 1917, married at 25, and now 107. Or any other massaging of the numbers. Really the only way to distinguish among these hypotheses is to have some sort of documentary evidence — birth certificate, marriage certificate, employment records, etc. Newman's point is that \"supercentenarian\" populations are disproportionately correlated with bad recordkeeping (presumably even when you control for the observation that century-old records are likely worse-kept than newer records, although I don't think Newman directly says that). And also with pension fraud. He writes: ( https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/704080v3.full ) > The state-specific introduction of birth certificates is associated with a 69-82% fall in the number of supercentenarian records. [...] In England and France, higher old-age poverty rates alone predict more than half of the regional variation in attaining a remarkable age [...] supercentenarian birthdates are concentrated on days divisible by five [...] relative poverty and short lifespan constitute unexpected predictors of centenarian and supercentenarian status and support a primary role of fraud and error in generating remarkable human age records. Now, maybe there's no evidence that John Tinniswood is lying about his age (consciously or unknowingly), and maybe \"the rough parts of Liverpool\" have great recordkeeping, and maybe Tinniswood isn't even from the roughest part of Liverpool — sure, I think Newman's argument is specifically weak on concrete evidence for any of those claims, which means Tinniswood might be a terrible individual example for him to have picked.

(2) Behavioural emulation, IE a virtual replicant that roughly makes same decisions far enough for you to identify with it and trust it will carry on your pursuits, even though it will be at least for the beginning slower than the meat was. Behavioural emulation is much less difficult and much more computationally efficient than whole brain emulation.

If you want your statement above to be true you need to crush free loading or expand the very limited set of people the population doesn't mind freeloading. both those things have huge risks of enforcement/creation because they damage other aspects of human dignity we like and benefit from (i.e. the fundamental freedoms that give us a competitive productivity edge over time through allowing innovators to get fabulously wealthy off their innovation is heavily damaged by the authoritarianism that is the easiest path to crushing freeloading [up until the authoritarians become the freeloaders] or the nationalism that can lead to problematic outcomes interfacing with the inevitable outgroup but is the easiest way to expand the group that can freeload without causing instability.) reply kmeisthax 3 hours agorootparent\"Freeloading\" is a feature, not a bug. Human[0] socialization is hard-wired to be altruistic. If altruism didn't work, we wouldn't be socializing, we'd still be hairless primates wandering around the jungles of Africa, alone, killing and eating anything and everything we met. Hell, ants wouldn't be in colonies if that were the case. Altruism works evolutionarily because selfless actions improve group fitness, even if they don't increase individual reproductive success. Insamuch as \"freeloading\" is an actually deleterious behavior, it is because individuals are trying to move resources out of their altruistic in-group and towards themselves. To address your specific examples: - The whole goal of authoritarianism is to \"become the freeloaders\". The key rhetorical strategy of authoritarianism is to accuse your opponents of what you plan to do. If they agree with you and stop doing that thing, then you've won, because they are now tying their hands behind their back. If they try to normalize the thing as OK, then you've won, because now you get to do the thing. So in this case, authoritarians will identify and demonize the freeloading of some out-group, both to attack the out-group as well as internally justify their own freeloading. - Nationalism is rather arbitrary in what is and isn't considered to be the altruistic in-group. In fact, I would argue that it is a subset of the freeloading authoritarianism I mentioned above, at least in our modern age. Nationalists want to divide and conquer humanity. - \"Allowing innovators to get fabulously wealthy off their innovation\" is a freeloading behavior. Copyright and patent laws allow inventors to take from the public commons of knowledge and legally enclose it off for themselves. The intent is for this to be limited, but the limits are extremely weak[1]. \"IP\"[2] is the engine by which large corporate empires build fiefdoms around themselves. The counterargument to this is to gesture vaguely at the European medieval period's economic stagnation, but my counter-counterargument is to point out that this economic stagnation was itself the product of a system in which the vast majority of economic wealth was the product of rents. Diving further into that last point... the economic system in which the majority of wealth is the product of rents is called \"feudalism\". We associate this with agrarian economies and extreme material poverty, but modern \"IP\"-heavy business practices are not that far off from feudalism, recast in the mold of modernity. You can't innovate in a feudal system because of all the owners demanding their cut. Innovation requires freeloading. If those who own the resources of innovation are positioned to charge more than you could ever hope to make from that innovation, then there will not be innovation.

Despite feeling implausible, we have exactly as much evidence of nothingness after death as we do of a heaven or a hell. Before you mention that this is absurd because there's no brain activity after death, we still don't know how the brain and \"mind\" work, we can't observe the vast majority of matter or energy in the universe, and there's a lot we don't know. Filling that unknown space in with \"it's the end of everything I experience\" is as irrational as filling that in with \"72 virgins if I kill enough infidels.\" reply cgriswald 3 hours agorootparentYou yourself seem to have internalized the idea that it is the end of the experience. The things you describe as possible are all different experiences to this one. People aren’t required to be rational for GP’s point to be correct. I don’t even think it is necessary that they hold a particular view on death. Plenty of Christians don’t fear death because they believe in heaven. Plenty of those who believe in nothingness fear the end of their experience. Nothingness has evidence. Memory and consciousness both appear tied to the body. Suggesting that’s equivalent to anything else because technically anything is possible is at best a god of the gaps argument. The rational take here is that we don’t know, we may never know, but that the evidence is suggestive of the same sort of nothingness we “experience” when unconscious or before we were born. Regardless, all that is required for the GP’s point to be true is that people do not universally fear death. reply pclmulqdq 3 hours agorootparent> You yourself seem to have internalized the idea that it is the end of the experience. The previous commenter didn't say the end of \"the experience.\" They said the end of \"experience\" (no the). If you want to be pedantic about the semantics, that's a pretty big thing to add, don't you think? One is the end of all sensation and the end of a particular set of sensations. And no, it doesn't require that people not universally fear death, it requires that people who see death as the end of all experience don't fear death, which appears to be tautologically false since they adopt an irrational and negative belief about what the post-death state is. > Nothingness has evidence. Memory and consciousness both appear tied to the body. Suggesting that’s equivalent to anything else because technically anything is possible is at best a god of the gaps argument. The wordplay is interesting here - I didn't mention memory, only consciousness. Memory does appear to be an embodied phenomenon in your brain. Regarding consciousness, I'm not filling the gaps with a god, I'm suggesting that denying the existence of the gaps is as bad as filling it with a god. reply Dylan16807 2 hours agorootparent> which appears to be tautologically false since they adopt an irrational and negative belief about what the post-death state is. \"Probably nothing\" is not an irrational belief.

You don't need 100% certainty to want to avoid that. The words \"probably nothing\" imply that on something more than belief, you can assign a probability to nothingness. Can you provide an objective measure of probability as to whether nothingness is what awaits you after death? When you say \"probably nothing,\" the belief in \"probably nothing\" is an emotionally nice but similarly irrational hedge on \"nothing,\" because nobody can assign a probability to an unknown unknown like \"what happens after you die.\" > If I don't have my memories, then the old me is effectively gone forever. Wanting to avoid such a drastic and disruptive change has nothing to do with \"fear of the unknown\". Wanting to avoid that change is almost definitionally due to a fear of the unknown.

Also when you have a very precise scenario and question, doesn't that make it a known unknown? > Wanting to avoid that change is almost definitionally due to a fear of the unknown. You are afraid that the new state you will be in will be worse for lack of those memories. Wrong. Even with a guaranteed blissful existence, I'm still busy using my consciousness on my current life and don't want it to end. > it is in fact a common trauma response to block out old, bad memories. Yeah a few of them, that's not remotely the same as a clean slate. reply Livanskoy 2 hours agorootparentprevI'm sorry, but I don't understand how you could make an equality between \"end of experience\" and \"fear of the unknown\". The first is about valuing your life and not wanting for it to end. The second is about what comes after the end of life. I do not care about the second, but care about my current life a lot. If, for some unlikely but rhetorically valuable reason, my experience decides to NOT END after my body dies — great, more fun. I do not care about the political or religious debates, especially here, but it always seemed strange to me that people assume the fear of the unknown to be some universal factor. reply bitwize 2 hours agorootparentprevIn one of the detective stories my wife watches, one of the suspects was a kooky spiritual medium. \"Don't you wonder what happens after death?\" she asks the detective. The skeptical detective responds: \"I know exactly what will happen after I die: I will go back to being what I was for millions of years before I was born.\" We know exactly what happens after death: nothing. You cease to be as a living being. What we don't know, and can't ever know, is what it's like to not be. But every investigation so far has failed to produce evidence of a soul separate from the body, so until that changes we can assume such souls don't exist, and neither will we when our body dies. Don't handwave it away with \"we don't know how the mind really works\". For all intents and purposes we do know. The mind working at all depends on the body working; once the latter stops, so does the former. We can't accept this because our mind, from our mind's perspective, is everything, but it is limited in space and time because it too is composed of matter and energy and one day, it will stop. That fills us with horror and dread, the idea of (from our tiny perspective) everything stopping, so we fight it. We make up stories about heavens and hells. Even in this era we fight it with hopes of becoming transfinite and infinite through technology. It's all hopium and copium, and incredibly dangerous. People like Elon Musk are now shooting giant penises into the sky, and planning to send actual humans on one-way missions to interplanetary hellscapes which should inspire visions of an angry Hayao Miyazaki saying \"what you have done is an insult to life itself.\" Meanwhile we're neglecting the care of the only hospitable home we know we have, Earth. Accept your fate. Live, as the fictional gorilla Ishmael put it, in the hands of the gods. Doing otherwise will doom us all, and a lot of other living things too. reply pclmulqdq 2 hours agorootparentSince you seem to know, can you tell me at what precise moment a person becomes conscious at birth? It would solve a lot of problems in the world if you could share that knowledge with us. People fill the unknown with lots of things. I am simply suggesting that you should let the unknown remain unknown, especially if you're going to make major life choices around it. reply bitwize 1 hour agorootparentFundamentalists are fond of responding to claims about evolution (dinosaurs, etc.) with, \"Were you there? How could you know if you were not there?\" This is even taught as a rhetorical tactic in fundamentalist elementary schools (which I'm embarrassed to be an American for admitting they exist here). This seems to be an approach similar to what you're taking here, except you put an interesting twist on it by handwaving your appeal to spooks with stuff about \"the unknown\" and then claiming it is the more rational position. Once again: we know, as certainly as we can know anything, that the mind cannot function without the body functioning. Therefore, the idea that there is no experience after body death is a more rational position to take than anything involving 72 virgins, nirvana, reincarnation, or blah blah Bible Jesus magic. reply pclmulqdq 1 hour agorootparentThe difference is that we know the fundamentalists are wrong because their beliefs solidly run up against known facts. I am suggesting that filling the gaps one way (even though it feels more rational) is as irrational as filling the gaps any other way. And we know very little about the mind. We know a lot about the brain. As far as the exact links between mind and brain, that is still quite a bit up in the air. reply imtringued 3 hours agorootparentprevThe problem isn't the end of experience. The problem is that the universe exists in the first place. A lot of atheist afterlife logic runs into the problem that if nothing follows death, then this would also mean the end of the universe, but this is in contradiction with the fact that we can experience the universe and that it exists.

Once you have that, and attained “immortality” as such, do you mind if someone shoots you in the head? The real you i mean. After all you are immortal. Your behaviouraly emulated clone will keep doing what you do, loving your wife, taking care of your kids, supporting the causes you support etc. For me the answer is that I would absolutely not let my real body killed just because i have my behavioural clone. Which to me implies that at least for me it is not a true continuation of my life. More like having a living will, or a son who is way too similar to me, but still not me.

Now the point you ended your reply in is a very common response. Many follow the same direction of thought. I think that to think one should not get a behavioural replica because you don't think it would be you is a non-sequitur however; if the behavioural replica continues to advance your interests, is it not the rational thing to do? Moreover, if you said \"no, it doesnt matter, I'll be dead\" you would be following a strategy that'd lead to huge loss if it turned out you actually never died. reply krisoft 3 hours agorootparent> I think that to think one should not get a behavioural replica because you don't think it would be you is a non-sequitur however Didn’t say that.

Such monks were thought not to be dead but rather to have ascended to a higher plane of understanding. Their corpses would be dressed in fine clothes and venerated almost like gods. If you complete a shrine in Breath of the Wild and reach the mummified monk at the end, those monks were inspired by sokushinbutsu.

Not trying to be contrary, I'm sympathetic to that idea, but most of what I've seen suggests idiosyncratic environmental effects become more prominent as you age, even into late age. Those random fatal events, cumulative exposures, random nucleotide flips, and so forth, all add up more with time. I suspect aside from lifestyle changes and drugs targeting those affected pathways, gene and \"epigene\" editing is the thing that will result in longer lifespans. But genetic and epigenetic editing targeting random accumulated mutations with age, not necessarily those at birth. The phenomenon in the linked piece is important because it throws a monkey wrench into a lot of stuff.

(note that between my comment and yours, I had edited that sentence a bit, it's not worded as strongly now - this is because I don't doubt much that IQ was scientifically researched, so saying IQ is pseudoscience may indeed a bit far-fetched, but I still think the whole notion is quite broken) reply busterarm 4 hours agorootparentIQ tests are not and have never been intended to measure intelligence. They're intended to be a measure of potential. The fact that those articles got it wrong from the basic definitions should indicate there is a problem with the interpretation. If you look at the actual first study link, for example, it doesn't debunk IQ but highlights logistical problems of pen & paper testing and sample size.

With a bit of luck, something will address the discussed concern. reply zahlman 2 hours agorootparentprevThe link demonstrates that there is a well-reproduced phenomenon in real science whereby, e.g., test scores in various academic subjects correlate positively with each other, and that this can be explained by a common psychometric factor that is reasonable to refer to as \"intelligence\". The IQ or \"intelligence quotient\" is an attempt to quantify that which is known to exist, and it's actually one of the best understood ideas in the science of the brain. Additional viewing that largely covers my points below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM You started off saying: > There a lot of pseudoscience around IQ too, probably starting with the very concept of IQ for measuring \"intelligence\" (for which we would need a strong definition anyway) The point is that we do, in fact, have all the necessary scientific research to argue that the concept of \"intelligence\" exists - i.e., that we can identify a single-factor quantity that can be fairly described with a single number - and that anything calling itself IQ is definitionally a measurement of that single quantity. In particular: problem-solving capability is a real thing, and some people very obviously have more of it than others. Also, we notably don't have data to support more than one factor anywhere near as strong as Spearman's g. (That is to say: we see correlations between academic performance in all subjects - rather than strong positive correlations within certain groups but weak or negative correlations between those groups). The fact that specific IQ tests might fail to actually measure intelligence, or might measure it inaccurately, is beside the point. The fact that an individual's capability to express intelligence might vary on a day-to-day basis, or for other immediate environmental reasons (stress, caffeine, ...) is also beside the point. Any correlation that any researcher might draw between measured IQ results and any other demographic measurement, mutable or immutable, is beside the point, too. I have routinely seen people who attack the theory of intelligence engage in pseudoscience of their own, such as trying to invent strange alternate \"intelligences\" like \"emotional intelligence\" (apparently meaning some combination of empathy and social skills) and \"physical intelligence\" (apparently meaning some combination of dexterity and proprioception) so as to \"debunk\" the idea of intelligence being single-factor (which is not even what the theory of Spearman's g asserts; we're only saying that there is a roughly-measurable quantity that strongly positively correlates with academic success). This is, of course, utterly absurd, and further comes across as an attempt to dunk on \"nerds\" as \"not as smart as they think they are\" etc. It only makes sense if you redefine \"intelligence\" to mean something fundamentally incompatible with the accepted and well understood meaning. And I, personally, have been called a racist elsewhere on the Internet before, simply for pointing these things out, when I had said nothing whatsoever about race. And I've seen it happen to others, too. It's infuriating, and it's transparently political. If I \"disrespect\" people by dismissing claims like \"IQ is pseudoscience\" out of hand, I will continue to do so, because I have all the evidence I need that the alternative would lead to far greater societal harm. reply jraph 2 hours agorootparentTo be clear, I'm not arguing that the notion of intelligence doesn't exist. Although I'm not sure we really know to define it correctly. Emotional intelligence seems pseudoscience. I haven't heard about physical intelligence but that seems dubious. The \"IQ is pseudoscience\" claim is possibly a bit strong. Now, whether it is a good measure of intelligence is being questioned, and one of the reason is that it has cultural biases and is strongly biased towards academia. It comes from a measure that attempted to assess the mental age of someone (a bit dubious on its own), and you can also train for IQ tests, that alone is a bit suspicious for a good measure of intelligence. Problem-solving is a real capability, but doesn't IQ mostly attempt to measure pattern recognition? And isn't problem-solving only a part of intelligence? It seems IQ is quite focused on specific aspects of intelligence, and might not even be measuring them very well.

Yes there are projects where you can. But they allow small area/transistor counts. Pcbway for chips would be amazing! reply moffkalast 9 hours agorootparentprevHonestly I love that old processes are still running and old parts are still being made. Modern SMD stuff is really rubbish for learning electronics. It's nigh impossible to hand solder because all of it is tiny af, and since it's newer it's expensive and you don't get as many attempts. Luckily there's still an immense supply of arguably completely obsolete thruhole parts that are super easy to work with, can be breadboarded and bought for basically nothing. reply bombela 5 hours agorootparentI find SMD so much easier to work with. You just drop the parts with fine tweezers after some solder paste and apply hot air. It's also much cheaper. You can also rework without trouble in my experience. Apply hot air, lift the chip with tweezers. Remember to use lot of flux. reply throwawayQQOWJF 3 hours agorootparent> Remember to use lot of flux. Agree with your post and this part especially. More flux means easier work, but more mess to clean up when done. Flux pens are practical. I only used hot air for removing parts, but the techs who controlled it well absolutely loved it and were insanely productive. I solder QFP by dragging a “saturated” tip across the leads and then wick up any excess solder if needed (e.g. if I bridged/shorted a few legs). reply throwawayQQOWJF 8 hours agorootparentprevI respectfully disagree with what you say about SMD parts :) SMD parts are much cheaper compared to THT in my experience. Which parts are you thinking of specifically? I majored in CompSci but got my first job in embedded at a hardware manufacturer. IME it didn’t require many hours of practice to learn to solder e.g. 0603-parts. Around 4-5 hours of deliberate practice for me, although smaller can still be annoying. I have slighty worse than average vision so personally need a magnifying glass or a microscope for 0402 and smaller, but I can do it and it looks pretty afterwards (says the HW techs). I was about 5-6x slower than the HW techs at solder work and repair, so I didn’t solder something up every week/month. I can still mount a board easily with 0805s and 0603s even though it’s been a few years now. reply moffkalast 8 hours agorootparentWell there are lots of breakout/dev boards these days that do make it possible, but for something like adding an indicator LED I'd rather reach for an ol' 1/4W resistor than those ridiculously tiny SMD specks. But in general modules like the CD4051 mux, SS49E hall sensor, 74AHCT125 level shifter, etc. Cheap and super reliable stuff. I admit I'm really crap at accurate soldering so it might be more of a me issue, but I doubt I'm entirely alone in this. reply throwawayQQOWJF 6 hours agorootparentI can see what you mean. For many, it looks scary in the beginning (using tweezers etc.), but it comes quickly with practice. It is easier than it looks IMO, though I did get some tips from our techs which likely accellerated my learning (e.g. compared to learning on your own). With smaller (and thus lighter) parts, the surface tension helps pull the parts into place etc., so you get help on “pad-alignment”. Hot air soldering gets more difficult though, as you risk blowing parts offboard :D I don’t know the parts, but my experience is that everything SMD is cheaper than THT. Almost always. The hall effect sensor can likely be found cheaper in Sot23? The only reason I ever saw for using THT parts, was the (typically) much higher power ratings. At my previous job, a typical board with e.g. 6 layers and 500 components would have perhaps 5-10 THT parts and the rest in SMD (0805 and 0603 mostly). YMMV and for hobbyists it doesn’t make a big difference. SMD-soldering skills can be handy though. E.g. I’ve repaired a few of my friends’ TVs with broken backlights for pennies. reply manquer 18 hours agoparentprevIt is not the first choice of revenue of course, they and everyone would like to be Nvidia and pick and choose the customers standing patiently in line outside the door.

Maybe with illustrative example? (Intuitively it would just seem like a good thing) reply WJW 9 hours agorootparentKeeping a factory alive is not free. If you have committed to delivering a certain product for the next 30-50 years, you need to be able to deliver that product even in year 49. Even if it's only three parts and the factory is only profitable when producing thousands a year. Some costs that will crop up even without investing in R&D and maintenance: - Factory maintenance. The lights need to stay on, the floors need to be swept and the bearings need to remain greased. Things like ISO and security certifications also need to be kept up to date. - The longer a product runs, the more likely it is that the original employees on the production line retire or leave for another job. This means you'll need to be able to find and train new people for a job that uses tools and methodologies no longer used anywhere else. It will probably be more expensive to hire for those jobs than for jobs where people learn transferable skills that they could use in the rest of their careers. - After 40 years, many of the components in the production machinery will be difficult to come by. A CNC machine from that time might use the (then brand new) 286 processor. If it breaks, where would you source extra 286 processors? Alternatively you can redesign the process to use up-to-date components, but that costs a lot of extra money. - Usually the demand for components drops off over time as the world moves on to something more modern. For example, demand for components of older fighter jets will slowly drop off as new airframes are no longer being built and the existing ones slowly get taken out of service. This means you'll need to spread the fixed costs of the above points over fewer and fewer components over time. - Finally, the need for R&D and marketing doesn't actually go away. If you only focus on producing (say) targeting processors for the F16, your company will go out of business at the latest when the last F16 leaves service. Your shareholders will probably not be happy about that, so it's still important to invest in gaining new contracts too. reply krisoft 8 hours agorootparent> Even if it's only three parts and the factory is only profitable when producing thousands a year.

Government pays for the product. The product should be serviceable whether the company becomes defunct or business shifts. At this point, military or consumer should be able to give blueprints of the parts to different manufacturer or manufacturer it themselves. reply Jtsummers 16 hours agorootparentThere are three things that already exist and address these kinds of concerns (I've removed some, but not all, color commentary, this is somewhat effective but definitely not 100%): Data Rights - Every acquisitions contract includes data rights. The specific data varies by contract. For things like an LRU, the data rights may include schematics. This is, in theory, enough information to recreate the device but may leave out certain key proprietary pieces. Like if a 1980s era LRU had an M68k, no schematics from Motorola will be included. But the architecture is known so recreation is technically feasible. The schematics also offer a foundation for producing a like-product replacing the obsolete components, though a project like that can take years. ICD - Interface Control Document. The device itself becomes a blackbox. Instead a description is provided, along with other requirements and spec documents, on how it behaves. The good ICDs are really enough to start a clean room project without ever needing to crack open the to-be-replaced devices. Unfortunately the good ones are rare, they often stop getting updated at some point and modern ICDs are shit compared to the documentation from last century. COTS - DOD (and the US gov't in general) has had a major 30+ year push to go COTS as much as possible. Obviously this doesn't work for everything, but go back to that M68k example. There's no reason to ask for a custom chip when a COTS one will do. Same for other parts of major systems. Computer motherboards can be COTS (or very near) even if the chassis is bespoke to make it form and fit suitable for its intended environment. COTS, in theory, also makes it possible to do incremental refreshes more easily. Like replace that computer hardware in the custom chassis every 5 years, it's not trivial but it's a small jump and updating software components in such \"short\" (by DOD standards) increments is hardly onerous. In practice, updates may not happen for 20+ years which is a more substantial undertaking. These, and other things that are supposed to be done in acquisitions, largely resolve the \"What will we do in 20 years when the supplier has gone under\" questions. reply atribecalledqst 4 hours agorootparentIt's so sad to see how miserable ICDs have gotten. Some of them are just REST APIs and you are on your own to figure out what everything means, it's pathetic. The old ones, you can (and I have) interfaced with stuff from the 80s without any customer input. (alright, it has happened though that they needed to wheel out the old-timer who was around when the hardware was originally delivered, come integration time - since the way you hook up to the thing isn't always clearly described. But the software was fine!) reply Jtsummers 10 minutes agorootparentYep. The older the ICD, the better it seems to be. I miss the era of dedicated technical writers, too. We received an \"ICD\" from a vendor and it's just garbage. It's incomplete, for one, and kind of just ends in the middle of things and leaves out crucial details so we can't use it without reverse engineering their system. A major problem is that it appears their developers are their document writers now, and they just don't do it, either out of laziness or insufficient time (higher priority dev tasks in the queue). They've been publishing the same incomplete document for years. reply sitkack 16 hours agorootparentprevWafers come in batch sizes of a FOUP, these are the little sealed boxes you see the robots on the tracks moving around a semiconductor factory. One might only need one wafer of chips or less for a project, those other unused wafers go in storage after some testing. When the military needs spare parts, those wafers can be brought out of storage and diced and packaged (if we will even still do that in the future). This technique is already done for things with long operational lifetimes.

Do we know the progress on \"5 nodes in 4 years\" plan, is it being executed well? reply beng-nl 6 hours agoparent(Disclaimer, I work for Intel but have no non public information about this and naturally don’t speak for them. I am a little more biased towards wishing them be successful than the average person perhaps.) Yes, by all accounts the latest node (Intel 18a, which ought to be competitive with the latest tsmc node) is healthy and on schedule. Very Recent pronouncements by the cfo support this (I think it’s extra significant that it’s the cfo because he knows like nobody else how much hot water he’d be in if he were misrepresenting the likelihood of success). That’s one thing I don’t understand about the Intel negativity; the whole world is lining up for tsmc (rightfully so). Either directly if you’re one of the major customers who can’t produce products fast enough to sell them (nvidia) or indirectly (if you want to buy nvidia). but the only realistic near-future competitor to tsmc isn’t seen as such, despite the great need (ie worth the time to investigate and worth the risk to try as a fab). If the current stock price is to believed, Intel should be bought for its assets, which makes absolutely no sense to me personally. As far as I’m concerned its the only possible short term path to breaking open the silicon supply chain gridlock, exacerbated by the ai hype. reply bornfreddy 10 minutes agorootparentThank you! I agree we should be rooting for Intel. Good luck to you and your coworkers! reply bgentry 5 hours agorootparentprevBen Thompson has been covering Intel’s precarious position for over a decade (well before the market finally realized it) and the latest update is not looking good: Intel’s is technically on pace to achieve the five nodes in four years Gelsinger promised (in truth two of those nodes were iterations), but they haven’t truly scaled any of them; the first attempt to do so, with Intel 3, destroyed their margins. This isn’t a surprise: the reason why it is hard to skip steps is not just because technology advances, but because you have to actually learn on the line how to implement new technology at scale, with sustainable yield. Go back to Intel’s 10nm failure: the company could technically make a 10nm chip, they just couldn’t do so economically; there are now open questions about Intel 3, much less next year’s promised 18A. https://stratechery.com/2024/intel-honesty/ reply bornfreddy 4 minutes agorootparentI know that post, but the problem is he is just extrapolating from history.

Compared to AMD, Intel is distinctly a “US” corporation, outside of that image they have large R&D centre's in Israel. US corporations that deal with the military very often have a similar setup.

For example, the F35 uses older chip generations. reply Jtsummers 17 hours agoparentIt's mixed. But even if you stick to older generation chips, someone has to supply them which means someone has to make them. Foreign manufacturing and sourcing is a political and security headache even if you go through the hoops to show a secure supply chain and address all their concerns. I had \"cybersecurity\" people refuse open source project use because someone in France (an ally) had a commit. Don't let them look at the Linux kernel commits... I wouldn't want to deal with that for hardware. Also F-35 is not something anyone should aspire to. That system, its software in particular, was a project management disaster.

Things like terminal guidance systems for hypersonic intercept run on CPUs like an ancient MIPS R3000/4000. It doesn’t need anything more. If you are trying to do real-time processing and fusion of the F-35 sensor suite or an AEGIS system, it is extremely compute intensive and so they live much closer to the bleeding edge with regular upgrades because there is an almost unlimited appetite for more processing power if available to support capabilities. You often see a mix of really old and really new. They only use the latest greatest, ASICs, or similar when there is an absolute advantage to be gained by doing so. The old platforms are proven and reliable so no reason to not use them if they do the job and they often do. reply anigbrowl 16 hours agoparentprevPerformance is a key metric of course, but reliability would seem to be an even bigger consideration.

I was able to get very significant speedups to my already highly optimized Rust code in my fast vector similarity project, all verified with careful benchmarking and validation of correctness. Not only that, it also helped me reimagine and conceptualize a new measure of statistical dependency based on Jensen-Shannon divergence that works very well. And it came up with a super fast implementation of normalized mutual information, something I tried to include in the library originally but struggled to find something fast enough when dealing with large vectors (say, 15,000 dimensions and up). While it wasn’t able to give perfect Rust code that compiled on the very first try, it was able to fix all the bugs in one more try after pasting in all the compiler warning problems from VScode. In contrast, gpt-4o usually would take dozens of tries to fix all the many rust type errors, lifetime/borrowing errors, and so on that it would inevitably introduce. And Claude3.5 sonnet is just plain stupid when it comes to Rust for some reason. I really have to say, this feels like a true game changer, especially when you have really challenging tasks that you would be hard pressed to find many humans capable of helping with (at least without shelling out $500k+/year in compensation for). And it’s not just the performance optimization and relatively bug free code— it’s the creative problem solving and synthesis of huge amounts of core mathematical and algorithmic knowledge plus contemporary research results, combined with a strong ability to understand what you’re trying to accomplish and making it happen. Here is the diff to the code file showing the changes: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/fast_vector_similarity/... reply wenc 1 hour agoprevOnce GPT is tuned more heavily on Lean (proof assistant) -- the way it is on Python -- I expect its usefulness for research level math to increase. I work in a field related to operations research (OR), and ChatGPT 4o has ingested enough of the OR literature that it's able to spit out very useful Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulations for many \"problem shapes\". For instance, I can give it a logic problem like \"i need to put i items in n buckets based on a score, but I want to fill each bucket sequentially\" and it actually spits out a very usable math formulation. I usually just need to tweak it a bit. It also warns against weak formulations where the logic might fail, which is tremendously useful for avoiding pitfalls. Compare this to the old way, which is to rack my brain over a weekend to figure out a water-tight formulation of MIP optimization problem (which is often not straightforward for non-intuitive problems). GPT has saved me so much time in this corner of my world. Yes, you probably wouldn't be able to use ChatGPT well for this purpose unless you understood MIP optimization in the first place -- and you do need to break down the problem into smaller chunks so GPT can reason in steps -- but for someone who can and does, the $20/month I pay for ChatGPT more than pays for itself. side: a lot of people who complain on HN that (paid/good - only Sonnet 3.5 and GPT4o are in this category) LLMs are useless to them probably (1) do not know how to use LLMs in way that maximizes their strengths; (2) have expectations that are too high based on the hype, expecting one-shot magic bullets.

I have found great value in using LLMs to sort things out. In areas where I am very experienced it can be really helpful at tons of small chores. Like Terrence was pointing out in his third experiment — if you break the problem down it does solid work filling in smaller blanks. You need the conceptual understanding. Part of this is prompting skill. If you go into an area you don’t know you have to try and build the prompts up. Dive into something small and specific and work outward if the answer is known. Start specific and focused if starting from the outside in. I have used this to cut through conceptual layers of very complex topics I have zero knowledge in and then verify my concepts via experts on YT/research papers/trusted sources.

Attitudinally, I suspect people who have had experience supervising interns or mentoring juniors are probably those who are able to get value out of LLMs (paid ones - free ones are no good) rather than grizzled lone individual contributors -- I myself have been in this camp for most of my early career -- who don't know how to coax value out of people. reply wslh 47 minutes agorootparent> ... that I have no bandwidth to do myself. One of the most interesting aspects of this thread is how it brings us back to the fundamentals of attention in machine learning [1]. This is a key point: while humans have intelligence, our attention is inherently limited. This is why the concept behind Attention Is All You Need [2] is so relevant to what we're discussing. My 2 cents: our human intelligence is the glue that binds everything together.

In fact, I would argue all students studying math will greatly increase their competence if they are required to recall all relevant definition and information before using it. We don't do this in practice (including teachers and mathematicians!) because recall is effortful, and we don't like to spent more effort than necessary to solve a problem. If recall fails, then we have to look up information which takes even more effort. This is why in practice, there is a tremendous incentive to just \"wing it\". AI has no emotional barrier to wasted effort, which make them better reasoners than their innate ability would suggest. reply perihelions 44 minutes agoprevI'm so excited in anticipation of my near-term return to studying math, as an independent curiosity hobby. It's going to be epically fun this time around with LLM's to lean on. Coincidentally like Terence Tao, I've also been asking complex analysis queries* of LLM's, things I was trying to understand better in my working through textbooks. Their ability to interpret open-ended math questions, and quickly find distant conceptual links that are helpful and relevant, astonishes me. Fields laureate Professor Tao (naturally) looks down on the current crop of mathematics LLM—\"not completely incompetent graduate student...\"—but at my current ability level that just means looking up. *(I remember a specific impressive example from 6 months ago: I asked if certain definitions could be relaxed to allow complex analysis on a non-orientable manifold, like a Klein bottle, something I spent a lot of time puzzling over, and an LLM instantly figured out it would make the Cauchy-Riemann equations globally inconsistent. (In a sense the arbitrary sign convention in CR defines an orientation on a manifold: reversing manifold orientation is the same as swapping i with -i. I understand this now, solely because an LLM suggested looking at it). Of course, I'm sure this isn't original LLM thinking—the math's certainly written down somewhere in its training material, in some highly specific postgraduate textbook I have no knowledge of. That's not relevant to me. For me, it's absolutely impossible to answer this type of question, where I have very little idea where to start, without either an LLM or a PhD-level domain specialist. There is no other tool that can make this kind of semantic-level search accessible to me.

But I was curious and I asked something very simple, Euclid's first postulate and I got this answer: Euclid's Postulate 1: \"Through any two points, there is exactly one straight line.\" In fact Euclid's Postulate 1 is \"To draw a straight line from any point to any point.\" http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/bookI.h...

The statement “exactly one” requires the parallel postulate, since otherwise it’s not necessarily true. Specifically in spherical geometry, which is considered to be consistent with Euclid’s first four postulates (i.e. without the parallel postulate).

The malware, dubbed Android.Vo1d, has infected nearly 1.3 million devices belonging to users in 197 countries. It is a backdoor that puts its components in the system storage area and, when commanded by attackers, is capable of secretly downloading and installing third-party software. In August 2024, Doctor Web was contacted by several users whose Dr.Web antivirus had detected changes in their device’s system file area. The problem occurred with these models: TV box model Declared firmware version R4 Android 7.1.2; R4 Build/NHG47K TV BOX Android 12.1; TV BOX Build/NHG47K KJ-SMART4KVIP Android 10.1; KJ-SMART4KVIP Build/NHG47K All these cases involved similar signs of infection, so we will describe them using one of the first requests we received as an example. The following objects were changed on the affected TV box: install-recovery.sh daemonsu In addition, 4 new files emerged in its file system: /system/xbin/vo1d /system/xbin/wd /system/bin/debuggerd /system/bin/debuggerd_real The vo1d and wd files are the components of the Android.Vo1d trojan that we discovered. The trojan’s authors probably tried to disguise one if its components as the system program /system/bin/vold, having called it by the similar-looking name “vo1d” (substituting the lowercase letter “l” with the number “1”). The malicious program’s name comes from the name of this file. Moreover, this spelling is consonant with the English word “void”. The install-recovery.sh file is a script that is present on most Android devices. It runs when the operating system is launched and contains data for autorunning the elements specified in it. If any malware has root access and the ability to write to the /system system directory, it can anchor itself in the infected device by adding itself to this script (or by creating it from scratch if it is not present in the system). Android.Vo1d has registered the autostart for the wd component in this file. The modified install-recovery.sh file The daemonsu file is present on many Android devices with root access. It is launched by the operating system when it starts and is responsible for providing root privileges to the user. Android.Vo1d registered itself in this file, too, having also set up autostart for the wd module. The debuggerd file is a daemon that is typically used to create reports on occurred errors. But when the TV box was infected, this file was replaced by the script that launches the wd component. The debuggerd_real file in the case we are reviewing is a copy of the script that was used to substitute the real debuggerd file. Doctor Web experts believe that the trojan’s authors intended the original debuggerd to be moved into debuggerd_real to maintain its functionality. However, because the infection probably occurred twice, the trojan moved the already substituted file (i.e., the script). As a result, the device had two scripts from the trojan and not a single real debuggerd program file. At the same time, other users who contacted us had a slightly different list of files on their infected devices: daemonsu (the vo1d file analogue — Android.Vo1d.1); wd (Android.Vo1d.3); debuggerd (the same script as described above); debuggerd_real (the original file of the debuggerd tool); install-recovery.sh (a script that loads objects specified in it). An analysis of all the aforementioned files showed that in order to anchor Android.Vo1d in the system, its authors used at least three different methods: modification of the install-recovery.sh and daemonsu files and substitution of the debuggerd program. They probably expected that at least one of the target files would be present in the infected system, since manipulating even one of them would ensure the trojan’s successful auto launch during subsequent device reboots. Android.Vo1d’s main functionality is concealed in its vo1d (Android.Vo1d.1) and wd (Android.Vo1d.3) components, which operate in tandem. The Android.Vo1d.1 module is responsible for Android.Vo1d.3’s launch and controls its activity, restarting its process if necessary. In addition, it can download and run executables when commanded to do so by the C&C server. In turn, the Android.Vo1d.3 module installs and launches the Android.Vo1d.5 daemon that is encrypted and stored in its body. This module can also download and run executables. Moreover, it monitors specified directories and installs the APK files that it finds in them. A study conducted by Doctor Web malware analysts showed that the Android.Vo1d backdoor has infected around 1.3 million devices, while its geographical distribution included almost 200 countries. The largest number of infections were detected in Brazil, Morocco, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Argentina, Ecuador, Tunisia, Malaysia, Algeria, and Indonesia. Countries with the highest number of infected devices detected One possible reason why the attackers distributing Android.Vo1d specifically chose TV boxes is that such devices often run on outdated Android versions, which have unpatched vulnerabilities and are no longer supported with updates. For example, the users who contacted us have models that are based on Android 7.1, despite the fact that for some of them the configuration indicates much newer versions, such as Android 10 and Android 12. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for budget device manufacturers to utilize older OS versions and pass them off as more up-to-date ones to make them more attractive. In addition, users themselves may mistakenly perceive TV boxes to be better protected devices, compared to smartphones. As a result, they may install anti-virus software on these less often and risk encountering malware when downloading third-party apps or installing unofficial firmware. At the moment, the source of the TV boxes’ backdoor infection remains unknown. One possible infection vector could be an attack by an intermediate malware that exploits operating system vulnerabilities to gain root privileges. Another possible vector could be the use of unofficial firmware versions with built-in root access. Dr.Web anti-virus for Android successfully detects all known Android.Vo1d trojan variants, and, if root access is available, cures the infected devices.

Most \"real people\" also have phones which aren't receiving updates for a few years by now. In south america the median android version is 8. And phones are not optional as most countries already jumped into both digital government and money transfer. reply donkeybeer 6 hours agoparentIts a self created problem of locked down user hostile devices. Operating system and software upgrades are not locked to the hardware manufacturer in the laptop world (not yet, for the most part). It is a pipe dream of mine that someday these attacks are used as an excuse by some government perhaps the EU to force opening up devices for install of other operating systems, maybe forced to open sourcing firmware etc. reply afavour 5 hours agorootparentThe problem is that the “self” in that statement is not the consumer. They have no choice, yet the bear the burden. The people who made these choices benefit from it. reply donkeybeer 5 hours agorootparentBy \"self\" I meant the manufacturers of the device, not the end user. reply ptero 4 hours agorootparentThe manufacturers do not have the problem. They created a problem for many users as a side effect of forced obsolescence making consumers in richer countries buy new hardware every few years. So it is not really \"self created\" in my book. reply croes 3 hours agorootparentDidn't Google create the problem. They could have made the Android core updatable without the need for a manufacturer update reply ptero 3 hours agorootparentGoogle certainly contributed to it. But whether the issue for consumers was caused by hardware makers or by OS makers it is not a self-imposed wound for the consumers -- they had nothing to do with it. reply Zigurd 3 hours agorootparentprevAndroids are less locked-down than iOS devices. The problem is that Google used to not have the ability to require long term support from device OEMs and now that it has the market power to demand long term support they seem reluctant to prioritize that in license agreements. Then there are devices, like in China, where Google Mobile Services is not on many phones so Google has no leverage at all re supporting updates. reply donkeybeer 3 hours agorootparentThere is nothing in principle requiring Android phones be locked down, but its a de facto reality that manufacturers of almost all phones have made them locked down and you have to research to even know beforehand if you can even do something as little as a bootloader unlock or a rooting. Why is os and phone model so tightly integrated and locked together, when in the pc world you can generally install any os on any computer? That's what I was saying. Which is to say I think you are speaking in terms of what you can do within the android's playground itself, its certainly much more open than ios in that regard. But when it comes to the fact of being able to change the playground itself ie install whatever os you want on the hardware or upgrade the os on the phone then suddenly most phones aren't any better than iphones either. Some are slightly better in that you can at least unlock the bootloader or root it, but I don't know if much progress has been made beyond that in being able to reverse engineer or otherwise them to able to install anything you want on them. That was the point with respect to I was speaking. reply sangnoir 57 minutes agorootparent> Why is os and phone model so tightly integrated and locked together, when in the pc world you can generally install any os on any computer? Qualcomm is the reason. Qualcomm wants OEMs to buy new chips every year, and for that to happen, consumers have to buy new phones every year. To upgrade Android (across kernel versions), OEMs need Qualcomm to provide updated drivers, which Qualcomm has been reluctant to do, because their sales will be undercut by chips they sold years ago. Android phones are closer to Mac than PCs, as there's one hardware-maker who determines which models become obsolete, and when, based on the software they choose to update (or not). reply donkeybeer 3 hours agorootparentprevAnd thats my point, you should not need OEM support for a pure software issue of operating system upgrades. I do not ask Dell or Lenovo before writing 'apt update && apt upgrade' when on my pc. I do not need to ask Dell or Lenovo before plugging in a flash drive with the iso of my favorite os or to upgrade the next version of the same and so on. These are things that if the device wasn't locked down, shouldn't have required the OEM's direct involvement in the first place. reply throwaway48476 3 hours agorootparentprevLaptops work because the BIOS provides a universal abstraction layer and because support is upstreamed in the Linux kernel. Supporting phones for longer would require them to also upstream support. reply donkeybeer 3 hours agorootparentIts true that a lack of standardization on phones makes things a bit harder but its as you said, still the key point is that they need to make the firmwares opened up. If manufacturers want to keep it all locked down then they deserve and should expect these type of attacks all the time. If they don't want these to happen, they should make their firmwares available and upstreamed or at least not cause roadblocks toward reverse engineering of the device by means of cryptographic locks or otherwise. reply ThatMedicIsASpy 6 hours agorootparentprevIt is the reason why I have Windows tablets not Android ones. I know there are OS updates. And once they are dead I have options for Linux tablets now. reply shakna 5 hours agorootparentWindows 8 stopped receiving updates in January last year, which killed my Surface for me. reply F7F7F7 5 hours agorootparentprevFragmentation used to be touted as a feature of Android, not a … well, you know. “Freedom”, I believe they called it. Also, hardware standardization in the PC world is pretty much a thing. Not so much in the mobile (and mobile offshoot) world. reply donkeybeer 5 hours agorootparentFragmentation is not the problem. The problem is inability to change os or firmware. If control of upgrading or changing os wasn't solely with the maker there wouldn't have been an issue in the first place. I bet for example many of these bugs might be due to the much older linux kernels in use in phones. Again something easily solved by making the os easily changeable and not presenting cryptographic etc roadblocks to reverse engineering, if they don't even want to open source the firmwares at least. At the end of the day these are software bugs not hardware bugs, so the solution as with any software is to be able to push fixes. It does not matter if there are a million different Android phone platforms, a fix to some bug in the Linux kernel for example should work the same on all of them. More importantly, as a piece of pure software this should be something anyone working on Linux or Android should be able to fix as happens in the more sane world of laptop, server etc hardware. If we weren't locked to the manufacturer for all operating system and software support this won't be a problem in the first place. Imagine how ridiculous it'd be if we had a Dell XPS 13 OS, a Lenovo Thinkpad T14 OS etc that went out of support the moment the model is discontinued instead of the sane and normal situation where your Debian or whatever os continues receiving software updates as long as Debian wants to support it. reply lupire 3 hours agorootparentYou're making a bold assumption that an alternate, extremely uneconomical, OS would be more secure. This is far from obvious. Now, if the phone's original OS were open source, it would be easier to make bugfix patches when old vulns are discovered. reply donkeybeer 3 hours agorootparentBy \"alternate\" I don't necessarily mean some obscure os, but any os in general , in fact I rather specifically had in mind Android or Linux. By alternate here I meant the fact of being able to install any you want instead of being stuck with whatever ancient Android version and Linux kernel the original came with. Ie if your phone came with an ancient Android, you should be able to without OEM support install a newer Android or a recent Linux or anything else you'd like. reply donkeybeer 5 hours agorootparentprevAnd honestly I doubt 99.9% of these attacks are anything hardware specific but rather generic software bugs like buffer overflows in the kernel, so hardware is in any case a moot point. reply yas_hmaheshwari 3 hours agoparentprevOut of curiosity, where did you find this data (genuine question) After reading your comment, I was trying to find that for India, and landed on this page: https://gs.statcounter.com/android-version-market-share/all/..., and thought that India it is Android 13 But then for South America, the same page (https://gs.statcounter.com/android-version-market-share/all/...) tells should be Android 13 as well India also has the same setup - digital money transfer happens via phones (in some ways, your phone number is your identity) reply jmyeet 6 hours agoparentprevUpdates for Android continue to be a huge problem. Android OEMs have historically been terrible at releasing timely updates (it can take months), releasing updates at all (particularly cheap Android phones get EOLed long before an admittedly way more expensive iPhone would) and such updates aren't typically pushed in the same way. One big problem with Android is the way driver updates work. It's a nontrivial process to add hardware support for a later Android version because of the Linux roots and having no stable ABI. I think back to how Windows has changed over the last 2 decades. Once Windows updates were all paid and people would hang on to old versions of Windows forever. Microsoft eventually realized this was a problem for them so paid upgrades aren't what they once were. Additionally, driver instability used to be a massive problem on Windows. Microsoft to their credit spent a lot of effort improving their driver situation to isolate drivers and have a stable ABI. Windows is way more stable than it was 20 years ago. Even OSX has adopted user space drivers (DriverKit). By the way, the above reasons is why some at Google have pushed Fucshia as essentially an Android ecosystem and architecture reset. It's been close to 10 years now. I don't see this going anywhere despite billions being poured into it at this point. reply Krssst 4 hours agorootparentI am using an Android phone which gets timely updates. However the vendor does not seem to do enough testing for major versions and has ended up with at least one significant bug upon release twice. I could do with less timely updates that come with less bugs. reply tannhaeuser 5 hours agorootparentprev> Windows is way more stable than it was 20 years ago. The problem with Windows today is more that it wants to opaquely update itself all the time, and the user gets undesired mandatory \"updates\" such as ads in menus and sending \"telemetry\" home (ie user activity data for MS' machine learning ambitions). But of course the most important thing is to keep fucking web browsers up-to-date with laughable and undesired CSS or WASM features (including subsequent exploit/fingerprinting fixes) all the time and even more often than actual content, or what's left of it anyway on the extant web. reply afavour 5 hours agorootparentThis just reads as a grab bag of complaints about modern tech with little relevance to the topic at hand reply secondcoming 5 hours agorootparentprevUbuntu and Debian both have unattended-uogrades running by default reply 1oooqooq 6 hours agorootparentprevFuchsia was a backup plan.

My guess was always that it just didn't ever have full support as a replacement due to turf wars with people in charge of Android-related things. reply throwaway48476 3 hours agorootparentprevFuchsia is a jobs program to prevent OS devs from making something that fan compete with android. reply wappieslurkz 5 hours agorootparentprevMay I ask what mobile OS you use? reply ajross 4 hours agorootparentprev> Updates for Android continue to be a huge problem. As is being pointed out elsewhere, this isn't a vulnerability in an \"Android\" product. These are TVs running vendor-maintained AOSP builds. They get updates when and how the vendor decides to do it. It's not related to the (fairly reasonable, though often spun) arguments about updates in the phone licensee ecosystem. reply jmyeet 2 hours agorootparentThis is a distinction without a difference. It's not like you can take your Android hardware and move to a different software supplier. You're stuck with whatever your OEM chooses to do or not do. It's also something you don't necessarily have knowledge of when you purchase a phone. It's one reason why people (myself include) prefer Apple. You know you're going to get 4-5+ years of updates. reply ajross 6 minutes agorootparent> This is a distinction without a difference. No? For a licensed Android phone there's a clean split between OEM and OS updates, a clear declaration for support period and a OS-managed tracking of updates with clear visibility to the customer. I get that there are constant platforms flames about whether this is acceptable or inferior to Apple's offering, yada yada yada. But the point is that none of that is relevant here, because these aren't phones and aren't running a licensed \"Android\" variant. They're just TVs running vendor-custom firmware that happens to be based on AOSP, and clearly can't be expected to conform to any update regime except whatever the integrator put together. Basically, the story here is saying \"I hacked product A\" and you're trying to have an argument like \"That's because this unrelated product B is bad\". It's a non-sequitur. reply kome 6 hours agoparentprevmobile first was a mistake reply mrweasel 10 hours agoprev> such devices often run on outdated Android versions, which have unpatched vulnerabilities and are no longer supported with updates.

There are some hacks and reverse engineering attempts but they are not very reliable. reply steelframe 2 hours agoprevSome of my hard requirements for a media device are that it must not share any of my personal information with any third party and it must fully cache the full-resolution and complete media content prior to beginning playback. If it's going to be connected to the Internet it must receive regular security updates for anything that's not written in a memory- and type-safe language like Go or Rust. While Go and Rust aren't necessarily magic pixie-dust that can account for all types of security vulnerabilities, if I'm going to be faced with the possibility of some project being abandoned at some point for the next new shiny thing that everyone would rather work on, I'd at least like to give it a fighting chance of remaining secure for some time after abandonment without any updates. Ideally it would be a Rust userspace media management package running on Debian Stable getting unattended upgrades every night. Since nothing like that exists I've recently decided to give CoreELEC/Kodi a try on an ODROID-N2+, albeit disconnected from any network. I was surprised at how seamless and integrated everything was. The remote control for my television \"just worked\" with it out of the box thanks to HDMI CEC support. Arrow buttons, play/pause, back, etc. all did just what I expected them to do. It's a marked improvement from the last time I built a custom media box, which I had running MythTV on Gentoo, when I needed to jump through hoops to set up an IR blaster. And you can't argue with a 12v/2a power supply. For now I'm keeping it off my home network and am \"sneaker-netting\" content on a USB drive between my trusted devices and the ODROID. When I get tired of doing that I might add some firewall rules to my router to only allow it to talk to a locked-down VM doing nothing but hosting a read-only file share. But some day I hope to look forward to building a similar form-factor box that has all the media gadgets and gizmos with a Rust userspace that respects my privacy and auto-updated Debian Stable so I can actually connect it to the Internet. reply photonthug 6 hours agoprevThere’s always one thread where we are discussing how everything needs to auto-update for security/stability forever, and another thread (currently crowdstrike) where that approach has caused the problem we wanted to avoid. Would be nice to see more discussion of this basic tension in the abstract since $current_issue is often just a distraction. Auto updates also have a reputation for harming the user at least as often as helping (removing features, adding ads, whatever) and so trust in that is declining while the need for decent security (smart cars/homes) is increasing. Not sure what to conclude from this except that we need more focus on secure-by-design systems and maybe immutability guarantees rather than autoupdates, app stores, and plugin/extension frameworks but these things are sometimes impractical fundamentally and sometimes just inconvenient for surveillance capitalism. reply TiredOfLife 5 hours agoparentThe problem with Crowdstrike was that they DID NOT TEST before release. reply photonthug 4 hours agorootparentSure, but again the specifics are a distraction. The problem with pushing any release onto users who have no ability to opt out is that those users never have any guarantee that vendors tested things, or that the vendor is even hoping to help rather than hurt users. it’s pretty safe to assume that most companies spend money trying to make money, which usually involves exfiltrating my data, turning off things I need but they don’t want to support, general rent seeking, ads injection. Trusting any small manufacturer of anything to spend time/money on fixing problems with security or quality control is a hilariously naive idea these days, when crowdstrike and Boeing are showing that even big companies don’t care. We all know the security update is enhanced spyware, planned obsolescence / a slow push to force me to buy a new device, or something else that’s going to make things worse. reply Namidairo 13 hours agoprevI wonder what SoC these are running? Quite a few of them actually end up configured to preference SD boot over internal flash and/or have easily accessible buttons or shortable pads to trigger bootrom recovery modes. Which at least, stops them being automatically consigned to e-waste. Although, customising a LibreELEC image for the dozens of different models of TV box isn't great.

Are those TV boxes not running behind routers with firewalls? reply usrusr 6 hours agoparentWhat makes you assume the vector is an incoming connection? Routers and firewalls won't protect a device from a user lured into installing malware with promises of \"free Netflix, completely legal\" running off some pirate mirror, or simply wrapping stolen credentials (note how people trying to break into your computers can not always be trusted with legal advice). And neither from simply luring them onto some malicious website (or just getting them to see a malicious ad) in case there's the juicy combination of a media decoder vulnerability with some privilege escalation that can be reached from the decoder. reply xbmcuser 4 hours agoparentprevA lot of these boxes probably are iptv/piracy streamers and I would not be shocked if it's one those apps backdooring these devices reply 1oooqooq 6 hours agoparentprevFirewall?

If an attacker can create outbound connections from inside the network then they can get around this of course, but you have to already be inside. reply happyopossum 6 hours agoprevGiven the nature of some (most?) of the generic tv boxes running random AOSP, I would not be at all surprised if these didn’t ship with so basic C&C malware already installed. This was apparently found due to seeing some changed files, so they didn’t ship with void, but it wouldn’t have been hard to push it out to pre-comprised boxes. reply tuetuopay 2 hours agoparentNot sure why this is downvoted. It is well documented that most cheap android tv boxes have more or less the same trojan preinstalled.

I'm not dissing Chinese makers. I'm only sure that like everything there's an exponential curve of how serious companies take security. I'm guessing, of the car makers out there, Tesla and Rivan are near the top since they are new and have people with security experience? I'd expect traditional car makers (Ford, Chevy, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, Nissan) to all be pretty mediocre. And then I'd expect all the tiny companies to be no different than the tiny companies that made the TVs above. reply AlotOfReading 13 hours agoparentThere's actually a strange tradeoff with automotive companies. Security requirements are a big forcing function driving vehicle electronics architectures to modernize and adopt similar security practices to consumer electronics, away from the traditionally developed and profoundly insecure embedded systems of yesteryear. That brings a lot of security features with secure communications, secure boot, signed updates, etc. It also means that all the exploit development that's been done on consumer electronics becomes applicable to vehicle systems. The teams maintaining all of this usually have a LOC/headcount ratio approaching 1 million too. It's a very different threat model than the old days when every manufacturer had their own systems and trying to craft an exploit required individualized work for all of them. reply BiteCode_dev 13 hours agoparentprevEven if the companies took security seriously (which they don't since it rarely affects their bottom line, even in the event of a breach), it's one of the hardest topics in IT, and there are very few people actually competent in it.

Everybody knows everything is easily hacked and companies people tout as exemplars like Apple and Microsoft just keep piling on the abject failures to prove the common wisdom true like it is going out of style. Decades of claimed success followed shortly after by failure after failure should really pound in the lesson: \"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me ten thousand times, shame on me.\" You need systems secure against teams commercially motivated attackers with 10 M$+ budgets and tens of full-time professionals working for years. Nobody in commercial IT would even dare to claim they could stop such attacks even though they are regular occurrences these days. If they do not even dare to say they can do it, why on Earth would anybody believe those vendors have, what, accidentally made things better than they think? Ranking companies by security is like ranking the relative resistance of individual sheets of toilet paper to bullets. Sure, maybe the single ply toilet paper is not as good as the two ply, but neither of them provide objectively useful degrees of protection. And that is just talking about the bare minimum to protect against current threats. If you can hack every Honda at rush hour to turn off the brakes, slam the accelerator, and drive slightly into oncoming traffic how many people do you think would die in the next minute before anything can be done or people informed to stop driving their cars? 1K? 10K? 100K? 1M? Does Honda survive killing more people than died in most wars? If a criminal organization demonstrates they can and will do it, how much would Honda pay in extortion to avoid being put out of existence and their executives jailed? How much security is adequate to avoid the deaths of thousands to millions? Certainly orders of magnitude more than the 10 M$ attacks that steam roll the \"best commercial IT security\" available today. Any reasonable number is vastly in excess of what these companies can secure today. 20 years ago, the hackers were 18 year olds demanding 300 dollars from grandmas. 10 years ago, the hackers were 28 year olds founding businesses demanding 10 thousand dollars from small businesses. Now they are 38 year olds managing teams demanding millions from billion dollar companies. Soon we will see them demanding billions if the trends continue for 5-10 more years. The software security doomsayers were right, just early. Even Mark Zuckerberg took a decade with huge piles of VC funds to get to a multi-billion dollar valuation; you have to forgive the hacking teenagers who had to bootstrap their criminal enterprises for taking so long. reply TiredOfLife 13 hours agoprev [–] It's not Android TV boxes.

However, traditional methods to improve it often lack direct and natural feedback. We propose an innovative and inspiring VR system to experience and improve concentration. In the experience of pulling out the holy sword, which cannot be achieved simply by force, the player receives multimodal concentration feedback in visual, auditory, and haptic senses. We believe that this experience will help the user confront his/her concentration and improve the ability to control it consciously.

The original stories tend to show that Arthur was worthy to become king because he understood he needed to apply the right amount of force, rather than trying to \"overpower\" it.

Making an app like that is not exactly cheap. You need either the right combination of skills or a lot of trial an error, which is either high rate times short time, or low rate times long time. So they probably released this intermediate work to try to gin up some interest to get more funding. Good luck to them. Never really worked out that way for me in my efforts. reply aulin 2 hours agoprevA bit tangent but for me the biggest improvement in concentration I ever experienced came with nutritional ketosis.

See Patanjala Ashtanga Yoga at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashtanga_(eight_limbs_of_yoga) One simple but effective technique is to practice the above three stages by focusing at a point where the eyebrows meet the bridge of the nose. Do this completely relaxed with eyes closed and adjusting the focal point slightly forwards/backwards until you feel a sudden relaxation/jolt (slight but distinct) within the body. Its like a physiological trick but once experienced you will know it and can then use it to calm down and concentrate whenever and wherever as needed. reply noduerme 12 hours agoparentI realize that this is ancient cultural knowledge, and what I'm going to say is very crude and sounds utterly stupid. But I stumbled upon a similar technique wherein I close my eyes and remember my best bowling game ever. That is, a moment which lasted 15 minutes that took place 20 years ago when my body and mind did exactly what I wanted in sync with each other, and performed almost as perfectly together as they ever have. Closing my eyes and re-living it for a few seconds gives me an endorphin rush and releases seratonin that I can feel elevating my mood almost immediately. I only honed in on this one experience in a bowling alley as my escape after years of trying to replicate various high feelings with drugs. Somehow, finding it has become a natural way to re-frame my mind in almost any situation. Although I'm afraid of over-using it, because the chemical effect is pretty powerful. To anyone searching for something like this, I'd recommend thinking of a peak moment in your life - it could be something totally unexpected, like bowling (and listen: I'm not much of a bowler!) Just a moment when everything worked perfectly and you couldn't make a mistake. And try to re-live that moment behind your eyes.

There was the me playing the game, and then there was the me observing the me playing, spectating my own gameplay. By the time I had reached that point, gameplay seemed almost automatic. The enemies seemed to practically fly into my reticle, to be shot down immediately upon appearing. I realized I was somehow blocking my conscious focus from commenting on how I'm playing and offering corrections, leaving my unconscious free to actually do the work of targeting and shooting, as well as my conscious mind free to sit back and enjoy the ride. It was an unprecedented experience of total concentration on a task. A further mindblow occurred when I realized that this is a thematic element in the game. In the upper left corner of the screen is a \"system log\" that describes what you're doing and names the things you're shooting down, that can be said to represent the mind's \"narrator\". But you almost never look at it because you're more concerned with what's happening on the screen. Steering your attention to the log means you'll lose focus on the actual gameplay. Rez is like that. It's almost a metacommentary on the experience of playing it, and experience in general, sometimes. Everyone should play it. ¹ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rez_(video_game) reply rablackburn 12 hours agoparentprevOh neat, I do exactly this and thought it was just another instance of neurodivergent self-soothing behaviour.

For example, Patanjala Ashtanga Yoga gives an all-encompassing framework to learn to focus/concentrate and if needed, experience a distinct supra-normal mental state (i.e. Samadhi). But the last is not necessary and you could use the framework to do and feel better in the everyday activities of life. Here is how to do it; 1) Yama - We are embedded in an environment which influences us. Thus we have to practice restraints w.r.t. the environment to settle on a equilibrium state where we can have some control over how we react to external factors. 2) Niyama - We are active living beings with certain essential everyday needs. These need to be automated away using personal discipline so that we don't have to think and waste precious mental energy on them. 3) Asana - Because \"we\" are housed in a material Body we need to take care of and maintain the body so that it is healthy, strong and free of diseases leaving us free to work on our mental aspects. 4) Pranayama - The Body and the Mind are linked through the Breath. Hence to control the Mind one needs to learn to control the Breath first. The above are the four \"external\" aspects, the four \"internal\" aspects follow; 5) Pratyahara - In order to focus and concentrate on one thing we first need to \"withdraw\" our Mind from other things and this is the practice of such withdrawal. 6) Dharana - Now we focus on one thing; it will be momentary at first but with repeated practice becomes easier. 7) Dhyana - Now we hold our attention for long periods of time on one thing. This is commonly known as Concentration/Contemplation. For all normal everyday activities we can stop at this stage. 8) Samadhi - This is the state where the distinction between subject and object does not exist and the individual has \"dissolved himself\" (called \"Laya\" in Sanskrit). A good common example is when people laugh and cry (literally) with the protagonist when watching a emotional movie. The key here is to be completely permeated by the experience itself with no other thought/emotion/feeling (Classic example - Orgasm). In modern psychology this can be approximated by the \"Flow State\" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology) As you can see, the framework given by Ashtanga Yoga is eminently practical. reply bovermyer 6 hours agoparentprevI tried this and it just made me anxious. I'm probably doing it wrong. reply rramadass 6 hours agorootparentIt is very simple, don't overthink it. Go to a quiet place with no distractions, let go of everything mentally and physically, be totally relaxed, don't think of anything (i.e. Pratyahara) but just try to focus on a point within the blackness (i.e. Dharana) and hold your attention there (i.e. Dhyana) when you feel a distinct bodily sensation. Try and do this before falling asleep in your bed at night and your quality of sleep will improve greatly. You can also do this just after you wake up in the morning in your bed (but before looking at your phone, talking to your spouse etc.) and you will feel more refreshed than normal. Once you get the trick you can actually use a home blood pressure monitor and see the changes in physiological parameters yourself. reply q7xvh97o2pDhNrh 12 hours agoparentprevForward/backward in which dimension? There's at least three or four to sort out. reply rramadass 11 hours agorootparentNothing magical; just front and back of the midpoint between the eyebrows until you settle on a point where you get the sensation. That is why i called it a \"physiological trick\". reply ulnarkressty 11 hours agorootparentBy focus do you mean with your eyes? Do you go cross-eyed? reply TriNetra 8 hours agorootparentTo me focus means to not move the eyes but to bring the attention in that area and be aware of the sensations there. For example, just bring your attention on your left foot big toe at this moment and suddenly you are now aware of your big toe which was not in your awareness otherwise. Just keep your awareness here and you're focusing on it. reply rramadass 8 hours agorootparentThere is a important point to be made here; viz. The physical activity leads the mental focus/attention. In your example, flexing and relaxing the left foot big toe makes it far easier to bring the focus initially on to the activity/sensation at that point and then expanding it to overall awareness. In the exercise i mentioned, you physically focus the eyes at a point in the blackness and the mental focus/attention follows it simultaneously. reply rramadass 10 hours agorootparentprevYes, but not fully cross-eyed, there should be no strain, you are focusing on a point within the \"blackness\" when your eyes are closed. Start with the midpoint between the eyebrows and keep your whole focus/attention on it and nothing else i.e. let go of everything with no other thoughts. Slowly move the focal point back and forth until you literally feel a jolt/dropping sensation. reply advael 10 hours agorootparentprevWell, it was specified that your eyes should be closed, so I think this is supposed to be sort of a proprioceptive attentional spotlight reply rramadass 10 hours agorootparentThat is definitely a part of it. See also https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41538392 reply advael 2 hours agorootparentI wonder how the somatotopic map relates to proprioceptive awareness. I've kind of implicitly assumed that executive functions like the attentional spotlight rely on connecting to that area to accomplish conscious proprioception, does that book go over how it relates? reply advael 11 hours agorootparentprevSaggital plane I think reply musha68k 12 hours agoparentprevInteresting, so you literally >focus Actuater Someone wrote this article in a last night frenzy before some submission deadline didn't they? :P reply asynchronous 13 hours agoprevMaybe I’m not seeing it but would be nice to have some metrics in this study to point to- maybe a control game which changes a fundamental part of the concentration mechanic. reply sandspar 14 hours agoprevIn Harry Potter, it seems like the key difference between successful or unsuccessful spell casting is in one's ability to concentrate. reply kragen 9 hours agoparentalso in programming and math. it's an important ingredient in everything difficult except maybe lateral thinking reply kfrzcode 14 hours agoparentprevIn esoteric muggle magick it is the same. reply swayvil 17 hours agoprevI've gone a bit down the road of concentration enhancement (meditation). There are trippy depths and real magic. And it really isn't that hard. It just takes time and dedication. reply helloplanets 12 hours agoparentMeditation is potent and should be treated as such. The good and the bad, much like any intense experience in life. Something to be especially aware of if you're interested in more than just dipping your toes in there. So, not talking about the basic ten minute guided mindfulness meditation. The meditation community (in the west) has a very weird relationship with the negative side-effects. We also have a poor structure to support any of the weirder effects, without just making the recipient of those just feel way more weird and/or crazy. Which is the result of it being uprooted from an entirely separate framework and brought over, sometimes without much care. In more concrete terms, people have had bad psychotic breaks during/after meditation retreats, or just as a result of going in too deep, etc. You can read more if you are interested: https://harpers.org/archive/2021/04/lost-in-thought-psycholo... https://vivo.brown.edu/display/wbritton This comes as a shock to some people, even if it's obvious that other age old traditions - such as consuming Ayahuasca - should be treated with the utmost respect when it comes to the good and the bad. reply gibbetsandcrows 17 hours agoparentprevWhat was your experience like, and what sort of meditation you were doing? reply swayvil 16 hours agorootparentPlain old concentration meditation with the feeling of breath in the tip of my nose as my object. (this guy calls it \"shrinking\" : https://fleen.org/fluffy_cloud/shrink/ ) As for the experience. Well, first it gets you high. Then it gets really easy. Then you encounter weird stuff and more weird stuff, vast and deep. And that's as far as I'll go with that line of conversation. reply nightowl_games 16 hours agorootparentMy grip on reality is so tight that I can't fathom anything you'd be unwilling to speak about. reply vinceguidry 2 hours agorootparentThen you're perfect for a technique called 'noting', which accelerates results. reply swayvil 16 hours agorootparentprevI've had several conversations about that stuff and they always go downhill fast. (Case in point, the other guy in this thread is already insinuating that I'm diddling demons or somesuch. That's what makyo means) reply ulnarkressty 11 hours agorootparentFrom reading the wiki page I take it to mean hallucinations which one gives greater importance to than they should. Which is sort of similar to what you were describing, I don't think they meant offense. reply CoastalCoder 16 hours agorootparentprev> And that's as far as I'll go with that line of conversation. Can you point us to somewhere that will fill in the blanks? I honestly can't tell if your general take on this approach is positive or negative. If it's negative, I'd rather have a heads-up of some kind. reply crdrost 14 hours agorootparentSome people do have acid flashbacks etc. ... others have described the situation as an “attention pull-up bar,” you try to hold yourself “up” (ie focused), eventually “your arms give” (ie your attention wanders), you “rest” a second (ie acknowledge it), then “pull yourself up” again (ie return to the object of meditation). I was a lay Tibetan Buddhist for several years, sometimes you do focus on one point, or a statue of a Buddha, or on your breathing... the sort of static/repetitive things where you might trigger the psychedelic effects. You can fast-chant Avalokiteshwara’s mantra[1] and Green Tara’s mantra[2] and Vajrasattva’s short mantra[3], but you would also have more dynamic meditations and longer mantras: Vajrasattva’s full mantra[4] is a whole song; so are the Praises of Tara; a full visualization of Green Tara has multiple colors and seed syllables and signs and stages until you visualize her blossoming out of a Lotus and shining green light through you, blasting all your your darknesses away. That last one is not so typical, but like tonglen practice, where you breathe in the darkness of the world and breathe out pureness and goodness, is more active and very common. [1] the familiar Om mani padme hum, which fast-chanted sounds like “hummo-mani-pemde” over and over [2] there are different skin colors of Tara, Green Tara is invoked with Om Tare tuttare ture svaha and fast chanted it sounds like “zohm-tare-t'tare-ture” repeated. [3] his short mantra is just his name, Om Vajrasattva hum. There's also a Japanese tradition of some monk dancing down the street sing-chanting an Amitabha mantra like that, Namu Amita butsu, Namu Amita Butsu. [4] It's known as the 100-syllable mantra, I think? I occasionally look back on my time and say “well was I really a Tibetan Buddhist if I wasn't a monk and didn't keep with it?” and then the Vajrasattva mantra will come back to mind and it's like “Yeah if that's one of the things I have memorized then I definitely count.” reply swayvil 16 hours agorootparentprevIt's positive. I like it. reply gibbetsandcrows 16 hours agorootparentprevThanks, it sounds a little like zazen, but with makyo being the goal. reply swayvil 16 hours agorootparentMakyo? Seriously? reply gibbetsandcrows 15 hours agorootparentIt sounds like the only difference between makyo and what you've experienced is whether you think it's 'real' or not...but I don't have a whole lot of detail to go on here, either. I'm not judging the 'realness', I'm just saying that two similar methods are producing similar results. At least subjectively. reply theptip 15 hours agorootparentSounds more like Jhana to me. reply wslh 16 hours agorootparentprevI wanted to share an unexpected experience I had during a yoga class, specifically a class that included pranayama practice, under the guidance of a particular teacher. This wasn’t something I sought out, and it hasn't repeated since, but it left a strong impression. During the session, I distinctly felt what could be described as the \"opening of the third eye.\" However, the sensation was much more mechanical than subtle, almost as if my forehead was literally opening up. It felt real, but strangely, it wasn’t part of the practice or anything the teacher mentioned. After the session, everything went back to normal; it was just this momentary experience during the practice. I’ve never come across descriptions of it happening this way in any readings on yoga or meditation. Has anyone else had a similar experience? reply TriNetra 8 hours agorootparentNot exactly sure whether you meant it but here's the thing: energies rise up with meditation/pranayama. These give you sensations in different parts of the body most notably in your eyebrow/forehead/etc. Experiences like Hollow, digging, pricking, massaging etc.. I've not just experienced profound sensations, but I live with them. In every session I experience them daily. IN fact, I'm experiencing them right this moment while typing, in my forehead, a deep, hollow like sensation, as if some energies are digging some hole in the forehead. This is not painful or discomforting. reply wslh 6 hours agorootparentThere are many different experiences, and from a mystical perspective, infinite forms of yoga. Your comment seems to suggest that this is a normal sensation, but for me, it felt anything but normal. What I’m trying to clarify is that while I did feel a very strange sensation, I wasn't necessarily describing the same thing you experience regularly. When I look into descriptions of third eye sensations, they don’t match what I felt, which is why it remains a mystery to me. reply bigcat12345678 18 hours agoprev [–] bene gesserit vibe hit hard Now there is a path forward to be able to focus on a single cell in my body. LoL reply kherud 12 hours agoparent [–] That was my association as well! Dune even uses similar vocabulary.

I don’t believe for a second that their fentanyl interceptions will sufficiently improve otherwise. The reality is that the margin is so strong, other methods (if small individual parcels were even a factor) would fill any gap. Even more interceptions would just lead to more shipments. That’s how good the margins are. reply tazu 11 hours agoparentI doubt more than 2% of the fentanyl in the US comes direct from China.

The solutions are completely different. reply firesteelrain 3 hours agorootparentGP was making a political point not a practical one reply JumpCrisscross 2 hours agorootparentprev> Majority of the fentanyl was backpacked in No. This should be plainly obvious for anyone who understands the scale and economies of logistics.

So that is predominantly being backpacked across the border.\" And that seizure is from only a vanishing minority of migrants who were searched. Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants are just sneak in without any checking. The formal ports of entry undergo far more validation and hence more stuff is found. reply jncfhnb 6 hours agorootparentPerhaps you should also quote the part from the same article that states it’s American citizens doing the smuggling, not illegal immigrants reply addicted 5 hours agorootparentOne can agree that illegal immigration is a problem that needs to be stemmed. But where’s the fun in that. The real fun lies in dehumanizing the illegal immigrants so one can hopefully start a pogrom against them.

So, no, I think your assertion is very ill informed reply JumpCrisscross 2 hours agorootparentprev> tens of thousands of illegal immigrants are just sneak in without any checking One TEU can weigh up to 67,500 lbs [1]. Humans can’t carry more than 20 to 30% of their body weight for meaningful distances. To rival the capacity of a single container, assuming only really fit men, you’d need 1,350 backpackers (assuming 200 lb men carrying 50 lbs each, which is ridiculous). If every one of the nation’s 2mm illegal crossers were a fit man carrying their maximum load on a backpack, it would total to the tonnage of 1,500 containers. The Port of LA processed over 500x that in June [2]. The throughput at a signal American port is 3+ orders of magnitude more than could possibly be carried by every illegal border crosser by backpack. It’s wild for anyone with a basic sense of numeracy to believe that humans carrying backpacks are bringing a material amount of anything into this country, let alone a product for mass consumption.

I have to assume it’s intentionally not being changed. Qui bono? reply bruce511 15 hours agoparentThe problem with closing loopholes that are being exploited is that it can be hard to do without causing unwelcome side effects. In other words, the loophole exists for a reason. If you \"close\" it you may cause good in one area but harm in others. So at the very least one should move slowly to at least understand the issue properly, beyond just the obvious exploitation. For example (and since I know nothing about small parcel imports, I'll use something I'm more familiar with) there's often a knee-jerk reaction to the exploitation of IP laws (trademark, copyright, patents). Some suggest killing it all. Some favor dumping patents but keeping the rest, and so on. But any change will have \"unexpected\" consequences. These tools are used by businesses of all sizes and means. Killing copyright because you dont like Microsoft would equally kill things like Free Software (because it would invalidate the freedoms enforced by the GPL.) So while \"immediate action\" seems like a good thing at first glance, it seldom works out that way. Throwing tarrifs on imported goods protects local jobs, but equally drives up prices (aka inflation). So charitably I interpret \"intentionally not neighbors changed\" to \"being changed intentionally, with care to achieve the desired effect not some unwelcome side effect. reply roenxi 14 hours agorootparent> Killing copyright because you dont like Microsoft would equally kill things like Free Software (because it would invalidate the freedoms enforced by the GPL.) The point is a good one but the example was chosen a little quickly. It'd kill the GPL because the GPL is part of copyright law. That much is simple to see. But it'd probably be a net win for user freedom. Right now, people choose to use free software either because it is good (and would see no difference if the GPL disappeared) or because it is free (and, again, would make decisions the same way in a no-IP world - only use software where the source is available). So the only risk is people copying an OSS project as free riders, withholding source changes and using some sort of embrace-extend-extinguish strategy. But EEE relies on proprietary extensions, so that strategy probably doesn't work without the support of IP law. The OS projects could clone features back in. Proprietary providers could fight back with a client server model - but AWS for example already does that so it isn't really new and the equilibrium is generally to contribute upstream anyway. I would expect software freedoms to improve if we lost the GPL as part of a big removal of IP laws. There'd be tactical instances where people were worse off, maybe. But strategically the OSS community would just be in a better position. They can keep doing what they do, it is harder to sue them and difficult to profit off their work in ways that aren't already possible. reply commodoreboxer 14 hours agorootparentprev> Killing copyright because you dont like Microsoft would equally kill things like Free Software (because it would invalidate the freedoms enforced by the GPL.) Without copyright, the GPL wouldn't need to exist because the freedoms it protects would be impossible to suppress. reply peeters 14 hours agorootparentI'm not sure I see how that's true. The GPL puts a legal onus on modifiers to publish their modifications to the source with distributions of the software. Without copyright, any other party might be legally entitled to use and redistribute said modifications, but the modifier wouldn't be compelled to publish them. reply samus 12 hours agorootparentThat's not really the problem the GPL is intended to fight against. The source code can usually somehow be recovered via decompiling. But that's illegal in the presence of copyright, and even reverse engineering is a legal minefield further encumbered by patents. reply JumpCrisscross 11 hours agorootparent> source code can usually somehow be recovered via decompiling Absent IP, ceteris paribus, you'd run as much code as possible on your servers and obfuscate what you deliver to a client. There would be an entire industry in producing technical DRM. reply samus 7 hours agorootparentThat's what the AGPL is designed to cover, and I think it's a major reason why a lot of software nowadays runs in the cloud. This is already a common way to circumvent the GPL. Obfuscation only gets you so far. But faithfully recovering the original source code is not really the point. Even heavily obfuscated code is useful and can be worked with since in the end the program is still doing what it's supposed to do. reply immibis 5 hours agorootparentprevThis is already possible with GPL and copyright, and companies do it. Hence the SSPL. reply labcomputer 7 hours agorootparentprevOk, so why is are GPL licenses so popular compared to BSD and MIT licenses? Why did the GNU foundation even bother writing a license at all? Those other licenses do not require republishing, so it seems that authors of OSS value the additional republication requirements provided by the GPL license. Even in under the current copyright regime, one can (perhaps other-than-legally) decompile binary to recover source-like code, and then launder and reinject the learned improvements back into the open source project. And the GPL license does not universally grant patent rights back to the source project. reply bruce511 13 hours agorootparentprevExactly what I meant. GPL requires modifications to be released. That us precisely what differentiates it from public domain. reply Arnt 8 hours agorootparentprevThis \"loophole\" is likely to be motivated be the cost of processing small transactions. If customs officers spend two minutes per parcel, then it makes sense to exempt parcels for which the expected revenue doesn't even cover one minute's labour cost. Where I live, parcels with an expected revenue below the price of a cup of espresso are exempt. The definition is different, of course. reply yunohn 12 hours agorootparentprevThe word “loophole” usually means a bypass of a law/rule in its spirit due to its language, thus leading to a void / gray area of enforcement that is beneficial to the exploiter. I say that because everytime the topic of “closing a loophole” comes up, HNers act like it’s metaphysically impossible. But if you just think a little bit more, you’d realize that the existence of a loophole shows that the said law is specifically NOT covering the edge cases, but is covering the general cases without problems. Hence, fixing it would most likely affect the exploited case, not the beneficial case. reply bawolff 10 hours agorootparent> existence of a loophole shows that the said law is specifically NOT covering the edge cases, but is covering the general cases without problems. Hence, fixing it would most likely affect the exploited case, not the beneficial case. I don't think that follows. Certainly that is true sometimes, but sometimes fixing edge cases can mess up the general case. Or at least its not always immediately obvious how to close the loop hole without unintended consequences. reply surgical_fire 7 hours agorootparentprevNot always. Many times a loophole is something that exists as a logical consequence of other laws and regulations, and people (actually normally corporations) abuse those to their own benefit. reply AmericanChopper 11 hours agorootparentprevThe possibility you’re not acknowledging is that the “spirit of the law” is trying to achieve something that cannot be done, or at least not done without massively modifying the way a system works to an unacceptable level. Law makers know this, but it’s not really a problem for them because they can write their bad law, leave it full of “loopholes” to be “exploited”, and then just cry about some loophole exploiting boogeyman to their constituents and donors as the reason their law making efforts have failed. If you wanted to be cynical you might even suggest that this is the desired outcome and a way of managing circumstances where donor and constituent interest are in conflict, or perhaps just a way of signalling that you’re delivering on a policy promise, when in reality you can’t. Corporate tax avoidance is a great example of this. The only feature you need your laws to have to facilitate corporate tax avoidance is the ability to incur a deductible expense to an offshore entity. The only thing corporate tax law loophole closing ever achieves is to make corporate tax avoidance procedures more complicated, thus making them only accessible to more sophisticated tax avoiders. There is no conceivable way of closing these “loopholes” without extreme protectionism or isolationism. It would basically require ending globalization or at least removing your country from the globalized economy. A solution that most people would find completely unacceptable. reply yunohn 10 hours agorootparentI fully agree that these loopholes are intentional, but I definitely don’t think they’re unavoidable. The problem is just that the ones (politicians and companies) writing the laws are the ones who want the loopholes. The lawyers who could work on improving laws, are instead helping companies find creative avoidance techniques. reply AmericanChopper 10 hours agorootparentThey’re not unavoidable, they can just potentially come at an unacceptable cost. In the corporate tax instance, literally the only thing you need to implement corporate tax avoidance is the ability to incur a deductible expense to an offshore company. No matter what other laws you write, if you can do that you can avoid corporate tax. If you can’t do that then you don’t have economic globalization (or you’re not participating in it at least). This unrealistic wishful thinking you seem to be exhibiting is something I think politicians intentionally prey on. If some politician can convince you that it is possible to “fix this”, but without the all the obviously mandatory costs and tradeoffs, then they can also potentially convince you that they can and will do it. This particular policy issue has been a part of many political platforms, yet nobody has ever “fixed it”, because it cannot be fixed (at least not without also ruining a lot of other things). reply yunohn 10 hours agorootparent> the only thing you need to implement corporate tax avoidance is the ability to incur a deductible expense to an offshore company > This unrealistic wishful thinking Quite the contrary, for some reason you seem to have a cognitive dissonance about the sheer complexity of tax laws. The loophole is not as simple as “anything can be offshored” - there’s a significant nuance involved in what is possible even now. reply AmericanChopper 9 hours agorootparentI own several companies that have a large pile of transfer pricing agreements, I’m very familiar with the nature and complexity of international tax laws. All corporate tax avoidance is, is incurring offshore expenses to shuffle profits offshore. As long as you can do that, there is literally no way to prevent the tax avoidance. The only thing you can do is make it more complicated. This is also the reason most developed economies have given up on regulating transfer pricing any more than they already have, and instead the strategy has shifted to trying to get the tax havens to implement or increase their corporate taxes. That’s why the “global minimum corporate tax rate” idea has recently emerged, and why the EU uses their black and grey lists to coerce foreign jurisdictions to write new tax laws. This strategy is arguably more effective, but still a complete failure, because you have some tax haven jurisdictions that simply ignore the pressure, and other tax havens are simply never sanctioned because they have sufficient leverage in the global economy to avoid the attention entirely. It is very literally a choice between corporate tax, or globalization. There is no way to have both. reply samus 6 hours agorootparentThe issue is neither corporate tax nor globalization, but the difference between corporate tax rates, which provides an incentive in the first place to shuffle profits offshore. A solution could be to tax offshore expenses with the difference in tax rates, i.e., min(0, corporate tax rate -destination company's corporate tax rate)%. That would eliminate the advantage of lower tax rates at the destination. Another way would be to allow deducting only min(100, 100 - corporate tax rate + destination company's corporate tax rate)% of the offshore expenses. That still provides benefits for shuffling profits offshore, but the origin location gets some of it. reply AmericanChopper 5 hours agorootparentThis is just a reinvention of the global minimum corporate tax effort, and it would fail for exactly the same reasons. Except, with the added benefit of making corporate tax avoidance procedures more complicated, without actually accomplishing anything (now you need to offshore your profits to a friendly high tax jurisdiction before offshoring them again to a low tax one). Also, aside from the fact that this policy would fail, what you’re describing is a rather extreme import tarrif, which is a highly protectionist policy. reply yunohn 7 hours agorootparentprevHonestly, I just don’t buy it’s impossible to properly handle global taxation. Governments do it just fine for normal individuals. Small to medium businesses also pay their taxes pretty fairly. It says something profound about the system, if the avoidance needs large complicated structures to do so. Something something lack of moral compass. reply AmericanChopper 4 hours agorootparentThen explain your solution for doing so, or show me a jurisdiction that has managed it and explain how. In reality no jurisdiction has ever achieved this, and for the reasons I have explained. Real people also manage to avoid their taxes all the time. People complain about the rich not paying their taxes every day. People can also offshore their income in mostly the same way a company can, with the only additional complication being residency requirements. I just finished watching the F1 qualifying, a sport that has 1 Monegasque athlete, but nearly half of its currently active athlete living in Monaco. If you want a system of global tax governance, then you’d need a global government.

Perhaps they want to delay it as much as possible: Can we produce Milwaukee branded silicone spatulas 3-for-$6.99? reply yunohn 12 hours agorootparentThere is no “may” be inflationary. The entirety of Western civilization is built on and its future is predicated on a perpetual cheaper labor class both at home and abroad. That’s the only way the people can even survive right now. The moment things change, like minimum wage, oil prices, input costs - anything produced (even partially locally) jumps in cost. We have been seeing this happen constantly over the past decade. reply mensetmanusman 3 hours agorootparentThat used to be true, but automation is real. Low cost labour simply delays automation. reply yunohn 2 hours agorootparentI’m not sure if you’ve seen the news over the past decade, but most low cost labor countries like China are aeons ahead in automation. They’re just optimizing further and further, while the West just offshores and outsources everything. reply mensetmanusman 1 hour agorootparentYes, that is why increasing tariffs and using that savings to subsidize automation in the US is the correct policy. reply yunohn 52 minutes agorootparentI don’t think tariffs will solve much, since people still want to buy those goods.
