As for blame, I haven't used it since learning about git log -L. Vastly superior in my opinion. reply dr_kretyn 15 hours agoprevThe thing that prevents me from using delta is lack of \"system\" theme detection.

Bat itself doesn't do system theme detection, but it's easy enough to do in a script - I have one that gets called when my system theme changes where I set themes for various programs.

How does syntax coloring help in this context? I don't use syntax coloring at all in my editor, I don't think it adds any information or clues that help me understand the code. I think colored diff output (beyond red for deleted and green for added) just adds distractions. reply lucasoshiro 6 hours agoparentDelta can show in the terminal a diff that looks like the GitHub one. You can compare side by side what was changed. It also highlight with more strength what changed inside the line. I installed it once, and never came back to the standard diff output. If Delta doesn't work like you expected and you want a standard diff output temporarily, no problem, you can run Git with git -c core.pager=less Note also that if you redirect the Git output, Git is smart enough to not call the pager (in this case, Delta) This is a case of personal taste. My only complaint about Delta is its name. Delta is already a concept in Git, and every time that I need to search about it is a pain...

    "title": "I quit Google to work for myself (2018)",
    "originLink": "https://mtlynch.io/why-i-quit-google/",
    "originBody": "Why I Quit Google to Work for Myself February 28, 2018 13-minute read entrepreneurship • google • sia For the past four years, I’ve worked as a software developer at Google. On February 1st, I quit. It was because they refused to buy me a Christmas present. Well, I guess it’s a little more complicated than that. The first two years 🔗︎ Two years in, I loved Google. When the annual employee survey asked me whether I expected to be at Google in five years, it was a no-brainer. Of course I’d still be at Google in five years. I was surrounded by the best engineers in the world, using the most advanced development tools in the world, and eating the free-est food in the world. My most recent performance rating was “Strongly Exceeds Expectations.” If I just kept going, I’d soon be promoted to the next level, Senior Software Engineer. What a great title! Forever after in my career, I’d be able to say, “Yes, I was a Senior Software Engineer. At Google.” People would be so impressed. My manager assured me that my promotion was close. He felt that I was already capable of senior-level work. I just needed the right project to prove it to the promotion committee. Your manager doesn’t promote you? 🔗︎ No, managers at Google can’t promote their direct reports. They don’t even get a vote. Instead, promotion decisions come from small committees of upper-level software engineers and managers who have never heard of you until the day they decide on your promotion. You apply for promotion by assembling a “promo packet”: a collection of written recommendations from your teammates, design documents you’ve created, and mini-essays you write to explain why your work merits a promotion. A promotion committee then reviews your packet with a handful of others, and they spend the day deciding who gets promoted and who doesn’t. During my two-year honeymoon phase, this system sounded great to me. Of course my fate should be in the hands of a mysterious committee who’s never met me. They wouldn’t be tainted by any sort of favoritism or politics. They’d see past all that and recognize me for my high-quality code and shrewd engineering decisions. That’s not really how it works 🔗︎ Before I put together my first promo packet, I never thought about the logistics of how it all worked. In my head, the promotion committee was this omniscient and fair entity. If I spent each day choosing the right problems to solve, making the codebase better, and helping my team execute efficiently, the promotion committee would magically know this and reward me for it. Unsurprisingly, it doesn’t work like that. It took me two years to figure that out. Working naïvely 🔗︎ My main responsibility until that point was a legacy data pipeline. It had been in maintenance mode for years, but load had increased, and the pipeline was buckling under the pressure. It frequently died silently or produced incorrect output. Its failures took days to diagnose because nobody had written documentation for it since its original design spec. I proudly and lovingly nursed the pipeline back to health. I fixed dozens of bugs and wrote automated tests to make sure they wouldn’t reappear. I deleted thousands of lines of code that were either dead or could be replaced by modern libraries. I documented the pipeline as I learned it so that the institutional knowledge was available to my teammates instead of siloed in my head. The problem, as I discovered at promotion time, was that none of this was quantifiable. I couldn’t prove that anything I did had a positive impact on Google. Metrics or it didn’t happen 🔗︎ The pipeline didn’t record many metrics. The ones it did have made it look like things had gotten worse. My bug discoveries caused the overall bug count to increase. The pipeline’s failures increased because I made it fail fast on anomalies instead of silently passing along bad data. I drastically reduced the time developers spent repairing those failures, but there were no metrics that tracked developer time. My other work didn’t look so good on paper either. On several occasions, I put my projects on hold for weeks or even months at a time to help a teammate whose launch was at risk. It was the right decision for the team, but it looked unimpressive in a promo packet. To the promotion committee, my teammate’s project was the big, important work that demanded coordination from multiple developers. If they hornswoggled me into helping them, it’s evidence of their strong leadership qualities. I was just the mindless peon whose work was so irrelevant that it could be pre-empted at a moment’s notice. I submitted my first promo packet, and the results were what I feared: the promotion committee said that I hadn’t proven I could handle technical complexity, and they couldn’t see the impact I had on Google. Learning from rejection 🔗︎ The rejection was a difficult blow, but I wasn’t discouraged. I felt I was performing above my level, but the promotion committee couldn’t see it. That was solvable. I decided that I had been too naïve in my first couple years. I didn’t do enough planning up front to make sure the work I was doing left a paper trail. Now that I understood how the process worked, I could keep doing the same good work, just with better record-keeping. For example, my team was receiving tons of distracting email alerts due to false alarms. Old me would have just fixed these alerts. But now I knew that for this work to appear in my promo packet, I should first set up metrics so that we’d have historical records of alert frequency. At promotion time, I’d have an impressive-looking graph of the alerts trending downward. Shortly after, I was assigned a project that seemed destined for promotion. It depended heavily on machine-learning, which was and still is the hot thing at Google. It would automate a task that hundreds of human operators were doing manually, so it had a clear, objective impact on Google. It also required me to lead a junior developer throughout the project, which generally won points with promotion committees. The holiday gift wake up call 🔗︎ A few months later, Google made headlines when they ended their long-standing tradition of giving lavish holiday gifts to all of their employees. Instead, they used the gift budget to buy advertising disguised as charity Chromebooks for underprivileged schoolchildren. Shortly after this, I witnessed the following conversation between two employees: Employee A: You effectively are still getting the gift. Cuts like these increase the value of Google’s stock. You can sell your stock grants and buy any present you choose. Employee B: What if I told my wife that I wasn’t buying her a Christmas gift, but she could use the money in our bank account to buy any present she wants? Employee A: You’re in a business relationship with Google. If you’re disappointed that Google isn’t “romancing” you with gifts like you do for your wife, you have a misguided notion of the relationship. Wait a second. I was in a business relationship with Google. It may sound strange that it took me two and a half years to realize it, but Google does a good job of building a sense of community within the organization. To make us feel that we’re not just employees, but that we are Google. That conversation made me realize that I’m not Google. I provide a service to Google in exchange for money. So if Google and I have a business relationship that exists to serve each side’s interests, why was I spending time on all these tasks that served Google’s interests instead of my own? If the promotion committee doesn’t reward bugfixing or team support work, why was I doing that? Optimizing for promotion 🔗︎ My first denied promotion taught me the wrong lesson. I thought I could keep doing the same work but package it to look good for the promotion committee. I should have done the opposite: figure out what the promotion committee wants, and do that work exclusively. I adopted a new strategy. Before starting any task, I asked myself whether it would help my case for promotion. If the answer was no, I didn’t do it. My quality bar for code dropped from, “Will we be able to maintain this for the next 5 years?” to, “Can this last until I’m promoted?” I didn’t file or fix any bugs unless they risked my project’s launch. I wriggled out of all responsibilities for maintenance work. I stopped volunteering for campus recruiting events. I went from conducting one or two interviews per week to zero. Then my project was canceled 🔗︎ Priorities shifted. Management traded my project away to our sister team in India. In exchange, that team gave us one of their projects. It was an undocumented system, built on deprecated infrastructure, but it was nevertheless a critical component in production. I was assigned to untangle it from our sister team’s code and migrate it to a new framework, all while keeping it running in production and hitting its performance metrics. As far as my promotion was concerned, this was a setback of several months. Because I hadn’t released anything for my canceled project, the two months I spent on it were worthless. It would take me weeks just to get up to speed on the system I was inheriting, and I was liable to lose several more in the gruntwork of keeping it operational. What am I even doing? 🔗︎ It was the third time in six months that my manager had reassigned me midway through a project. Each time, he assured me that it had nothing to do with the quality of my work, but rather some shift in upper management strategy or team headcount. At this point, I took a step back to assess what was happening from a high level. Forget my manager, forget his managers, forget the promotion committee. What if I boiled it down to just me and just Google? What was happening in our “business relationship?” Well, Google kept telling me that it couldn’t judge my work until it saw me complete a project. Meanwhile, I couldn’t complete any projects because Google kept interrupting them midway through and assigning me new ones. The dynamic felt absurd. My career was being dictated by a shifting, anonymous committee who thought about me for an hour of their lives. Management decisions that I had no input into were erasing months of my career progress. Worst of all, I wasn’t proud of my work. Instead of asking myself, “How can I solve this challenging problem?” I was asking, “How can I make this problem look challenging for promotion?” I hated that. Even if I got the promotion, what then? Popular wisdom said that each promotion was exponentially harder than the last. To continue advancing my career, I’d need projects that were even larger in scope and involved collaboration with more partner teams. But that just meant the project could fail due to even more factors outside my control, wasting months or years of my life. What’s the alternative? 🔗︎ Around this time, I discovered Indie Hackers. It’s an online community for founders of small software businesses. Emphasis on small. These weren’t Zuckerberg hopefuls, but rather people who wanted to build modest, profitable businesses that pay their bills. I had always been interested in starting my own software company, but I only knew of the Silicon Valley startup path. I thought being a software founder meant spending most of my time fundraising and the rest of it worrying about how to attract my next million users. Indie Hackers presented an attractive alternative. Most members built their businesses with their own savings or as side projects to their full-time jobs. They didn’t answer to investors, and they certainly didn’t have to prove themselves to anonymous committees. There were downsides, of course. Their income was less steady, and they faced more numerous catastrophic risks. If I ever made a mistake at Google that cost the company $10 million, I would suffer no consequences. I’d be asked to write a post-mortem, and everyone would celebrate the learning opportunity. For most of these founders, a $10 million mistake would mean the end of their business and several lifetimes of debt. Founders on Indie Hackers captivated me because they were in control. Whether their business became a runaway success or stagnated for years, they were calling the shots. At Google, I didn’t feel in control of my own projects, much less my career growth or my team’s direction. I thought about it for months and finally decided. I wanted to be an Indie Hacker. One last thing before I leave 🔗︎ I still had unfinished business at Google. After investing three years into my promotion, I hated the idea of leaving with nothing to show for it. There were only a few months left until I could reapply for promotion, so I decided to give it one last shot. Six weeks before the performance period ended, my project was canceled. Again. Actually, my whole team was canceled. This was a common enough occurrence at Google that there was a euphemism for it: a defrag. Management transferred my team’s projects to our sister team in India. My teammates and I all had to start over in different areas of the company. I applied for the promotion anyway. Weeks later, my manager read me the results. My performance rating was “Superb,” the highest possible score, given to around 5% of employees each cycle. The promotion committee noted that in the past six months, I clearly demonstrated senior-level work. These were, uncoincidentally, the months when I was optimizing for promotion. But they felt that six months wasn’t a long enough track record, so… better luck next time. My manager told me I had a strong chance at promotion if I did the same quality work for another six months. I can’t say I wasn’t tempted, but by that point, I’d been hearing, “great shot at promotion in six months,” for the past two years. It was time to go. What’s next? 🔗︎ When I tell people I left Google, they assume I must have some brilliant startup idea. Only an idiot would leave a job as cushy as Google Software Engineer. But I am indeed an idiot with no idea. My plan is to try different projects for a few months each to see if any of them catch on, for example: Continue working on KetoHub to see if I can make it profitable Build a business on top of Sia, a distributed storage technology I’ve written about frequently Spend more time writing, and look for ways to earn money from it Google was a great place to work, and I learned valuable skills during my time there. Leaving was difficult because I had more to learn, but there will always be employers like Google. I won’t always have the freedom to start my own company, so I look forward to seeing where this takes me.

    "commentBody": "I quit Google to work for myself (2018) (mtlynch.io)314 points by alexzeitler 22 hours agohidepastfavorite185 comments shoo 19 hours agothe same author has also published an interesting series of \"annual review\" blog posts summarising his progress trying to get different software businesses off the ground -- including being quite open about the finances. If you're interested in boostrapping a software business, and haven't seen them, they're well worth reading: https://mtlynch.io/tags/annual-review/ https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/ reply Etheryte 19 hours agoparentA good highlight of what quitting your job can look like: > Six years ago, I quit my job as a developer at Google to create my own bootstrapped software company. For the first few years, all of my businesses flopped. The best of them earned a few hundred dollars per month in revenue, but none were profitable. We often hear about the successes, and it is easy to be loud with success, but it's important to keep in mind the ground truth: most companies fail. It's nice to see that for this author, three years in he did manage to find something that made money, but realistically most people don't have that much runway to keep at it without generating income. reply nostrademons 19 hours agorootparentIt's an interesting reality check that in 2023, six years into his journey as a bootstrapped founder, Tiny Pilot made $225K in profit on ~$1M on revenue. For 2021 and 2022, it made roughly a $5K profit; the rest was all losses. He quit Google because he couldn't get a promotion presumably from L4 to L5, but $225K is less than what an L4 makes. This might also be a microcosm of why the working class is pissed off in America, because looking at this experience, the optimal strategy for revenue is to blow smoke up the ass of a wealthy corporation until they give you a fat stock grant, then claim credit for the work of others so that they give you more. reply sangnoir 11 hours agorootparent> This might also be a microcosm of why the working class is pissed off in America I know it's topical, but I really don't think the working class on America is pissed because they are struggling to increase their annual income from $350,000 to $500,000 at their Big Tech job. That's an elites-problem; or whatever you choose to call anyone in the top 5% earning bracket. reply safety1st 1 hour agorootparentMaybe not when you put it that way, but small businesses used to be a larger share of the economy and a more viable \"rags to riches\" path than they are today. The system is undoubtedly rigged to favor large businesses - most people understand that intuitively but the anti-trust cases the government is currently prosecuting and in many cases winning are hard evidence of how the US really punted on protecting the small businesses from the big ones over the last few decades. You aren't going to find many people in the working class who disagree with the idea that big corporations should be cut down to size and we should have an economic system that's friendlier to people who want to be their own boss. reply mcdeltat 8 hours agorootparentprevI don't know about America, but keep in mind that having an income which is a large number doesn't necessarily mean you have tonnes of wealth (in most general sense of the word), due to cost of living. In my country, you could be in the top 5% of earners and still not be automatically set or life or anything like that, because tax and housing is so bloody expensive it's ridiculous. Even on $200k+ you're still stuck at that job for a decade or more to afford a low-to-mid tier house/apartment, unless you have generational wealth. No, you won't be homeless, which is a lot to be thankful for, but you're still pretty locked in to being a wage minion. In my country, I reckon the top 5% earning is more like where the average should be, in order for the average person to have a decent life. reply amrocha 3 hours agorootparentBeing “stuck” at a job for a decade, living a life with zero financial worries, does not compare to the average worker who has to work for 40+ years, cannot afford to purchase property, and has to rely on social security in old age when they can’t work anymore. Claiming these are anywhere comparable is an incredibly lack of perspective. reply saagarjha 8 hours agorootparentprevThat depends on how you live your life. Most of the people who are making even the top 1% of the salaries in the US are probably not set for life. They could be if they quit immediately and moved to Vietnam maybe, but otherwise their cash is probably locked up in a house or spent on things like their car or school for their kids. reply elegantlie 4 hours agorootparentprevI worked in big tech in one of the coastal cities. Most of my coworkers, although great people, were delusional in terms of money. I was getting paid between 200k to 400k during my tenure, and after working there a few years, I was set for life. Reality check: even in \"high cost of living areas\", typical salaries are around 50k. Most of my coworkers came from wealthy families and perceived buying condos in Chelsea as middle class activities. I don't think they saw themselves as rich. And to be fair, many probably didn't actually save that much money, because they had such expensive lifestyles. reply avereveard 10 hours agorootparentprevSide of the same coin. Salaryman earning millions are still salaryman. You're bounded to the whims of the employer, and can lose it all from the ups and down of the personal relationships that surround you. The American dream is not the rich employee, is moving out to that relationship and build something you own. Building something that is bounded to the marked at large and can weather the individual change of whims is increasingly harder as megacorp are capturing more and more value in every corner of the market. The entire mechanism that elevated the working class to entrepreneurship is broken and the effects do include a working class increasingly repressed, at ever income bracket. reply amrocha 3 hours agorootparentNo they’re not. A “salaryman” earning millions has financial independence in 5 years maximum if they so choose. Most people are forced to work or starve. These are not the same. reply avereveard 2 hours agorootparent> has financial independence well yeah the dream is not the salaryman lifestile, but the financial independence, thanks for agreeing with me reply nostrademons 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's not the dollar values so much as the incentive structure. I think most Americans have a core value of \"work hard, get compensated for your work\". There's a basic value of fairness and meritocracy, that you can take steps to control your destiny and will be rewarded proportionally. When you've been at Google for a few years these days, you realize that this isn't really true. Nobody knows or cares how good a programmer you are. Nobody really cares how hard you work either. Your ability to get promoted is basically dependent upon how well your manager knows how to work the system and then whether you listen to your manager. I'm an eng manager there; I am relatively good at working the system, having gotten my reports 4 promotions in the last 2 years. My tech lead does all the actual work, because he actually cares about product quality, knows the code well, mentors the team effectively, and is a nice guy to work with. My job is just to get him promoted (which I've done, twice) and ensure that he doesn't leave. The last promotion packet hinged on work that took him maybe a couple months to do, but that I managed to spin into a big complex project, because it was stuff that folks at the Director/VP level cared about deeply but had no idea how to do. All the rest of the two years, the time spent fixing bugs and improving code health and mentoring the team and delivering small usability improvements, was basically ignored (don't tell him or the rest of the team!) because it fell below the radar screens of the decision-makers who hold the purse strings. When it comes to the working class, I suspect that most of them would like to be able to take pride in their work and be rewarded for it. To make money because they did a particularly clean plumbing job, and not because they paid off Yelp to increase their rating to 4.5 stars or happened to run the right Google AdWords. But that's not the world we live in, salesmanship and paying the right taxes to the right overlords matters more than actually doing the job well, and people are pissed about it. reply whack 5 minutes agorootparentprev> This might also be a microcosm of why the working class is pissed off in America, because looking at this experience, the optimal strategy for revenue is to blow smoke up the ass of a wealthy corporation until they give you a fat stock grant, then claim credit for the work of others so that they give you more. Here's an alternate take. A competitive free market has squeezed corporate profits so much, that most would-be-capitalists would be better off joining the working class instead. Consider the alternative where anyone who doesn't have the financial means to build their own company, is relegated to a sub-par quality of life. reply rvnx 19 hours agorootparentprevA big factor for early employees (not N. 1 or 2, but the first XXXX) is purely being lucky to be in the right place at the right time. https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/stroke-of-...

And I might have even retired earlier absent COVIVD. Not spectacular sums but certainly reasonable amounts given owning a house and modest travel sums. reply teaearlgraycold 18 hours agorootparentprevYou really shouldn't quit Google if your plan is to get rich. You should quit if you don't care too much about money and want more interesting work than being a cog in a lucrative machine. reply matwood 9 hours agorootparentYeah. Google or any of the big techs are the lowest risk paths to economic stability and independence. Anyone with the ability to work on one should absolutely take it. reply saagarjha 8 hours agorootparentThose who have the ability to take such a path often have other paths available to them that they can take with more risk–because the low risk path is always available to them as a fallback. reply I_AM_A_SMURF 11 hours agorootparentprev> This might also be a microcosm of why the working class is pissed off in America, because looking at this experience, the optimal strategy for revenue is to blow smoke up the ass of a wealthy corporation until they give you a fat stock grant, then claim credit for the work of others so that they give you more. I mean getting a job as a SWE at Google is hardly a good strategy if you don't enjoy writing software.

Great inspiration source reply phyzix5761 16 hours agoprevI think you learned the most important lesson of any career: the customer is not your customer. The person/people who control your raise, bonus, and promotion are your real customers. Think about it like this. A customer is the entity that exchanges money for something they value; like a good or service. That's usually your manager. Or in the case of OP the promotion committee. (Many times it's both your manager and the promotion committee). They are the ones who directly control your money (raise, bonus, promotion, etc). With that perspective in mind it makes sense to manage your career as a business where you're doing things to increase the rate at which you deliver value to the entity which can trade money for that value. Many of the setbacks you faced are very common when trying to run your own business. The customer changes their mind, the market shifts the goal posts, you realize you're focusing on the wrong things. Like a business you have to constantly change your strategy and adapt to the customer; not the other way around. Why? Because the customer can very easily get their goods or services from someone else if you can't deliver what they want. reply heresie-dabord 8 hours agoparent> the most important lesson of any career: The person/people who control your raise, bonus, and promotion are your real customers. Such is a \"career\" in a large hierarchy, where actual acquaintance with people hardly exists and is replaced by \"process\". In short, your real customers are not even people anymore, they are a process. Having enthusiasm for pursuing great ideas that help people is the sweet spot in both career and society. From the Fine Article: \"Of course my fate should be in the hands of a mysterious committee who’s never met me. They wouldn’t be tainted by any sort of favoritism or politics. They’d see past all that and recognize me for my high-quality code and shrewd engineering decisions.\" reply DeathArrow 6 hours agoparentprev>I think you learned the most important lesson of any career: the customer is not your customer.

Students should be teached these things in universities so they don't waste years from their lives after they graduate. reply epolanski 5 hours agorootparentI find it super sad that we should teach kids how to climb corporate ladders rather than taking control of their life, starting businesses, making the world a better place or chasing a career of fulfilment rather than maximizing money return. reply godzillabrennus 4 hours agorootparentAgreed. Every kid their senior year of high school should be forming an LLC, starting a company around their idea, learning the basic skills to operate one, if they want to graduate. reply ryandrake 3 hours agorootparentI sometimes can't even detect sarcasm on HN anymore. What 16-18 year old kid (or their parents) has the capital and time to start and run their own business? Even when they're adults, they likely will not have access to business ownership. Depending on the source you use, somewhere between 5 and 10% of Americans own their own business. I'm not saying basic business skills aren't valuable--they are, but the vast, vast majority of people will work for someone else throughout their careers. Shouldn't we be optimizing education for the 90% case? reply dfee 3 hours agorootparentYou and I have a fundamentally different view about how to optimize education. Your view is probably great to cover the base case of people “checking out” of their children’s education, but my individualized view doesn’t care about the 90% but the child in front of me. I’d also posit that this approach to education reduces overall attainment by dulling the edge of what the margin is capable of. reply egypturnash 2 hours agorootparentprevI don't know if this is sarcasm or not but: You could make it work if this \"everyone forms an LLC in school\" initiative comes with \"everyone gets a chunk of cash to invest into this business\". I assume the time would come from restructuring curriculums so that half of your senior year is spent on this project. Maybe add another year onto high school instead that is the Business Year. This would also require a massive increase in the amount of money going into schools so it's pretty much a non-starter in the US. As to \"optimizing for the 90%\", I feel like there's probably a lot of interesting differences in a world where every high school graduate has been in a boss' shoes. Possibly bosses would be able to get away with a lot less shady shit. This probably doesn't help the chances of setting it up either. reply noduerme 5 hours agorootparentprevOptimizing for promotion is a terrible solution to life's problems. Promotions often, if not always, come with much larger workloads for only marginal pay increases. Whether the a corporate hierarchy is your \"customer\" or you deal with actual end-consumers, the goal is to minimize your workload while maximizing your paycheck, and a promotion in a corporate setting simply does not do that anywhere short of the C-suite. So what should one optimize for, if not promotion? Being the indispensable guru in your domain. People get promoted and people get laid off. No one has as much power as the person you cannot, must not, ever fire. In such a situation, the optimal strategy is to terrify one's superiors who don't understand the domain, and refuse promotion (but do accept a raise). See that webmonkey in the corner next to the rain pipe, making double what the manager makes? If they fired him the whole company would be screwed because he's the only one who has a complete picture of XYZ client's network infrastructure. reply naveen99 4 hours agorootparentIdeally promotions are for people who can handle increased responsibility with ease.

While this might be true in other industries, in big tech companies like TFA is talking about SWE promotions come with rather large increases in pay. https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Amazon,Facebook,Google&track... The author was trying to go from L4 to L5. Promotions are also backwards facing, which means at the point you get promoted you're already doing the larger workload. reply JKCalhoun 2 hours agorootparentprevI did not care for the performance review practices at Apple (and it is probably similar in every other big corporation). We'll give you a 1 to 3 rating in three categories (it's been a while, something like: \"Expertise\", \"Innovation\", \"Teamwork\"). A \"1\" means you did not meet expectations, a \"2\" means you met expectations and a \"3\" means you exceeded expectations. If we give you a \"1\" in anything, you should probably start to look for a job elsewhere. We can't give you a \"3\" in two of the categories above however. Well, we can but then we have to go up the management chain — perhaps even to the director — because giving someone a \"3\" in more than one category means we have to raise your \"grade\". And moving up a grade is a Big Deal. We can only have so many top-tier engineers. Oh, and regardless of what your manager thinks of you, all managers have to report to their manager for what we call a \"leveling session\". Here your manager needs to defend their choices when compensating their direct reports in front of all the other managers and of course their boss as well. Something in particular we're looking to make sure of is that your manager rewards some of their direct-reports with bonuses, a raise, etc. but \"punishes\" others.

If you’re a person making a piece on commission, what the buyer wants and needs can be different and you can get to the end and they are still unhappy. But if you’re working for a boss, they can get in the way. It’s not enough that you do what the customer wants, you have to do it my way, even if that prevents the customer from getting what they want. And if the “customer” is buying the item for someone else, that indirection can result in failure as well. Which often happens when you make custom software for businesses.

I mean a promotion is nice, but it was never really explained why that was such a dealbreaker. If the only thing keeping you at your job is the prospect of a better title, that's probably a bad sign. They then made a lifetime's worth of money at Google in four years, and then used that financial stability to do something high risk which most people can't afford to do.

Hopefully they can use that financial stability to build something useful and impactful :) reply r0ze-at-hn 18 hours agoparent> author seems like they were only there for a promotion It is more the other way around. Internally google taught/teaches engineers that their only goal is promotion. All parts of this used to be very very public. There are whole presentations, decks, docs, and more. What level you are and what level the person you are talking to ~mattered~. The goal isn't to be a good engineer, to make good products, or anything liek that, but to ONLY do what a nameless committee might want to make that magical number go higher. So while they might not have joined Google for that reason eventually they learned what was wanted. There is a whole generation of software engineers that learned this lesson unfortunately. reply rockemsockem 18 hours agorootparentThis is not true. Google is so large that I'm definitely willing to believe that there are parts where people are like this, but I found that people generally did not care about my level and while there are many docs/slides about how to get promoted it was largely oriented towards helping people advocate effectively for themselves and was not \"thou shall be promoted\". There was/is the expectation that eventually everyone can reach a certain level within a certain (very generous) amount of time, but I don't see that as the same thing at all. reply nicoburns 18 hours agorootparent> There was/is the expectation that eventually everyone can reach a certain level within a certain (very generous) amount of time, but I don't see that as the same thing at all. The fact that you are expected to reach a certain level in a certain time period, and going up levels involves a largely arbitrary process that is disconnected from your actual work performance seems pretty problematic to me.

In the past you were expected to hit L5, 2 promotions from hire, and now the expectation is L4, so only 1. An L5 engineer at Google is someone who is expected to be able to handle any medium-large difficulty task with some amount of cross-team coordination and get it done without much oversight. IMO every software engineer should be able to get to that point in their career eventually otherwise it indicates a pretty big problem. reply spwa4 17 hours agorootparent> The amount of time is very long It is now, it used to be a lot shorter. \"Up or out\" has effectively been sacrificed to cost savings, which is perhaps a good thing in some ways. reply rockemsockem 17 hours agorootparentWhat did it used to be? reply cmrdporcupine 6 hours agorootparentWhen I started in 2011 I was told \"up or out\" of L4 by 4 years.

L4 money was good enough. reply jebarker 4 hours agorootparentprevWhat happens once you hit L5? You just need to perform satisfactorily each year? reply dmazzoni 2 hours agorootparentYes. There are far fewer people at each higher level. reply cmrdporcupine 6 hours agorootparentprevI don't think it was a case of it \"happening to\" people, as in HR took them out back and put a bullet in their head... just social pressure. Internal elitism, perf comments, slowly chipping away at you, maybe even toss you on a PIP. Until you throw up your hands and leave. After all, other employers would be more than happy to have you. But yes, it was officially dropped. I stayed as L4 for 10 years. But when I transferred teams I occasionally got ... attitude. Thing is, if you go from L4->L5 (or L5->L6) based on performance you're expected to stay or improve on that performance once you're at L5, and if you don't, you'll get up with Needs Improvement, and there's no going back to L4. reply tdeck 18 hours agorootparentprevI will second what the parent poster says, people definitely cared about levels in the teams I was on (2016-2021). Sometimes people would talk about other engineers using only their level. E.g. \"some L3 keeps sending me these crappy CLs\" or my manager introducing new teammates by saying \"we have a new L5 joining the team\". This seemed normal to a lot of people at Google, but since I have worked at other places where someone's level almost never comes up in any conversation I always found it a little concerning. reply rockemsockem 18 hours agorootparentSo like I said, I definitely believe that it happened, but I didn't see it and I have a hard time believing it was the norm.

My experience: initially, I learned a lot of new things, I was excited to work for a big famous company. But eventually, it started to be less fun and more stressful. There's an endless push for impact or to improve some questionable metrics, while technical debt is building up. Also there's always uncertainty about reorgs and layoffs. Lots of anxiety related to the next evaluation cycle. After a few years, I can say money is probably my main driver. Although, I don't want to get promoted because I certainly don't want more stress. I want to stay in this company as long as possible because I will be very hard to earn more money elsewhere. reply strken 18 hours agoparentprevI would be very discouraged if the people who set tech strategy at my company were the ones who had passed me on the promo ladder by not writing any tests and refusing to go to interviews or help their team fix bugs. reply asdfman123 18 hours agoparentprevWill you work for me as a software engineer? I'll pay you $20 an hour, which is vastly more than nearly all of your ancestors throughout history have made. Why is it a dealbreaker? Don't you enjoy software engineering? My point is that human psychology doesn't work that way. You compete with people around you. If they're getting promoted while you're being left behind, you're not going to be very happy about it. reply cdrini 14 hours agorootparentIt's less about comparing to your ancestors, more your peers in other industries. If you're getting payed say $40/h, that's muuuuch more than most other jobs, and can give you a comfortable living for quite a while. I agree human psychology is part of it and can help explain someone's mentality, but I don't think human psychology can fully justify someone's behaviour, since humans aren't automatons beholden to their psychology. reply klipt 12 hours agorootparentNot if you live in a very high cost of living area. Which is where the biggest Google offices are. reply cdrini 11 hours agorootparentThat's a good point, but I don't believe it scales at the same rate -- meaning I believe the salaries are much higher than the living costs. Eg average us salary is probably somewhere around 60k. Let's say single bedroom apartment not in SF is maybe like 1.5k/mo, that leaves like 42k left over. Google salary I would guess is closer to 150k (low end probably); SF single bedroom is probably closer to 4k/mo, that leaves 102k. Big difference, and note the ratio here isn't as important as the absolute value. You live a very different life with 102k than with 42k. And also note wealth doesn't really increase linearly with how much money you have, it tends to be more than linear, because people with lots of money are more comfortable investing large chunks of it, which further increases their wealth. reply Karrot_Kream 11 hours agorootparentInternally most larger tech companies index their salary bands based on the CoL of the employee. The downturn over the last couple years has had many companies move reqs from high CoL areas to low CoL areas to save money. reply mattlondon 2 hours agorootparentIME of Big Cos, it is never cost of living that is taken into account, but what \"the competition\" in the local market are paying, and then some percentile of that. Who \"the competition\" are specifically is 99.9% of the time entirely black-box, as is the percentile that the company is targeting. So they claim it is open and transparent (\"we benchmark against local employers in tech\") but the actual details are hidden - are the other employers they are using FAANG or someone else? Are they targeting 50% or 95%? Etc etc (\"oh that is confidential sorry\") This is how you end up with situations like London, which is obscenely expensive cost of living, yet gets lower salaries than SF and Zurich which in my experience are a bit cheaper than London for day to day costs (e.g. transport, food etc). London is a physically & metaphorically huge cultural World Capital and attracts loads of people from across the world so there is more competition for tech/high-skilled roles because so many people move to London after they graduate, and stay for good. So salaries are lower but everything else is more expensive due to population density and resulting demand. No one wants to live in Zurich so there are less people competing for each job, so salaries need to be higher to attract and retain staff in such a dull and boring place that people naturally and understandably plan to leave after a few years. reply r0m4n0 5 hours agorootparentprevAgree and not only that, Google attracts a certain type of person that I feel like is more competitive and slightly obsessed with self image (senior role titles for example) reply raincole 11 hours agorootparentprev> Why is it a dealbreaker? Because they can find a job that pays way more than $20 an hour. That's it. reply shadowgovt 18 hours agorootparentprevActually, that varies from person to person. I've been fine not being promoted (less time doing the self-reporting monkey-dance leaves more time to work on projects), and I make enough to satisfy my material needs and desires. And at most startups, there's nowhere to be promoted to when you're a double-digit hire. There's just the work and the chance of a cash-out (or of changing the world, whatever gets you up in the morning). Very different from the BigCo rat race. reply taneq 7 hours agorootparent> And at most startups, there's nowhere to be promoted to when you're a double-digit hire. This is something I'd assumed every engineer-type person faces sooner or later. Unless you're in a massive corp with hundreds of engineers, there's only maybe two or three tiers of engineering roles. That's two promotions, ever, unless you want to be promoted out of engineering and into management. So if you want to stay technical, instead of chasing higher status job titles, you have to chase higher status projects. reply herval 18 hours agoparentprev> the author seems like they were only there for a promotion? Based on Blind and personal experience, the vast majority of people in big tech are literally doing that. It’s probably the most used carrot used by management in those companies too, so hard to blame them reply nvarsj 18 hours agoparentprevFairly sure Google has/had a cliff for engineers to reach senior by a certain time frame. That puts immense pressure to get promoted, or you get laid off. reply izacus 5 hours agorootparentNot just Google - I haven't seen many companies which would tolerate people being stuck on junior level for many years. They'd be slowly managed out (unless the company is government or really big). reply rockemsockem 18 hours agorootparentprevIt's no longer senior, it's only L4 (new hires are usually L3). Also I never knew the time length for the cliff, but I think it was really, really long. reply joshuamorton 15 hours agorootparentIt also wasn't, as far as I know, every strictly enforced. There were folks when I joined (which was when the L5 requirement still existed, but it was in its way out) who had been L4 for like a decade. reply aix1 7 hours agorootparentRight, while there was a \"growth\" expectation for L4s written into the SWE job ladder, there were no fixed timelines. Enforcement varied from org to org: at least one of my previous orgs periodically conducted talent reviews, specifically looking at cases like long-tenured L4s to decide whether to intervene. That was before the layoffs started. One of my by then ex-reports, who was a very talented and knowledgeable but not at all career-focused long-time L4s got laid off in one of the rounds. :( reply shadowgovt 18 hours agoparentprevIt's a little more than that. At the level this engineer was at, they are expected to seek and attain promotion. Sitting at a level below staff becomes a negative and can lead to you being put on a PIP because you aren't meeting the declared expectations when you aren't being promoted. Google eventually removed that language because they learned that in a 100,000-person company, there's simply not enough room in the pyramid and they'll lose the people who are doing the keeping-the-lights-on work who don't self-promote. They didn't know that yet in 2018 if memory serves. reply rockemsockem 18 hours agorootparentIt was senior (L5) that you were expected to reach, not staff. It was revised down to L4. For reference almost all SWE hires start at L3. reply skirmish 14 hours agorootparent> For reference almost all SWE hires start at L3. Straight out of school, yes.

I know more than a handful of folks who are very happy with their level of responsibility and comp, and don't want higher expectations and more stress even if it would bring in significantly more cash.

Happy to answer any questions about this post. reply steelframe 15 hours agoparentForgive me if I seem presumptuous in my advice here. You've done things in your career that I can only dream of doing. What I can say is that I've somehow managed to survive a quarter-century in a string of Big Tech companies without dropping out (yet). It sounds like you may have been looking at the currents and picking the one that seemed best one to swim in. I found there's often -- but not always -- another option: build a dam. In other words, change it up. Alter the landscape. Seek to change the business in a way that nobody's been willing/able to do before. Looking back at my career I found I was happiest and most successful when I was able to tell my boss what I was doing vs. waiting for my boss to tell me to do something interesting/impactful/etc. When that option doesn't seem to be presenting itself, it's probably time to move on. But I've found it's often worth giving it a try first. A couple of times I needed to earn the right to create my own destiny by pushing through some grunge work, but once I established a degree of trust with my management chain, that was capital I could \"cash in on\" by proposing something big, new, and interesting. It never ceases to amaze me to see how boldness often gets rewarded. I just saw a co-worker of mine draw blood from a stone (funding-wise) by proposing something ambitious and controversial last week. Suddenly they're a TL of a new team this week. They've built a reputation for \"just getting it done,\" so management has confidence in their ability to execute and drive results. Whenever I'm starting to feel stuck in a rut, that's when I open a blank document and start hammering out a design for something new. I'm not even thinking about promotion when I do that. But somehow, somewhere down the road, either a promotion or a bigger opportunity with another company has always come of it. reply mtlynch 4 hours agorootparentContext for others: steelframe and I were teammates at Microsoft in the late 2000s.[0] Hey steelframe! Good to see you here again! This is good advice and something I wish I'd recognized earlier at Google. For the first few years there, I was under a manager who had 20+ direct reports, so he probably didn't have time to think of the best projects for me. I probably would have been better off figuring out my own high-impact project rather than focusing on fighting short-term fires that kept popping up for my team. In certain ways, I solved this with the founder route because I get to skip the \"earning the right to create my own destiny\" phase, but in other ways, there's inescapable grunge work like legal compliance, taxes, vendor issues, etc. [0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41011696 reply cromagnum 13 hours agorootparentprevCan you explain how this doesn’t amount to saying “You seem like you’re brave.

Sad that an organization functions in a way that doesn't promote collaboration and creates all sorts of perverse incentives. Sad that employees get carelessly tossed from one project to another without any consideration for what they want for themselves. Sad that \"being surrounded by the best engineers in the world, using the most advanced development tools in the world, and eating the free-est food in the world\" (and probably being paid quite handsomely as well) is not enough for happiness, unless there is also promotion involved. reply coding123 3 hours agoparentWe definitely do things wrong in this world. reply solatic 8 hours agoprevThe conclusion I took away from this piece is just how heartless it is to depend on a promotion committee. I know Google put them in place because they wanted an Engineering-driven culture where people could do great Engineering work and still be recognized, even if their manager didn't. But it sure doesn't sound like these promotion committees are recognizing great Engineering work, especially when that work falls under difficult-to-quantify cultural improvements. Life is better when you find counterparts (customers, leaders, etc.) who appreciate what you bring to the table and can demonstrate that appreciation via promotion decisions. Faceless committees relying on packets fundamentally, by design, cannot develop the relationship that allows for genuine appreciation to form. If you're in a company whose leadership doesn't appreciate you, then why are you forcing yourself to stay? Go find somewhere that does appreciate you. If Google doesn't learn that it's simply not possible to avoid the loss of good talent to bad management or process, then that's their loss. Take advantage of the good-enough performance reviews and take your time planning your exit. Life is too short to work in an organization that actively dissuades forming genuine, supportive, professional working relationships with colleagues. reply adonovan 2 hours agoparentExactly. There are non-monetary rewards to doing good work: esprit de corps from a team of coworkers you like and respect, satisfaction and pride in your craft, positive responses from users, and so on. For many, promotion is like winning a pie-eating contest only to find that the prize is: more pies.

It is never a wasting time in your life. You learned how the world works! After six years of running bootstrapped businesses, I actually more strongly believe the opposite. It might be true at a high-growth VC-backed startup that you need many stars to align to succeed. In bootstrapped businesses, you basically just need one thing to succeed: product market fit. If you create a product that people want, you'll probably succeed even if you make a lot of other mistakes. With TinyPilot, I didn't know anything about hardware or selling a physical product at the beginning, so I did a million things wrong. But I landed on a product people were willing to pay for, and I found a good way of getting it in front of customers, so the company worked. I did some things right, but for the first year, I mostly felt like revenue was growing on its own and I was trying to keep up. You still need luck to find product market fit because lots of reasonable-sounding ideas end up flopping, but you really just need to get lucky once rather than wait for a whole set of things to get lucky at the same time. reply misstercool 15 hours agorootparentWell, to be honest, I have never heard any of many FAANG turned startup founder friends told me that the want to build a life style business from the beginning. Every one wants to build a vc-backed startup with a home run idea. Many of them ended up building life style business because the markets of their ideas were actually much smaller. If you do the math, climbing the corporate ladder at FAANG might have better ROI than running life style business. Of course, money is not the only consideration in life. reply mtlynch 4 hours agorootparentYeah, I agree financial ROI is definitely higher in a FAANG, especially the last five years.

But it is still the promo committee (which doesn't include your manager) that decides whether or not you get promoted. reply goldfish3 12 hours agorootparentTechnically yes, but \"promo committee\" has also changed to be your immediate org instead of being independent. Which makes your promo more dependent on your manager's influence. reply alarge 14 hours agoparentprevNo, your manager doesn't decide your promotion. The difference between before and now is that before, your manager was expected to make the case for your promotion. Now, the manager is expected not to be an advocate, but to provide their balanced input (ready now, ready soon, not yet ready). The promotion still goes to a promo committee - although now they try to locate it close enough to your org that they have heard of you, and can have a high-context reviewer (not your manager) at the table. The carryover from the previous system (and the thing that these sorts of posts seem to miss) is that every level has explicit expectations about the sort of activities that a person at that level can be trusted to independently conduct. A decision on promotion is a decision on whether or not a person has adequately demonstrated that they can do the work of the next level. It isn't some sort of award for doing their current job well. When someone languishes for a long time at a level, it is usually because they aren't demonstrating those next-level signals. The system can feel unfair - like a team that lacks adequate opportunities for someone to demonstrate next-level signals, or the insistence that work doesn't count until its production impact can be assessed (which may take years for some projects).

But it's not a mystery and ultimately it falls on the manager to put together a strong packet that makes it clear why the candidate should be promoted. The promotion attempt itself is the manager's vote. Beyond that it comes down to how strongly they champion for the candidate's promotion. It's the only way to ensure some consistency between promotions, IMO. reply 1024core 19 hours agoparentprevWhat I found neat (when I heard about it) was that one could nominate yourself for promo, without your manager's assent. This is quite rare and a neat feature. reply aix1 6 hours agorootparentIn theory, yes. In practice, it would take some pretty extraordinary circumstances for one to get promoted without their manager's support. For starters, even if it is the candidate themselves who self-nominate, it is still the manager who writes the promo readiness assessment that forms the main body of the packet. It is also the manager's job to solicit peer feedback and represent it to the committee. One could imagine a scenario where the manager's opinion diverges sharply from the assessment of the session lead and other senior folks sitting on the committee (who decide collectively) but again, those would be some pretty exceptional circumstances... Layered on top of this are promo quotas, which already mean that some folks who do tick all the boxes aren't getting promoted as soon as they would be otherwise (or at all). That is to say that there are lots of headwinds even if the manager is supportive, let alone when they aren't. reply jeffbee 18 hours agoparentprevAt all levels? I know it changes every year so I don't let my own personal experience color my perception of Google 2024, but some years when I was there my manager barely even knew where my desk was. My promo packets for L5 and L6 were judged by peer committees and I am not sure they even saw my manager evaluations. When I sat on an L5 promo committee we did not weigh manager assessments. This made sense at that time because of how hands-off managers were in the realm of the reasons a person could get promoted to L5. reply aix1 6 hours agorootparentThese days it's the manager who writes the next-level assessment (NLA) and it's the NLA that forms the main body of the packet that the promo committee looks at. They're also the one soliciting and summarizing peer feedback etc. reply jeffbee 3 hours agorootparentThat's wildly incompatible with my experience there in the previous decade. I hope the current managers are up to the job! Most of my managers didn't have even the slightest inkling of how to evaluate what I was doing on the job. One of them was mainly occupied with running the \"mindfulness\" office. reply aix1 3 hours agorootparent> That's wildly incompatible with my experience there in the previous decade Yes, there have been some very signficant changes over the last few years. Promos are decided in-org. Managers play a much more important role. There are promo quotas along with associated pressures (felt more acutely in some orgs compared to others). But, putting that asides, a manager who doesn't have any idea of what or how their reports are doing is clearly failing at their job under any of those systems. reply DeathArrow 6 hours agoprevIf you are that good that Google wants to hire you, it means you don't need Google, you can do fine on your own or working somewhere else. reply belval 19 hours agoprevI'll play devils advocate because it's more fun but this: > The pipeline didn’t record many metrics. The ones it did have made it look like things had gotten worse. My bug discoveries caused the overall bug count to increase. The pipeline’s failures increased because I made it fail fast on anomalies instead of silently passing along bad data. I understand why the author might think this is better, but all software have bugs and a lot of data is tainted by those bugs. Was fixing the pipeline an actual priority? Was it critical? If so, how were the downstream internal customers dealing with the new exceptions? Why were they not raising a ruckus about it? Why was the author allowed to move on to a different project if there were so many bugs in that pipeline deserving of a promotion? I have met more people in life that made a big deal out of ultimately unimportant details than the opposite. Internal pipelines usually have a lower bar and the downstream consumer may not even care about 75% of features that are just there and unused. Being a senior engineering is also knowing when to leave good enough alone. > My other work didn’t look so good on paper either. On several occasions, I put my projects on hold for weeks or even months at a time to help a teammate whose launch was at risk. It was the right decision for the team, but it looked unimpressive in a promo packet. To the promotion committee, my teammate’s project was the big, important work that demanded coordination from multiple developers. If they hornswoggled me into helping them, it’s evidence of their strong leadership qualities. I was just the mindless peon whose work was so irrelevant that it could be pre-empted at a moment’s notice. Is that conclusion really wrong? It's a bit uncharitable for sure but that is indeed what happened not just how it appeared to have happened. If your project was such a low priority that dropping it for several months does not flash a red light in someone's dashboard, then I am sorry but that does not seem promotion worthy. The little comic also has good examples that things that imo are not \"senior\" work. Writing E2E tests for a product that is already shipped is worthwhile, but unless it's something very special it's not complex enough, does not require enough design to be considered \"senior work\". Again I don't know the guy, maybe he did get an unfair read on his body of work, but reading the entire blog I mostly get the vibes of \"I worked 2 years at Google and then wanted to be a senior so I rushed my promo packet without a cornerstone project\" and the committee refusing that is just the system working as intended. reply mtlynch 18 hours agoparentHi, I'm \"the guy.\" Thanks for reading! I largely agree with you. I didn't mean to argue that the work I was doing for the first two years merited a promotion. My point was more that I felt frustrated that I was doing what my manager and team asked of me, told consistently that I did the work well, and then later found out that it was all worthless for career advancement. I think there are competing interests at a large organization that make this difficult. On the one hand, you have grungy work that needs to get done but only requires the skill of a junior developer (e.g., fixing bugs, writing tests). On the other hand, everyone at Google wants to advance their career by doing senior or above work, so how do you incentivize anyone to do the grungy work if it essentially means a career pause? I don't know how to solve that problem at scale. I didn't and still don't harbor resentment toward Google or my managers for how promotions worked. I think it's difficult to align incentives for an organization with 100k people, and they chose a reasonable strategy. But I felt like the things I was good at didn't align well with career advancement at Google, so that was why I left. reply skulk 13 hours agorootparent> My point was more that I felt frustrated that I was doing what my manager and team asked of me, told consistently that I did the work well, and then later found out that it was all worthless for career advancement. oh wow. Reading this made me realize why (in the context of a big tech career) it's such a good idea to have a mentor whose reasonably far away from your team. They could have probably pointed this out to you early. reply mtlynch 3 hours agorootparentYeah, I found a mentor at the beginning of year 4, and they were very helpful. There were a lot of things happening on my team that I didn't understand, and my mentor was able to recognize them as political patterns that were somewhat common. I realize I maybe came across as naive thinking that I could get promoted without thinking much about career strategy or politics, but that's how the first few years of my career had worked out. After undergrad, I worked for Microsoft for three years, and I got promoted twice without ever thinking about career. I just did the projects my team needed, and did a good job. Same thing when I worked for NCC group: promoted after a year and was on track for more. One of the big differences in other companies was that they gave me opportunities to demonstrate aptitude in my day to day work rather than needing to see me launch something big and shiny. I invested a lot into peer reviews and building repeatable processes, so managers at those companies were able to see that impact my team even if it would be hard to prove measurable results to an external promo committee. reply robertclaus 16 hours agoprevI know this article is about Google's culture and the author is a strong developer, but it reminds me of conversations with junior developers at other companies. I've worked with a lot of junior folks that think they should be a \"senior\" 2 years out of their undergrad CS courses.

    "originBody": "NPR > National It's legal for police to use deception in interrogations. Advocates want that to end By Meg Anderson Friday, November 8, 2024 • 4:48 PM EST Heard on All Things Considered Ted Bradford says the worst day of his life was when detectives took him into a tiny room to question him about a rape. “The whole day it was like accusation after accusation,” he says. “I kept telling them over and over, ‘I didn't do this.’” Bradford says the officers in Yakima, Wash., claimed they had biological evidence that would prove he did it, and they weren't going to let him leave until he admitted it. “I knew I didn’t do it,” he said. “So I'm thinking, ‘In order to get out of this situation, I could just give them a statement. They’ll test that evidence. It’ll show that I didn’t do it, and then this will all be done with.’” After hours of questioning, Bradford confessed to the crime. But the evidence police had – a mask left at the scene – could not be DNA-tested. This was the late nineties and the technology wasn’t there yet. Bradford recanted his confession, but was convicted anyway. He was 22 with two small children when he went to prison. “Every day I woke up and knew that I shouldn't be there,” he says. Advancements in DNA testing helped lead to his exoneration in 2010. What happened to Bradford might seem extreme, but nearly 30 years later, the tactic used on him is not. In every state, police officers are allowed to lie to adults during an interrogation. The hope, in many cases, is that they’ll get a person to confess to committing a crime. When it comes to children and teenagers, a growing number of states are stopping that practice: Ten have passed laws in recent years effectively banning police from lying to juveniles during interrogations, starting with Illinois in 2021. But some legal advocates are pushing for a deception ban that would apply to everyone, not just kids. ‘A quick and relatively straightforward way to close a case’ Deception is a powerful law enforcement tool in eliciting confessions, says wrongful convictions attorney Laura Nirider. “Police are trained around the country in all 50 states to use deception during interrogation, to lie both about the evidence against a suspect and to lie about the consequences of confessing in order to make it seem not so bad if you just say that you did these things,” she says. Police can go into an interrogation room with a suspect, Nirider says, and emerge with “one of the most believable pieces of evidence imaginable, a confession.” “It's a quick and relatively straightforward way to close a case,” she says. But Nirider says using deception can also draw false confessions. According to the Innocence Project, a national organization that works to overturn wrongful convictions, nearly a third of DNA exonerations from 1989 to 2020 involved a false confession. Legal experts say the deception bans passed in recent years fail to protect other vulnerable groups: young adults, people with intellectual disabilities, even just people who are naturally compliant. “Children are one category that makes you more vulnerable, but it's certainly not the only category,” says Lara Zarowsky, executive and policy director at the Washington Innocence Project. “It's something that all of us are vulnerable to.” ‘Law enforcement is the biggest impediment’ In Washington state, where Bradford was convicted, Democratic lawmakers want to set a higher bar: A bill that would make incriminating statements made in police custody – by adults or children – largely inadmissible in court if obtained using deception. State Rep. Strom Peterson has introduced the bill twice, but it hasn’t gone anywhere. “Law enforcement is the biggest impediment to the bill. They believe that the system in which they work is effective,” he says. The Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs declined NPR’s request for an interview, but said in a statement that it opposes such a measure, because banning deception would take away a tactic that yields “many more true confessions” than false ones. “We fear that it will negatively impact our ability to solve crimes and would result in less accountability for those who victimize others,” the association’s policy director, James McMahan, said at a hearing for the bill in February. “Criminals often conduct elaborate stories to conceal their crimes,” McMahan said at the hearing. “Sometimes the use of deception is required to locate the truth both to convict and to exonerate people. Such deceptions include telling a person that abuse was discovered during a routine medical exam rather than reported by a family member.” In its statement, the association added that judges assess whether confessions are given voluntarily before they can be introduced as evidence, and convictions based solely on confessions are rare. Even with other evidence, however, confessions carry a lot of weight. Research indicates that people who confess are treated differently afterwards: They’re more likely to be charged, face more charges, and receive a harsher punishment when convicted. “A confession will trump everything,” says Jim Trainum, a retired homicide detective in Washington, D.C. In his experience, there is pressure to move on after a suspect confesses because a detective’s measure of success is often tied to closure rates. “Let's say that I get a confession and I get all the stuff that I want to go out and corroborate. I want to make sure that this is an accurate confession,” Trainum says. “I'm sitting there at my desk working very, very hard on it. And my sergeant comes up and says, ‘What are you doing? That's a confession. That's closed. Move on. You got other ones to take care of.’” ‘Trying to give the police new tools’ Those against deception bans see them as an attack on police, says Mark Fallon, a consultant on interrogation practices and former federal agent. In fact, he says, it’s the opposite. “It is actually trying to give the police new tools, better tools,” he says. There’s another way for police to question people, Fallon says, that relies on building rapport and asking open-ended questions, and where the primary goal is information, rather than a confession. That technique is used in other countries, including much of Europe. In England, France, Germany, Australia, Japan and elsewhere, for instance, the police are generally not allowed to deceive suspects. Trainum says interrogation methods that don’t rely on deception ultimately make the police more trustworthy to communities. “Today’s suspect is tomorrow's witness,” he says. When a suspect or witness has been lied to, he says, “that radiates out. And no wonder people don't trust us. Why should they trust us?” That is why Peterson, the lawmaker, plans to introduce the bill in Washington again. He says the public is better off when police use the best tools available to convict the right people. Transcript ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: In every state in the U.S., police officers are allowed to lie to people during interrogations. Now a growing number of states are stopping that practice with juveniles in custody. Advocates in one state want a ban on deception that applies to everyone, not just kids. As NPR's Meg Anderson reports, they're being met with resistance. MEG ANDERSON, BYLINE: Ted Bradford says the worst day of his life was when two detectives took him into a tiny room to question him about a rape. TED BRADFORD: The whole day it was, like, accusation after accusation. It was, like, we know you did this. And I kept telling them over and over, I didn't do this. ANDERSON: Bradford says the officers in Yakima, Washington, told him they had DNA evidence that would prove he did it, and they weren't going to let him leave until he admitted it. BRADFORD: I'm thinking, in order to get out of this situation, I could just give them a statement. They'll test that evidence. It'll show that I didn't do it, and then this will all be done with. ANDERSON: After hours of questioning, Bradford confessed to the crime. But the evidence police had - a mask left at the scene - could not actually be DNA tested. This was the late '90s, and the technology wasn't there yet. He was 22 with two small children when he went to prison. BRADFORD: For nine years, it's like every day I woke up and knew that I shouldn't be there. ANDERSON: Advancements in DNA testing led to his exoneration in 2010. What happened to him is extreme, but the tactic police used - even 30 years later - is not. LAURA NIRIDER: Police are trained around the country, in all 50 states, to use deception during interrogation. ANDERSON: Laura Nirider is a wrongful convictions attorney. NIRIDER: To lie both about the evidence against a suspect and to lie about the consequences of confessing in order to make it seem not so bad if you just say that you did these things. ANDERSON: Confessions carry a lot of weight in an investigation, and Nirider says deception is a powerful tool to get them. Police can go into a room with a suspect... NIRIDER: And emerge with one of the most believable pieces of evidence imaginable - a confession. It's a quick and relatively straightforward way to close a case. ANDERSON: The problem, she says, is that it is so effective that it also draws false confessions. Juveniles are especially swayed by deception. Ten states have passed laws in recent years banning police from lying to them during interrogations. But legal experts say other people are vulnerable, too, like young adults and people with intellectual disabilities. In Washington State, lawmakers want to set a higher bar with a bill that would make a statement made by anyone - adult or child - inadmissible in court if it was obtained using deception.

That other path is why Peterson, the state lawmaker, plans to introduce the bill again. He says we're all better off when police use the best tools available to convict the right people.

But then I often read about USA and police corruption there, brutality, and virtual immunity (strike virtual out maybe) they enjoy and I feel that definitely trumps Indian police in this aspects by a crazy margin. At least we can technically hold them accountable here and we often do. [1] One of them is that there was a tiger set free in a dense forest somewhere and police from Germany, Japan, and India were tasked to track it down each time as a challenge. Japan found the tiger in 4 hours, Germany in 12 hours. Indian police party was nowhere to be seen. Hours passed, days passed. Finally after the end of the 12th day the Japanese and German police banded together and went to find/rescue the Indian police party. They saw the police party had set camp deep inside the forest and they had a monkey hung upside down from a tree that they were taking turns beating and telling it to confess that it was the tiger. reply z3phyr 6 hours agorootparentSimply in India, anything told to the police is not applicable as evidence in the court of law.

Which is why he was able to sue and win $900K. If you want to prevent these sorts of things from happening in the future, adding another ban on this behavior isn’t going to do it. There needs to be consequences for the officers that do this. It’s not the officers paying $900K, it’s the city. And they aren’t getting fired, the officers that did that to Tom Perez even got promoted! The system of accountability needs to be reformed. Maybe that means reforming qualified immunity, maybe demoting and firing officers for misconduct, maybe prosecutors need to start indicting officers when their behavior gets to the point of criminality. Personally, I think if you could sue, say, the police union rather than the city when there is misconduct, things would turn around fast. reply nickff 17 hours agoparentprevThat’s shocking, and sounds like psychological torture.

Less convincingly, when you separate a group of suspects and claim that Kyle gave you up when he did nothing of the sort. reply ulrikrasmussen 11 hours agorootparentNo it isn't. People have imperfect memory, and if the police can knowingly lie to you, then they can also convince you to admit something which never happened, effectively coercing you to fabricate evidence against yourself. Yes, it may lead to some bad guys getting caught who otherwise wouldn't have been. But that is not an excuse if it also compromises the rule of law for innocent people. reply stephen_g 10 hours agorootparentprevYes, great, so if neither of you were actually involved in the crime and they tell you that the other guy gave you up, you can fabricate something that implicates him instead so they take the rap because you’re scared of being blamed. This isn’t a hypothetical, people have literally gone to prison for decades before some new DNA evidence exonerates them and the ‘accomplice’ admits they lied… reply d1sxeyes 9 hours agorootparentThe vast majority of folks who get cleared based on “new DNA evidence” or whatever actually don’t have their innocence proven. Instead in most of these cases, there is shown to be some problem with a piece of evidence relied on at trial. To be clear, the prosecutors should be held to a high standard, and they should be forced to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. But we should also be a little more cautious about proclaiming the “innocence” of people whose guilty convictions are found to be problematic. In case that evidence had been excluded on time, it is possible that the prosecutors could still have built a solid case that relied on different evidence. reply viraptor 6 hours agorootparent> about proclaiming the “innocence” of people whose guilty convictions are found to be problematic That's literally how innocence works though. From the universal declaration of human rights: \"Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a public trial ...\". If they weren't proven guilty they are presumed innocent. reply d1sxeyes 6 hours agorootparentYes but it’s a presumption rather than something that is proven. If the guy who done it was blonde, 6’2”, driving a red Mercedes, and he wrapped the body in a green rug, and it turns out that the bloodstains on green rug of the 6’2” blonde guy with the red Mercedes that you arrested for it are only actually 70% likely to be the victim’s rather than 99.5%, while LEGALLY the guy in prison now can benefit from the presumption of innocence, I’m not sure I’d be comfortable if he moved in downstairs. Proven innocence would be “oh we have irrefutable video evidence that this guy was two states away at the time”. reply jyounker 1 hour agorootparentThis seems like a stretch. As far as I know, usually DNA evidence in exonerations is more along the lines of, \"The DNA is 98% match for a known killer who was arrested for similar crime a few years later.\" reply pelorat 9 hours agorootparentprevInterestingly enough this only works in countries where the police is allowed to imply they can get punishment lowered by talking to the prosecutor, something that's impossible in most western countries. It unfortunately has a side effect, the reciprocating \"my friend did it\" defense works really well in those places - Scandinavia, I'm looking at you. Given two murder suspects, but no witnesses, and no evidence of who actually delivered the final blow, it doesn't matter if both would be covered in the victims blood. As long as they point blame at each other and shut up, chances are they will get away with murder. They would still very likely go to prison of course, but for some \"lesser\" crime like assault. reply stuaxo 7 hours agorootparentprevThe police in other countries manage without doing this. reply unyttigfjelltol 9 hours agorootparentprevhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=InA4SmSlObw reply sandworm101 12 hours agorootparentprevnext [3 more] [flagged] kergonath 10 hours agorootparent> Being totally open and honest with suspects gives them control over the situation, at least to the guilty suspects who by definition know more than the police ever can. This fails to account for innocent suspects, who are already having a bad day and are all too often convicted despite their innocence. The police not knowing means that they should be careful, not reckless. You cannot presume guilt in order to justify lying or psychological torture. > Ever wonder why cops ask you how fast you were going before they pulled you over? Its because they are unsure and want you to admit your mistake. It is trickery but not evil. It’s also not lying. reply listenallyall 11 hours agorootparentprevSure, but just asking you is different than lying to you, such as claiming the radar gun clocked you at 98, subject to something like reckless driving, when it was actually only 82, a speeding ticket. reply jjulius 14 hours agoparentprevAnd cops wonder why people don't trust them. reply listenallyall 11 hours agorootparentI dont think cops wonder about that at all reply ClumsyPilot 17 hours agoparentprev> They the said that they would kill his dog Someone should be in prison.

Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 477 (1966). If the detectives make any kind of promises or threats then your lawyer will be able to suppress the entire interview. Here is the waiver sheet used by the US Treasury, and this is similar to the waiver sheets used by police departments all over the USA, it reads \"I understand the statement of my rights above as they have been read and explained to me and I waive them freely and voluntarily, without threat or intimidation, and without any promise of reward or immunity.\" https://www.tigta.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022-... reply _DeadFred_ 15 hours agorootparentThe United States Courts don't think that having a 50 year sentence over your head, and being offered a 5-10 year plea deal instead, is cajoling. When you take a plea (with the judge knowing all of the above and that you were threatened with a 40 year 'trial tax' if you didn't take the plea) you literally have to swear in court no in answer to the judge asking \"Has anyone forced, threatened, or coerced you in any way into pleading guilty?\" even though it is the judge who will personally add 45 years to your sentence if you don't take the plea. This falls under the \"voluntariness requirement\" as part of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Specifically, Rule 11(b)(2) requires that the court \"address the defendant personally in open court and determine that the plea is voluntary and did not result from force, threats, or promises (other than promises in a plea agreement).\" The threat of 40 years of your life (basically a death sentence, you will probably die in that time, many you know and love will die in that time, you will not be able to restart any sort of life if you don't die) because you chose to exercise your right to trial instead of pleading guilty is not considered a threat, coercion, or cajoling by the United State Federal Justice system. This voluntariness inquiry is a key part of what's known as the \"Rule 11 colloquy\" - the series of questions and statements that must occur between the judge and defendant before a guilty plea can be accepted. Plea deals/plea bargaining was not legal at the start of the United States and was actually considered unconstitutional. The practice wasn't officially recognized by the Supreme Court as legitimate until 1970 in Brady v. United States on the grounds that not EVERY plea is coercion. https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_11 https://naacp.org/resources/eliminating-illegal-practice-tri... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_v._United_States https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Jackson reply Spivak 15 hours agorootparentThis nonsense is why I think plea deals need to have no admission of wrongdoing. Which I know makes the name kind of vestigial but it's at least more honest about the transaction. Both sides are negotiating based on the perceived time and monetary effort, and chance of conviction. Someone who is innocent may (unfortunately) find it their best course of action to take a plea deal and they shouldn't have to falsely admit their guilt to accept it. It's not perfect but it removes a lot of the coercive elements from the transaction. reply _DeadFred_ 15 hours agorootparentThey are considered somewhat differently which is why some statutes/laws have a clause 'or plead guilty to'. I don't see how it removes in any way that the threat of imposition of the trial tax is a threat. If you can receive a 5 or 50 year sentence for the exact same crime, with the exact same circumstances other than taking a plea, the extra 45 years can not be considered anything but an explicit threat to take the plea. Or that pleas were considered unconstitutional at the founding of the US and only made legal in the 1960s. The government only allows pleas for businesses that include a non admission of guilt. Admission of guilt is required as part of the Federal plea process, otherwise defendants could retain too many appeal rights (when you admit guilt from that point on you must prove a much higher 'actual innocence' legal standard on appeal and none of the easier standards like tainted evidence, corrupt officials, improper procedures can be applied to your case). reply noduerme 12 hours agorootparentSorry, come again? What is a \"trial tax\"? You mean if you opt to go to trial, plead not guilty, and you lose then they're threatening that the penalty could be more severe? Is that the \"tax\"? Maybe it's just me, but if I were falsely accused, I'd take a jury trial in a heartbeat over making a false confession. Just on principle alone. I understand why a guilty defendant might take a plea bargain, but it blows my mind that this works on some people who are innocent. reply listenallyall 11 hours agorootparentProsecutors will argue exactly your point, that no innocent person would take a plea deal or confess to a crime they didn't do. But lots of research is demonstrating the opposite. Keep in mind that once police and prosecutors believe you probably are the one who committed the crime, they will usually stop investigating any alternate theories or people, and only focus on building their case against you - and sometimes, even withhold exonerating evidence. So if you do choose a trial, everything that is presented will be pointing at you and you alone, you can try to raise an alternate theory but nobody in authority will back you up. It's a very difficult spot to be in. reply noduerme 5 hours agorootparentNo doubt it's difficult, and in countries like Russia it's downright impossible to defend your innocence successfully under such circumstances. But I think if you ever find yourself in such a situation, you have no choice but to stand on the truth, on principle. It's better to go down fighting than to submit. And in game theory terms, there is at least a potential upside to fighting the charge, even if the potential downside is worse. There is no further upside to pleading guilty to something you didn't do. I'll tell you this... the judge could tell the jury to ignore it, or declare a mistrial, but if someone had offered me a plea bargain for something I was innocent of, I would tell the jury that I'd refused it. Whether that was stricken from the record or not, at that point you're a political prisoner and you've done all you honestly can. reply smolder 10 hours agorootparentprevWhen police have a false story that your own lawyer and everyone around you seems to buy, you might then falsely admit guilt.

I've served on juries, though never been tried in front of one. If we were talking about something where I had actually broken a law, I'd expect to lose. But if it were truly a case of mistaken identity? I'd almost certainly defend myself and be confident no jury would convict me. It's possible that a lot of people don't have sufficient skills to pore through legal books and case histories the way we pore through examples of massive SQL queries, but I'm sure I'd be up to it. And thus I would never concede to a plea bargain for something I hadn't done. Moreover, the whole concept of doing so is so anathema that I wouldn't care if it was a choice between admitting false guilt or execution (as it was in the show trials of the Soviet Union)... I would tell em to execute me. There are things I'm not willing to live with, like making a false confession, so you had better fuckin kill me. reply Hikikomori 50 minutes agorootparentThe most tech bro hubris I've ever seen. reply listenallyall 11 hours agorootparentprevThe point of the plea deal is that you aren't pleading to \"the exact same crime.\" For example maybe you're charged with 2nd degree murder, with extenuating circumstances of using a firearm, and that's what you'll be on trial for, facing 50 years. Unless you plead to involuntary manslaughter, with a 7 year max but the prosecutor will recommend 4 because you cooperated. Just an example, I'm making up the numbers.

But funnily enough, a 50+ years in prison threat when the state knows you will die in prison due to age/health, not considered coercive and doesn't qualify. It's the threat of physically being put to death that puts it over the line for this sort of plea for the courts to recognize the threat being made as 'coercive'. So The Justice System absolutely understands that pleas come with implicit threats. Or you can explain that as 'this can sometimes happen'. reply NoMoreNicksLeft 11 hours agorootparentprev> This nonsense is why I think plea deals need to have no admission of wrongdoing. No. Not even close. Instead, plea deals need to be made illegal. Prosecutors who use plea deals in more than 2% of their cases in a given calendar year should face loss of law license for life, and 10 years in prison. It should be aggressively enforced and a strict liability crime (no \"I lost track\" excuses). DAs would no longer be able to prosecute as many cases if most had to be taken to trial, and they would be much less permissive of cops who were filing borderline horseshit, who were refusing to use their discretion. Legislators would be less able to keep bad laws on the books, were it not for pervasive plea bargaining. In my own county, I heard with my own ears the DA bragging about how they do about 4000 cases per year, but take fewer than 30 to trial.

Occasionally they will do one to keep the myth alive, but the reality is that due process is dead, and if the DA accuses you of something you have no recourse.

This is often the tricky part. reply DannyBee 15 hours agorootparentThis kind of interrogation is held at a police station. They are recorded - a lot of countries outside the US actually require it be recorded and if it is not, the interview and anything said in it are simply inadmissible. Even in the US, recording is standard practice for any meaningful felony. Unlike body worn cameras, it does not get magically lost, and when it does, the interview is generally not admitted, or a defense lawyer tears it to shreds if the detective tries to use his notes. While there are always cases of recordings \"being lost\" or whatever, the rate here is very low, compared to body worn cameras or anything else. The case where they don't do recording is usually resource related. There are around 20,000 law enforcement agencies in the US. 80% of them have less than 25 full time employees 15% of those have 1 full time employee. While most still do recording, it might only be for major felonies or whatever because they don't have the manpower to have handle recording 24/7. Given that, you won't achieve 100% compliance without something drastic (for example, funding and paying for 24/7 video recording in every department). Even there, at best you'll just end up with only the cases where software/hardware went wrong. Note that i have no love for police (actually, much the opposite), but i'm also realistic - i'm not sure it's easy to solve the problem of having tons of small, low-budget police departments, be required to record. (the UK, by comparison, has 43 regional law enforcement forces, and is down to 300 police stations or something like this) reply _DeadFred_ 15 hours agorootparentIn the USA our courts have something called 'Good Faith'. They take the word of law enforcement on 'Good faith' because they are official officers of the law. Chain of custody broken on your evidence? Well, the court will take it on 'good faith' that the police department still did things right, because otherwise they would have to throw out the case, and in the USA there is nothing worse than that. Video evidence that conflict with officer testimony? Most times the court with side with 'good faith' in the officer's testimony.

On top of that, they could add some sort of chain of custody for the accused. For instance gaps in the recording between arrest and trial (solo bathroom breaks and conferring with defense attorneys excepted) could mean the charges are dropped. reply pyuser583 16 hours agorootparentprevClear and simple rules help a lot. If you say “I want to talk to a lawyer” - anything after that is not admissible. Full stop. This is generally enforced. Same with Miranda warnings.

And if they did, the mere fact that they contacted an attorney to say \"does this person's request for a lawyer constitute a valid legal request for a lawyer?\" says they absolutely knew that was precisely what was being requested, and were just playing fuck-fuck games. Because if they weren't, are you (and they) going to argue with a straight face, \"No, it was sincerely believed that he was requesting a canine who was admitted to the bar in the state of Louisiana to provide him counsel\" then at best you're being absurdist, and at worst, well... Apropos of ANY of that, the moment the suspect requests counsel (or requests something that sounds sooooo close to requesting counsel that you need to contact an attorney to verify whether they agree that it was a request for counsel or not) you're supposed to immediately terminate the interview.

In the USA you might be able to get the statements thrown out afterwards, but as long as the police didn't actually commit any violence then they are likely to get promoted.

Splitting everyone up, questioning everyone to try to find inconsistencies. Multiple times I remember telling a cop \"no, you are not allowed to do this, am I being detained?\" And they can just respond \"yes I am, no you're not, can I look through your car now?\" In central nowhere texas, the cops are elite at this. Just all of us pretty much sobbing on the side of the road from the stress, pleading and pleading with them... But I would live through that everyday of my life if I knew I would never have to get to the sometimes next chapter of this kind of thing: jail in a small Texas town.

Mouthwash has a level of alcohol in it.\" If they know that's not what happened, it shouldn't be legal to plant in the mind of a jury or judge.

Defense attorneys will sometimes tell their clients \"if you're guilty, don't tell me\" in order to avoid such ethical restrictions. Of course, not all lawyers live up to their ethical obligations and if the only evidence of an ethical lapse is protected by attorney-client privilege, it's unlikely that they would ever get caught. reply lolinder 16 hours agoparentprevI disagree with your example. That's a perfectly reasonable question that a good witness can have a perfectly valid answer to: \"I know your client didn't use mouthwash because we tested this process and proved that mouthwash is only capable of getting up to a 0.05 (or whatever number)\". If the officer doesn't have a good answer to the question, then there exists reasonable doubt, whether or not the defense attorney knows that their client was, in fact, drunk. reply echoangle 10 hours agorootparentI think the point frellus made was that you shouldn’t be allowed to create reasonable doubt by bringing up something you know is not true/relevant. If the lawyer know no mouthwash was involved, it shouldn’t be allowed to use the ambiguity created by mouthwash to discredit the measurement. At least that’s how I understood it. reply lolinder 4 hours agorootparentI agree that's what they meant, but why not? The standard of proof isn't \"beyond the doubt of my own lawyer\", the standard of proof is \"beyond a reasonable doubt\". The entire job of a defense attorney is to cast reasonable doubt on the prosecution's evidence. If there's a reasonable explanation for the prosecution's evidence that doesn't involve the defendant being guilty, that's a reasonable doubt. Whether the defense attorney knows the doubt isn't true in this case is irrelevant to the question of whether it's a reasonable doubt. Our system is designed to try to avoid putting innocent people in jail even if that means failing to convict some guilty people. It's already imperfect at that goal. We already convict the innocent. OP's proposal would tie defense attorneys' hands in ways that would lead to even more innocent people in prison. reply lesuorac 4 hours agorootparentBut the defense can spend literally weeks bringing up random stuff that is irrelevant to the case that will cast doubt.

English is not my first language; is a constabulary not a police? Maybe I'm misunderstanding your point, but I consider any armed unit that works for the government and is paid to enforce law by arresting people (and other things), to be \"police\". Such units have existed for much longer than 200 years. But perhaps you use a different definition for the term? Anyway, my point is that if there is a building with 10 armed gang members, no normal person would go in there to arrest them. That'd be suicide. You need some organized group with special training (and ideally superior weapons) to do anything about this gang. And that group is the police. If you were relying on random individuals voluntarily (and without pay) doing the enforcement, a gang would only need to be sufficiently feared, so that noone ever dares touch them. You'd have gangs killing people as brutally as possible, to make others afraid to go against them. You can see this exact thing happening in some countries today, and it's horrible. Yes, I do think the police \"experiment\" will continue. (For the next 10000 years? Probably not. I don't think real AGI will happen in our lifetime, but I do think it will hapen within the next 10000 years. And it will change society in ways I cannot predict.) reply giantg2 17 hours agoprev [–] I think deception is fine if it's about what evidence they have. What isn't fine is deception about the the law and physical threats. It's one thing to say you have someone's prints at a crime scene hoping they confess, it's entirely different to threaten to kill their dog or say you aren't allowed to talk to a lawyer. The basis of our adversarial legal system is that the truth will emerge from a fair fight between the sides. Deception on the facts, but not the law or threats, seems to be balanced. There are other areas of the law that are not, but this one seems to check out. Some potential tips are to stay calm while asserting your rights and ask for a lawyer. Record anything you can, even leaving an open 911 call if you feel your safety is in jeopardy. Ask for a supervisor. If you're being forced and physically threatened to comply with something like an unlawful search, say you only consent under protest (recording needed). reply AdamJacobMuller 17 hours agoparentI also think deception in the form of \"just admit you murdered the person and you can go home\" should be illegal. Police aren't empowered to make plea deals and they shouldn't imply or outright say that they can. reply giantg2 16 hours agorootparentWell yeah, that falls under deception of the law - they don't have the legal power to make deals. reply ClumsyPilot 16 hours agoparentprev [–] > Record anything you can Ironically, I would record phonecalls and it saved my butt when dealing with a scammy company.

Head to the installation page and start merging nonviolently today! Aspirations Mergiraf is designed with your needs in mind. Its goals are: Don't sweep conflicts under the rug Syntax-aware merging heuristics can sometimes be a bit too optimistic in considering a conflict resolved. Mergiraf does its best to err on the side of caution and retain conflict markers in the file when encountering suspicious cases. If it manages to resolve all conflicts on its own, it encourages you to review its mediation work via the mergiraf review command. If a merge looks faulty, you can report it easily. Be fast enough for interactive use Figure 2: Mergiraf offers to mediate Did you know that giraffes can run as fast as 60 kilometers per hour? Anyways. The operation of merging diverging versions of files happens routinely when working on a code base, often without you noticing as long as there aren't any conflicts. So Mergiraf tries to be quick so as not to interrupt you in your tasks. Be open to other methods In many cases, line-based merging works just great and there is no need for tree-munging business. If a line-based merge is conflict-free, then Mergiraf just returns that merge (which is very quick). One exception to this rule is when line-based merging creates duplicate keys. In such a case, Mergiraf does a bit more work to resolve the issue or highlight it to you with conflict markers. Figure 3: Harmony and peace reign on Earth Illustrations by Freya F-T, CC-BY 4.0.",

    "commentBody": "Mergiraf: a syntax-aware merge driver for Git (mergiraf.org)257 points by p4bl0 7 hours agohidepastfavorite57 comments DarkPlayer 3 hours agoLooking at the architecture, they will probably run into some issues. We are doing something similar with SemanticDiff [1] and also started out using tree-sitter grammars for parsing and GumTree for matching. Both choices turned out to be problematic. Tree sitter grammars are primarily written to support syntax highlighting and often use a best effort approach to parsing. This is perfectly fine for syntax highlighting, since the worst that can happen is that a few characters are highlighted incorrectly. However, when diffing or modifying code you really want the code to be parsed according to the upstream grammar, not something that mostly resembles it. We are currently in the process of moving away from tree-sitter and instead using the parsers provided by the languages themselves where possible. GumTree is good at returning a result quickly, but there are quite a few cases where it always returned bad matches for us, no matter how many follow-up papers with improvements we tried to implement. In the end we switched over to a dijkstra based approach that tries to minimize the cost of the mapping, which is more computationally expensive but gives much better results. Difftastic uses a similar approach as well. [1]: https://semanticdiff.com/ reply wetneb 3 hours agoparentThanks for the insightful comments! You surely have a lot more experience than me there, but my impression was that producing visual diffs and merging files are tasks that put different requirements on the tree matching algorithms, and Dijkstra-style approaches felt more fitting for diffs than for merging, so that's why I went for GumTree as it seemed to be the state of the art for merging. Does SemanticDiff offer a merge driver? I could only find documentation about diffing on the website. As to mismatches: yes, they are bound to happen in some cases. Even for line-based diffing, Git uses rather convoluted heuristics to avoid them (with the \"histogram\" diff algorithm), but they can't be completely ruled out there either. I hope that with enough safeguards (helper to review merges, downstream consistency checks with local fall-back to line-based diffing) they can be lived with. I'm happy to try other matching algorithms if they are more promising though (there isn't much coupling with the rest of the pipeline). Concerning tree-sitter, I have noticed some small issues, but nothing that was a show-stopper so far. I actually like it that it's designed for syntax highlighting, because it's really helpful that the representations it gives stay faithful to the original source, to avoid introducing reformatting noise in the merging process. Parsers written for a specific language can sometimes be too zealous (stripping comments out, doing some normalizations behind your back). That's a problem in Spork (which uses Spoon, a pretty advanced Java parser). And the uniform API tree-sitter offers over all those parsers is just too good to give up, in my opinion. reply DarkPlayer 2 hours agorootparentI don't think that different algorithms are better for merging or diffing. In both cases, the first step is to match identical nodes, and the quality of the final result depends heavily on this step. The main problem with GumTree is that it is a greedy algorithm. One incorrectly matched node can completely screw up the rest of the matches. A typical example we encountered was adding a decorator to a function in Python. When other functions with the same decorator followed, the algorithm would often map the newly added decorator to an existing decorator, causing all other decorator mappings to be \"off-by-one\". GumTree has a tendency to come up with more changes than there actually are. We try to really get the diff quality nailed down before going after merges. We don't have merge functionallity in SemanticDiff yet. The main issue we have with tree-sitter is that the grammars are often written from scratch and not based on the upstream grammar definition. Sometimes they only cover the most likely cases which can lead to parsing errors or incorrectly parsed code. When you encounter parsing errors it can be difficult to fix them, because the upstream grammar is structured completely different. To give you an example, try to compare the tree-sitter Go grammar for types [1] with the upstream grammar [2]. It is similar but the way the rules are structured is somewhat inverted. We use separate executables for the parsers (this also helps to secure them using seccomp on Linux), and they all use the same JSON schema for their output. This allows us to write the parser executable in the most appropriate language for the target language. Building all them statically and cross-platform for our VS Code extension isn't easy though ;) [1]: https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-go/blob/master/gr... [2]: https://go.dev/ref/spec#Types reply wetneb 1 hour agorootparentThanks for the details. Concerning matching for diffing vs for merging, the differences I can think of are: - for diffing, the matching of the leaves is what matters the most, for merging the internal nodes are more important, - for diffing, it feels more acceptable to restrict the matching to be monotonous on the leaves since it's difficult to visually represent moves if you can detect them. For merging, supporting moves is more interesting as it lets you replay changes on the moved element, - diffing needs to be faster than merging, so the accuracy/speed tradeoffs can be different. Packaging parsers into separate executables seems like hard work indeed! I assume you also considered fixing the tree-sitter grammars (vendoring them as needed, if the fixes can't be upstreamed)? Tree-sitter parsers are being used for a lot more than syntax highlighting these days (for instance GitHub's \"Symbols\" panel) so I would imagine maintainers should be open to making grammars more faithful to the official specs. I'm not particularly looking forward to maintaining dozens of forked grammars but it still feels a lot easier than writing parsers in different languages. I guess you have different distribution constraints also. reply Sesse__ 26 minutes agoparentprevAn important point here is that for certain languages, using the original grammar is pretty much impossible. In particular, for C, you want to do diffing and merging on the un-preprocessed source, but the language's grammar very much assumes the source has gone through the preprocessor. Of course, the existence of the preprocessor means there are situations where it's completely impossible to know what the correct parse is; it will necessarily be heuristic in some cases. reply drawnwren 26 minutes agoparentprevThis may or may not be on your radar, but crypto is desperate for a product like this. Smart contracts are often forks or rewrites (obfuscated or otherwise) of others and an easy interface for end users to be able to see changes between two forks would probably provide a lot of value. reply Game_Ender 4 hours agoprevThe tool has an excellent architecture section [0] that goes into how it works under the hood.

Rust has macros. People started using \"go generate\" for stuff like early generics. Does Mergiraf take EBNF or plugins or does a team fork it to explain their syntax? reply chrismorgan 7 hours agoprevGoing through the sorts of conflicts it solves, and limitations in that, I find it claiming that in some insertions, order doesn’t matter . I really don’t like that. At the language level, order may not matter, but quite frequently in such cases the order does matter, insofar as almost every human would put the two things in a particular order; or where there is a particular convention active. If you automatically merge the two sides in a different order from that, doing it automatically has become harmful. My clearest example: take Base `struct Foo; struct Bar;`, then between these two items, Left inserts `impl Foo { }`, Right inserts `struct Baz;`. To the computer, the difference doesn’t matter, but merging it as `struct Foo; struct Baz; impl Foo { } struct Bar;` is obviously bad to a human. This is the problem: it’s handling language syntax semantics, but can’t be aware of logical semantics. (Hope you can grasp what I’m trying to convey, not sure of the best words.) Left was not inserting something between Foo and Bar, it was attaching something to the end of Foo. Whereas Right was probably inserting something between Foo and Bar—but maybe even it was inserting something before Bar. You perceive that these are all different things, logically. Another example where this will quickly go wrong: in CSS rulesets, some will sort the declarations by property name lexicographically, some by property name length (seriously, it’s frequently so pretty), some will group by different types of property… you can’t know. reply soulofmischief 6 hours agoparentI sort my CSS by property type (display, size, position, etc). Takes a while to get used to it but it definitely speeds up my ability to do CSS surgery. reply wonger_ 5 hours agorootparentSimilarly, I've been wanting to make an autoformatter that reorders CSS properties into these categories: https://9elements.com/css-rule-order/ (box model, positioning, typography, etc) I think it's the most useful CSS organization method I've found yet. reply p4bl0 2 hours agorootparentThis is what I've always done naturally for the 20+ years I've been writing CSS.

That’s too coarse-grained. No idea about C♯, but languages could impose a rule that imports must come before anything else—long ago Rust had such a rule, for example. So it might be that within your compilation_unit node, only its using_directive children are commutative, and only among themselves. Otherwise (lapsing into Rust syntax for convenience), with Base `use A; struct X…`, Left `use A; use B; struct X…` and Right `use A; struct Y; struct X…`, you could end up with the invalid `use A; struct Y; use B; struct X…`. reply tokinonagare 4 hours agorootparent> No idea about C♯ C#'s using aren't imports, and order indeed doesn't matter. reply soraminazuki 3 hours agoparentprevNot only that, the order of fields in a Java class does matter despite what that link claims. It's common to use Lombok to automatically generate constructors, and \"the order of the parameters match the order in which the fields appear in your class.\" https://projectlombok.org/features/constructor The first two kinds of conflicts that Mergiraf handles looks somewhat dangerous to me when handled by a computer. https://mergiraf.org/conflicts.html reply andrewaylett 52 minutes agorootparentCode that uses Lombok features which change classes (rather than subclassing them) might have a high degree of similarity to Java, but it's not Java. reply wetneb 2 hours agorootparentprevLombok is an interesting example, but yes, just with reflection you can already get order-dependent behaviors as the docs note. I've been thinking about giving users more control over this commutativity, but it's not clear to me what it should look like. A strict mode where commutativity is disabled entirely? The ability to disable certain commutative parents? reply wetneb 6 hours agoparentprevYes, that's definitely something that could be refined, for instance by specifying that only children of specific types can be reordered together: https://codeberg.org/mergiraf/mergiraf/issues/6 reply andybak 6 hours agoparentprevCould some of this be mitigated by running a prettifier post-merge? reply wetneb 6 hours agorootparentIt's definitely something I would recommend in general, but I'm not sure if it would solve this particular problem (reordering blocks is perhaps a bit bold for a prettifier). reply CGamesPlay 6 hours agoparentprevBut surely Mergiraf has some opinion about the order when it doesn’t matter, right? Like structs before impls, in your example. reply wetneb 6 hours agorootparentFor now, you let it reorder every child within a given node type, which felt expressive enough to me in most cases, but I agree it would be good to refine that: https://codeberg.org/mergiraf/mergiraf/issues/6 reply lucasoshiro 6 hours agoprevHappy to see something being developed for merge drivers, they are a underrated Git feature that could save a lot since the standard three-way merge of file contents is not aware of the language and can create some problems. For example, if you have this valid Python code: x = input() if x == 'x': print('foo') print('bar') If you delete the first print in a branch, delete the other print in another branch, then merge the two branches, you'll have this: x = input() if x == 'x': Both branches delete a portion of the code inside the if block, leaving it only with a whitespace. In Python it is not a valid code, as they empty scopes need to be declared with pass. I installed Mergiraf to see if it can solve this situation, but sadly, it doesn't support Python... reply masklinn 5 hours agoparentFWIW your examples are very unclear as they use text formatting, you need to indent lines by 4 spaces (with an empty line before and after) for a code block e.g. if a == b: print(\"x\") versus if a == b: print(\"x\") reply chrismorgan 5 hours agorootparentThe minimum required is actually only two spaces. reply wetneb 5 hours agoparentprevI tried your example but git does create a conflict in my case - but maybe I misunderstood the scenario. Python support can likely be done (I would be thrilled if someone made a PR for it), but I don't know if there is a lot of potential for solving conflicts there: imports can have side effects, function arguments are complicated with the mixture of positional and keyword arguments, decorators are effectful… it seems to me that there is a lot of sensitivity to order in many places. reply leonheld 5 hours agoprevI'll certainly give it a try. Another tool I've been using (with varied degree of success) to enhance my git life is https://github.com/tummychow/git-absorb.

If it's not a drop-in replacement that makes my life better (like these easy \"git plugins\"), I'm basically not using. reply fallingsquirrel 3 hours agorootparentfwiw you can mix git and jj commands on the same repo and everything will work fine. If you want to stick with 99% git commands, and use jj only as a replacement for git-absorb, you can. For this particular use case, jj will handle merges/tags descended from the fixed commit gracefully, and I don't think git-absorb handles that. reply dochtman 4 hours agoparentprevgit absorb is great, use it all the time. reply jappgar 5 hours agoprevThis seems like a really cool idea that would help with a scenario I encounter a lot with conflicts related to auto-formatting. Sometimes a small change can lead to a lot of whitespace changes below (in functional chains in js, for example). Can this also detect some scenarios where semantic conflicts (but not line conflicts) arise, usually due to moved code? I don't know the exact circumstances when this happens, but occasionally you can have e.g a function defined twice after two branches both move the same function elsewhere. reply wetneb 5 hours agoparentYes, see this example: https://mergiraf.org/conflicts.html#line-based-merges reply cool-RR 1 hour agoprevI'm flummoxed at the lack of Python support. reply 77pt77 22 minutes agoparentNo typescript either, but it does support JS. reply _flux 4 hours agoprevPython support would certainly be seem useful for this, in particular as its intentation-based AST should play nicely with this. reply donatj 5 hours agoprevNeat idea for sure.

To be honest though none of the merge tools really give me enough information to resolve all conflicts easily. The best I've got to is zdiff3 in VSCode (not using their fancy merge view which I don't understand at all). But it's missing: 1. Blame for the merge base. 2. Detection of the commit that introduced the first conflict. 3. Most annoyingly, no way to show diffs between the \"current\" and \"incoming\". IIRC it has buttons to compare both of those to the merge base, but not to each other. That often leaves me visually scanning the text to manually find differences like a neanderthal. Sometimes it's annoying enough that I copy & paste current/incoming into files and then diff those but that's a right pain. reply Consider applying for YC's W25 batch!

    "originBody": "Defense confabulations Claude AI to process secret government data through new Palantir deal Critics worry Anthropic is endangering its \"ethical\" AI stance due to defense associations. Benj Edwards – Nov 8, 2024 10:08 PM53 Credit: Yuichiro Chino via Getty Images Credit: Yuichiro Chino via Getty Images Text settings Anthropic has announced a partnership with Palantir and Amazon Web Services to bring its Claude AI models to unspecified US intelligence and defense agencies. Claude, a family of AI language models similar to those that power ChatGPT, will work within Palantir's platform using AWS hosting to process and analyze data. But some critics have called out the deal as contradictory to Anthropic's widely-publicized \"AI safety\" aims. On X, former Google co-head of AI ethics Timnit Gebru wrote of Anthropic's new deal with Palantir, \"Look at how they care so much about 'existential risks to humanity.'\" The partnership makes Claude available within Palantir's Impact Level 6 environment (IL6), a defense-accredited system that handles data critical to national security up to the \"secret\" classification level. This move follows a broader trend of AI companies seeking defense contracts, with Meta offering its Llama models to defense partners and OpenAI pursuing closer ties with the Defense Department. In a press release, the companies outlined three main tasks for Claude in defense and intelligence settings: performing operations on large volumes of complex data at high speeds, identifying patterns and trends within that data, and streamlining document review and preparation. While the partnership announcement suggests broad potential for AI-powered intelligence analysis, it states that human officials will retain their decision-making authority in these operations. As a reference point for the technology's capabilities, Palantir reported that one (unnamed) American insurance company used 78 AI agents powered by their platform and Claude to reduce an underwriting process from two weeks to three hours. The new collaboration builds on Anthropic's earlier integration of Claude into AWS GovCloud, a service built for government cloud computing. Anthropic, which recently began operations in Europe, has been seeking funding at a valuation up to $40 billion. The company has raised $7.6 billion, with Amazon as its primary investor. An ethical minefield Since its founders started Anthropic in 2021, the company has marketed itself as one that takes an ethics- and safety-focused approach to AI development. The company differentiates itself from competitors like OpenAI by adopting what it calls responsible development practices and self-imposed ethical constraints on its models, such as its \"Constitutional AI\" system. As Futurism points out, this new defense partnership appears to conflict with Anthropic's public \"good guy\" persona, and pro-AI pundits on social media are noticing. Frequent AI commentator Nabeel S. Qureshi wrote on X, \"Imagine telling the safety-concerned, effective altruist founders of Anthropic in 2021 that a mere three years after founding the company, they'd be signing partnerships to deploy their ~AGI model straight to the military frontlines.\" Anthropic's \"Constitutional AI\" logo.

Credit: Anthropic / Benj Edwards Aside from the implications of working with defense and intelligence agencies, the deal connects Anthropic with Palantir, a controversial company which recently won a $480 million contract to develop an AI-powered target identification system called Maven Smart System for the US Army. Project Maven has sparked criticism within the tech sector over military applications of AI technology. It's worth noting that Anthropic's terms of service do outline specific rules and limitations for government use. These terms permit activities like foreign intelligence analysis and identifying covert influence campaigns, while prohibiting uses such as disinformation, weapons development, censorship, and domestic surveillance. Government agencies that maintain regular communication with Anthropic about their use of Claude may receive broader permissions to use the AI models. Even if Claude is never used to target a human or as part of a weapons system, other issues remain. While its Claude models are highly regarded in the AI community, they (like all LLMs) have the tendency to confabulate, potentially generating incorrect information in a way that is difficult to detect. That's a huge potential problem that could impact Claude's effectiveness with secret government data, and that fact, along with the other associations, has Futurism's Victor Tangermann worried. As he puts it, \"It's a disconcerting partnership that sets up the AI industry's growing ties with the US military-industrial complex, a worrying trend that should raise all kinds of alarm bells given the tech's many inherent flaws—and even more so when lives could be at stake.\" Benj Edwards Senior AI Reporter Benj Edwards Senior AI Reporter Benj Edwards is Ars Technica's Senior AI Reporter and founder of the site's dedicated AI beat in 2022.

    "commentBody": "Claude AI to process secret government data through new Palantir deal (arstechnica.com)223 points by lawls 20 hours agohidepastfavorite165 comments JCM9 17 hours agoWhat’s so special about Palantir? They seem to trade on this mystique of doing “secret government work” (spoiler alert most secret government work isn’t all that exiting). From what I’ve seen it’s fairly routing analytics and ML with a lot of humans deployed to deal with the usual messiness of any dataset. What am I missing? reply Cheer2171 16 hours agoparentPalantir was created by the US intelligence community to be their vendor. Palantir's first VC investment (outside of Thiel's self fund) was literally the CIA, through its In-Q-Tel VC firm. Their moat is that they are trusted to do whatever you pay them to do and to not bite the hand that feeds them. And that if you're the kind of engineer to organize against a Project Maven, you really don't want to work for Peter Thiel. reply nova22033 16 hours agorootparenthttps://thehustle.co/newsletters/%F0%9F%92%B3-how-paypal-fra... reply smolder 11 hours agorootparentprevIn-Q-tel also had a hand in Facebook's rise. I remember being laughed at in about 2010 and called a conspiracy theorist for suggesting big tech was on intelligence agencies' leash, but it's pretty clearly true. Society is being shaped from the shadows. Edit: I overstated the first sentence. It wasn't In-Q-tel, just someone who might have been sympathetic. reply ben_w 8 hours agorootparent> Society is being shaped from the shadows. Always; yet at the same time, because of those shadows, almost all specific claims of some specific face being spotted in those shadows isn't correct. Thiel personally, and the name \"Palantir\", gives off Bond Villain vibes (yes I know it's LOTR). How much of that is the actual threat, vs. an unmarked shipping crate owned on paper by \"Dave's Shrimp Inc.\"? reply odyssey7 6 hours agorootparentThe unmarked crate can blow up and destroy individual people. A secretive governing process can overstep, undermining democracy or subverting constitutional rights. If the crate blows up, generally the public will know about it. If important calls are made without public oversight, then the public won’t know about them. This might deprive the electorate of a chance to shape those processes democratically or to go through the courts, where their rights could be defended or where they could be compensated for harms. Fortunately, I can’t think of any examples of when secretive organizational processes have harbored abusive dynamics. Not even in more mundane organizations with far less authority, like the Boy Scouts of America. Public officials and their reports can always be trusted to do the right thing, so public oversight is never necessary. reply ben_w 4 hours agorootparentI think we're on the same page on what's bad with secretive stuff. Given that the opponents of your government can use the same information as the general public to determine the blind spots of your intelligence agencies, I'm not sure what to do about that, though I am hopeful that we're rapidly approaching the point where any motivated teenager can sucessfully spy on a government and at that point there's much less benefit for agencies to be secretive. I hope. But all that aside, my point was that conspiracy theories are often wrong even when there's an actual conspiracy in the same general area. reply zaptrem 10 hours agorootparentprevThis would have been interesting if true, but this other HN comment suggests it isn’t https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9374977 reply smolder 10 hours agorootparentThey suggest the connection is tenuous, not that there is none.

Corporations have their use, but predominantly, they're corner cutters[1]. Their function is to chase higher profits by reducing costs. This is not a skillset with no value; it's why you can now get an 85\" television for less than the cost of a mid-range laptop; but it does mean that their capacity for innovation is inherently limited. The way this always worked was the government would sponsor research into new tech, get it and use it, and then the patents and licenses would be disseminated into the private sector and be re-packaged as products. Think of the first iPhone; the LCD screen was a result of DARPA projects looking to reduce the beefy CRT displays to something more usable in vehicles and aircraft; the multi-touch screen was developed by CERN; the GPS system was originally conceived to track deployed materiel in warzones, etc. That doesn't mean Apple did no work of course, combining all of these things is no trivial matter. I'm just saying that most tech has it's roots in defense/intel grants that fund the research, because building new technology is fucking expensive and most corporations won't do it because it's terrible ROI. Edit: I remembered the note I wanted to add for corner cutters: [1]: The primary exception being a corporation that does not yet need to make profits, which is where you find investor-funded startups and incubator arrangements like Google had during their early time. reply skybrian 14 hours agoparentprevHere are some in-depth blog posts from ex-employees: https://sarahconstantin.substack.com/p/the-great-data-integr... https://nabeelqu.substack.com/p/reflections-on-palantir reply EasyMark 3 hours agoparentprevI think while lots of corps do business with the government and love the money, Palantir is next level and seems to be aimed completely at serving the government and especially intelligence communities as the go to, which means that if there is a swamp, there are in the most gassy part of the swamp, we are talking fartville, microbial smorgasbord indigestion version.

It's not trump's plan but they'll do it in his name anyway, if not they can always 25th amendment him and have Vance instead. The authors and their acolytes will all be in his cabinet. They have the presidency, the house, senate, supreme court and already have many federalist society judges in place. Will they be able to do everything in the plan? Probably not.

Its hard to find a single institution that some group hasn't tried to shutdown, control or exploit.

Isn't that what we already have now?

I mean, if there's a revolving open door between these three entities: 1. government 2. business 3. media Then what we get seems to amount to corporate fiefdom, at least in its effects. In the words of Walter in The Big Lebowski: \"Am I wrong?\" Put differently: if you look at the larger threats we face as a species, and then if you look at the larger trends of how nation states (\"democracies\") actually act, the actions don't seem to track whatsoever with the desires of populations, and they do seem to track very accurately with the desires of big business.

The Ukraine war wasn't started for the USA to profit and nobody on the western side (including Ukraine itself) was lied to to allow it to happen.

The only difference between a legal and an illegal migrant is paperwork. If the paperwork route was a viable alternative, nobody would risk their lives crossing a river or a giant desert to do it illegally. reply _heimdall 6 hours agorootparentprevWell I can give two American cents here. I don't defend illegal immigration, I take issue with today's immigration laws. I view our current immigration problems as an obvious side effect of welfare programs - creating financial incentives to physically be in the country means the government budget is a blank check and people have a reason to move here other than the hope of making a better life for themselves. In my view, those immigration problems should be a sign that our welfare programs can't function without strong borders and heavily controlled immigration. We can't seem to solve immigration management, and until we do we should abandon the welfare programs and accept that people will move here if they want to. Edit: I can also come at this from a fundamental rights angle. I am a strong believer in individual rights and don't believe that I have the right to decide who can live here. reply ethbr1 2 hours agorootparentThe central driver of migration is global wealth disparity. What is grinding poverty in the US isn't too bad compared to the same in Haiti. reply _heimdall 1 hour agorootparentSure, I can agree with that. I mentioned the incentives welfare programs create and maybe that doesn't play as big a role as I expect for motivating immigrants. It is a structural problem of sorts though, welfare programs and immigration are financially at odds with one another. I don't personally have any problem whatsoever with someone from a poorer country immigrating to the US (not saying that was your argument here) and don't agree with any immigration laws that limit based on wealth. The US wouldn't be what it is today if only the wealthy were ever allowed to immigrate here. reply ben_w 8 hours agorootparentprevAlso not American. Some hire the illegal immigrants, and many benefit from the lower prices this brings. The game theoretic payoff varies a lot depending on which specific interest and timescale you have, including from the countries the migrants come from who probably don't want their moderately capable citizens — above average but not by enough to do it legally — leaving, and wose: getting badly paid jobs so they can't send much cash back home. reply saagarjha 7 hours agorootparentprevI would expect the answer to mostly lie with what decides what \"legal\" is.

On the one hand you are right, there are military money and people involved in essentially every high-tech firm and university project in the USA. On the other hand, a lot of the time this is done as an easy way of subsidizing a potentially useful civil technology without going into the weeds of Congress and public discussions about how to allocate grants and so on. The military budget acts partly as a discretionary fund that the US government can use to fund (civil) R&D as it sees fit without as much red tape. Noam Chomsky wrote about this from his experience at MIT. Especially in the 70s and 80s, MIT was getting lots of grant money from defense spending, and every professor could access it by simply putting some fictitious \"possible military applications\" on their research into shortest-path algorithms or what have you. Of course, this plays it both ways, because providing the money, even as a thinly veiled subsidy, also allows you to come back later and assert some control if it does turn out it could be beneficial for \"defense\" purposes. reply ryukoposting 5 hours agoparentprevYeah, more or less. The US uses the DoD as its private-sector R&D funding firehose. They aren't writing Raytheon a $800B check and saying \"make us some missiles.\" They might write a $4B check for some missiles, but that leaves $876B left over based on 2023's defense spending numbers. Most of the money goes to stuff you wouldn't even think of as \"military equipment.\" Stuff like medical devices, security, communications, networking, search-and-rescue, and so on. Morally neutral-to-good things that the military needs, but so does everyone else. As a business, the difference between the DoD and the rest of the market is that the DoD is a single institution with the budget and willingness to bankroll your R&D.

The founders talked about how throughout the industry and the world, tons more data was being generated than ever before (of course), but we (humanity) didn't have a good handle on making use of all of that data, so a lot of it was not being interpreted, reacted to, etc. Not long after that, I found out that Palantir got their first energy industry customer. Some employees in Palantir thought it wouldn't be worthwhile to go after oil & gas companies because they viewed them as old school and slow to adapt to new ways of doing things. However, in those days Palantir was focused on acquiring no more than one customer per industry, because they were trying to boost their valuation as quickly as possible and wanted to demonstrate how many industries they could serve. And then, due to a contrarian within the company, they did get an O&G customer, and it was the biggest single deal so far in the company's history. What I don't know is exactly how well they served that customer. What I do know is that they were selling the customer on the idea that they have sooooo much data and they're leaving tons of low-hanging fruit that could easily boost savings in the company. Stick all this data into Palantir's product and we'll help you on a million fronts and therefore boost your profits significantly. One example is the longevity of machine parts and all the data you can get about historical wear and tear, etc. Now, this is what they were selling, and I don't know which areas ended up being the most helpful, but yeah, as someone else in here said, they were insisting on customers putting in all the data they have and the product would make connections, or reveal insights, etc. Even if it's a crude product by Star Trek standards, you've gotta admit there is probably a ton of low-hanging fruit like that in most companies, and a lot of the time they don't go after all that because they're making money, but just don't have extra manpower or expertise to look into all that, so if Palantir delivers on the promise to boost the bottom line, then I guess it's worth it. It also means there's room to compete, although a big problem is even if you're a sharp cookie, Palantir probably started with way more business connections than most nerds will ever have. reply yeahwhatever10 15 hours agoparentprevThe product demos show some features but obviously not everything. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxKghrZU5w8 reply extr 12 hours agorootparentSo it's like observability metrics but for ships and missles and such that people care about in the real world.

When I built my own website it seemed natural (but with hindsight, not the ideal security posture) to treat it as my home. Over time I started saving a backup of my digital home locally. But for a long time it was just a backup. The source of truth in my mind was in the cloud. Most of what has happened recently is a piecemeal inversion where I start thinking of the local copy of various things as the ground truth. Eventually I noticed my cloud server was altogether too beefy for a tiny website and a glorified backup server. I moved the data to a dedicated backup service and started pushing backups up from my laptop. Then I downsized the server; all it needs to do now is run the website.

We specifically focus on Urbit, as an NRx digital architecture that captures how post-neoliberal politics imagines notions of freedom and sovereignty through a micro-fracturing of nation-states into ‘gov-corps’. We trace the development of NRx philosophy – and situate this within contemporary political and technological change to theorize the significance of exit manifest within the notion of ‘dynamic geographies’. While technological programmes such as Urbit may never ultimately succeed, we argue that these, and other speculative investments such as ‘seasteading’, reflect broader post-neoliberal NRx imaginaries that were, perhaps, prefigured a quarter of a century ago in The Sovereign Individual. reply dmicah 14 hours agorootparentprevThese are all concepts related to Curtis Yarvin: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin reply immibis 15 hours agorootparentprevPresumably that they are all instances of the American government suppressing its citizens. reply thr0waway_abcd 15 hours agoparentprevIt's all out in the open, I can't be alone in seeing it, right?

But you have to simulate whats possible to prepare for the worst, and the inner circles are way ahead so whenever the public gets some pieces of info, know that any criticism lags behind. Which is why it's so important to hack away at your institutions, corporations and individuals in relevant networks. Their systems and jobs have to get harder, faster, stronger, smarter and that requires radical criticism so that a) the job description only fits the best, and b) the job environment doesn't disgust the best.

I was born into and grew up in a spot 'betwixt and between', with much of what I need to become successful, rich & powerful but at the same feeling so damn disgusted by the ways of the people I'd have to deal with that I would rather not support them at all. That nonsense got amplified by leftist bullshit, trusting people I shouldn't have. Then I got diagnosed with ADHD and a proper analysis of my psyche and my life revealed that my only issue was to get 'friends' when I should have stayed at home hacking away at stuff. They were earlier more aware/conscious and I let myself get dragged to parties, liquor and mild drugs but that Rausch was enough for my hyperactive imagination to lose any sense for accomplishment and the concrete things I could actually do to get into the right positions to make change happen and shape my environment to my (obviously better) tastes. So every time I read \"support your gov.\", my brain goes 'grrrr' and triggers an avalanche of emotions and rationalisations that end in \"it's all super-gay Mafia hierarchies and there's nothing you can do because all of 'dem gays' are too fragile to withstand the pressure of being an actual man\". ( I'm not homophobic, back in the day it meant nothing but submissive, ass licking, it was metaphorical ) So my previous post is meant to encourage myself and others to not get pulled into these hierarchies as obedient participants and beneficiaries but as competitors, breaking, hacking and fixing all the weak spots in these hierarchies and systems.

    "originLink": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03647-0",
    "originBody": "NEWS 08 November 2024 This scientist treated her own cancer with viruses she grew in the lab Virologist Beata Halassy says self-treatment worked and was a positive experience — but researchers warn that it is not something others should try. By Zoe Corbyn Twitter Facebook Email Viruses such as measles (pictured here) can be used to attack cancerous cells. Credit: Eye Of Science/Science Photo Library A scientist who successfully treated her own breast cancer by injecting the tumour with lab-grown viruses has sparked discussion about the ethics of self-experimentation. Beata Halassy discovered in 2020, aged 49, that she had breast cancer at the site of a previous mastectomy. It was the second recurrence there since her left breast had been removed, and she couldn’t face another bout of chemotherapy. Halassy, a virologist at the University of Zagreb, studied the literature and decided to take matters into her own hands with an unproven treatment. A case report published in Vaccines in August1 outlines how Halassy self-administered a treatment called oncolytic virotherapy (OVT) to help treat her own stage 3 cancer. She has now been cancer-free for four years. In choosing to self-experiment, Halassy joins a long line of scientists who have participated in this under-the-radar, stigmatized and ethically fraught practice. “It took a brave editor to publish the report,” says Halassy. Up-and-coming therapy OVT is an emerging field of cancer treatment that uses viruses to both attack cancerous cells and provoke the immune system into fighting them. Most OVT clinical trials so far have been in late-stage, metastatic cancer, but in the past few years they have been directed towards earlier-stage disease. One OVT, called T-VEC, has been in approved in the United States to treat metastatic melanoma, but there are as yet no OVT agents approved to treat breast cancer of any stage, anywhere in the world. Halassy stresses that she isn’t a specialist in OVT, but her expertise in cultivating and purifying viruses in the laboratory gave her the confidence to try the treatment. She chose to target her tumour with two different viruses consecutively — a measles virus followed by a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Both pathogens are known to infect the type of cell from which her tumour originated, and have already been used in OVT clinical trials. A measles virus has been trialled against metastatic breast cancer. Halassy had previous experience working with both viruses, and both have a good safety record. The strain of measles she chose is used extensively in childhood vaccines, and the strain of VSV induces, at worst, mild influenza-like symptoms. Halassy’s experience with self-treatment has changed the focus of her research. Credit: Ivanka Popić Over a two-month period, a colleague administered a regime of treatments with research-grade material freshly prepared by Halassy, injected directly into her tumour. Her oncologists agreed to monitor her during the self-treatment, so that she would be able to switch to conventional chemotherapy if things went wrong. The approach seemed to be effective: over the course of the treatment, and with no serious side effects, the tumour shrank substantially and became softer. It also detached from the pectoral muscle and skin that it had been invading, making it easy to remove surgically. How a trove of cancer genomes could improve kids’ leukaemia treatment Analysis of the tumour after removal showed that it was thoroughly infiltrated with immune cells called lymphocytes, suggesting that the OVT had worked as expected and provoked Halassy’s immune system to attack both the viruses and the tumour cells. “An immune response was, for sure, elicited,” says Halassy. After the surgery, she received a year’s treatment with the anticancer drug trastuzumab. Stephen Russell, an OVT specialist who runs virotherapy biotech company Vyriad in Rochester, Minnesota, agrees that Halassy’s case suggests the viral injections worked to shrink her tumour and cause its invasive edges to recede. But he doesn’t think her experience really breaks any new ground, because researchers are already trying to use OVT to help treat earlier-stage cancer. He isn’t aware of anyone trying two viruses sequentially, but says it isn’t possible to deduce whether this mattered in an ‘n of 1’ study. “Really, the novelty here is, she did it to herself with a virus that she grew in her own lab,” he says. Ethical dilemma Halassy felt a responsibility to publish her findings. But she received more than a dozen rejections from journals — mainly, she says, because the paper, co-authored with colleagues, involved self-experimentation. “The major concern was always ethical issues,” says Halassy. She was particularly determined to persevere after she came across a review highlighting the value of self-experimentation2. That journals had concerns doesn’t surprise Jacob Sherkow, a law and medicine researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who has examined the ethics of researcher self-experimentation in relation to COVID-19 vaccines. Huge leap in breast cancer survival rate The problem is not that Halassy used self-experimentation as such, but that publishing her results could encourage others to reject conventional treatment and try something similar, says Sherkow. People with cancer can be particularly susceptible to trying unproven treatments. Yet, he notes, it’s also important to ensure that the knowledge that comes from self-experimentation isn’t lost. The paper emphasizes that self-medicating with cancer-fighting viruses “should not be the first approach” in the case of a cancer diagnosis. “I think it ultimately does fall within the line of being ethical, but it isn’t a slam-dunk case,” says Sherkow, adding that he would have liked to see a commentary fleshing out the ethics perspective, published alongside the case report. Halassy has no regrets about self-treating, or her dogged pursuit of publication. She thinks it is unlikely that someone would try to copy her, because the treatment requires so much scientific knowledge and skill. And the experience has given her own research a new direction: in September she got funding to investigate OVT to treat cancer in domestic animals. “The focus of my laboratory has completely turned because of the positive experience with my self-treatment,” she says. doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-03647-0 References Forčić, D. et al.

The history of science is already full of self-experimenters, so at the margin publishing is unlikely to move the needle. Furthermore, patients with cancer diagnoses are already extremely motivated to try whatever experimental treatments the FDA will permit; self-experimentation is already supply-constrained (of experiment opportunities) and there is excess demand. Again fuzzy concerns about population-level harms overrule individuals’ rights to seek treatments for their fatal diagnoses. reply MostlyStable 11 minutes agoparentI've been at least partly convinced that \"medical ethics\" very frequently looks nothing at all like what most people consider to be ethical. As far as I can tell, it exists mostly to prevent anyone from getting in trouble in the case that something goes wrong (which often means \"do nothing\"), rather than actually consider what is or is not ethical. It seems to be completely infected by the Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics [0] So, while they aren't always wrong, my default opinion is that, until given compelling evidence to the contrary, I shouldn't worry too much about what medical ethicists think on a particular topic. Even when they are right, they are usually right in a way that most normal people can easily see that it is correct.

The problem with a nominal fee is fraudsters can be really clever at finding ways to bump up production costs. You might give the company doing the research relaxed liability, but even then you'd want to be careful. After all, you wouldn't want a coal mining operation conducting \"research on lung cancer treatment\" by sending in miners without PPE.

R&D corp attempts to find a cure for the disease, if the mission fails and John dies, in the future if other patients with cancer X appear, they can take over from where they left.

Is it considered unethical to do medical experiments on yourself without any oversight like you would find in a typical human subject trial? reply jpeloquin 1 minute agoparent> Is it considered unethical to do medical experiments on yourself without any oversight like you would find in a typical human subject trial? Note there are different contexts at play here. When someone says \"ethics\" in a scientific context, it may encompass scientific integrity, avoidance of questionable research practices, reproducibility, etc., as well as medical and moral ethics. The speaker may not even be fully aware of these distinctions, since the subject is often taught with a rule-based perspective. Experimentation on oneself is often _scientifically_ unethical (i.e., when done with the intent to make a scientific discovery) because: 1. The result is often too contaminated by experimental integrity issues to have scientific value. As another comment in this thread notes: \"sample size of 1, confirmation bias, amped-up placebo effect, lack of oversight, conflict of interest when the patient is the investigator\". Lack of oversight means no one is checking the validity of your work, it's not a permission thing. Every issue that is blamed for the so-called reproducibility crisis is worse. 2. Due to publication pressure, abandoning the cultural prohibition against self-experimentation amounts to pressuring everyone to self-experiment to grow their CV by a few quick N = 1 studies, or do something risky when their career flags. Obviously, oversight to ensure that self-experimentation proceeds only in cases of terminal disease mitigates this concern. In practice, journal editors currently provide oversight addressing point #2, which is why work like what we're discussing here still gets published. See also Karen Wetterhahn's valuable documentation of her (accidental) dimethylmercury poisoning (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Wetterhahn). Experimentation on oneself in an attempt to cure your own illness by any means at your disposal, provided you do not harm others, is not _morally_ unethical IMO. It just rarely has a scientific role. reply odyssey7 3 hours agoparentprevIt is considered not definitive, given the sample size of 1, confirmation bias, amped-up placebo effect, lack of oversight, conflict of interest when the patient is the investigator… but you’re usually allowed to do what you want with your own body. reply card_zero 3 hours agorootparentThe relevant Wikipedia page says all that too, but then confuses matters by listing about 50 notable examples. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-experimentation_in_medici... reply odyssey7 36 minutes agorootparentNot definitive ≠ useless reply vikramkr 3 hours agoparentprevYou can do whatever you want to yourself.

Particularly in America, where it can bill for them. reply hello_computer 59 minutes agoparentprev [–] The problem with immunotherapy--going all the way back to Imhotep--is the same problem with antibiotic resistance: directed evolution. Kill the cancer cells that are susceptible to one treatment (be it chemo, radiation, immune system, or something else), then the cancer cells that are not susceptible survive and continue to multiply. We get a remission, but it comes back later with a vengeance. They know this, so oncology has pivoted to \"combination therapy\", but many of the official treatments are so toxic that combining them may kill you faster than the cancer. But you are right about the commercial aspect. More money in treatments than in cures. If a cure ever comes, it is more likely to come from \"the people\" sharing notes over the internet than Pfizer or Novo Nordisk. But with the amount of money involved, it is an open question as to how long such an internet--where people are allowed to freely discuss things--will survive. reply Consider applying for YC's W25 batch!

And glad to see it's MIT licensed. I wonder if it is feasible to use this as a replacement for p2k, instapaper etc for the purpose of reading on Kindle. One annoyance with these services is that the rendering is way off -- h elements not showing up as headers, elements missing randomly, source code incorrectly rendered in 10 different ways. Some are better than others, but generally they are disappointing. (Yet they expect you to pay a subscription fee.) If this is an actively maintained project that welcomes contribution, I could test it out with various articles and report/fix issues. Although I wonder how much work there will be for handling edge cases of all the websites out there. reply JohannesKauf 4 hours agoparentThere are two parts to it: 1) convert html to markdown This is what my library specifically addresses, and I believe it handles this task robustly. There was a lot of testing involved. For example, I used the CommonCrawl Dataset to automatically catch edge cases. 2) Identify article content This is the more challenging aspect. You need to identify and extract the main content while removing peripheral elements (navigation bars, sidebars, ads, etc.) For example, the top of the markdown document will have lots of links from the navbar otherwise. Mozilla's \"Readability\" project (and its various ports) is the most used solution in this space. However, it relies on heuristic rules that need adjustments to work on every website. --- The html-to-markdown project in combination with some heuristic would be great match!

I've used your library for a few years in a Lambda function which takes a URL and converts it to Markdown for storage in S3. I hooked it into every \"bookmark\" app I use as a webhook so I save a Markdown copy of everything I bookmark, which makes it very handy for importing into Obsidian. reply JohannesKauf 6 hours agoparentOh very nice to hear, thank you very much! That’s actually a great idea! I personally use Raindrop for bookmarking articles. But I can’t find stuff in the search. The other day “Embeddings are underrated” was on HN. That would actually be a good approach for finding stuff later on. Using webhooks, converting to markdown, generating embedding and then enjoying a better search. You just gave me the idea for my next weekend project :-) reply cpursley 8 hours agoprevThis is really nice, especially for feeding LLMs web page data (they generally understand markdown well). I built something similar for the Elixir world but it’s much more limited (I might borrow some of your ideas): https://github.com/agoodway/html2markdown reply JohannesKauf 7 hours agoparent> built something similar for the Elixir We interact with the web so much that it’s worth having such a library in every language... Great that you took the time and wrote one for the Elixir community! Feel free to contact me if you want to ping-pong some ideas! > feeding LLMs web page data Exactly, that one use case that got quite popular. There is also the feature of keeping specific HTML tags (e.g.and ) to give the LLM a bit more context about the page. reply jaggirs 7 hours agoparentprevWhy not just give the html to the llm? reply zexodus 7 hours agorootparentContext size limits are usually the reason. Most websites I want to scrape end up being over 200K tokens. Tokenization for HTML isn't optimal because symbols like '', '/', etc. end up being separate tokens, whereas whole words can be one token if we're talking about plain text. Possible approaches include transforming the text to MD or minimizing the HTML (e.g., removing script tags, comments, etc.). reply dtjohnnyb 5 hours agorootparentprevI was trying to do this recently for Web page summarization. As said below the token sizes would end up over the context length, so I trimmed the html to fit just to see what would happen. I found that the LLM was able to extract information, but it very commonly would start trying to continue the html blocks that had been left open in the trimmed input. Presumably this is due to instruction tuning on coding tasks I'd love to figure out a way to do it though, it seems to me that there's a bunch of rich description of the website in the html reply kgeist 7 hours agorootparentprevI remember there was a paper which found that LLMs understand HTML pretty well, you don't need additional preprocessing. The downside is that HTML produces more tokens than Markdown. reply simonw 7 hours agorootparentRight: the token savings can be enormous here. Use https://tools.simonwillison.net/jina-reader to fetch the https://news.ycombinator.com/ homepage as Markdown and paste it into https://tools.simonwillison.net/claude-token-counter - 1550 tokens. Same thing as HTML: 13367 tokens. reply throwup238 6 hours agoprevThis is probably out of scope for your tool but it’d be nice to have built in n-gram deduplication where the tool strips any identical content from the header and footer, like navigation, when pointed at a few of these markdown files. reply JohannesKauf 4 hours agoparentMy final university project was about a clean-up-approach on the HTML nodes before sending it to the html-to-markdown converter. But that was extremely difficult and dependent on some heuristics that had to be tweaked. Your idea of comparing multiple pages would be a great approach. It would be amazing if you build something like this! This would enable so many more use cases... For example a better “send to kindle” (see other comment from rty32 [1]).

    "originBody": "New Kind of Paper, Part Five November 8, 2024 · Milan Lajtoš new kind of paper, thinking, computation, paper & pencil, human-computer interaction, Apple In the previous parts (1, 2, 3, 4) written in 2021, I described New Kind of Paper – an app that enhances paper & pencil, the best medium for thinking, with the capabilities of a crazy advanced calculator. In 2024, Apple introduced their spin on this topic under the name Math Notes. In this article, I will provide my deep praise (and even deeper hate) for their attempt to bring a bit of innovation into the UX of math. Let's start with a simple example of how Math Notes works... Writing a math expression in Apple Math Notes It *fucking* works! 🥹 At first glance, it may not seem like much, but in this brief example, a lot has happened. First, the handwriting recognition worked flawlessly, despite my awful handwriting. It perfectly recognized what I meant by those scratch marks. Second, after I wrote the trigger symbol, = (the equal sign), the expression was evaluated, and the result was inserted inline, mimicking my handwriting style. The inline insertion could be improved to better match the handwriting style, but overall, this is basically magic. With my writing magic wand, I have conjured up a little computational spell. 🪄 The fact that millions of people have this technology at their fingertips and pencil tips (works both on iPads & iPhones too), is a major miracle. The democratization of this technology is the hardest part, and it is in the hands of the people who know how to get shit done. Maybe not on the first try, but the third iteration... *chef's kiss* Too Magical & Not Alive Enough How do you know that the result is correct? The calculation is definitely correct, but how can you trust your calculator to recognize your badly handwritten \"1\" as \"1\" and not as \"7\"? You simply don't. This is essentially Apple claiming that their handwriting recognition is infallible. It's a rather bold claim, don't you think? I appreciate the confidence, but I don't believe we have reached that level of accuracy yet. Even basic calculators indicate which button you (mis-)pressed. Why does it appear lifeless most of the time? If you only saw the first 90% of that demonstration, you wouldn't even know if this thing works. Honestly, it seemed dead most of the time. And when the result finally appeared, it was accompanied by flashy animation. 🫣 I love the animation, and I understand why it adds a nice touch to the initial version, but it's really just a distraction. This calculator should feel MORE alive! Of course, talk is cheap, so let me demonstrate what I mean: Writing a math expression with live feedback (source, 2021) Not as polished, but it is alive! And snappy. And colorful. The feedback is immediate, and you can see the result as you write. This kind of feedback instills trust in the system and gives you a sense of control. Of course, Apple will fix these issues differently... The first problem – whether the system recognized your handwriting correctly – can be solved with another iPadOS feature called Smart Script. It lets you beautify your handwriting – simply write an ugly \"1\" and it will progressively transform the scribble into neatly handwritten \"1\" or \"7\". The point is to inform the user, give them feedback on how the system recognized the symbol. This helps tremendously with the trust issue. The second problem, the missing liveness, is even easier to solve – just ditch the \"=\" and evaluate the expression when the user pauses. Not too eager, not too lazy. This \"interactive\" mode can be simulated in Math Notes with this technique: \"Interactive\" mode in Math Notes & number of WTF moments Scratch to Delete *no comment* Unnecessary switching between writing and erasing & 2-second long inconsistent state The Math You Know™ 2D notation Math Notes supports 2D notation – you can write exponents as superscript, use fractions, etc. You know, the usual scary math stuff: Example of 2D notation: Relation between exponentiation, divison, and logarithm. Every operation has different 2D representation. I know how crazy difficult this must have been to pull off. *Bravo!* PEMDAS PEMDAS – the order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction. It's everywhere. It's in our textbooks, our calculators, programming languages and now even in Apple's Math Notes. *sigh* Illustration of operator precedence The Future of Math Notation Supporting the traditional handwritten math notation is no easy task. It is extremely messy, inconsistent and sometimes ambiguous. However, a calculator that wants to be useful must support ideas that have been forged for centuries. It is hard to change math. When math started to become executable in form of software & hardware, we developed consistent notation that was shaped by keyboards, not by pencils. We migrated from 2D into 1D, misused some glyphs, and introduced constructs that made sense for computing. Math definitely adapted to this new medium. Math Notes embodies even newer medium on which math can grow and change. While supporting existing traditional notation is a must, adding ability to define custom notation is an aspiration. We can't evolve math if the medium does not allow it. Today, the notation in Math Notes is fixed and it doesn't even cover a lot of useful math (e.g. calculus). This is fine in the short term, but if we are serious, we should start to think about user-definable 2D notation. Heck, even user-definable operators (e.g. ≈ or ⊙) would be a good first step. While Math Notes isn't doing anything on this front yet, Apple leaned heavily into different direction... Dynamic Scribbles Since we are not stuck with static scribbles on the paper, Math Notes supports some dynamic behaviors, e.g. changing a numeric value just by dragging a slider. Simple means of \"solving\". Circular knob with different speeds might be better in the long-term, but the slider is a great choice for first iteration. Or graphing a function... Term \"graphing calculator\" has a new meaning now. These are fantastic features that millions of people will love. With just a scribble and touch of a finger, I can solve non-trivial computational problems. Can you imagine the effort, if you wanted to achieve the same thing in e.g. Python? *Bleh..* However, graphs are dead – they do not respond to changing coefficients... Graphs in Math Notes are useful, but dead. λλλ One obvious omission in this part of Math Notes, is proper function definition. Define a function, see its graph, and be able to evaluate it with a specific input value. You know, something like this... Mockup of a better function definition. Showing a point at [1, 10] would be neat... This notation for function definition (or lambdas/λ in comp-sci jargon) is pretty understandable and supports multiple arguments. Also, it opens up a route to primitive custom (infix) operators. Solving Way Harder Stuff All these features are hinting at a calculator that is a good companion for a mind that wants to solve problems that can be turned into a computation. So far, the capabilities of Math Notes are pretty limited – e.g. how would you sum up numbers from 1 to 100? That is a pretty easy computational problem, but you can't solve it easily with this type of calculator – yet. However, \"solving\" is much broader topic than a straight-to-an-answer computation. What about problems that involve optimizing a function with thousand of parameters in an iterated manner? This problem-solving technique is currently limited to small set of smart people. Math Notes could unlock it for much broader, and younger audience. Like Excel did open up sophisticated computation for mere mortals. But this time in a much more humane way. ∞ Amount of Constructive Criticism... I have been thinking about this type of calculator for many many years, and I am extremely happy to see this new kind of calculator in the wild. I want to see it used by everybody – from curious 5 year olds to PhD-level professionals in the science & engineering. Solving our personal problems and civilization-level ones too. We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done. – Alan Turing Do you have ideas about this kind of stuff? Please share them online!

It generates confidence in the output. Some things aren’t obvious until we see them. This is one. reply mlajtos 11 hours agoparentI thought the same few years ago – putting recognized symbol above is simple and effective. But you can get the same effect (confidence in recognized input) with the Smart Script technique when done right. I briefly experimented with that in 2022 (nothing published though) and it worked pretty well. However, the implementation has to be good – you can't just beautify every symbol because it becomes distracting really fast. The less confidence system has about some symbol, the more it should fix it. High-confidence misclassifications will still be a theoretical problem, but I didn't experienced them that often. reply MBCook 13 hours agoparentprevI don’t know, it seems unnecessary to me. Why do I need a second copy on top of the one I just wrote? I don’t think misinterpretation would happy nearly enough for it to be more useful than intrusive. reply wonger_ 13 hours agorootparentI like having confidence that the intermediate representation is correct before moving forward. Especially since OCR usually makes mistakes on handwriting. It's not a redundant copy, it's reassurance. reply mlajtos 11 hours agorootparentYes, the handwriting recognition system needs to communicate results as soon as possible to instill trust in the user. I need to be able to spot and fix misinterpretations as quickly as possible, otherwise errors accumulate real fast. reply wpm 17 hours agoprevMaybe I'm a freak but almost all of the proposed \"improvements\" in this article I find distracting, annoying, and would turn me off of ever using the feature. I do NOT want my notes or content dancing around on the screen or having motion displayed because its evaluating equations or statements while I'm writing them. It's also why I disable most autocomplete and warnings in code editors. I don't complaints about syntax errors for lines I haven't finished writing. Like, why would I care about the value of `a` before I've finished writing the equation? Sometimes a tool just shutting the hell up is a good thing. reply treyfitty 12 hours agoparent> I don’t complaints about syntax error for lines I haven’t finished writing How about “complaints about” syntax errors after you’ve finished writing? Jokes aside, to answer why knowing the value of ‘a’ might be useful before writing the full equation: ever work in excel and you’re building up a calculation, and when finished, your answer isn’t what you expected? Tracing that missing parentheses or brain-fart typo can be frustrating. I imagine that’s the same reason why some people would care about the value of ‘a’ before they’ve finished. reply mlajtos 12 hours agoparentprevFair point. Interactivity is a spectrum that should match the user preference. Interactivity helps when you are learning the tool, because you can do & fix mistakes faster. But when you want to think deeply, it should stand away and be there only when you explicitly request it. reply paulcole 17 hours agoparentprevYeah it’s almost like people design things without asking you specifically for feedback.

I’ve been holding off updating my Macs, but I can see this feature being really handy as a sort of lite spreadsheet replacement. reply mlajtos 12 hours agoparentYes, having an ability to do simple math across the whole ecosystem is extremely useful. reply jerojero 4 hours agoprevLive graphs, function definitions and support for more calculus would be something good for the future, as it is right now this is good for basic middle school math and quick calculations. Linear algebra, calculus notation, etc. these are necessary improvements. I think they might come in the future though, I know this will become on par with a graphic calculator. reply mlajtos 13 minutes agoparentYes, the first version is already usable for everyday simple stuff. In the future, it will definitely gain more features. But you are wrong in one thing – it will become much-much more than graphing calculator. reply keyle 19 hours agoprevRelated, has anyone noticed with the new Sequoia, Apple Notes, which I use extensively, if you start searching or clicking as soon as the window open, you get a frozen application that won't recover - it must be killed?

This requires a few years of effort by a capable machine learning engineer that's also a pretty good software developer. I would love to try this, mostly to become a capable machine learning engineer. But ... what's missing is the $, like in so many software demands. I looked up the paper on this, but there are no good models for it that generate proper syntax. So for one thing, whoever does this would need to grind out creating at minimum a few 10,000 math exercises, to get the software to work. So this costs, say, ~400.000 USD, and 2 years of time, counting taxes, equipment, office, ... Perhaps \"only\" 100.000 if you're a professor and willing to use a PhD student (and deal with the issues that will give). Now I don't mean to disparage this proposal. But this seems to be how everything works except \"improve our existing boring software 1%\" ... And it's frustrating. At best, I can find machine learning jobs that boil down to \"make LLMs solve tickets\" or, worse \"make LLMs write spam\" (usually customize/personalize existing spam mails). Beats solving tickets myself, that it definitely does, but something like this ... I don't have trouble finding software development jobs. However, I cannot ever seem to do something like this. I would so love to make something like this, to really take a hard problem, work it and make something beautiful. But this is not a hobby effort. This requires spending a few years of effort making something beautiful. If this is done as a hobby project I can make a nice tech demo, no doubt, but it will be only what I make of it, and it'll be a limited cool tech demo, just like what Apple did (making a gradio that does a few examples correctly isn't very hard), what I'd use it for. Not because I don't want to make the next generation of advanced calculators, but because I'd never have the time to do that. reply mlajtos 24 minutes agoparentYou are not wrong. In 2021, I did bootstrap everything on my own – dataset, segmentation algorithm, neural net, UI, math engine, etc. And in the end, it worked properly only for me. But that was my aim – own complete stack to be able to try out everything that might be interesting without being burdened by 3rd party solutions. It was a prototype that I could show to people – spread the idea. Doing product of that magnitude on my own would never fly. I don't think Apple did a \"cool tech demo\". In my view, they published first version of a very ambitious project. They worked on it for years with top talent. And they felt this is the minimum lovable product on which they will iterate. And if you would like to build product-ready solution similar to Math Notes, you can leverage existing stuff. MyScript.com have really good handwriting recognition system with bells and whistles. You can take a lot of shortcuts. reply spwa4 12 minutes agorootparentWell, I hope you'll open source it. But I will 100% understand you not doing this. And it's just a general observation. Being well paid to make a technically impressive GOOD product for people, I would so love to be in that situation. But barring a FANG job, I don't know what to do. reply peppertree 19 hours agoprevI wish there's a way to restrict math notes within a bounding box.

However, I struggled to get it to convert units. An example with non-representative numbers: A = 10000 W B = A / 1 kW = This gives 10 000 000 W². I was hoping for 10 kW. reply setopt 5 hours agoparentDid you try “A / ( 1 kW )” just to see if that works? Sounds like it doesn’t understand that 1 and kW are parts of the same “thing”. reply tomashubelbauer 5 hours agorootparentGood call! Seems as though that just gives a unitless \"10\". Which is cool, I also struggled to make it give me unitless values I could use as factors without it starting to make up sci-fi units. But it could use some more of that Apple polish and just get this right. reply donatj 4 hours agoprevI really want to like Apples handwriting recognition, it's half the reason I bought an Apple Pencil with my new iPad. It's just kind of difficult to use in practice. It's just not that good at recognizing my handwriting, and best I can tell has zero mechanism for teaching it to better understand. When enabling the \"autocorrect\" where it cleans up your writing, it so often replaces my handwriting with the entirely wrong word as to be infuriating. On top of that, it often does so long after I wrote it so I might not even notice that it happened until I try to read the note back later. As the author mentioned, having to switching to eraser and back is painful and annoying. I really wish the options for reflowing a document were a lot more intuitive. If I need to go back and add a sentence or two mid note I can try to draw a line to make space but it rarely works like one would expect. I think all in all the feature is neat but half baked, and they really need to do a bunch more user testing to get it into something that you would want to use rather than a neat tech demo. reply odysseus 16 hours agoprevIn Apple Math Notes, why can't you type a simple list of numbers, either in a table or in columnar format, like: 239.12 +242.33 +673.34 ------- = And get an answer after the equals sign? (a la Soulver) Isn't this an obvious use case? Was Apple trying really hard not to copy Soulver's implementation? You can type them one after another on the same line and get an answer, but that's bad for readability.

    "originBody": "Ponies & Light Work Research Reflect About Texture-less Text Rendering Written on Oct 25 2024, by @tgfrerer. Sometimes, all you want is to quickly print some text into a Renderpass. But traditionally, drawing text requires you first to render all possible glyphs of a font into an atlas, to bind this atlas as a texture, and then to render glyphs one by one by drawing triangles on screen, with every triangle picking the correct glyph from the font atlas texture. This is how imgui does it, how anyone using stb_truetype does it, and it’s delightfully close to how type setting used to be done ages bygone on physical letterpresses. Case in point: Some ancient Letterpress Type Cases (public domain) – source In case you wonder – yes That’s enough (ed). Quaint, correct, but also quite cumbersome. What if – for quick and dirty debug messaging – there was a simpler way to do this? Here, I’ll describe a technique for texture-less rendering of debug text. On top of it all, it draws all the text in a single draw call. The Font: Pixels Sans Texture How can we get rid of the font atlas texture? We’d need to store a font atlas or something similar directly inside the fragment shader. Obviously, we can’t store bitmaps inside our shaders, but we can store integer constants, which, if you squint hard enough, are nothing but maps of bits. Can we pretend that an integer is a bitmap? An 8 bit integer as a bitmap. The value 66, or 0x42 in hex notation, translates to 0b01000010 in binary notation. If we assume that every bit is a pixel on/off value, we get something like this. We can draw this to the screen using a GLSL fragment shader by mapping a fragment’s xy position to the bit that is covered by it in the “bitmap”. If the bit is set, we draw in the foreground colour. If the bit is not set, we draw in the background colour. To calculate the bit that is covered by a normalized (0..1) .x coordinate, we discretize the .x value to 8 steps (note that we apply a final min() because the initial .x range includes the final 1.0) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 uint bitmap = 0x42; vec4 col_fg = vec4(1,1,1,1); vec4 col_bg = vec4(0,0,0,1); // vec2 uv is the normalized texture coordinate for the fragment // with the origin top-left uint which_bit = 7 - min(7,floor(uv.x * 8)); out_color = mix(col_bg, col_fg, (bitmap >> which_bit) & 1); glsl Now, one byte will only draw one line of pixels for us. If we want to draw nicer glyphs, we will need more bytes. If we allowed 16 bytes (that’s 16 lines) per glyph, this would give us an 8x16 pixel canvas to work with. A single uvec4, which is a built-in type in GLSL, covers exactly the correct amount of bytes that we need. The character A encoded in 16 bytes, stored as an uvec4, that’s 4 uints with each 4 bytes. 16 bytes per glyph seems small enough; It should allow us to encode the complete ASCII subset of 96 printable glyphs in all of 1536 bytes of shader memory. (We could probably compress this further, but we would lose simplicity and/or readability). Where do we get the bitmaps from? Conveniently, the encoding of a font into bitmaps such as described above is very much the definition of the venerable PSF1 format, give or take a few header bytes. We can therefore harvest the glyph pixels from any PSF1 terminal font by opening it in a hex editor such as ImHex, travelling past the header (4 bytes) and the first section of non-printable glyphs (512 bytes), and then exporting the raw data for the next 96 glyphs (1536 bytes) by using “Copy as → C Array”. The ImHex hex editor has a really useful feature: you can copy binary data as a c-array. This will give us a nicely formatted array of chars, which we can easily edit into an array of uints, which we then group into uvec4s. We need to remember that just concatenating the raw chars into uints flips the endianness of our uints, but we can always flip this back when we sample the font data… Once we’re done, this is how our font bitmap data table looks like in the fragment shader: You can look up the complete bitmap table as part of the Island source code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 const uvec4 font_data[96] = { { 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000 }, // 0x1e: SPACE { 0x00000000, 0x08080808, 0x08080800, 0x08080000 }, // 0x21: '!' { 0x00002222, 0x22220000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000 }, // 0x22: '\\' { 0x00000000, 0x1212127E, 0x24247E48, 0x48480000 }, // 0x23: '#' // ... etc ... { 0x00000808, 0x08080808, 0x08080808, 0x08080808 }, // 0x7C: '|' { 0x00000030, 0x08081010, 0x08040810, 0x10080830 }, // 0x7D: '}' { 0x00000031, 0x49460000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000 }, // 0x7E: '~' { 0xFC1B26EF, 0xC8E04320, 0x8958625E, 0x79BAEE7E }, // 0x7F: BACKSPACE };glsl I say table, because the font_data array now stores the bitmaps for 96 character glyphs, indexed by their ASCII value (minus 0x20). This table therefore covers the full printable ASCII range from 0x20 SPACE to 0x7F BACKSPACE (inclusive), but in the snippet above I’m showing only 8 of them, to save space. So far, all this is just so that we don’t have to bind a texture when drawing our text. But how to draw the text itself? This is what we want to print at the end of this process One Draw Call, That’s All. We’re going to use a single instanced draw call. Ok, I cheated: It is a single, but instanced draw call. But still… With instanced drawing, we don’t have to repeatedly issue draw instructions, since we encode the logic into per-instance data. One draw call contains everything we need, provided it uses two attribute streams. The fist stream, per-draw, has just the necessary information to draw a generic quad. And the second stream, per-instance, packs the two pieces of information that change with every instance of such a quad: First, a position offset, so that we know where in screen space to draw the quad. And second, of course, the text that we want to print. For the position offset we can use one float each for x and y, which leaves two floats for this particular attribute binding unused (attribute bindings in GLSL/Vulkan are at minimum the equivalent of 4 floats wide). We have more than enough space to use one extra float to pack in a font scale parameter, if we like. I really would have liked to pack this shader-side into a tidy vec3+uint combination, too, but unfortunately Vulkan requires all components of a vertex output binding to have the same interpolation characteristics– you can’t mix uints and float-based types… For the text that we want to print, we have a similarly wasteful situation – the smallest basic vertex attribute data type is usually 32bit wide, and so it makes sense to make best use of this and pack at least 4 characters at a time. If we do this, we must make sure that the message that we want to print has a length divisible by 4. If it was shorter, we need to fill up the difference with zero byte (\\0) characters. Conveniently, the zero byte is also used to signal the end of a c-string. Our per-instance data looks like this: A word is four bytes is four characters – it’s nice when variable names echo a historical term 1 2 3 4 struct word_data { float pos_and_scale[ 3 ]; // xy position + scale uint32_t word; // four characters that we want to print }; cpp It’s the application’s responsibility to split up the message into chunks of 4 characters, to convert these four characters into an unit32_t, and to store it into a word_data struct together with the position offset for where on screen to render these four characters. Once a word_data is filled, we append it into an array where we accumulate all the data for our text draw calls. Once we are ready to draw, we can then bind this array as a per-instance binding to our debug text drawing pipeline, and draw all text with a single instanced draw call, with the number of instances being the number of quads that we want to draw. More interesting things happen in the vertex and fragment shader of the debug text drawing pipeline. Vertex Shader Our vertex shader produces three outputs. First, it writes to gl_Position to place the vertices for our triangles on the screen. This operates in NDC = Normalised Device “screen space” Coordinates. We calculate an offset for each vertex using the per-instance pos_and_scale attribute data. The second output of the vertex shader is the word that we want to render: We just pass though the attribute uint as an output to the fragment shader – but we make sure to use the flat qualifier so that it does not get interpolated. And then, the vertex shader synthesizes texture coordinates (via gl_VertexIndex). It does so pretty cleverly: 12 >> gl_VertexIndex & 1 will give a sequence 0, 0, 1, 1, 9 >> gl_VertexIndex & 1 will give a sequence 1, 0, 0, 1, This creates a sequence of uv coordinates (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) in a branchless way. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 #version 450 core #extension GL_ARB_separate_shader_objects : enable #extension GL_ARB_shading_language_420pack : enable // Inputs // Uniforms - Push Constants layout (push_constant) uniform Params {vec2 u_resolution; // screen canvas resolution in physical pixels }; // Input Attributes layout (location = 0) in vec3 pos; // \"vanilla\" vertex position attribute - given in pixels layout (location = 1) in uint word; // per-instance: four chars layout (location = 2) in vec3 word_pos; // per-instance: where to place the word in screen space layout (location = 3) in vec4 col_fg; // per-instance: foreground colour layout (location = 4) in vec4 col_bg; // per-instance: background colour // Vertex Outputs struct per_word_data {uint msg;vec4 fg_colour;vec4 bg_colour; }; out gl_PerVertex { vec4 gl_Position; }; layout (location = 0) out vec2 outTexCoord; layout (location = 1) flat out per_word_data outMsg; void main() {outMsg.msg = word;outMsg.fg_colour = col_fg;outMsg.bg_colour = col_bg;vec2 scale_factor = vec2(1.,2.)/(u_resolution);outTexCoord = vec2((12 >> gl_VertexIndex) &1, (9 >> gl_VertexIndex ) &1);vec4 position = vec4(0,0,0,1);position.xy = vec2(-1, -1) + (pos.xy * word_pos.z + word_pos.xy) * scale_factor;gl_Position = position; } glsl If we at this point visualise just the output of the vertex shader, we will get something like this: Visualisation of per-quad outTexCoord uv coords. Note that these are continuous (smooth). Fragment Shader You can find the complete code of the fragment shader on github Our fragment shader needs three pieces of information to render text, two of which it receives from the vertex shader stage: The fragment’s interpolated uv coordinate, uv The character that we want to draw, in_word The font data array, font_data To render a glyph, each fragment must map its uv-coordinate to the correct bit of the glyph bitmap. If the bit at the lookup position is set, then render the fragment in the foreground colour, otherwise render it in background colour. This mapping works like this: First, we must map the uv coordinates to word – word not, world! – pixel coordinates. The nice thing about these two coordinate systems is that they both have their origin at the top left, so we only need to bother with scaling, and not origin transformation. We know that our uv coordinates are normalised floats going from vec2(0.f,0.f) to vec2(1.f,1.f), while our font pixel coordinates are integers, going from uvec2(0,0) to uvec2(7,15). We also must find out which one of the four characters in the word to draw. Mapping uv coordinates to per-glyph pixel coordinates 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 const uint WORD_LEN = 4; // 4 characters in a word // quantize uv coordinate to discrete steps uvec2 word_pixel_coord = uvec2(floor(uv.xy * vec2( 8 * WORD_LEN, 16))); // limit pixel coord range to uvec2(0..31, 0..15) word_pixel_coord = min(uvec2( 8 * WORD_LEN -1, 16 -1), word_pixel_coord); // Find which of the four characters in the word this fragment falls onto uint printable_character = in_word >> (WORD_LEN - (word_pixel_coord.x / 8)); // Map fragment coordinate to pixel coordinate inside character bitmap uvec2 glyph_pixel_coord = uvec2(word_pixel_coord.x % 8, word_pixel_coord.y); glsl A visualisation of word_pixel_coord (normalised) A visualisation of glyph_pixel_coord (normalised) Remember, to draw a character, we must look up the character in the font bitmap table, where we must find the correct bit to check based on the uv coordinate of the fragment. You will notice that in the first GLSL example above, we were only worried about the .x coordinate. Now, let’s focus on .y, so that we can draw more lines of pixels by looking up the correct line to sample from. Let’s do this step by step. First, we fetch the character bitmap from our font_data as an uvec4. Then we use the glyph_pixel_coord.y to pick the correct one of 4 uints that make up the glyph. This will give us four lines of pixels. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 // First, map character ASCII code to an index offset into font_data table. // The first character in the font_data table is 0x20, SPACE. offset = printable_character - 0x20; // Then get the bitmap for this glyph uvec4 character_bitmap = font_data[offset]; // Find the uint that contains one of the four lines that // are touched by our pixel coordinate uint four_lines = character_bitmap[glyph_pixel_coord.y / 4]; glsl Once we have the uint covering four lines, we must pick the correct line from it. Note that lines are stored in reverse order because after we used ImHex to lift the bitmap bytes out of the font file, we just concatenated the chars into uint. This means that our bitmap uints have the wrong endianness; We want to keep it like this though, because it is much less work to just concatenate chars copied form ImHex than to manually convert endianness in a text editor. We compensate for the flipped endianness by indexing four_lines ‘backwards’ 1 uint current_line = (four_lines >> (8*(3-(glyph_pixel_coord.y)%4))) & 0xff; glsl And, lastly, we must pick the correct bit in the bitmap. Note the 7- – this is because bytes are stored with the most significant bit at the highest index. To map this to a left-to-right coordinate system, we must index backwards, again. 1 uint current_pixel = (current_line >> (7-glyph_pixel_coord.x)) & 0x01; glsl We now can use the current pixel to shade our fragment, so that if the pixel is set in the bitmap, we shade our fragment in the foreground colour, and if it is not set, shade our fragment in the background colour: 1 vec3 color = mix(background_colour, foreground_colour, current_pixel); glsl Text printed with uv coordinates overlaid What about the fill chars that get inserted if our printable text is too short to be completely divisible by 4? We detect these in the fragment shader: In case were are about to render such a fill character, we should do absolutely nothing, not even draw the background. We can do this by testing printable_character, and issuing a discard in case the printable character is \\0. A Visual Summary It is said that an image is worth a thousand words. Why not have both? Here is a diagram which summarises the mapping from quad-uv space to glyph bitmap space: Note: Our Fragment position is marked by the blue speck. ① pick the correct character from our per-quad word. ② calculate the offset into font_data using the character ASCII code. ③ fetch the uvec4 that holds the bitmap for our glyph from font_data ④ pick the uint representing the four lines of the glyph that our fragment falls in (via its y-coord) ⑤ pick the correct line using the fragment’s .y coord ⑥ pick the correct bit using the per-glyph x coordinate. Full Implementation & More Source Code You can find an implementation of the technique described above in the source code for le_print_debug_print_text, which is a new Island module that allows you to easily print debug messages to screen. It has some extra nice bits around text processing and caching which, however, would be too wordy to describe here. Using this technique, it is now possible, from nearly anywhere in an Island project, to call: 1 2 char const msg_2[] = { 70, 111, 108, 107, 115, '!', 0 }; le::DebugPrint( \"That's all, %s\", msg_2 ); cpp And see the following result on screen: Acknowledgements Diagrams drawn with Excalidraw Original source data for the pixel font came from Tamsyn, a free pixel font by Scott Fial Backlinks This article was featured on Graphics Programming Weekly, and discussed on Lobste.rs, and Hacker News.

You could improve it by adding more bits, but long before it starts to look good you'd be searching for an easier way to handle setting all the bits... And there's almost certainly no more efficient solution than using black and white pixels in a drawing program then saving the results in a texture. So, full circle.

And/Or draw a full message into a texture (more work) and you'll need to cache that result until the message changes (more work) On top of all of that, you need to manage resources and bind them into the system where as here no resources are needed. but again, it's a technique for getting \"debugging text\" on the screen. It is not a solution for text in general. Note that drawing text to textures is how most browsers and OSes work. They draw fonts into texture atlases dynamically (since a atlas for all of Unicode per font per size would take too much time and memory). They then use the texture atlas glyphs to make more textures of portions of the app's window. In the browser you can turn on show texture edges to see all textures. Rendering->Layer borders will outline each texture in cyan reply ferbivore 3 hours agoparentprevDrawing one quad to cover N characters and picking out a glyph in the shader is going to be faster than drawing individual quads for each character (for monospace fonts, anyway). But there are only so many characters you can fill the screen with, so it's probably not a huge difference in practice. Regarding the upload part: at the end of the day, you have X bytes of glyphs and they need to get into GPU memory somehow. Whether you get them there as textures, as uniform data or as shader constants doesn't really matter performance-wise. If anything, doing it through shader constants as described in TFA is more expensive on the CPU side, since all those constant declarations need to be processed by the shader compiler. What does matter on the GPU side is which memory hierarchy you hit when reading glyph data (texture fetches have a dedicated L1 cache on most GPUs, larger than the \"normal\" L1 cache I think) and what order the data is in (textures are usually stored in some version of Morton order to avoid cache misses when you're shading blocks of pixels). For a production atlas-based text renderer you probably want to use textures. Edit: I misread the question; you were asking about drawing individual glyphs on the GPU vs. drawing an entire block of text on the CPU, right? This is a speed/space tradeoff, the answer is going to depend on how much memory you want to blow on text, whether your text changes, whether it needs to have per-character effects applied, and so on. reply jamesu 6 hours agoparentprevGenerally you want to avoid wasting too much memory on a GPU, even today. That large text box texture also has to go over the PCI bus which can cause stalls depending on when its uploaded and if the GPU ends up having to evict resources. If you end up having a lot of independent texture text boxes being rendered by the comparatively slower CPU, that could add up quickly and cut into your budget. Drawing using a glyph atlas is still a way better use of resources. Modern text rendering pipelines will also often use either SDF or encoded bezier curves to improve glyph legibility when scaling which is also a great way of saving more memory. reply Sesse__ 4 hours agoparentprevYou can render the entire string before upload, but then you are essentially using a CPU render, which will be slower than having the GPU do the same thing. FWIW, this method is also a texture despite being called “texture-less”; the texture is just stored in a different format and a different place. True textureless font rendering evaluates the vector curves on the fly. reply superjan 6 hours agoparentprevIt depends on the application. It’s the easiest way especially if you might encounter right to left script, CJK or emoji. It is worthwhile to cache the textures, most text does not change every frame. It is good enough for us. reply spookie 3 hours agoparentprevIt's huge.

You could compare that to storing some data in a separate file which needs to be read during runtime versus embedding the data directly in the source code. reply dahart 3 hours agorootparentThe bitmap absolutely is a texture in the broad sense of the word. It’s not a Vulkan texture in the sense that it doesn’t use the Vulkan texture API, but it is a texture nonetheless. Moreover, parent’s point is double valid because of the example “Look Ma, No Font Atlas!!!” that uses a font atlas baked into shader code.

When told it's going to be a \"texture less text rendering\", I was thinking of procedural drawing of glyphs, not embedding bitmaps in a shader instead of a texture. reply ginko 9 hours agorootparentprevThe effect of that is that you're circumventing using hardware specialized for efficient pixel lookup in favor of using general data lookup inside the shader binary. You're saving yourself some memory due to using 1 bit per pixel rather than at least 8 (none of the major APIs expose a 1-bit texture format AFAIK so R8 would be the next best thing), but you're bound to use some extra cycles for the lookup and decoding of your embedded font. reply Const-me 7 hours agorootparent> none of the major APIs expose a 1-bit texture format AFAIK so R8 would be the next best thing I think the next best thing is BC4.

    "title": "What Is a Staff Engineer?",
    "originLink": "https://nishtahir.com/what-is-a-staff-engineer/",
    "originBody": "By Nish Tahir in Engineering — Feb 4, 2023 What is a Staff Engineer? \"I've worked with a couple of Staff Engineers on different teams in the past and I've seen them do different things, but I've not been able to pin down exactly what they do.\" I get this question quite frequently. Sometimes from engineers looking to elevate their roles. At other times, team members reach out looking to learn how they could get the most value from Staff Engineers on the teams. It is a complicated question because a lot of ambiguity exists in the role. Different engineers have distinct interpretations, so you may get a significantly different answer depending on who you ask. With that in mind, I wanted to capture my thoughts on the subject. It's deep, complex, and nuanced. As a result, I'm likely to be as successful as someone attempting to unravel the mysteries of Engineering Management [1] in a single blog post. To lay some foundation, I'll be describing a class of engineers as Staff Plus (Staff+). These engineers operate above the Senior level. However, they do not assume the role of an Engineering Manager. These engineers often aim to stay within the technical track of an organization's career ladder. While there is currently no universally accepted title for this role [2], successful individuals I've seen in this role tend to share notable common traits They are proven experts in their area of expertise They have a lot of experience leading teams toward shipping products Characterizing a Staff+ Engineer One of my favorite ways to characterize the Staff+ role is by using the \"4 key skills [3] every job needs\". It provides a solid framework that we can use to determine the distribution of skills one would need to be successful in the role. Core Technical Skill This is the foundational skill needed to execute the role effectively and one that the Staff+ Engineer should be highly proficient in. In my experience, this level requires deep technical knowledge in some specialty[4], and it is often accompanied by a wide breadth of knowledge and experience working with multiple different systems within multiple different environments[5]. This is the wealth of experience that the Staff+ Engineer reaches into to solve complex technical problems that contribute toward furthering their team's objectives. While I cannot overstate the importance of this skill as a foundational element of the role, it's not enough to be successful on its own. It must be fluidly combined with other skills to empower the Staff+ Engineer to fluidly adapt to different roles on the team, some of which I will cover below. Product Management A Staff+ Engineer relies on this skill to determine what should be built as well as why. At this level, the Staff+ Engineer should be capable of looking at a team, project, and/or organization's objectives, gaining some understanding of its history, and developing a technical vision[6] to meet those objectives[7]. A skilled Staff+ Engineer should be able to communicate this vision to their stakeholders, as well as other parties that may have a stake in the outcome, and get buy-in from all parties, especially the engineering team that will be responsible for building the solution. This role may sometimes manifest as a Technical Architect[8]. Project Management This skill helps the Staff+ engineer break down large work items into smaller more manageable tasks for more junior members of the team, create a plan/timeline for completion that can be tracked, as well as manage uncertainties/risks that may deter completion of the work. Proficiency in this skill requires a mastery of basic project management fundamentals [9]. This does not mean that Staff+ Engineers should be expected to replace project managers; rather these roles should be seen as complementary. People Management This includes the ability to rally and lead a team toward completing a set of objectives. I've heard this fondly described as \"herding cats\"[10]. While I don't think a Staff+ engineer in this role is required to assume full people management responsibilities (that's what Managers are for), there is notably a lot of overlap. For example, I would expect an engineer operating at this level to be an effective mentor, able to provide technical and a reasonable extent of career guidance. This skill also requires having a solid awareness of the team's composition. This includes the skills makeup, strengths as well as growth areas. At this level, the Staff+ engineer should be able to use this awareness to elevate the effectiveness of the team through coaching and mentoring. You're rubber, I'm glue \"I feel like they do a little bit of everything. They seem to be the go-to on the team when there's an issue. They are like a rock with all the answers!\" I've found that a key aspect of my day-to-day is autonomously combining these skills to fill roles that may find difficult to fill. It's often the less glamorous but high-value work that is required to build or maintain team momentum. This is sometimes described as \"glue\" work. \"Every senior person in an organisation should be aware of the less glamorous - and often less-promotable - work that needs to happen to make a team successful. Managed deliberately, glue work demonstrates and builds strong technical leadership skills. Left unconscious, it can be career limiting.\"[11] Doing glue work often requires a cross-functional grasp of how the team operates as well as deep insight into areas of the team that may require optimization. Here are a couple of scenarios that exemplify glue work, You notice that a couple of email threads between your engineers and a 3rd party vendor have been running long. They seem to be talking past each other without making any headway. You decide to help improve the situation by scheduling a couple of meetings to help foster alignment and develop a culture of partnership between the teams. You notice an up tick in the number of bug tickets being written about a feature in the product. After a brief investigation, you find that area of the code lacks automated tests because of a dependency on a third-party framework and will require some rework to make it testable. The development team needs some coaching on how to handle these sorts of problems in the future and a plan needs to be drafted and communicated to the leadership team. There's some upfront cost but will pay for itself in fewer bug tickets down the road. A team member has been struggling with a new aspect of their assignment. They are unsure of what specific skills they need to learn to be most effective. So you help by offering some light coaching by offering some resources that help them get up to speed quickly as well as setting up 1:1s where they can ask questions and get feedback. Your team was asked to build a tool that aggregates data for marketing and Business Intelligence (BI). The requirements were vague but enough for the engineering team to work on. Noticing the potential for improvement, you schedule meetings with representatives from the marketing and BI team to better understand how the aggregated data will be used to provide a better product. While one could argue that this work has a high-value impact on the team, it may be tough to justify having the Staff+ Engineer function doing any one of those things in the long term. As a result, a crucial part of the role is leveling up the team such that they may take over such responsibilities such that the Staff+ Engineer may shift their focus towards tackling other priorities. It may be by coaching an existing team member to own one of those tasks or working with the leadership team to staff a new permanent owner. Conclusion \"I forget what was said exactly, but [Staff+ Engineer] spoke up and said something with clarity and confidence that changed the conversation to be much more productive. They were thoughtful with their comments and have a keen ability to drive toward clarity in a room of swirling indecision.\" I've only scratched the surface here, but hope I've captured some specific nuances in the role. Ultimately I think a Staff+ Engineer should be able to use their autonomy and influence within an organization and turn that into meaningful impact and value in service of a team or organization's objectives. Here are a couple of great resources that I recommend if you are interested in learning more. The Staff Engineers Path by Tanya Rielly Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track by Will Larson To wrap things up, I'm adding an assorted collection of questions I've gotten recently. This is either because I couldn't figure out a way to answer it directly within the context of this blog post or because I thought it may add additional perspective to address the question directly. FAQ Does Staff+ Engineering require mentoring responsibilities? Yes. I think this is a non-negotiable part of the role. The ability to elevate a team's capability is predicated on being a good mentor. In essence, the ability to identify strengths and growth areas on the team. Additionally, creating opportunities for team members to learn and grow. What kinds of teams need a Staff+ Engineer? A Staff+ Engineer can exist on any team in theory. However, their role will depend on the specific team composition. The Staff+ Engineer may be the main Individual Contributor (IC) on a small team working on a proof of concept for some experimental technology, while a Staff+ Engineer may act as a technical lead on a larger team trying to build long-term momentum. The opportunity cost is the Staff+ Engineer's time and must be considered when making staffing decisions. Could a Senior Engineer be sourced to fill the IC role? This would free up the Staff+ Engineer to work on more complex or higher value problems for the project. What differentiates senior levels of Staff Engineers? The main differentiator is their scope of impact. More senior Staff+ Engineers should be able to have and manage an impact on an organization or company, in some cases an industry at large. Being able to build and leverage their influence to guide a technical direction is a skill in and of itself Hmm... It looks like you went over a lot of general points but didn't address a lot of specific expectations of the role This is because the nature of the role changes with each individual and circumstance. This means that being able to adapt to each circumstance is important. That being said, I think the most important thing is that the Staff+ Engineer can turn autonomy into meaningful impact at a scale proportional to their role/level. I stayed on the technical track with I got promoted because I wanted to continue to write code. How do I balance leadership responsibilities but still retain coding in my day-to-day? I would argue that at this level, your leadership skills are likely your most valuable asset. Trying to keep hands-on-keyboard writing code a major part of your role may not be using your talents to their full potential. However, your day-to-day should be determined by the team/project needs while considering that time dedicated towards work that an IC would typically do comes at the cost of glue work and other higher-level work that may require your attention. This is not to say that you should be completely removed from the code avenues such as working on future work such as PoCs or lower priority features as you have availability might be great ways to keep you engaged in writing code.

    "commentBody": "What Is a Staff Engineer? (nishtahir.com)131 points by CarefreeCrayon 21 hours agohidepastfavorite105 comments summerlight 19 hours agoI don't think there's a single easy definition of \"Staff Engineer\" and it's usually just a title. But it might be still good to think about why those folks keep talking about this specific title. From my observation, there is a certain inflection point in a senior level engineer's career where their expectation rapidly grows in that no one can realistically match it alone. The quality of your work will saturate and it's physically impossible to \"work harder\". Some extraordinary engineers could delay that point a bit but they will be eventually there. At the moment, they will need to figure out a consistent, reproducible way to scale their contribution. If they want further career progression. The most direct way is becoming an engineering manager. Someone may develop a technical and organizational skill to influence high level decisions and prioritization. Or just become an engineering genius... There are many other possible ways to achieve this, but the point is that further contribution at this point usually needs a radically different way. I do see that many companies tend to grant a title of \"Staff Engineer\" to those folks able to figure out how to handle this situation. reply Swizec 18 hours agoparent> There are many other possible ways to achieve this, but the point is that further contribution at this point usually needs a radically different way. I do see that many companies tend to grant a title of \"Staff Engineer\" to those folks able to figure out how to handle this situation. In my own experience it's also entirely common for your comp and responsibilities to grow and grow until your working peers are all directors, VPs, and heads of this or that and you're meant to act as their API layer to an entire team of humans executing on your technical direction, but your title is just Senior Engineer. Internally everyone understands this and treats you accordingly, but it sure looks bad on linkedin. reply bigtunacan 9 hours agorootparentMy experience is those are generally technically immature organizations. Everyone knows that \"John\" is consulted across departments and pulled in by senior leaders, that he's guiding the technical of multiple teams ands areas of the business. But management can't quite explain what it is so they give John more money and his title remains unchanged. reply MichaelZuo 17 hours agorootparentprevIt’s possible to assign further ranks to subdivide titles appropriately. e.g. The most important senior engineer, with an equivalent rank just one level below the CTO, would be the ‘First rank X Engineer’, then the next level below would be the ‘Second rank X Engineer’, and so on… reply astrange 16 hours agorootparentThere are usually tech industry levels above senior like staff, principal, distinguished engineer.

Staff Engineers live on the critical path of implementation and directly contribute to their execution. reply robenkleene 18 hours agorootparent> Staff Engineers live on the critical path of implementation and directly contribute to their execution. What does this mean? reply hasmolo 15 hours agorootparenti think the idea here is that a staff engineer should be identifying what needs to be done, figures out how to do it, works to push the team and project in that direction, and provides insight to the org as to how it is going reply CSMastermind 14 hours agorootparentprevIn my view it's the responsibility of engineering management is to create alignment on what needs to be built, when, and how. You call your shot and then you have to hit it. Managers need a lot of information to create this alignment, to set correct goals, and to allocate resources effectively. The first part of a Staff Engineers job is to help provide that information. That might be through prototyping software to inform what is possible or the tradeoffs of taking different approaches. That might be through having an in depth knowledge of technical constraints, historical decision making, and business domain that the manager can query. That might be through seeing patterns with bugs or inefficiencies on the team and surfacing them. That might be through staying abreast of larger industry trends and thinking about how they apply to your team's software. It's ultimately about removing unknowns so the manager can negotiate effectively on the teams behalf when setting goals and create a plan that will be successful to achieve those goals. The second part of a Staff Engineers job is to help make sure those goals are met. That might be through solving complex issues when they arise in development. That might be through directly contributing code to projects that are behind because effort was underestimated. That might be through building frameworks to make the whole team more productive. That might be indirectly through setting an example for other team members to follow or consciously influencing team culture. That might be through picking up responsibilities for an overworked manager like coordinating between different teams or helping the team organize tasks. That might be teaching and up-leveling team members. That might be through providing a second set of eyes from a different perspective to the manager about how the work is going. Unlike line engineers who are evaluated on if they completed the work assigned to them at a satisfactory level, Staff Engineers like managers are evaluated on if the team shipped the agreed upon software on time or not. But the levers they have to pull to achieve those results are different. At least that's my take on the role and why I think it's not the path everyone should pursue. I feel like the job and the skillset required to do it well are sufficiently different for it to be a different path that you need to consciously decide you want to go down. I feel like once you reach Senior Software Engineer, you can stay there forever.

Does this imply that becoming a manager is also \"not a promotion\" in your organization? reply xp84 48 minutes agorootparentAt the risk of being obtuse, depends on what your definition of “promotion” is… I’d classify the dimensions as: - Compensation - obvious one. May vary by org - Authority - are you officially allowed to give orders? Hire and fire? - Respect and influence- in your org, do people specifically want EMs to be active in areas ICs are not, like strategy, etc. varies widely. - Alignment with personal Career goals - some people hate management-type duties - so for them, this EM title change would be “not a promotion” to them I’d say EM is a promotion in some of those ways and it varies a lot by org for sure. reply BhavdeepSethi 18 hours agorootparentprevAt a lot of places, sr. engineer and early engineering manager are same pay band, making it a parallel move rather than a \"promotion\". reply CSMastermind 15 hours agorootparentprevYes - becoming a manager is a role change; strictly not a promotion. reply pjmlp 9 hours agoparentprevThere is also the alternative to accept, like companies exponential growth doesn't last forever, and maybe one should be happy where they are instead of pursuing growth paths that will ultimately make them unhappy while getting more money they cannot ever spend, every day thinking why go to the office. Personally, I am happy to die as IC, having tasted management related roles. reply jakupovic 7 hours agorootparentPeople forget this a lot. Yours truly has seen this thought slip .. is more really more? reply jvanderbot 19 hours agoparentprevI concur. It was a eye opening experience to move into management and staff/prin levels after research. The focus was very much more on \"doing through others\" rather than \"doing yourself\". For me this felt unnatural. If someone had warned me prior, I'm not sure I'd have made this jump. I'm happily now doing direct RnD again. reply grogenaut 17 hours agorootparentFor me if your a principal and you're only doing through others your either not looking at it right or doing it wrong. For basically everything I do, I ask myself the question: is this something that I should be doing directly, or something that other people should be doing, or something I should coach people up on doing train them, or build an organization around or whatever. In many cases I will build an organization and it will take 5 to 10 times longer than if I did it myself. But it keeps going for years after I move on to something else, as opposed to stopping the instant I stopped working on it. What I say to a ton of mentees as they mature into staff/pe, is the important thing is to always figure out what is the highest leverage thing you could be doing. if it's coding, code. if it's writing a doc to explain to other people why other people should be coding, write a doc. if it is slowly nursing junior engineers through a multi-year arc that you could do in a week, maybe that's what you need to do tho I'm seconding guessing that one. But you definitely shouldn't be hanging up the keyboard as a tech ic. Also as of this week at 9 years at a company, I have now shipped code in almost every language the company uses, and on all but: salesforce, an actual prod sagemaker model (all local prototypes), jira workflows, and SAP. reply mattgreenrocks 18 hours agorootparentprevSame. Working indirectly saps my life force. Maybe some day in the future, but I'm about 80-85% hands-on nowadays. Seems right. reply fnord77 15 hours agoparentprev> The most direct way is becoming an engineering manager. After 30 years of engineering experience, I tried to transition from engineer to engineering manager, and I hated every minute of it. reply WesleyJohnson 12 hours agorootparentI'm 19 years into my development career. I've been promoted to some sort of manager position twice. Currently, I'm 7 years into a management role. I don't hate every minute of it; but I sorely miss every minute I'm not coding. reply criley2 18 hours agoparentprevI don't personally agree with the idea that senior is basically the end point of writing high level code. Perhaps it's just a difference in terms but I think of seniors at the high end of their capacity as being able to release high quality features. But if I needed a whole new app greenfielded, would I trust a senior to not only get the job done, but execute at a high level, with a clear vision, clean design system, beautiful code base, all the right choices of libraries, following all the best practices, linting, style, etc? Of course not. To me, a staff engineer can deliver that application at that level, and can lead senior engineers in maintaining and enhancing it. We also consider a level above that, the principal engineer, who is primarily focused on higher level and longer term thinking and less about individually jumping into tickets and features. They re-envision the entire approach to implementing the business logic and scale the business in ways that seniors are mostly helpless at. They do work through others much more, and I do personally see Staff Engineer as the highest level where you primarily are still coding day to day. reply dasil003 15 hours agorootparentIMHO greenfield vs new features vs maintenance/tuning/scaling are different skill sets, not level dependent per se. Plenty of junior engineers can spin up a reasonable greenfield app, and plenty of staff/principal engineers never have had to. The way I look at it is that levels only make sense within an organization that is big enough that a hierarchy is needed to scale. At that point staff+ IC levels are needed because you want purely technical people on the same pay scale and influence level as managers to counteract the incentives of empire building that can corrupt the entire architecture and lead to a Dead Sea effect of engineering talent if left unchecked. From this perspective most staff+ work is in some way generating influence and impact across multiple teams and individuals. Outside of certain specialties and specific R&D roles I think it’s pretty hard to justify staff leveling on purely technical work. Of course different companies calibrate levels differently, and they’re all subject to level inflation, but that’s my feeling for a traditional Google L6. reply criley2 2 hours agorootparentIn my opinion, there is absolutely no way a junior / SWE1 could greenfield an app by doing anything other than following a youtube tutorial or similar step by step guide, and would have basically no understanding of the decisions made throughout. They would have no real experience with style, linting, no good opinion on libraries, no knowledge of accessibility, security, usability, nothing. They would end up with a basic 'hello world' application that would likely fall apart before you could even get your business logic in there. If you have a SWE1 that can literally just greenfield an entire application and do it at a very high level, then they are a unicorn / 10X developer operating at a ~SDE4 level already. I personally do not think the average SDE1 can meaningfully contribute to a quickly moving and efficient team. By the time they are even able to contribute regularly, they are SWE2/mid in my book. I do have much less experience in giant beaurocratic slow moving organizations so I don't have an opinion on how all of that rigmarole works, I'm speaking more to highly focused small teams delivering at a high level quickly. reply dasil003 46 minutes agorootparentSure, someone that is an entry level programmer will not have deep technical knowledge, that's not what I was trying to say though. My point is that levels only make sense in organizations that are big enough that tech leadership can't directly assess and compare ICs work because there's too much going on for any one technical expert to assess. Smaller organizations sometimes cargo cult leveling systems because it helps their ICs resumes and give a sense of progression even though the organizational problems that are the raison d'etre for staff+ levels don't exist at that scale. To say it a different way: consider hobbyist developers who have spent a lot of time developing technical skills. These folks will tend to be very good at creating greenfield apps, and depending what they do, they may also have technical chops that are applicable to large companies as well. So they may be able to be hired as L4 or L5 (Google leveling) just based on technical chops. L6+ will be tough though, unless they have very deep specialist knowledge, because the most common L6+ work is about using technical knowledge to achieve outcomes that depend on navigating multiple teams and stakeholders in a way that the solo dev never has to deal with. reply fsckboy 19 hours agoprevI remember learning back at the beginning of my career that at places like Bell Labs and IBM, everybody who was anybody had the title \"Member, Technical Staff\" which was designed to be a low key humblebrag with the uniformity designed to quell egotistical agitation/competition for more and better titles.

I learned that when I was quitting a senior engineer job (around 2000) and my manager said if I they'd make me a \"member of (the) technical staff\". Since I had never heard of such a title before (I would have been the first MTS at that company) my response was roughly \"(a) aren't I part of the technical staff already? And (b) you're \"offering\" to strip my \"senior\" title? And my \"engineer\" title? WTF? I'm quitting already, you didn't have to be insulting about it\" The confusion was cleared up, eventually, but that conversation definitely didn't go the way my manager expected it to (and I still quit - no regrets).

A Staff Engineer might manage people, but if that were their main desired focus, they probably would have the title Engineering Manager instead. reply roskilli 19 hours agorootparentNot sure but I believe it’s possible you may have read the parent comment unintentionally in the inverse? I might be wrong but I believe you posited their desired focus is to manage people from parent comment, but I actually think it’s opposite. They don’t want to manage people (especially career wise), instead they want to manage and guide the work of teams and people across one or many teams. My interpretation of it was to pursue the type of work and things you focus on as an Engineering Manager in terms of getting the most of out teams for the goals of the organization but doing so without the need to manage people directly. Which I would agree is nice since it’s really hard to wear the technical hat and also directly manage people, so separation of concerns makes for far less context switching and folks to naturally align doing the part of the job that they do best. I also agree with this definition since it’s how I think of it too. reply opello 19 hours agorootparentI took the post you're replying to as to have interpreted the \"doesn't want to be a manager or director\" idea as that there are times others or a team may be foist upon them without such a people management role being the majority of the person's time during, say, a year. I'd also add \"team lead\" to the list of possible titles that indicate a primary focus on people management vs. individual contribution. reply scottlamb 18 hours agorootparent> I took the post you're replying to as to have interpreted the \"doesn't want to be a manager or director\" idea as that there are times others or a team may be foist upon them without such a people management role being the majority of the person's time during, say, a year. Yes, this. There may come a point in your career where your old manager is advancing and they need a new manager for your team. The position is offered to you, maybe repeatedly. It's clear that either you take it or you and your teammates will soon have a new manager who is fresh to the team or company. Maybe you've seen the latter go badly before. Maybe your outgoing manager expresses their own anxiety about that possibility. You finally get the hint and become a manager. Now you can change from the engineering ladder to the management ladder, but you don't have to. You can be an Engineering Manager, commit all your time to this, and hope to advance to Engineering Director. Or you can stay a Staff (Software) Engineer and also manage a few people. With some help from say a good PM, you can be a good manager to a small team without giving up the technical aspects. (I assert part-time managers are actually better for small, high-performing teams; no idle time for micro management.) > I'd also add \"team lead\" to the list of possible titles that indicate a primary focus on people management vs. individual contribution. Maybe. At some companies (e.g. Google), a team's tech lead and manager can be two different people. If so, the tech lead doesn't have reports according to HR. At promo time, they don't do the manager reviews, although they likely put a fair bit of time into writing peer reviews and participate in the promo and calibration committees, so they're not entirely without what many smaller and/or more traditional companies would consider manager responsibilities. reply opello 17 hours agorootparent> a team's tech lead and manager can be two different people Yes, I've worked in an environment like that. I had a \"functional manager\" that took care of the HR side of things and a \"team lead\" that kind of led an effort for a specific project. They also interacted with each other about how things were going. I also agree that for small, high-performing teams it can be a very nice arrangement for everyone. But my point was that the \"team lead\" role ends up requiring some amount of people management while not taking over as the primary focus for the person with that role, \"no idle time for micro management\" as you said. I may have been lazy with \"a primary focus\" as a construction because while I don't think it's >50% of time for a team lead in the structure I worked in or imagined in this discussion, I do think it can be around 20% for that person, depending on how they feel about people management, and the dynamics that exist between those involved, and the size of the team being led. reply leptons 16 hours agorootparentprevWho makes more money, a \"staff engineer\" or an \"engineering manager\"?

I think engineering manager is the easier path to advancement. Compare for example Google Staff Software Engineer (L6) vs Engineering Manager (L6). [1, 2] The latter gets paid more but IMHO the ladder expectations are easier to meet, and even more so when advancing to L7. This is admittedly cynical, but to some extent I think managers are often judged by the size of their empire, while engineers are judged by their (individual or team) accomplishments, which includes setting the overall project design and filling in gaps between the smaller pieces delegated to other engineers. Building a large empire is easier but can be counterproductive. To accomplish things you also need good design oversight, technical mentorship, etc. that managers aren't expected to deliver. A lot of people who are passionate enough about software stay on the SWE ladder in spite of the relative difficulty. I know someone who switched to the management ladder then eventually (at great trouble) switched back; he nearly got down-leveled in the process. There are great engineering managers out there of course, but I think in general the difference in expectations is real and unfortunate.

It means nothing, because there is no legal certification process for any of this. I believe I understand where you are coming from. However, that's not entirely fair. Most jobs have \"no legal certification process\", but that doesn't make their job title meaningless. Not everyone who wants to define what a title means is doing so to gain or assign clout, many just want to understand what a person with that title typically does. Granted, there are some titles (especially in technical roles, in some companies), that tell nothing more than \"that person works in I. T.\" (or whatever your company calls it). For example, I've seen roles called \"Systems Analyst\", that varied greatly in responsibility -- some where all the person did was code all day, some where the person almost never wrote any code. Sometimes that was two people in the same group at the same company. So yes, titles can hold only a very small amount of meaning, at times, but that doesn't make them entirely meaningless. reply Spooky23 19 hours agorootparentPeople with the “real engineer” chip on their shoulder want to die on this hill. reply lolinder 16 hours agorootparentI always point these people to Hillel Wayne's Crossover Project [0].

The article then says that a Staff+ does all of them, both at architecture level and helping build up juniors in the team. Finally it describes them as glue between different aspects of the company. The article provides various blogs and a couple of books as reference for statements. Now onto my opinion. The Staff that I've met in my life are more of the solitary type, the Individual Contributor class of person who have decades of experience in their expertise and supporting skills. Yes they may have the responsibility defining the work for others, but that mostly happens as an architect. They herd seniors not mentor juniors. The article itself doesn't work hard enough to set the bar and explain to me why I should give the title to someone when in some companies these are just the responsibilities of a senior or at a stretch Principal.

SVDQuant: Accurate 4-Bit Quantization Powers 12B FLUX on a 16GB 4090 Laptop with 3x Speedup Muyang Li*, Yujun Lin*, Zhekai Zhang*, Tianle Cai, Xiuyu Li, Junxian Guo, Enze Xie, Chenlin Meng, Jun-Yan Zhu, Song Han November 7, 2024 TL;DR A new post-training training quantization paradigm for diffusion models, which quantize both the weights and activations of FLUX.1 to 4 bits, achieving 3.5× memory and 8.7× latency reduction on a 16GB laptop 4090 GPU. Related Projects AWQ SVDQuant DistriFusion SIGE QServe SmoothQuant Check our interactive demo at https://svdquant.mit.edu! Our quantization library is at github.com/mit-han-lab/deepcompressor and inference engine is at github.com/mit-han-lab/nunchaku. Our paper is at this link. SVDQuant is a post-training quantization technique for 4-bit weights and activations that well maintains visual fidelity. On 12B FLUX.1-dev, it achieves 3.6× memory reduction compared to the BF16 model. By eliminating CPU offloading, it offers 8.7× speedup over the 16-bit model when on a 16GB laptop 4090 GPU, 3× faster than the NF4 W4A16 baseline. On PixArt-∑, it demonstrates significantly superior visual quality over other W4A4 or even W4A8 baselines. Background Computation v.s. parameters for LLMs and diffusion models. Diffusion models are revolutionizing AI with their ability to generate high-quality images from text prompts. To improve image quality and improve the alignment between text and image, researchers are scaling up these models. As shown in the right figure, while Stable Diffusion 1.4 has 800 million parameters, newer models like AuraFlow and FLUX.1 reach billions, delivering more refined and detailed outputs. However, scaling brings challenges: these models become computationally heavy, demanding high memory and longer processing times, making them prohibitive for real-time applications. As Moore's law slows down, hardware vendors are turning to low-precision inference, such as NVIDIA's new 4-bit floating point (FP4) precision in Blackwell. In large language models (LLMs), quantization has helped reduce model sizes and speed up inference, primarily by addressing latency from loading model weights. Diffusion models, however, are computationally bound, even for single batches, so quantizing weights alone yields limited gains. To achieve measured speedups, both weights and activations must be quantized to the same bit width; otherwise, the lower precision is upcast during computation, negating any performance benefits. In this blog, we introduce SVDQuant to quantize both the weights and activations of diffusion models to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, conventional post-training methods fall short. Unlike smoothing, which redistributes outliers, SVDQuant absorbs them through a high-precision low-rank branch, significantly preserving image quality. Visual examples demonstrate its effectiveness. See the above figure for some visual examples. SVDQuant: Absorbing Outliers via Low-Rank Branch The key idea behind SVDQuant is to introduce an additional low-rank branch that can absorb quantization difficulties in both weights and activations. As shown in the above animation, originally, both the activation \\( \\boldsymbol{X} \\) and weights \\( \\boldsymbol{W} \\) contain massive outliers, making 4-bit quantization challenging. We can first aggregate the outliers by migrating them from activations to weights via smoothing, resulting in the updated activation \\( \\hat{\\boldsymbol{X}} \\) and weights \\( \\hat{\\boldsymbol{W}} \\). While \\( \\hat{\\boldsymbol{X}} \\) becomes easier to quantize, \\( \\hat{\\boldsymbol{W}} \\) now becomes more difficult. At the last stage, SVDQuant further decomposes \\( \\hat{\\boldsymbol{W}} \\) into a low-rank component \\( \\boldsymbol{L}_1 \\boldsymbol{L}_2 \\) and a residual \\( \\hat{\\boldsymbol{W}} - \\boldsymbol{L}_1 \\boldsymbol{L}_2 \\) with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). As the singular value distribution of \\( \\hat{\\boldsymbol{W}} \\) is highly imbalanced, with only the first several values being significantly larger, removing these dominant values can dramatically reduce \\( \\hat{\\boldsymbol{W}} \\)’s magnitude and outliers, as suggested by Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem. Thus, the quantization difficulty is alleviated by the low-rank branch, which runs at 16-bit precision. The below figure illustrates an example value distribution of the input activations and weights in PixArt-∑. Example value distribution of inputs and weights in PixArt-∑. Nunchaku: Fusing Low-Rank and Low-Bit Branch Kernels Although the low-rank branch adds only minor computational costs on paper, running it separately can lead to significant latency overhead—about 50% of the 4-bit branch's latency, as shown in figure (a). This is because, despite reduced computation costs with a small rank, the data size of input and output activations remains the same, shifting the bottleneck to memory access instead of computation. To address this, we co-designed our inference engine, Nunchaku, with the SVDQuant algorithm. Specifically, we noted that the down projection in the low-rank branch uses the same input as the quantization kernel in the low-bit branch, and the up projection shares the same output as the 4-bit computation kernel, as shown in figure (b). By fusing the down projection with the quantization kernel and the up projection with the 4-bit computation kernel, the low-rank branch can now share activations with the low-bit branch. This eliminates extra memory access and cuts the number of kernel calls in half. As a result, the low-rank branch now adds only 5–10% additional latency, making its cost almost negligible. Performance SVDQuant reduces the model size of the 12B FLUX.1 by 3.6×. Additionally, Nunchaku further cuts memory usage of the 16-bit model by 3.5× and delivers 3.0× speedups over the NF4 W4A16 baseline on both the desktop and laptop NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs. Remarkably, on laptop 4090, it achieves in total 10.1× speedup by eliminating CPU offloading. Quality On FLUX.1 models, our 4-bit models outperform the NF4 W4A16 baselines, demonstrating superior text alignment and closer similarity to the 16-bit models. For instance, NF4 misinterprets \"dinosaur style,\" generating a real dinosaur. On PixArt-∑ and SDXL-Turbo, our 4-bit results demonstrate noticeably better visual quality than ViDiT-Q's and MixDQ's W4A8 results. Integrate with LoRA Traditional quantization methods require fusing LoRA branches and then requantizing the model when integrating LoRAs. Our SVDQuant, however, avoids redundant memory access, making it possible to add a separate LoRA branch directly. The figure above shows visual examples of our INT4 FLUX.1-dev model with LoRAs applied in five distinct styles—Realism, Ghibsky Illustration, Anime, Children Sketch, and Yarn Art. Our INT4 model adapts seamlessly to each style, maintaining the image quality of the original 16-bit version.

It is important to keep in mind that modifying a model changes the performance of the resulting model, where performance is \"correctness\" or \"quality\" of output. Just because the base model is very performant does not mean the smaller model is. This means that another model that is the same size as the new quantized model may outperform the quantized model. Suppose there are equal sized big models A and B with their smaller quantized variants a and b. A being a more performant model than B does not guarantee a being more performant than b. reply boulos 31 minutes agoparentAs others have replied, this is reasonable general feedback, but in this specific case the work was done carefully. Table 1 from the linked paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05007) includes a variety of metrics, while an entire appendix is dedicated to quality comparisons. By showing their work side-by-side with other quantization schemes, you can also see a great example of the flavor of different results you can get with these slight tweaks (e.g., ViDiT INT8) and that their quantization does a much better job in reproducing the \"original\" (Figure 15). In this application, it's not strictly true that you care to have the same results, but this work does a pretty good job of it. reply ttul 2 hours agoparentprevWhile I think I agree that there are many posts here on HackerNews announcing a new model compression technique, your characterization above understates the technical innovations and practical impacts described in this MIT paper. Unlike traditional model compression work that simply applies existing techniques, SVDQuant synthesizes several ideas in a comprehensive new approach to model quantization: - Developing a novel outlier absorption mechanism using low-rank decomposition — this aspect alone seems quite novel, although the math is admittedly way beyond my level - Combining SVD with smoothing in a way that specifically addresses the unique challenges of diffusion models - Creating an innovative kernel fusion technique (they call it “Nunchaku”) that makes the theoretical benefits practically realizable, because without this, the extra computation required to implement the above steps would simply slow the model back down to baseline This isn't just incremental improvement - the paper achieves several breakthrough results: - First successful 4-bit quantization of both weights AND activations for diffusion models - 3.5x memory reduction for 12B parameter models while maintaining image quality - 3.0x speedup over existing 4-bit weight-only quantization approaches - Enables running 12B parameter models on consumer GPUs that previously couldn't handle them And, I’ll add, as someone who has been following the diffusion space quite actively for the last two years, the amount of creativity that can be unleashed when models are accessible to people with consumer GPUs is nothing short of astonishing. The authors took pains to validate their approach by testing it against three models (Flux, PixArt-Sigma, and SDXL) and along several quality-comparison axes (FID score, Image Reward, LPIPS, and PSNR). They also did a proper ablation study to see the contribution of each component in their approach to image quality. What particularly excites me about this paper is not the ability to run a model that eats 22GB of VRAM in just 7GB. The exciting thing is the prospect of running a 60GB model in 20GB of VRAM. I’m not sure whether anyone has or is planning to train such a monster, but I suspect that Midjourney, OpenAI, and Google all have significantly larger models running in their infrastructure than what can be run on consumer hardware. The more dimensions you can throw at image and video generation, the better things get. reply djoldman 2 hours agorootparentI definitely agree that there may be some interesting advancements here. I am trying to call attention to the models used for evaluation comparison. There are 3 factors: inference speed/latency, model size in total loaded VRAM, and model performance in terms of output. Comparisons should address all of these considerations, otherwise it's easy to hide deficiencies. reply Jackson__ 1 hour agorootparentThe site literally has a quick visual comparison near the top, which shows that theirs is the closest to 16bit performance compared to the others.

I had to int4 a llama model to get it to properly run on my 3060. I'm curious, how much resolution / significant digits do we actually need for most genAI work? If you can draw a circle with 3.14, maybe it's good enough for fast and ubiquitous usage. reply sigmoid10 8 hours agoparentEarlier this year there was a paper from Microsoft where they trained a 1.58 bit (every parameter being ternary) LLM that matched the performance of 16 bit models. There's also other research that you can prune up to 50% of layers with minimal loss of performance. Our current training methods are just incredibly crude and we will probably look back on those in the future and wonder how this ever worked at all. reply llm_trw 7 hours agorootparentNone of those papers actually use quantized training, they are all about quantized inference. Which is rather unfortunate as it means that the difference between what you can train locally and what you can run locally is growing ever larger. reply danielEM 6 hours agorootparentIndeed. I think \"AI gold rush\" sucks anyone with any skills in this area into it with relatively good pay, so there are no, or almost no people outside of big tech and startups to counterbalance direction where it moves. And as a side note, big tech is and always was putting their agenda first in developing any tech or standards and that usually makes milking on investments as long as possible, not necessary moving things forward. reply llm_trw 6 hours agorootparentThere's more to it than that. If you could train models faster, you’d be able to build larger, more powerful models that outperform the competition. The fact that Llama 3 is significantly over trained than what was considered ideal even three years ago shows there's a strong appetite for efficient training. The lack of progress isn’t due to a lack of effort. No one has managed to do this yet because no one has figured out how. I built 1-trit quantized models as a side project nearly a decade ago. Back then, no one cared because models weren’t yet using all available memory, and on devices where memory was fully utilized, compute power was the limiting factor. I spend much longer trying to figure out how to get 1-trit training to work and I never could. Of all the papers and people in the field I've talked to, no one else has either. reply p1esk 46 minutes agorootparentPeople did care back then. This paper had jumpstarted the whole model compression field (which used to be a hot area of research in early 90s): https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00363 Before that, in 2012, Alexnet had to be partially split into two submodels, running on two GPUs (using a form of interlayer grouped convolutions) because it could not fit in 3GB of a single 580 card. Ternary networks appeared in 2016. Unless you mean you actually tried to train in ternary precision - clearly not possible with any gradient based optimization methods. reply sixfiveotwo 5 hours agorootparentprev> I spend much longer trying to figure out how to get 1-trit training to work and I never could.

Feel free to email me if you care enough to have a more in-depth discussion. reply sigmoid10 5 hours agorootparentprevThat's wrong. I don't know where you got that information from, because it is literally the opposite of what is shown in the Microsoft paper mentioned above.

Naively when I'm running a transformer locally I get about 30% GPU utilization, when I'm running a diffusion model I'm getting 100%. This means that the only saving you're getting in speed for a diffusion model is being able to do more effective flops since the floats are smaller, e.g. instead of doing one 32bit multiplication, you're doing 8 4bit ones. By comparison for transformers you not only gain the flop increase, but also the improvement in memory shuffling that they do, e.g. it also takes you 8 times less time to load the memory into working memory from vram. The above is a vast over simplification and in practice will have more asterisks than you can shake a stick at. reply flutetornado 6 hours agoparentprevGPU workloads are either compute bound (floating point operations) or memory bound (bytes being transferred across memory hierarchy.) Quantizing in general helps with the memory bottleneck but does not help in reducing computational costs, so it’s not as useful for improving performance of diffusion models, that’s what it’s saying. reply pkAbstract 6 hours agorootparentExactly. The smaller bit widths from quantization might marginally decrease the compute required for each operation, but they do not reduce the overall volume of operations. So, the effect of quantization is generally more impactful on memory use than compute. reply superkuh 3 hours agorootparentExcept in this case they quantized both the parameters and the activations leading to decreased compute time too. reply DeathArrow 6 hours agoprevBut doesn't quantization give worse results?

They’ve released a bunch of papers, and Michael has given plenty of in-depth interviews available on YouTube. They’re looking at low-level structures like cells and asking “what can be learned/achieved by viewing these structures as being intelligent agents?” The problem of memory is tied intricately with intelligence, and examples of it at these low levels are found throughout their work. The results of their experiments are surprising and intriguing: bringing cancer cells back into proper functioning, “anthrobots” self-assembling from throat tissue cells, malformed tadpoles becoming normal frogs, cells induced to make an eye by recruiting their neighbors… An excerpt from the link below: Our main model system is morphogenesis: the ability of multicellular bodies to self-assemble, repair, and improvise novel solutions to anatomical goals. We ask questions about the mechanisms required to achieve robust, multiscale, adaptive order in vivo, and about the algorithms sufficient to reproduce this capacity in other substrates. One of our unique specialties is the study of developmental bioelectricity: ways in which all cells connect in somatic electrical networks that store, process, and act on information to control large-scale body structure. Our lab creates and employs tools to read and edit the bioelectric code that guides the proto-cognitive computations of the body, much as neuroscientists are learning to read and write the mental content of the brain. https://drmichaellevin.org/ reply whoisjuan 3 hours agoprevThis is wild, but many studies have reached the same conclusion. I remember reading somewhere that heart transplant recipients have random memory flashes that are not their memories, and sometimes they develop new personality traits. reply GuB-42 1 hour agoparentA theory I have seen is that we tend to mix up cause and effect. So, for example, a dangerous situation causes stress and stress causes the heart to beat faster, all normal. But make the heart beat faster through external means and it will also cause stress. So it is not clear which one is the cause and which one is the effect, probably some weird combination, with all sorts of feedbacks. Life is messy. So get a heart that isn't yours and it will not beat in a familiar way, which, in turn may be interpreted as changing emotions. And even if memories are entirely contained within the brain, what if the heartbeat is part of these memories, with a heart that reacts differently, the meaning of these memories may change. For a tech analogy, in order to record a video game session, it is common to only record player input. If the game is deterministic, you just need to run the game with the recorded inputs and the session will be faithfully reproduced. It is much more compact than something like a video. Now imagine we change the game engine so that it responds slightly differently to inputs, now, when replayed, the game will appear different. If we imagine memories are \"replays\" and the engine is our body, than altering our body will also alter our memories. reply kadoban 3 hours agoparentprev> I remember reading somewhere that heart transplant recipients have random memory flashes that are not their memories, and sometimes they develop new personality traits. Wild. Doesn't necessarily surprise me too much that the body stores some memories outside the brain, but it seems _very_ surprising that another body/brain can read and understand ones created by another. I'd assume that the whole mind and memory system is one big correlated mess, not essentially composed of data files in a ~standard encoding. reply kibwen 3 hours agorootparentIt would be hasty to assume that any memories would be transferable in such a way. If your hypothesis is that transplant recipients can have their memories altered by interpreting information carried by foreign organ cells, start by assuming they're reading junk data that they cannot decipher. Brains are great at turning junk data into something that feels real. reply im3w1l 1 hour agorootparentI would probably ascribe it to the procedure itself. Like I imagine if you put someone under, opened up their chest, took their heart out and then... put it back in - that the stress of that whole thing would be enough to seriously mess with your head. reply kadoban 3 hours agorootparentprevThat was my followup question, are the memories accurate (even as much as normal memories are), or are they nonsense? Or even better, it'd be fun if they're not completely nonsense, but corrupted in some understandable way (like people/places are substituted for instance). There's no way at all that memories are encoded as essentially mpeg files, so _something_ has to be wrong with them. But yeah, you're right, odds seem good that they're just nonsense, but even then it just feels weird that the body can even interpret them as memories in the slightest. reply yetihehe 2 hours agorootparentMaybe it's all about encoding and it IS pretty standard?

He got hurt bad when he fell down. He likes Power Rangers a lot I think, just like I used to. I don’t like them anymore though” (p. 70, [8]).

Musicians reading sheet music tend to read ahead, but that could be something else entirely. reply tetha 1 hour agorootparentMh, I'm neither a Neurologist, nor any level of good at being a musician. But it goes further than that. Now after a few years, I start to recognize patterns in songs and this removes a huge amount of cognitive overhead. For example, there are very classical rhythms in rock and metal. These were very intimidating two or three years ago, because it's so many notes to look at and a lot of them fast and it's just a lot of stuff to look at. Now, on a guitar, I just recognize 18 bars of gallop-rhythm on string two and my right hand just does that, at least at the speeds I can do. Or you can recognize how a song is in a certain key and my left hand is just used to what happens in such keys. Sure, you need to learn the notes, but the physical motions are largely set already. Similar things on a keyboard. In complex sections, a lot of thought can go into hand position and which finger to use to press a key, because you may need to prepare movement of your hand a few notes early or you can't hit a certain transition. I've noticed that something other than conscious thought optimizes that as well. My biggest takeaway is that music is hard, and the human kinematic system is entirely amazing. reply Nevermark 2 hours agoparentprevMuscles and nerves adapt to physical challenges to make higher intensity efforts easier in three ways: better effort coordination, higher demand signaling, and higher force produced by muscle fibers. (We tend to think of just the latter, but all three significantly impact “strength”.) Each of these has mechanisms of maintenance and faster recovery after use lapses. Which can all be described as memory. First, the spinal cord and motor cortex learn more effective coordination. Proper coordination of muscles impacts strength by ensuring our different muscles cooperate effectively to apply force where we need it. We imagine simple movements as simple efforts, but they are really a series of coordinated multiple muscle response. This can be considered “normal” neural/cognitive learning and memory in the brain, spinal coord and nervous system. Second, our nervous system learns to send higher intensity demand signals to the muscles. I don’t know what the mechanism is here. Maybe higher coordination of simultaneous signals within the muscle? Maybe an increase in signal strengths? An increase in nerve cells? A combination? In any case, once learned, this learning is mostly maintained despite loss of stimulus and relearned quickly. This creates a common source of injury. After a workout hiatus, our ability to demand intense muscle response can exceed the abilities of our reduced muscle’s capabilities. It can feel too easy to push our bodies hard again, resulting in injuries that abort the attempt to restart training. Restart weight lifting programs with patience and caution, until muscles catch up with the renewed overload, hypertrophy and recovery cycle. The third very long term memory mechanism in muscle cells is quite interesting: myonuclear accretion. Support cells merge with muscle cells permanently giving them multiple nuclei, permanently increasing their ability and speed to create the proteins we need for hypertrophy (muscle growth) and recovery (repair and energy store recuperation). Myonuclear accretion allows muscle cells to grow far beyond their original limits. And accounts for why previously trained muscles can retain a modestly higher level of strength and size, even after training regimen lapses. All three memory mechanisms account for why regaining previous high levels of strength happens faster, with less effort, than it took to gain any level of strength the first time. Aother memory mechanism include higher interoception, prioperception, kinematics, and higher level learning regarding exercise form, workout discipline, workout organization, body limitations, injury warnings, positive associations with making effort, etc. that are all result in long term increased strength and ability recover and accumulate it. reply htk 3 hours agoprevOf course cells and tissues react to external stimuli, that's part of the homeostasis process, and a fundamental part of our adaptivity or we'd die with minimal changes in the environment.

To the extent that epigenetics transfers at all, they can't go very far. For past-life memories, uh no. For memories in non-brain tissues, there's a major detail problem there, if any of this pans out at all. For memories transferred from another person, it makes no sense. Your nerves don't transfer universal (between human) data files around, and your brain is a tangled mess. Memories won't transfer beyond, maybe, possibly, some stuff around personality, mood, and various neurotransmitter things. And I don't think it would be common, if it happens at all, without intentional development and use of new tech. For example it should theoretically be possible to recover the basic personality of a cryogenically vitrified brain, based quite a bit on genetics and some on brain structure, but beyond that I can't say. Unless you know many things I don't, and have carefully checked that you truly know them, you should not expect memory recovery, at least above the low double digits percentage. And that's assuming \"full technology\", I for sure don't know to even get started. reply Consider applying for YC's W25 batch! Applications are open till Nov 12.

What I'm used to, using hardware APIs, or software rendering: - Nodes - Edges - Triangles - Meshes - Shaders - Matrices - Quaternions (Or bivectors etc) - Projection (3d state to 2d screen) I suppose I'm confused because the basics don't seem cosmic. It's a straightforward application of considering the state you need to store your 3D model in, then some linear algebra and quaternion operations to convert that 3d state to a 2d screen. For quality level seen in media, it's different; all the additional techniques that make things realistic or have effects that get complicated. I suspect this is where the disconnect lies; if so, I suppose my point is that it's not 3D that's complicated; it's realistic 3D. edit: I Looked up Gaussian Splats: Very cool! reply smolder 3 hours agoparentprevI've forgotten most of the specific matrix multiplication stuff I needed to know to write a ray tracer, and my ray tracer was dog slow compared to pixar's renderman.

But, take a game, or a movie. One needs render things very efficiently in a game, you have 33.3ms of frame budget. Today, raytracing in games either uses just 1 or 2 techniques (e.g. shadows) and calls it a day. If you want to do more, you probably need some help with machine learning (think DLSS). Not to mention, you need a system that accelerates the structures needed to perform it, and somehow marry all this with everything else in game that uses the GPU. You get animations into the mix and the complexity goes up in all areas. In movies, you have more leeway, but the artists still need to iterate fast. You want them to be able to see something akin to the final product fast.

    "originBody": "PSA: SQLite does not do checksums 09 Nov 2024 SQLite does not do checksums by default. I learned this from Alex Miller. What does this mean? If there is disk corruption, the database or application won’t be able to know that the database is ‘corrupt’. Even a single bit flip can cause havoc. This can happen due to a faulty disk, a bug in the disk driver, or when another application (malicious or otherwise) modifies the database files. This is not a bug - it’s properly documented: SQLite assumes that the detection and/or correction of bit errors caused by cosmic rays, thermal noise, quantum fluctuations, device driver bugs, or other mechanisms, is the responsibility of the underlying hardware and operating system. SQLite does not add any redundancy to the database file for the purpose of detecting corruption or I/O errors. SQLite assumes that the data it reads is exactly the same data that it previously wrote. I created a simple script to demonstrate this: Create a sample database using this script. It creates a bank database and adds a row for Alice with $83K. Flip a single bit: printf '\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x80'dd of=bank.db bs=1 seek=$((0x1ffd)) count=1 conv=notrunc Alice’s balance is now zero. Sorry, Alice. It passes PRAGMA integrity_check too. Here’s an ASCII animation if you prefer that: WAL and Checksums SQLite has checksums for WAL frames. However, when it detects a corrupt frame, it silently ignores the faulty frame and all subsequent frames. It doesn’t even raise an error! Ignoring frames might be acceptable, but not raising an error is where it gets me. Checksum VFS Shim You can use the Checksum VFS Shim, but there’s one important caveat: Checksumming only works on databases that have a reserve bytes value of exactly 8 The documentation of reserve bytes explains: SQLite has the ability to set aside a small number of extra bytes at the end of every page for use by extensions. These extra bytes are used, for example, by the SQLite Encryption Extension to store a nonce and/or cryptographic checksum associated with each page. The “reserved space” size in the 1-byte integer at offset 20 is the number of bytes of space at the end of each page to reserve for extensions. This value is usually 0. The value can be odd. This means if you’re using any extension that uses reserve bytes, you can’t use the Checksum shim. Again, this is not a bug.

Of course no one's milk (or whatever it was) had any bleach (or whatever it was). Specially highlighting something true, but out of context and with no equally special justification, is not an innocent act and is misleading. And yes, absolutely, very clearly, causes harm, and does so unfairly.

If some true-believer apple fan felt victimized, well that would be bizarre, right? This is a SQLite guy talking about SQLite to SQLite users. They're describing a feature/possible downside of SQLite that users might want to be aware of. They don't need \"balanced\" coverage of every other DB because it hurts someone's bizarrely fragile feelings.

That data was never committed successfully. Throwing an error for this scenario would mean that sqlite is unable to recover from a crash. reply ncruces 2 hours agoparentIt was committed successfully, if there's a valid commit frame in the WAL. It simply wasn't checkpointed at this point. If the WAL has valid data frames and a valid commit frame after a corrupted frame, there's a strong likelihood this was caused by accidental corruption, so an argument could be made that silently deleting such a WAL is not necessarily the best idea. A lesson to be learned here, is that the durability of stuff in the WAL is reduced, even if you use PRAGMA synchronous=FULL. reply anotherhue 3 hours agoprevZFS & BTRFS both have native FS checksumming, I don't think there's a strong reason not to use it, except maybe in a contained embedded context. Many years ago ZFS checksums helped me figured out I had a bad DIMM. reply jandrewrogers 2 hours agoparentIn the context of databases there are a few issues with relying on the filesystem for checksums: - The default checksum algorithms used in many filesystems are too weak (e.g. CRC32), you really want 128-bits for modern databases. - While some filesystems give you a selection of checksum algorithms ranging from weak to very strong (e.g. SHA256), the databases like SQLite are often deployed in an environment where you have no control over the algorithm selected. - The checksum algorithms available in most filesystems do not provide adequate performance on modern storage hardware. It is much easier to evolve these in database engines than in the filesystem. - Filesystem suitability for database workloads varies widely. Few people are going to trade the performance and scalability of XFS for the built-in integrity mechanisms of ZFS. Implementing checksums in the database gets you the best of both worlds. Also databases are not always deployed on filesystems, so you need checksums for these cases. From a database engineering perspective, the checksumming in filesystems to the extent it exists is often not fit for purpose. Many databases implement their own integrity mechanisms for this reason. reply traceroute66 2 hours agoparentprev> ZFS & BTRFS both have native FS checksumming, I don't think there's a strong reason not to use it, except maybe in a contained embedded context. There are many good reasons not to use BTRFS. :) Also ZFS is hell to use if you're not on an OS that has native support. You become reliant on e.g. kernel modules on Linux , and on Debian this means using Backports which is not something any sensible sysadmin wants to do because it introduces the hell of having a mismatch of all sorts of software unless you spend your life defining exclusions in the apt config. Also in terms of SQLite, ZFS/BTRFS have no understanding of what's running on them. Personally, when it comes to databases I'd rather the database does its integrity checks. If the OS does some too that's great, but the database blindly assuming the OS will do integrity checking is not a good look in my book. reply oarsinsync 2 hours agorootparent> on Debian this means using Backports which is not something any sensible sysadmin wants to do because it introduces the hell of having a mismatch of all sorts of software unless you spend your life defining exclusions in the apt config. root@nas:/etc/apt/preferences.d# cat 80_kernel Package: linux-image-amd64 linux-headers-amd64 linux-kbuild-* Pin: release n=bullseye-backports Pin-Priority: 1000 root@nas:/etc/apt/preferences.d# cat 90_zfs Package: libnvpair* libuutil* libzfs* libzpool* spl-dkms zfs-* zfsutils-linux zfsutils-linux-dev Pin: release n=bullseye-backports Pin-Priority: 1000 root@nas:/etc/apt/preferences.d# cat 1000_backports Package: * Pin: release n=bullseye-backports Pin-Priority: 10 Pretty sure this is well documented in many places, I definitely didn’t invent this wheel myself.

In the best case, repeating it at the FS layer wastes performance; in the worst case, it causes confusion as to which layer has to do it and then maybe nobody does.

Google also returned zfs general database tuning: https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/solaris/oracle-... reply prirun 2 hours agoprevIMO, checksums at the filesystem and higher level are only useful for maybe detecting software problems, not cosmic ray RAM bitflips. ECC RAM is the only way to reliably detect random RAM bit flips. Without ECC, if you read a block of data from disk into a RAM page, do whatever checksums you want - filesystem page, database page, whatever - and THEN a bit flip occurs, you are now processing bad data but think it's okay because all of the checksums passed. Every disk block has an ECC code recorded with it to detect and correct errors. Hardware busses have checksums to detect transmission errors. But without ECC RAM, there is no protection for RAM bit flips, and higher-level checksums won't help with that. It's ridiculous that all computers don't come with ECC RAM, and it's mainly that way because Intel wants to charge a premium for data center servers. reply macote 3 hours agoprevI think it's a question of trust and responsibility, and the client should decide where to draw those lines. Depending on the environment and context, it could be totally acceptable to trust the filesystem, but not in other cases. reply astrobe_ 2 hours agoparentYes. It is a \"storm in a glass of water\", as we say. Probably the client application doesn't assume cosmic bit-flipping events for its own files, which would have equally bad consequences, either. Probably the likeliness for this happening and not being caught and corrected by the storage medium is as low as a hash or UUID collision, which everyone conveniently round down as \"impossible\". reply Quarrelsome 3 hours agoprevI am extremely happy to learn of Checksum VFS Shim. So this article has done its part to make the world a slightly better place. :) reply ncruces 3 hours agoparentMy Go driver adds support for this by default, and I provide a simple API to enable it. I'm of the opinion that the VFS shim should ship by default, certainly on the CLI, because it still needs to be enabled for each DB, and all it takes is one instance that doesn't know about checksums to modify a checksummed DB for it to appear corrupt. https://github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3/tree/main/vfs#checksum... Weirdly, databases created with the macOS version of the sqlite3 CLI reserve 12 bytes, for some reason, so you can't ever enable checksums on those DBs. reply ncruces 2 hours agoparentprevAlso, I'm not 100% certain what the interaction is between the checksums of the VFS shim and the WAL checksums during checkpointing w.r.t. silent durability loss. The shim's checksums are explicitly ignored during checkpointing so I'd need to think it through. The VFS is focused on not (silently) accepting corrupted data, not necessarily on not (silently) ignoring it. reply zazaulola 2 hours agoprevECC algorithms can be used to find errors in read data: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code I was introduced to the first ECC algorithm in high school: the Reed-Solomon Code: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_cor... This algorithm remains mysterious to me to this day. It allows you not only to indicate the presence of an error, but also to recover any data with a small redundancy (e.g. 5%). Reed-Solomon Code principles are embedded in the workings of WinRAR. When creating RAR-archive, you can add redundant data to restore the archive in case of storage interference: https://thuthuattienich.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cach-... reply jrockway 2 hours agoparent> This algorithm remains mysterious to me to this day. The basic idea of Reed-Solomon is to represent a piece of data as though it's the coefficients on a polynomial and then transmitting the value of various points on the polynomial. You have the opportunity to provide an infinite number of points, and you only need theto be correct to derive the original polynomial. If the polynomial is overspecified, then you have the opportunity to derive the original polynomial for each set of points and see whether or not you get the same result each time. Various combinations of this outcome result in no errors, errors that are corrected, or errors that are detected but not corrected. The rest of Reed-Solomon is about which polynomial to pick, as the selection of polynomial and where to evaluate it makes the coefficients easier to derive, and how \"finite field\" math works. We're used to math over all real numbers from math class; finite fields define the same operations but over a finite number of numbers (i.e. \"all uint8s\"). This is convenient when implementing this algorithm on a computer. (The math, of course, still works when \"all real numbers\" is the domain of the coefficients and points; restricting to fixed-size integers just makes things easier for computers.) reply OskarS 3 hours agoprevHonestly seems pretty reasonable to me. SQLite operates above the filesystem, and it seems to me the filesystem is the appropriate place to do this kind of error correction/detection. If you need this kind of durability of your data, why are you storing anything on a filesystem that doesn't do this? reply xyzzy_plugh 3 hours agoparentI'm going to present a potentially controversial opinion: you should always consider adding checksums. Checksums are great, easy and almost assuredly cheap. CRC32C has hardware acceleration support on any modern CPU. Writing a masked CRC32C is incredibly cheap and you'd be surprised at all the places you can catch corruption. The sooner you write a checksum, the more value it adds. If you calculate a checksum later on, such as when you're rotating files on disk, or archiving to cold storage, it may be too late. What do those checksums represent? The checksums may be accurate, such as those used by your filesystem, but the data is already corrupted before they were calculated. reply bawolff 3 hours agorootparentWhat part are we checksumming? No matter how fast CRC32 is, you still have to transfer the data from disk to cpu. I suspect reading the entire db would introduce unacceptable latency & i/o strain in many usecases for sqlite. reply eknkc 3 hours agorootparentPages?. Postgres does that apparently if enabled. And when a page is read, it is already read… The server just checks the checksum. Only overhead should be recalculating the checksum and validating it. Now, in case a bit flips somewhere you do not touch often, it would probably keep chugging along without noticing that. Which kind of makes sense? reply heftig 3 hours agorootparentprevAll of it. With a checksums-of-checksums scheme like a Merkele tree, you can effectively and efficiently checksum all the data and keep incremental changes cheap. You only need to update the checksums of the data blocks you touched and their ancestor nodes in the tree. reply ajsnigrutin 3 hours agorootparentprev+1 for this. I use sqlite for some \"logging-like\" thing a lot, the file is in the ~1.5GB range and growing, and every minute some data is logged to it. Having to read 1.5GB of data from the disk every minute, to add a (few times) timestamp and one 64 bit number to that data seems pointless. reply anarazel 3 hours agorootparentprevCRC32C is not that cheap, even with hardware acceleration. Postgres uses CRC32C for the WAL an it definitely shows up in profiles, despite HW acceleration. And that's at a far lower throughput than you can have with e.g. sequential scans.
