    "originBody": "Boris Vallejo and the Pixel Art of the Demoscene As an epic fantasy painter, Boris Vallejo had a great influence on 1980s and 90s fantasy book covers, computer game box art, and the demoscene. Through the decades, his works have been replicated by pixel artists. This article features fantasy art history, demoscene drama, and a lot of pixel art fun creating a Boris Vallejo imitation graphic using only four colors. October 2024 On the left, the original painting \"Gillkarth's Odyssey\" by Boris Vallejo. On the right, is my line art recreation using only four colors. I call it \"Wrath of the Vallerian\" (after Boris Vallejo). Recently, I was going through the historical results of the Revision demoparty, as you do. I was looking for a subject to draw for a new pixel art piece. I had learned to appreciate the color limitations during the old-school graphics competition at Evoke, where we could only use a predefined color palette. The first time I submitted an entry in 2022, I hated it. The second time, in 2023, I came to accept the limited color palette as a problem to solve. And by 2024, I actually started to enjoy the challenge. I wanted to create a new piece outside of competition and was looking for inspiration. In the results.txt file of Revision 2013, I found an interesting phrase. Right above the list of results for the graphics competition, it said: \"GRAPHICS COMPETITIONS HAVEN'T BEEN THE SAME EVER SINCE PEOPLE STOPPED RIPPING BORIS VALLEJO AND SORAYAMA\" Whatever Happened to Boris Vallejo? I hadn't thought of Peruvian artist Boris Vallejo in ages. I remembered his slick fantasy artwork, featuring idealistically rendered warriors and princesses, muscular and scantily clad (but not indecent). If they weren't battling monsters, the figures wouldn't look out of place in a romance novel. Vallejo's paintings were always beautifully done, but they're a bit out of fashion these days. Boris Vallejo, \"Dragon Riders\", 1982 Pixel artists copied his work in the late 1980s and 1990s. Vallejo's visual aesthetic was one that many demoscene groups sought to replicate or pay homage to on the new 16-bit platforms like the Commodore Amiga, the Atari ST, and the PC with its wonderful VGA graphics. Boris Vallejo and Julie Bell, \"John Carter of Mars\", 2009 Vallejo's art was filled with heroic characters, often set in mythical or alien worlds, similar to the themes explored in many demoscene productions. Demos in the 1990s, especially on platforms like the Amiga, frequently featured surreal landscapes, epic narratives, and fantastical characters reminiscent of Vallejo's paintings. There was a time when I loved Vallejo's art. It was a fascinating blend of imagination and breathtaking realism, with vivid portrayals of fantasy worlds populated by powerful, heroic figures and fantastical creatures. Vallejo's mastery of anatomy and attention to detail brought his subjects to life. I used to feel a true sense of awe and wonder when looking at his paintings. Back then, I felt that his work struck a balance between strength and beauty, craftsmanship and adventure. Left: One of Boris Vallejo's early works from 1977, the cover of \"Tarnsman of Gor\". Right: A recent painting by Boris Vallejo and Julie Bell from 2023: \"Tenacious D\". These days, I'm not so sure. I've grown older, and my tastes have changed. I still admire Vallejo's work, but now I find it a bit too slick, idealized, and repetitive. I've come to appreciate rougher, more abstract, and more experimental art styles. I looked up Boris Vallejo, and by all accounts, he is in his 80s, alive and well. He collaborates with his artist wife Julie Bell, continues to produce and successfully sell their artwork online at borisjulie.com. Yet, while reminiscing about Vallejo's paintings, I realized I might have found a topic for a drawing. The Appropriation of Popular Art by Sceners As of September 2024, around 35 images submitted by sceners on Demozoo are tagged with \"boris-vallejo\" though the tagging is probably not comprehensive. Given his significant influence on the demoscene, Boris Vallejo even has entries on both demozoo.org and janeway.exotica.org. Left: Boris Vallejo's art as found in the Hardwired demo by The Silents and Kefrens Right: Vallejo's orignal cover of the book \"Edge of Tomorrow\" by Isaac Asimov The other artist mentioned in the results.txt was the Japanese artist Hajime Sorayama. He is best known for his hyper-realistic erotic robots and cyborgs. His work explores the fusion of man and machine, often focusing on eroticism, fetishism, and the beauty of artificial forms. Sorayama rose to international fame in the 1980s and has influenced various fields, from fine art to commercial design, including contributions to film, music, and fashion. For the young men in the demoscene, this was a perfect combination. On the Left: the pixel art copy on the Amiga of the original painting by Sorayama on the right. Over the years, Boris Vallejo and his long-time collaborator Julie Bell had other intersections with computers in the 1990s. They painted box art for computer and video games such as the fantasy role-playing game Dragon Wars, the platform shooter Turrican, the side-scrolling fantasy beatem-up Golden Axe, and the delightful underwater adventure Ecco the Dolphin. Here is a list of computer and video game box art credits by Boris Vallejo. Vallejo's influence on sceners was unquestionable. Below are more examples of Vallejo's artwork used in demoscene productions. Many of these artworks were digitized or scanned, which doesn't require any artistry. It's a cheap and easy way to get good graphics for a demo. The Fantasy Slideshow by Turtletronic has a number of obvious scans (left) of Vallejo's paintings, e.g. the harpy kissing a woman (right). Turtletronic could pull off this scan or capture because their slideshow uses Amiga's HAM mode that allows the nearly unrestricted use of all of the Amiga's 4,096 color. I feel that Peachy's recreation (on the left) of a painting by Boris Vallejo (on the right) looks to be hand-pixelled and not a scan. The slightly different angle of the front leg and the bark on the tree trunk look different. I also believe that Archmage (left) recreated the painting by Boris Vallejo (right) by hand-pixelling it in a painting program. The face of the woman in the center is angled differently and trees in the background look differnt. Scanned paintings are quite controversial in the scene. In a blog post by a scener called Danny, who used to work for the computer game company Eidos Interactive, he does not like the practice of using scanned images of paintings and then declaring them as your own work. But he also does not find critics great who condemn sceners who copy paintings but openly admit that they are copies. He even wrote that it is the main reason he left the scene and would no longer submit any graphics for competitions. His post, Disintegration Of The Old Graphics Scene, is worth reading. He wrote it in 1998, making it a reflection of that time period in the demoscene. Some of Danny's arguments sound distressingly familiar nowadays in the context of AI-generated art. In his post, he wrote: \"There are quite a number of artists (even some famous ones that get much respect) that have practiced so long on making a scanned image look hand drawn, that their lame efforts have become almost undetectable. There is almost no way of telling if the image is created through blood, sweat, and tears, or the powers of modern-day technology. Danny does not outright condemn or defend copying. He just does not fully discount its value in a hobbyist community like the demoscene as long as it is clear that a work is a reproduction of another work. This is for me the culmination of his text: \"My point is that everybody copies. Some do it to learn, others do it to grasp a bit of fame in a very challenging environment. It's not just the artists that copy, it's the whole bloody scene. And everyone that makes any form of art. Artists just get all the crap for it because it's easiest to spot.\" The history of the Amiga demoscene is paved with Vallejo immitations. Some graphics based on Vallejo paintings were actually pixel painted by the sceners, as can be seen in this article in Demoscene: the Amiga Years. Volume 1 1984-1993 by Éditions64k. This requires artistry and dedication. The Éditions64K book features three pages about the process that Suny used to hand-pixel a recreation of a Vallejo painting on the Commodore Amiga. It is amazing how many demoscene pixel artists in the 1990s got their inspiration or motives from Boris Vallejo. Suny wrote in the Éditions64K book about the Amiga demoscene: \"My main influence was Boris Vallejo who seems to have inspired a lot of artists at the time. I then got interested in design, photography, painting and animation.\" Then Suny went on to close out his section of the Éditions64K book with the following: \"With time, I realized I was not a real artist. I had reached a very good technical level and could reproduce an existing image perfectly. However, this is not the definition of an artist, and I am not super creative. This is why I became a Technical Artist in the video game industry, and now I am working at Apple.\" This started out somewhat discouraging, but then we see that his meticulous reproductions of Vallejo’s work and other pixel art helped him find his strengths and discover new professional roles. Some sceners only use parts of a Vallejo painting, like in this example by Facet from the Hardcore demo. In a post on pouet.net, user friol asked what the point of re-drawing paintings by others actually is. He even specifically referred to sceners who copy Boris Vallejo's work: \"Oh well... I knew the demoscene was ripping Boris Vallejo, but not that much (we are talking of at least of one hundred pictures). But while some pictures are... I would call them \"re-elaborations\", others are 1-1 copies. What's the point of that?\" Another user, gaspode, replied to friol's post: \"That's the dark side of the scene, I think. I can not understand why obviously talented people copy pictures nearly 1:1. Even if they were re-drawn or re-pixeled or whatever, they are still copys for me (because the idea, colors and structure was stolen). Other people apparently don't have problems with that but for me everytime I discover such a thing my respect for the copying artist decreases and first of all I cannot enjoy their future artworks anymore, cause I always think they could have been copied.\" This opinion is well-supported by many sceners. User ok3anos pointed out that there is another side to copying artwork as long as the original artist gets credited: \"Well, consider this: In painting, masters have always been copied by the apprentices to let them learn the basis techniques. It does not disturb me at all to see pixel artists copying Boris Vallejo or others to increase their pixel technique as long as the original artist is credited in a way or another. Would be more annoying if some of the works were just simple scans reworked a bit (which I suspect some...) ok3anos reply can be interpreted as a defense of copying artwork as long as the scener remains honest. A link can be found in this thread on pouet that points to the No-Copy site. You can find a gallery of images created by sceners but copied from other artists. There are a lot of examples of swiped Vallejo art. The No-Copy website. If we disregard for a moment that there are so many examples of swipes of Vallejo's merman and mermaid image, and look closely at this particular copy, then we can see that it looks like an actual painstaking recreation and not a scan (though this is only my personal feeling). The first thing that strikes me, just looking at the swipes on the No-Copy site, is how often Vallejo's painting of the merman and the mermaid was copied. I never wanted to know what it looks like when merpeople have sex. The second thing that strikes me is that many of the graphics definitely look like full scans or collages of partial scans. Yet, I think some of them are not scans but incredible reproductions. If my suspicion is true, I personally believe it takes a lot of craft to reproduce a painting as pixel art with the comparatively low resolution and limited color palette of a Commodore Amiga or a PC with VGA graphics. The most commonly used graphics mode for a regular Amiga was 320 x 256 with 32 colors (or 64 colors if extra halfbrite mode was used). The later AGA chipset in the Amiga 1200 and 4000 had a graphics mode comparable to the PC's VGA graphics. When the No-Copy site was published in the second half of the 1990s, the most common VGA mode used for pixel graphics was 320 x 200 with 256 colors, though some people used the higher resolution of 640 x 480, also with 256 colors. It takes patience and a lot of precision to copy Vallejo's art in a pixel paint program like Deluxe Paint or Brilliance. My journey through Vallejo's influence on the demoscene brought me to the essay An Original Picture written in 2007 by Lars Ghandy Sobiraj, the main editor of the longest running Amiga diskmag Jurassic Pack. He is very critical of pixel artists and graphicians who copy art or photos. He not only condemns scans but even folks who hand-pixel their graphics based on someone else's paintings. He mentions a traditional, analog technique in which a grid is overlaid on both the original image and the drawing surface. This allows the copying artist to focus on replicating one small part at a time. This method ensured accurate proportions and alignment, helping the artist recreate the image in precise detail. However, he does not consider this technique to be high art. Lars Sobiraj writes: \"The biggest shame with copied motives are the artists never telling others if it was copied or not. They just secretly hope not to be discovered by the scene police.\" I actually support this statement. If you copy something, then make it clear what you have done. This is the bile-filled finale of Lars Sobiraj's essay, like a necromancer's curse thrown upon copying artists (the spelling is unchanged from the original): \"Here is a last message from me: You took the express road for your success. But you are worthless peace of junk. No own fantasies, using grids, copying ideas. Damn lame. You will never develop yourself, and even if you get place #1 in the charts or by your scene friends, that is nothing compared to real life true graphicians based on the bigger world outside the scene. (b)lame yourself\" I understand the feeling of betrayal one might feel when confronted with artists who so obviously cheat. Yet I feel that this is also a bit too harsh. All that being said, I don't think copying Vallejo's art is reprehensible as long as you credit the original artist and learn something from the recreation, perhaps by altering it enough to make it distinct. Criticizing other artists for copying the works of Boris Vallejo becomes somewhat ironic when we consider Vallejo's own creative process. Vallejo often uses models and bodybuilders as references, photographing them in specific poses, and then using these images as a foundation for his paintings. In this way, imitation plays a significant role even in his artistic method. However, what distinguishes Vallejo is his remarkable ability to synthesize and transform these real-life references into something new and beautiful through his extraordinary skill with paint and brush. His artistry lies not just in copying but in elevating these references into highly imaginative and dynamic works, blending realism with fantasy. This process shows that while imitation may be part of art, true creativity comes from how those references are interpreted and reimagined. How I Learned Not To Worry And Love Color Limitations I wanted to copy a Vallejo painting in my own style, using a super limited color palette. And, of course, I'd give credit to good ole Boris! But first, I need to wax poetic about the beauty of limited color palettes. I chose to use only these four colors for my recreation of a Vallejo painting. I used to paint pixel art on an Atari ST, which was limited to 16 colors on screen at the same time from a palette of 512 available shades. I always found this limiting and frustrating, especially considering that the Atari ST's main competitor, the Commodore Amiga, could display 32 and even 64 colors from 4,096 available shades. Then, I started participating in graphics competitions at demoparties, using ridiculously limited six- to eight-color palettes. That's when I discovered an interesting challenge. There's something exciting about working within a limited color palette. I found that the constraints forced me to focus more on composition, shapes, and contrast. I had to make the most of the few colors I had. It might be unfair to call the limited color palette required for the Evoke graphics compo \"old school\" (or \"old skool,\" if you're too cool for \"school\"). There are no restrictions on resolution, meaning I can use much higher resolutions than any retro \"old school\" machine was capable of. The results can look quite modern, and the style can be deliberately atmospheric due to the limited color palette. Video Walkthrough of Line Art Drawing A full walkthrough of the process of painting the picture. Drawing A Vallejo in Line Art and Four Colors So I decided to challenge myself by limiting a drawing to four colors. As a callback to the old days of the demoscene, I used a Boris Vallejo painting as my model. I chose Vallejo's \"Gillkarth's Odyssey (The Axe Man)\" from 1998. I used Procreate on my iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil. I absolutely adore Procreate. It is a phenomenally frictionless and intuitive painting tool. I ended up quite happy with my copy of it as line art. After a few dead ends in coloring, I was also pleased with how it turned out using only four colors. Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 There was one odd thing I only realized while making the drawing: I have no idea what the barbarian fellow in the center is swinging his axe at. It might be that he's trying to chop into the snake, which is actually facing away from him and minding its own business. Or maybe he's attacking the viewer of the image. It could even be that he's being influenced by the two demon-like creatures behind him to attack. In the original image, his eyes are red, as though he's possessed. To this day, I don't know what this person is up to. I actually only learned that he's not Conan after I had started the drawing. I asked on the Conan Reddit, if anyone had more information about the painting, and I was quickly corrected. Reddit user mattmirth provided the painting's real name. And another user wrote the following comment and got the most upvotes: \"Every Boris Vallejo painting is Conan, he just doesn't know it. /s\".\" I had a lot of fun drawing this piece. I learned a lot about working within color limitations and how to make the most of them. It also rekindled my appreciation for the art of Boris Vallejo. While I might not be a super fan of his work anymore, I can see why he was so popular and influential. I understand why so many pixel artists copied his work. And here is my final line art version of Vallejo's Axe Man from \"Gillkarth's Odyssey\" called Wrath of the Vallerian (after Boris Vallejo).

Vallejo was definitely a popular source and influence. But demoscene graphics were really more of a technical competition than expressive art. The participants were teenagers — it was pretty obvious that most 16-year-old boys don't paint like Frazetta while also having mastered the skills for rendering those visions in 32 colors. There was great appreciation for technical factors like palette tricks, elegant hand-made dithering, and how to do antialiasing without a soft look. It was pretty easy to tell if an image was actually hand-pixeled vs. an overpainted scan. On a 320*240 image, every detail is conspicuous. You quickly develop an eye for the hand-made detail. I took a quick look at my old hand-pixelled images to see if there's a Vallejo. I never did the straight-up fantasy pictures, but I think the large sabretooth in this drawing must be from a fantasy painting: https://anioni.com/pauli/site1999/work/katka.html I made this at age 16 in Deluxe Paint IIe on the PC, so it's got the full 256-color palette. The somewhat random color explosions on the sabretooth definitely show both palette excitement and Vallejo influence. The two cats are clearly from different sources. I didn't use scans, just worked the outlines from the sources (maybe with the help of tracing paper or something). It took around 40-50 hours to hand-pixel an image like this. In the bottom-left corner I've added the date and time when it was completed, clearly relieved that it was finally finished... This is the last hand-pixeled image I did in 1998: https://anioni.com/pauli/site1999/work/seqjesus.html It's a much better picture! By this time it was obvious that pixel graphics are a relic, nobody seemed to care about my antialiasing anymore, and I moved on. reply actionfromafar 9 hours agoparentHey, I remember that sabre tooth picture!

I primarily work with glitch art; the definition is finicky, and creating it without bleeding into the more generic genre of New Aesthetic can be difficult because of how volatile and uncooperative glitches are. A hard limitation on a number of colors in a palette seems simultaneously incredibly frustrating and liberatingly-simple. While it doesn't inherently affect the medium of the work (pixel art), it poses limitations that challenge it (fidelity in detail being most notable). These limitations also pose some ceiling on the work that can be done - a limited color depth makes an artists focus much more on effective detail than perfect detail, which I think adds character to an art piece. Very interesting article. reply kbouck 17 hours agoparent> I've found that limitation in artistic mediums can serve as motivation and even inspiration in art. There's a great 1969 interview with Charles Eames in which he discusses design, and constraints as being a necessary component of design. Some Excerpts: Interviewer: Does the creation of Design admit constraint? Eames: Design depends largely on constraints. Interviewer: What constraints? Eames: The sum of all constraints. Here is one of the few effective keys to the design problem: the ability of the designer to recognize as many of the constraints as possible, his willingness and enthusiasm for working within these constraints. The constraints of price, size, strength, balance, time and so forth. Each problem has its own peculiar list. Interviewer: Does Design obey laws?

The majority of people I've seen glitching circuits have no understanding of what they're doing, actively resist gaining any, and then act frustrated when the humidity changes and the glitch doesn't work anymore, or the chip dies after a few more tries. If you want a glitch to ground out a sync pulse that travels between chips in a Speak N Spell, but do so _without_ overstressing the chips and eventually destroying them, there are absolutely ways to do that. Buffers and diodes are not rocket science, and once the signals have been found, manipulating them can be made repeatable, safe, and durable. If you want a glitch to happen somewhere between the 4th and 40th scanline of a video frame and always during the horizontal blanking interval, it's absolutely possible to construct a trigger circuit that will do precisely that, every time, perhaps still with a configurable degree of randomness but never in a way that will smoke the chips.

Wolfenstein being feasible on the PC and not the Amiga, was just a symptom of stagnation. The Amiga (as a promising commercial venture!) had doom (pun intended) written all over it even before Wolfenstein. Commodore ignored the Amiga for years and years. Edit: I just recalled something - the Amiga recquired either a TV or increasingly rare monitors with PAL/NTSC frequencies. You couldn't just walk in to a computer shop and buy an Amiga and a VGA compatible monitor. It was a flickery and low-resolution monitor or a TV. Not exactly endearing to professionals. I mean, I loved the Amiga maybe too much, it was always the underdog, but it was increasingly also the losing underdog. reply predictsoft 8 hours agorootparentI used a VGA monitor with my Amiga 1200 (with an adapter). It was not flickery at all and was full resolution. reply actionfromafar 7 hours agorootparentYes, I know. I had that setup myself. :) I posit though, that by the time Amiga 1200 was out, Amiga as a commercial venture was already dead in the water. The 1200 was a last ditch effort. Still loved it, of course. reply vintermann 1 hour agorootparentI remember that there was some sort of shareware with a 40 day trial that my brother ran, but it stayed at 40 days. They had removed the clock as a cost saving measure on the A1200. Yup, pretty desperate. reply badpun 8 hours agorootparentprevA1200 and A4000 could be hooked into a VGA monitor for the flickerless experience. The caveat was that the flicker-free display modes were added on top of old ones, which meant that, while you could run Workbench and most applications on the VGA monitor, all games ran in the obsolete PAL modes your VGA display couldn’t handle. This created a market for niche dual-mode displays, which solved the problem, but were a bit pricey. reply winternewt 12 hours agorootparentprevIt certainly has direct framebuffer access. But the bitplane representation where the bits of each pixel's value are spread out across multiple bytes can make certain kinds of updates very time consuming. reply shiroiushi 11 hours agorootparentYeah, that's what the video was discussing. Sorry, I got the terminology wrong. reply pjc50 10 hours agoparentprevIt might have had a rocky transition, but it was also very badly mismanaged by Commodore. reply mrob 3 hours agoprevThe high resolution but limited colors example looks like screen printing. Screen printing involves squeezing ink through stencils supported by a fine mesh. It can produce excellent detail, but you need a separate stencil for each color so the number of colors is usually low. A lot of old arcade and pinball machines used screen printing for the cabinet artwork. I like it better than standard CYMK printing because it can produce more saturated colors. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_printing reply ChrisMarshallNY 18 hours agoprevI met him, back in the 1980s, when I was still doing paintings, myself[0].

If you look at the ring on the lizard-finger, you'll see \"CDM 84.\" reply amiga386 17 hours agoprevThe article links to the \"no copy?\" site: http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/ which was highly influential in its own time... Demos are ultimately about impressing, also copying without being seen as copying - if you literally copy/paste other people's stuff, that makes you \"lame\", but if you quote/reference it, if you one-up it - if your rivals put out a demo with 200 bobs, you put out one with 240 bobs - then you look cool and people look up to you. I don't think many people would be too concerned that Amiga musicians sampled presets of existing synths before putting those sounds to use in an original composition that fits the Amiga's hardware limits. And they would think it _amazing_ if you could cover a well-known tune with any kind of fidelity in those tight memory limits. I don't think many people are upset if coders reverse-engineer their rivals and they all share among the many hardware tricks you can do - because there's always someone looking to go one step further and is experimenting to find yet another new trick. And finally, graphics artists weren't exactly penalised for re-drawing a Boris Vallejo by hand - it was difficult to do, and \"the scene\" liked those sorts of pictures (i.e. naked chicks and fantasy art). Effectively there was not just \"this is my original art and it's on message\", but also \"I can copy this well-known art, because i'm technically capable enough to do it, and you're not\". And like the generative AI is doing today, or the camera did to paintings... back in the 1990s, scanners and photo editing software lowered the bar so much that even talentless fools could just scan in an image, rather than have the technical skills to reproduce it by hand, taking away what was otherwise a good channel for showing you had talent and others didn't. reply eru 17 hours agoparentYes. Of course, there's plenty of skill to be developed in photographing, too. And nowadays there's still plenty of skill left in coercing our limited AI generation tools to produce passable pictures, yet alone great ones. (But the field is evolving so far, that the achievements that still require skill constantly evolve, and the skills required also still shift.) reply throwawayk7h 16 hours agoprevHow did his art become the face of 80s fantasy? of GoldenAxe? of D&D?

It is as if he is channeling the fantasies of a 13-year-old boy without shame, guilt or even self-consciousness. It is that rare artwork that is only about itself. It is like a picture that is run through iterative image generation using only the words \"hotter\" and \"heroic\" and \"mysterious\" over and over until an asymptote is reached.

A direct link would be possible at the time when the phrase “puritanism sells” made sense, but a number of generations have alreafy been born into the “sex sells” world. So there's a country with a giant porn industry, but at the same time newspapers are full of stories about “sexual predators” hiding under every bush, and someone's naked breast is considered worthy of being turned into a “national scandal”. Intuition hints that one is intertwined with another. When people from elsewhere hear about gender neutral bathhouse (formerly “common village/family bathhouse”, or simply “a river”), they picture themselves asking a granny how's steam in the sauna. In certain countries, they immediately think of some kind of orgy instead (based on media descriptions and fantasies). And certain people of limited wit even try to reenact them in reality, with pathetic results. Specific social convention makes people gasp, roll their eyes, and hide the children when they see someone without clothes, not their strict moral principles. It is highly unlikely that it will disappear by itself. On the contrary, there are forces that benefit from it. The aforementioned porn industry have successfully used commoners' fears to ban non-corporate-produced wanking materials from the biggest websites.

End of story. All the excuses and exceptions corporate human robots invent afterwards are just irrelevant icing on the cake.

For example, there's , which can control any MPRIS-compatible client: VLC, web browsers, different music players, mpd (with a plugin), etc. MPRIS can also be used to e.g. allow controlling playback without unlocking the screen - the screen locker itself doesn't need elaborate support, something as simple as slock could be hacked to recognise a key combo and call out to playerctl; more fancy login managers/lockers could talk DBUS/MPRIS directly and even e.g. display album artwork. Unfortunately, the standard doesn't seem to specify a simple way to indicate whether video is being played back, which could be a saner way to inform the screen locker; the actual protocol to directly inhibit locking is unfortunately a little bit insane. Read the spec, there's probably some interesting ideas to explore: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/ reply mariusor 5 hours agorootparentFunny you mentioned playerctl. Due to the fact that over time its scope expanded from a simple MPRIS based control application, into a full blown library with various unneeded (by me) features. Therefore as a starting point for the scrobbler daemon I wrote the simpler mpris-ctl: https://github.com/mariusor/mpris-ctl, which does just the control and meta-data output parts that playerctl has, and only depends on libdbus.

If there's interest I would be happy to extract it into a separately maintained package. For now it lives [here](https://codeberg.org/andrewrk/player/src/branch/main/player/...). I also did a [semi-related talk about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCLrNqc9jdE). For context, Acoustid is a MusicBrainz-adjacent service for figuring out the MusicBrainz ID of a song based on the sonic content alone, even if it has been distorted or compressed. Chromaprint is the logic for computing an Acoustid given a song as input. reply lukaslalinsky 1 hour agoparentOh, really cool to see my old code implemented in a different language. There is one other reimplementation, I think in C#, but that's much much more verbose.

I think in the case of \"great, open service\" selling, the new buyer can just change the licensing, and you're out of luck.

MusicBrainz/beets/flac/plex is my choice for music and it beats Spotify with the selection and quality. reply camtarn 11 hours agoprevWay back in 2007-2009, a bunch of Amazon Scotland developers and I were tasked to make a ripoff of MusicBrainz, because Amazon wanted another IMDb to sell ads on. (The brief was literally \"make us IMDb but in another vertical\"!) It felt like a doomed project from the start, and I kinda hated the idea of ripping off an open project and trying to steal their users, but hey, it paid the bills. We imported the MusicBrainz database, spent months hotly debating about the data model (releases versus editions, mostly), more months preparing the site for an influx of traffic (our goal for launch was 200 hits per second), and yet more months going from a team-internal design (Amazon at that time believed that engineers were perfectly good designers, which I think says a lot about the 2007 Amazon site design!) to an execrable bright-yellow-and-red \"tequila sunrise\" design by an internal Amazon designer from Seattle, to finally something attractive once we hired our own designer. Then after two years of hard work we launched and hilariously sunk without trace, except for one dedicated user who we reckoned had a big paper music encyclopedia and who just kept on trucking, adding basic info, for months. We sent her a T-shirt. SoundUnwound closed quietly a couple of years after launch.

If you are OCD about your digital music collection it is a must have. reply squigz 15 hours agoparentbeets is fantastic A bit I've taken to heart from their docs: I would like to sincerely apologize that the autotagger in beets is so fussy. It asks you a lot of complicated questions, insecurely asking that you verify nearly every assumption it makes. This means importing and correcting the tags for a large library can be an endless, tedious process. I’m sorry for this. Maybe it will help to think of it as a tradeoff. By carefully examining every album you own, you get to become more familiar with your library, its extent, its variation, and its quirks. People used to spend hours lovingly sorting and resorting their shelves of LPs. In the iTunes age, many of us toss our music into a heap and forget about it. This is great for some people. But there’s value in intimate, complete familiarity with your collection. So instead of a chore, try thinking of correcting tags as quality time with your music collection. That’s what I do. reply AzzyHN 15 hours agoprevMusicBrainz (and Picard) are amazing tools.

A piano is labelled string instrument, equally unusual. And it says piano quartet consists of a piano, a violin, a viola and a cello, which is not unusual, but definitely not always the case.

Their style guide says: https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Style/Principle If you ask yourself in what style something should be entered into MusicBrainz, the following principles apply: Follow Artist intent.

Follow the style guidelines. https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Style reply lazybookwyrm 8 hours agorootparent\"remix\" would be an example of extra title information as outlined here https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Style/Titles. \"Titles and subtitles of mixes/versions are formatted according to the appropriate language's guidelines; the other parts of this extra information should be in lower case except for words that would normally be capitalized in the language.\" \"acapella\" would technically be considered a spelling error, which is something that we correct. This article does a good job explaining what artist intent means: https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Style/Principle/Error_correction... reply kevin_thibedeau 18 hours agorootparentprevThe artist \"intent\" is often misguided.

It's like they take the \"best\" match from their US/EU pressings and if you live in asia and have an alternate market and a slightly different combination in the pressing, you're SOL. I am in the asia-pacific. I do have this recording. it does not match what they and discogs have for this CD. (its a recording of the bach double violin concerto over 2 CDs by Zukerman/Stern/Perlman with other materials, which seem to vary by pressing) The tooling is great for the mainline.

The CDs themselves say Sony, with a copyright date of 1985 on the cds which I believe is before Sony bought Colombia, which is how CBS masterworks were being branded. The notebook says Columbia (c) Sony 1991. This is usual. This is confusing. It's an Australian manufactured cd burned by disctronics. So it's US and British recordings, owned by american-canadian recording companies, sold on to Japan, and minted in Australia with branding from all 3. https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/165099849212?srsltid=AfmBOoqjTUN... reply lc9er 5 hours agoprevOne of my old bands is listed in here. reply lobochrome 19 hours agoprevQuaint memories of a carefully curated library of music. iTunes was my pride, every file properly tagged with beautiful music.

After all Apple was dedicated to Music (Liberal Arts & Technology!) and I would finally have the ability to have my *entire* music collection with me on the road. Hey - iTunes replaced a version of a song (Max Richter On the Nature of Daylight) with a slightly different version (Weird vocalized version from a Leonardo di Caprio Soundtrack) and for some reason even *my* copy on my Mac is now replaced by this one. Lot's of angry e-mails with Support. They bought Beats by Dr. Dre - a bit odd and that Jimmy Iovine guy starts showing up at WWDC. Odd. He's not so sympa. So now iTunes becomes Apple Music and you compete with Spotify eh?! Well if you make it just right and don't mess up MY music and combine it with streaming - that could be great! Plus ONLY Apple could pull this off. Hey, somehow I can't find my Music anymore and some of my demo bootlegs are gone. Apple Music has disappeared from WWDC, because we all complained that it isn't relevant to developers maybe?! But why doesn't it show up in the iPhone event anymore? Okay - I give up.

Then everything went bad in an unexpected way. I was using Firefox on a Mac to interact with the site. Apparently they added a bunch of javascipt to the site that would automatically fill some fields that I didn't even understand, but the scripts did not execute correctly or even at all on my system. Later I got an angry message from someone at the site telling me that my submissions were unacceptable, though it isn't clear if some or all data was backed out or what. Given the timing it seems they were targeting IE6 on Windows and could not imagine any other kind of user. They could have somehow checked script function on the incoming data, and apparently eventually did that, but they got angry at me instead even though I put quite a bit of effort into correctness. Have stayed away since, but still take this as a warning about the kinds of things that can go wrong even with the most well meaning contributed data type site. And unfortunately this kind of music data continues to have relatively low value to most audiences. reply aeontech 11 hours agoparent [–] I can't speak to your experience, and I'm sorry you had a bad one, but just to clarify for anyone who is not familiar with the site, the review and voting on the data submissions is done by other users. Perhaps you ran into someone who was particularly passionate about that artist, or having a particularly bad day, but I'd be surprised if it was any of the site's developers. (PS: If a submission does not get any negative feedback, it gets auto-accepted after some time in the queue. If it gets negative feedback, it will be rejected, and the author can modify and resubmit it.) reply m0llusk 4 hours agorootparent [–] Wow, a bunch of neg votes because I tried to summarize my experience. I should just hide instead? Sure, I may have misunderstood that part. So not a dev. Which means we have what? Get excited about a web site that implements a cool idea.

Sorry I didn't understand something about the input process or how to correctly respond to the rage emails. My central point of being careful interacting with contributed data sites stands. Most people do not go into such things expecting the result might be a great deal of rage mail with no clear way to respond.

I get how making such quick generalizations can serve you well as an engineer, but when people's work is involved it pays to think about it a bit more! :) Example of respectful: I tried this, super cool, and I encourage everyone to give it a try. For my setup (details), I could only get 10 to work , but that might just be me.

For my setup (details), I could only get 10 to work , but that's probably just me! edit: Thinking about it some more, I realized it might be because my device uses an outdated lib and I just updated that and I got 19 of them to work! I checked 's GitHub and saw they also hadn't updated this dependency. So I opened an issue, and let them know about this, here's the link: . All around super awesome project, love it!\" You get the idea? Few word mantra: contribute and build, not deplete and discourage. reply munch117 7 hours agorootparentThe problem here is that it cannot possibly work robustly. It does what it does by trampling all over the error correction codes and using out of spec pixel shapes. This is not the sort of problem that will go away once the technology matures. It is fragile by its very nature. It is absolutely OK to recommend against it on that basis. reply keepamovin 32 minutes agorootparentI don't think you're right about that, how could it work at all? Are you even sure how it works? I was able to scan all 21 perfectly, less than 1 second each, on iOS 18 a couple of inches from retina display. I have no idea how it works, but it seems pretty robust to me. I know people can't do it on some Android phones, and apps. Okay. But still seems pretty good and not a fundamental flaw. Absolutely not OK to blanket recommend against trying that. Why limit anyone? Just encourage everyone to try for themselves. Get more data. Premature to make these negative recommendations on 1 test. Rather than short-circuiting further curiosity and exploration, expand it! reply hluska 37 minutes agorootparentprevIn this case, the builder actually agreed with the feedback. You had no reason to call it “poosey”, in fact that’s a stupid word to even have in your vocabulary. reply notpushkin 8 hours agorootparentprevI see your point! But there’s an issue specific to QR codes here. See, if you generate a code and it works for you, you generally expect it to work for other QR readers as well. If all you want to create a QR code for yourself to use (say, to deactivate an alarm with a code, or a Wi-Fi code for your guests to connect maybe, this should be fine. However, things like this will inevitably be used in production, and it would be really bad if, say, a QR code gets printed on a million copies of something and turn out to only work for some users. I agree that we should support new projects and not choke them down with overly negative commentary. However, piling up positivity doesn’t help either: your second example doesn’t feel genuine to me, more like a spam review in app store or something. I love the sandwich approach in your first one though! How about this: “Cool project! Some styles are really nice, I didn’t know you can make QR codes like this ever work. However, when I tried reading them with [app name] scanner app, only a few styles actually worked for me. Perhaps it works with other scanners, but this one has [99M+] downloads last month [/ active user base or something]. So if you want to use those be sure to check it works everywhere, and maybe stick to more plain styles? I also hope this gets addressed in the qrframe itself – perhaps tweaking the contrast in styles [X] and [Y] a bit would help.” It is still way too fluffy IMO, but much more substantial. It is harder to write, of course. reply keepamovin 1 hour agorootparentThanks, let me maybe respond tomorrow, when more time. reply stkdump 13 hours agorootparentprevI tested it with my phone and got similar results: I got only 9 out of the 21 QR codes to work. I don't know why you think such a finding should not be mentioned here. reply keepamovin 10 hours agorootparentI think it should be mentioned but without the \"so I'd recommend against using\", because that's wrong. Also, specify OS, surface, time, etc for better test! reply mynameisvlad 2 hours agorootparent> \"so I'd recommend against using\", because that's wrong. Someone's opinion is not \"wrong\". It may be misinformed, it may be different than yours, but you can't just assign a \"correctness\" value to something subjective just because you disagree with it. reply keepamovin 1 hour agorootparentNo, that's not it, but I get why you read it like that. By \"wrong\" I mean the lifting his personal test/opinion to the level of a general \"recommendation\", in effect discouraging others from exploring, and harming the creator. That is one wrong here. You get it? reply echoangle 11 hours agorootparentprevIf you want to use something for production, you shouldn’t only test on the latest stuff you personally have at home but on the crappiest stuff you reasonably expect users to have. Otherwise, you get websites that lag and spin up the fans on everybody’s laptops while the developer is happy on his workstation with 32 cores and a gaming GPU. reply Kiro 6 hours agorootparentNo, thanks. I have no obligation to do that and if it lags you can always just close the page. reply echoangle 6 hours agorootparentI didn’t mean „you’re mandated by law to do this“, I meant „if you don’t do this, people won’t use your stuff if they can avoid it“. If that’s ok for you, that’s awesome. We were talking about production use though, were adoption and user friendliness is normally a goal. reply keepamovin 10 hours agorootparentprevAgree, but OP should not then \"not recommend\" and it shouldn't be top comment dissuading others from seeing this AWESOME project. reply echoangle 10 hours agorootparentOP didn’t „not recommend“ the project but said > so I'd recommend against using anything too fancy for real world barcodes. That’s completely correct and doesn’t speak against the whole project but only against the „too fancy“ styles offered. reply keepamovin 38 minutes agorootparentBut did OP effectively \"recommend against using\" this by that statement \"? Yes. Especially given how many people are likely to quickly scan that top comment given the context. It's not correct, and actually morally wrong, to make blanket recommendations against something based on your own specific set up. Share your experience! Don't discourage others from trying it, or pretend your single source, device specific test now permits you to direct others with recommendations on this thing you didn't build, but have effectively now misrepresented as a \"too fancy\" \"non real world application\" toy. How many people is that comment going to lose the creator? How many joy experiences are robbed from those people who get misguided by that comment? I get your more literal, word parser-y reading, and I can definitely see how a narrow, defly parsed, narrow reading precisely defines just what you think it does. But that doesn't mean that's the only reading, or even the intended one. I think the people who will bother parsing any such possible nuance while making microsecond decision to either explore further or not bother is low. Congrats on being an exception tho! Or maybe you are just overanalyzing for the purpose of this argument? Hahaha :) I get you don't see the issue right now, and how it undermines the very best aspects of the project, but i think with a slight shift of perspective, you might! I encourage you to explore a few more Show HN's yourself and empathize with the dynamics, the effects of comments, and even try posting a few and seeing the response you get and how you feel about that. Through long experience you will know the values important here. reply keepamovin 1 hour agorootparentprevI got all 21 to scan: iOS 18, 3 - 4 inches from retina display. All scanned within 1 second.

And some of that is splashing onto YC itself. PearAI offers an AI coding editor. The startup’s founder Duke Pan has openly said that it’s a cloned copy of another project, VSCode, and another AI editor called Continue, which was covered under the Apache open source license. But PearAI made a major misstep: PearAI originally slapped its own made-up closed license on its project, called the Pear Enterprise License, which Pan admitted was written by ChatGPT. Changing a license like this is a big deal in the open source world. Not only are there legalities involved in violating a software license, but it defeats the whole purpose of open source, which is about community building, sharing, and contributing. In an apology PearAI’s Pan posted on Monday, he said that the project has now been released under the same Apache open source license as the original project. The launch thread went viral with thousands of comments by Sunday. Some were congratulatory, but others were vicious in pointing out the licensing and the fact that PearAI wasn’t so much a fork with new stuff added, but a replica with a new name. Pan admitted as much in his apology. So many angry comments were made on Pan’s launch thread that X put a community note on it that read: “Pear is a fork of Continue.dev, an open-source AI code editor. PearAI used Continue.dev’s code and mass-replaced all references to ‘Continue’ to ‘PearAI’ to mislead people into believing that they built this product on their own.” This note wasn’t accurate, either. PearAI did say in some of its materials that the project was a clone (also known as a fork) of Continue as well as the original project that Continued used, VSCode. X subsequently removed that note. Pan apologized for how hard it was to find that information, too. He said that one way he and his cofounder, Nang Ang, “screwed up, critically, was not being clear enough about this … doing so upon a fork of others’ work without many new features, and talking about it so publicly online, made it look like we were stealing the work of others as our own.” In a comment to TechCrunch, he pointed out, however, that PearAI did have a list of differentiating features from Continue, which it has listed in a FAQ document. Still, on Sunday, Continue jumped in by posting a subtle threat that it was “ecstatic to see the ecosystem that has formed around us. But open source can’t be taken for granted—it is a movement built on trust, and on respect for contributions, licenses, and intellectual property.” Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan got involved, too. He defended PearAI with several tweets. “Don’t understand why people are dragging a new project when literally it’s open source Apache license and that’s *the reason* why open source is awesome” one read. As you might imagine, people pointed out that it was changed to an Apache license after the uproar. There were other reasons this project caught ire. Pan boasted how he “just quit my 270 000$ job at Coinbase” to do this startup, even though this was about as far from an original idea as a startup can get. In addition to Continue, another big competitor is Cursor. On top of that, YC has funded two other AI code editors already, Void and Melty, as the mob was quick to point out. To which Tan replied on X, “More choice is good, people building is good, if you don’t like it don’t use it.” Others criticized YC for selecting PearAI into its cohort at all. Blogger Sven Schnieders wrote that PearAI is an example of the “the decline of YC” because it accepted a company that is “nothing more than a codebase copied from another YC-backed company.” On Hacker News, the site for programmers owned by YC, a commenter wrote that the debacle “says more about YC than this particular founder (lots of these types nowadays): i.e. their process, their due diligence.” Another wrote, “Is it typical for VC to just throw money at projects without any sort of oversight/auditing of, oh jeez, IDK, Licensing/Legal issues?” YC’s plans to double from two cohorts a year to four isn’t likely to ease this perception, or this risk, but the whole uproar probably says as much about how eager all VCs are to fund AI startups as it does about YC’s love of this particular ilk of them. Tan could not be immediately reached for comment. Edit note: This story was updated with a comment from PearAI and to include another mention that the project was a fork of VSCode as well as a fork of Continue.

    "commentBody": "YC criticized for backing AI startup that simply cloned another AI startup (techcrunch.com)312 points by blinding-streak 6 hours agohidepastfavorite235 comments CharlieDigital 5 hours agoI've been in the VC-backed startup space as a lead/principal engineer or technical advisor for the last 4 years. In that time, I've worked at 1 startup that closed a $100m C, one that closed a multi-million B, one that recently closed a $30m C, and one that started with a $8m seed. I've started my own startup and worked with founders of other startups on the side advising on the technical side (and once in a while building the initial PoCs). Some have failed, some have succeeded wildly, some have hit their limits of growth, some have a great product that solves an obvious problem yet get zero traction. Here is a lesson-learned as far as \"copying\" goes: it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if there are 3 companies in the same domain doing the same thing; then it simply comes down to insider connections, sales, marketing, and pricing. In the end, the team that wins isn't always the one with the best product; there is a fair bit of luck and timing, marketing is super important, and having the right leadership team in place makes all the difference. The non-product aspects of a successful business are supremely underappreciated, especially by the technical folks. Bad products can become good products eventually; bad teams can rarely survive turbulence and it is so hard to tell if a team has the right \"vibes\" or not. So it makes sense for YC or any VC to bet broadly because the reasons why a team succeeds and another fails is so intangible with so much luck and timing involved as well that making broad bets -- even if two YC-batch companies are very similar in terms of domain and product -- is just sound business. Edit: to be clear, these are not my principles (no need to attack me personally); these are simply my observations about teams that have succeeded and teams that have floundered. I left 1 company because because in principle, I disagreed with their loose operational style in a regulated space. reply kibwen 5 hours agoparentThe problem here is not that they stole the idea, it's that they literally just took an open-source codebase and filed off the serial numbers to claim it as their own proprietary work, and they did so in the most comically inept way possible. From the OP: PearAI offers an AI coding editor. The startup’s founder Duke Pan has openly said that it’s a cloned copy of another AI editor called Continue, which was covered under the Apache open source license.

It might be salvageable if they can convince customers they aren’t dragging everyone who uses them into a legal morass. But that will likely take more funding, and “help me pay lawyers” isn’t a great pitch. Good artist copy, great artists steal. PearAI tried and failed to copy. Y Combinator's value-adding play is in striking a licensing and indemnification deal between PearAI and Community. (If Community is smart, they'll demand an arm and a leg. They're owed it.) reply kevin_nisbet 5 hours agorootparentprevThe funny? thing is, this isn't the only YC company I've seen do this. reply CharlieDigital 4 hours agorootparentThere's a really great Radiolab podcast Dealing with Doubt[0] that talks about how high level competitive poker has evolved over the years. ANNIE DUKE: Sometimes you have to be 40 percent sure. Sometimes you have to be 30 percent sure. You know, if there's $70 in the pot and you only have to call $10, you know, now you're in the 15 percent range in terms of how certain you have to be that your hand is good. JAD: In that case, you can bet this hand that you're really not sure about knowing that while you might lose this time ... MIKE PESCA: If I do that a million times in my poker life, the law of high numbers indicates that I'm going to be very much a winner in the long run. It might be the very long run, but you should be ahead in the long run. ANNIE DUKE: Because it's not—it's not about winning the hand all the time, it's about winning the hand enough of the time. Any VC is making a bet of the same nature. Because there is some intangible in the team itself, it makes sense for the VC to bet on multiples if they believe that there is a valuable problem to be solved here.

They frown when they try to advocate for more rights, better employment conditions, and better pay. Such is the nature of modern capitalism. The Costco's and James Sinegal's of the world are few and rare; I wish we'd see more companies and leadership teams that valued labor and were more ethical. But a survey of the most successful CEO's (Ellison, Zuckerberg, Musk, et al) and companies leads us to believe that such principles are often opposed to the machinations of capitalism. reply mystified5016 4 hours agorootparentprevYes. That's exactly what capitalism is. reply drawkward 4 hours agorootparentPoe's Law: can't tell if serious or sarcastic. At any rate, emergent behaviors can arise from complex systems, and thats exactly what I am alleging of (venture) capitalism at this stage of its evolution. If you have differences of opinion, by all means share them. reply mystified5016 3 hours agorootparentThe American economic system is and always has been designed explicitly to extract the maximum profit from any venture at any cost. See: children mangled in factories, minimum wage laws, the oil industry, pretty much every OSHA regulation. If capitalism were at all capable of recognizing any externalities at all, we wouldn't have to create a vast legal system to protect workers, they would be treated safely and fairly because that is an ethically valuable thing to do. If capitalism were capable of considering morals, ethics, or even the law in general, we would live in a much better world. However, capitalists regularly dodge taxes while extracring wealth from any natural or human resources that exist. They then simply hoard that wealth. Remember we're living in the worst wealth inequality in this country's history. Global warming caused by the oil industry is wrecking the planet. Amazon warehouse workers get docked pay for using the bathroom and AI companies are pointing cameras at drivers to measure how often they blink. I have no clue how you can look at the world around you and not see the rampant exploitation and value extraction. The US is in a very bad way because of it. Increased poverty, homelessness, starvation. Hell, just look at our for-profit medical industry. People regularly go bankrupt due to ludicrous and exploitative price gouging. Tell me how ethical capitalism creates a system where hospitals are owned by private investment firms who squeeze the sick and dying for every cent they have and more. Capitalism does not, and fundamentally cannot consider ethics. Only profit. reply drawkward 3 hours agorootparentSo we agree. I couldn't tell, because Poe's law.

For the simple reason that it is a fundamental category error! But perhaps more profound a conceit is connecting morality to the economy. Is not our best advances in economics precisely in step with it's secularization, it's scientific nature which needs not for any old ideas of the individual and her maxims or \"moral\" nature? I guess, in your system here, what is this thing, economy, that could be harmed by a \"lack of morality\"? How do we understand it? Which came first? Why and how could there be this connection?

Life becomes so much harder if you have to justify why your seed/pre-seed startup has a unique advantage, but you're just ripping off the competition. Maybe you have unique hustle. That's a fairly incredible claim - especially in a crowded space like AI. I think it's at least a warning klaxon. We're entering this market by copying a competitor (not just in UI/UX, but literally byte-for-byte). How are we going to beat them? How do we ensure the same does not happen to us?

YC should bet on multiple companies in the same space. It's only logical. What bothers people is the lie. Also. They did break the terms of the license. They replaced the Apache license with their own enterprise license. They said they have the rights to relicense the code.

No, what I expect is for people to have thought about their own personal framework.

And b) you are living in a world with other people, people who are not dummies. If your own moral code is, say, \"grab the cash and run\", there going to treat you differently. That's part of why most professional organizations will have codes of ethics. E.g., IEEE has a good one for themselves [1] and another one specifically for software engineers. [2] It's true even in areas where making money is the primary goal, like business and finance. Take the current article as an example. The PearAI founders have revealed something about their moral code. That will matter down the road. E.g., Whenever I'm hiring somebody I'll look at their resume and flag companies with known ethical problems. Maybe that gets them binned, maybe I ask them about it. And when I've founded something, the ethics of my cofounders has been among my highest criteria. That's true for a lot of founders and execs I know.

But Open Source only works if people follow the rules. 2. In general, this is just an indication that YC is not the quality filter it once was.

It's about one set of people very generously doing lots of labor and publishing the result in hopes of making the world a little better. And then some other people exploiting that for personal gain with no regard for the first group. That's a social dynamic that's at the heart of IP laws. For example, Gutenberg enabled the creation of the publishing industry. Pirate book publishers saw a way to make some money by exploiting the labor of authors and original publishers for their own gain.

Pirate book publishers saw a way to make some money by exploiting the labor of authors and original publishers for their own gain. This is a _gross_ misunderstanding of what publishing was like in the first few centuries of the printing press. Copyright laws originated as a form of government censorship and control over the printing press in 15th-16th century Europe. Governments and religious authorities sought to regulate the spread of information by granting exclusive printing privileges to select printers. This allowed them to censor and control what content was published. It was only when the people who were censored won that copyright was invented to keep them from killing everyone involved. reply wpietri 4 hours agorootparentI never claimed that I was reporting on the whole arc of publishing law over hundreds of years.

It's the same vein of when people cry \"free speech\" when they said something reprehensible, as if that somehow should protect them from how people react to their horrible statements. I think what is driving this is one the of the fundamental problems with the tech industry and its relationship to society: the ingraining of the assumption that because something is legal to do means it is OK to do.

In my view, if you believe it is unethical for someone to re-license your Apache code with their own proprietary license, then it shouldn't have an Apache license. Taking a proprietary fork of an Apache licensed code base and creating an Enterprise product around it seems like a valid business move to me. My guess is that the \"uproar\" is not coming from the original project creators, but from outside community members who consider such things \"anti-social\" or whatnot, but I could be wrong. reply evanelias 1 hour agorootparent> if you believe it is unethical for someone to re-license your Apache code with their own proprietary license, then it shouldn't have an Apache license. It's not just unethical, it is clearly illegal. If you don't own the copyright to a program's source code, you cannot legally relicense that source code! Same holds true for any other copyrightable creative work which can be licensed. This is a very clear case of copyright infringement. Nothing in the Apache license permits the licensee to relicense the source code (meaning, entirely replace the license with a different one). It does permit you to build derivative enterprise products, and you have no obligation to keep the source code open for derivative products. But if you do release the source code for your derivative product, any original unmodified Apache licensed portion of the code retains that license and you cannot remove it if you aren't the copyright holder for that original work. reply kunley 5 hours agorootparentprevYes but they don't defend their view about enterprise product, instead saying they \"chatgpt'ed\" the license and \"can't be bothered with legal\", which is IMO even worse - I mean, as a founder how can one be so dumb to openly say that?

Rather, they attempted to re-license it, despite not being the copyright holder in the first place. They have no legal right to remove or replace the original license. They can build derivative works, and apply a new additional license on top, assuming the additional license is compatible with the original one, and the original one is retained for any unmodified portion of the original work. But they cannot legally remove the original license entirely, nor remove copyright/attribution from any code that they did not write. Think about this more deeply: if permissive licenses allowed you to replace the license entirely at will with no restrictions, that would effectively mean the work is in the public domain. There would be no purpose to having any license text at all, if these licenses could be trivially removed and violated at will. reply wpietri 5 hours agorootparentprevYou are confusing legality and morality. Legality can be an indicator of morality, in that laws tend to flow out of our moral senses. But legality is a lagging indicator, and new circumstances tend to create gaps where things are legal but not moral. One of my favorite examples here is wire fraud. The rise of electronic communication created all sorts of new possibilities for fraud, but we didn't get the wire fraud statue until 1952. There's a biography of Joseph \"The Yellow Kid\" Weil, a con man from the 1890s forward, where he crows about many of the things he got away with because of that. A number of the things he did were probably legal before 1952, but that didn't make them moral before and not moral after. reply sgarland 5 hours agorootparentprevIf you get a traffic ticket, you can pay a lawyer to get it knocked down to a non-moving violation, thus saving your insurance rates from spiking.

But he is not a real investor, as he invested in a copy of my project, which I had been developing since 2012. In 2020, during the pandemic, I found myself without any protection. I was robbed, and my Upwork account was even destroyed. I didn’t have enough money for food. I asked for help with my project in a remote accelerator where Amassad was a judge. I presented my project and expected a constructive conversation. But then I saw that Amassad immediately created copies of it within his network with his team. This had already happened with the YC startup Sixa, which was a copy of my post from a Ukrainian forum, and I mentioned this directly in my YC application. It was ignored and later the founder of Sixa disappeared with $7M (including money from Ukrainian investors) and he’s still being searched for. I think he was either killed or managed to deceive everyone and disappear. I believe there is a crisis of honesty and technological integrity at YC now, as there’s a huge demand for managers and actors. YC feels like a massive megamarket where all the managers trade technologies like at a Chinese microelectronics market only with better PR and networking. Unpunished evil always comes back. But it’s unclear how it can be punished in YC when all that matters is money and there’s no room for accountability in investments. When there are fake projects, 20% management errors from irresponsibility, and people whose success is measured by how many enemies they have, how can justice prevail? In Amassad’s home country of Pakistan, which he left for America, a supermarket was looted in 4 hours after opening. He would be better off helping his country than stealing projects from Ukrainian founders. I think for PG, Amassad may be bitch, but he's our bitch.. the world is run by hackers.

EMacs and Treesitter is much faster way to “find all references to X” in the codebase. Other questions can be answered with the naive grep implementation and marginal brain power. If all they’re investing in here is to write boilerplate code, well, that takes not much time in the grand scheme of things. Where the value add is actually in the design phase. And, as a result of these tools people are going to just skip those crucial steps. Am I missing something? reply dewey 5 hours agoparent> Am I missing something? Yes, you are basically posting a modern equivalent of the famous \"Dropbox reply\". \"EMacs and Treesitter...naive grep implementation\". There's value in these tools, that's why GitHub, JetBrains, Cursor all built businesses on top of AI coding extensions. Personally I don't use the \"Write this full function for me\"-features but use it as a way smarter auto-complete. People don't really use them to jump to \"find all references to X\" as that's perfectly well solved. reply sgarland 5 hours agorootparentI don’t think expecting someone to know how to set up an editor (or not; there are plenty of turnkey distros like LazyVim) or knowing how to use the most basic of *nix tools is on par with the Dropbox reply. > there’s value in these tools, that’s why… all built businesses on top of AI Or is it because those companies realized they would rapidly lose market share if they didn’t? You don’t have to add value to become popular, you just have to make people think they’re missing out.

So saying that it doesn't provide value is definitely wrong, and I was skeptical at first too. reply stroupwaffle 5 hours agorootparentprevJetBrains built a business on top of IDEs long before AI was mainstream. GitHub built their business on top of Git and collaborative coding. Microsoft (who owns GitHub) built part of their business on Visual Studio (also IDEs) long before AI was mainstream. So it’s a natural extension to their existing business. But if you’re selling me on a smarter autocomplete, I can already say from experience that AI can bounce good implementation ideas around, but it ALWAYS takes my intervention to get it right.

Because thats why you are selling it? reply keiferski 5 hours agoprevPrediction: as technology becomes more “mundane” and infiltrates more aspects of life, explicitly copying another business model or business idea itself will increasingly become normalized, even expected. Nowadays this tactic gets a bad name, but in the wider world of business, it’s pretty common to take an idea from one place and sell it elsewhere, or take something that is free and sell it for money. There are a million and one Italian restaurants, but no one gets criticized for opening yet another one (except as a poor business decision.) And so I don’t think YC or the startup can really be blamed here for basically just finding an opportunity and capitalizing on it. They’re an investment firm, not a nonprofit out to improve the world. What bothers me more is the deeper sense that many things which are / were free/public/etc. are now explicitly becoming private products competing in the marketplace, and not public goods. No one seems particularly interested in making public goods anymore, which is the deeper tragedy. And when events like this or the recent WordPress debacle occur, everyone is incentivized to shut their doors and stop making things open and accessible. One of the biggest areas you can observe this in is the news/journalism. Pretty much all of the better quality sources are behind paywalls now, when they weren’t five or ten years ago. This makes business sense and perhaps it’s the only real way journalism can fund itself in the Internet age, but it also means that information is increasingly not accessible for everyone. Something like Wikipedia probably couldn’t even get started today for this very reason. I’m not sure what the way out is, other than the traditional model of patronage from rich people. Unfortunately that group seems less and less interested in funding “cultural” things like the arts or open source software, probably because they’re increasingly comprised of technocrats with no interest in culture. What would really be great for YC or another organization to do, therefore, would be to fund this kind of public good. Unfortunately that goes against everything in the startup zeitgeist. reply moomin 4 hours agoprevLooking through the comments there are a number of people here who are determined to defend the company’s lousy morals.

(nothing to see here yet) Upgrade Notes¶ borg 1.2.x/1.4.x to borg 2.0¶ Compatibility notes: this is a major “breaking” release that is not compatible with existing repos. We tried to put all the necessary “breaking” changes into this release, so we hopefully do not need another breaking release in the near future. The changes were necessary for improved security, improved speed and parallelism, unblocking future improvements, getting rid of legacy crap and design limitations, having less and simpler code to maintain. You can use “borg transfer” to transfer archives from borg 1.2/1.4 repos to a new borg 2.0 repo, but it will need some time and space. Before using “borg transfer”, you must have upgraded to borg >= 1.2.6 (or another borg version that was patched to fix CVE-2023-CVE-2023-36811) and you must have followed the upgrade instructions at top of the change log relating to manifest and archive TAMs (borg2 just requires these TAMs now). command line syntax was changed, scripts and wrappers will need changes: you will usually either export BORG_REPO= into your environment or call borg like: “borg -r”. in the docs, we usually omit “-r …” for brevity. the scp-style REPO syntax was removed, please use ssh://…, #6697 ssh:// URLs: removed support for /~otheruser/, #6855. If you used this, just replace it by: ssh://user@host:port/home/otheruser/ -P / --prefix option was removed, please use the similar -a / --match-archives. archive names don’t need to be unique anymore. to the contrary: it is now strongly recommended to use the identical name for borg create within the same series of archives to make borg work more efficiently. the name now identifies a series of archive, to identify a single archive please use aid:, e.g.: borg delete aid:d34db33f the archive id is always given separately from the repository (differently than with borg 1.x you must not give repo::archive). the series name or archive id is either given as a positional parameter, like: borg create documents ~/Documents borg diff aid:deadbeef aid:d34db33f or, if the command makes sense for an arbitrary amount of archives, archives can be selected using a glob pattern, like: borg delete -a ‘sh:myarchive-2024-??-??’ borg recreate -a ‘sh:myarchive-2024-??-??’ some borg 1.x commands that supported working on a repo AND on an archive were split into 2 commands, some others were renamed: borg 2 repo commands: borg repo-create # was: borg init borg repo-list borg repo-info borg repo-delete borg repo-compress borg repo-space borg 2 archive commands: borg create NAME … borg list ID borg extract ID … borg diff ID1 ID2 borg rename ID NEWNAME borg info ID borg delete ID borg recreate ID … borg mount -a ID mountpoint … For more details, please consult the docs or --help option output. create/recreate/import-tar --timestamp: defaults to local timezone now (was: UTC) some deprecated options were removed: removed --remote-ratelimit (use --upload-ratelimit) removed --numeric-owner (use --numeric-ids) removed --nobsdflags (use --noflags) removed --noatime (default now, see also --atime) removed --save-space option (does not change behaviour) removed --bypass-lock option removed borg config command (only worked locally anyway) using --list together with --progress is now disallowed (except with --log-json), #7219 the --glob-archives option was renamed to --match-archives (the short option name -a is unchanged) and extended to support different pattern styles: id: for identical string match (this is the new default!) sh: for shell pattern / globbing match (this was used by --glob-archives) re: for regular expression match So you might need to edit your scripts like e.g.: borg 1.x: --glob-archives 'myserver-2024-*' borg 2.0: --match-archives 'sh:myserver-2024-*' use platformdirs 3.x.x instead of home-grown code. Due to that: XDG_*_HOME is not honoured on macOS and on Windows. BORG_BASE_DIR can still be used to enforce some base dir + .config/ or .cache/. the default macOS config and cache dir will now be in ~/Library/Application Support/borg/. create: different included/excluded status chars, #7321 dry-run: now uses “+” (was: “-”) and “-” (was: “x”) for included/excluded status non-dry-run: now uses “-” (was: “x”) for excluded files Option --filter=… might need an update, if you filter for the status chars that were changed. borg is now more strict and disallows giving some options multiple times - if that makes no sense. Highlander options, see #6269. That might make scripts fail now that somehow “worked” before (but maybe didn’t work as intended due to the contradicting options). Change Log 2.x¶ Version 2.0.0b11 (2024-09-26)¶ Please note: Beta releases are only for testing on NEW repos - do not use for production. For upgrade and compatibility hints, please also read the section “Upgrade Notes” above. New features: Support rclone:// URLs for borg repositories. This enables 70+ cloud storage products, including Amazon S3, Backblaze B2, Ceph, Dropbox, ftp(s), Google Cloud Storage, Google Drive, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft OneDrive, OpenStack Swift, pCloud, Seafile, sftp, SMB / CIFS and WebDAV! See https://rclone.org/ for more details. Parallel operations in same repo from same client (same user/machine). Archive series feature, #7930. TL;DR: a NAME now identifies a series of identically named archives, to identify a specific single archive, use aid:. in borg 1.x, we used to put a timestamp into the archive name, because borg1 required unique archive names. borg2 does not require unique archive names, but it encourages you to even use a identical archive names within the same SERIES of archives, e.g. you could backup user files to archives named “user-files” and system files to archives named “system-files”. that makes matching (e.g. for prune, for the files cache, …) much simpler and borg now KNOWS which archives belong to the same series (because they all have the same name). info/delete/prune: allow positional NAME argument, e.g.: borg prune --keep-daily 30borg delete aid: create: also archive inode number, #8362 Borg can use this when using archive series to rebuild the local files cache from the previous archive (of the same series) in the repository. Fixes: Remove superfluous repository.list() call. for high latency repos (like sftp, cloud), this improves performance of borg check and compact. repository.list: refresh lock more frequently misc. commands fixed for non-unique archive names remote: allow get_manifest method files cache: fix rare race condition with data loss potential, #3536 storelocking: misc. fixes / cleanups Other changes: Cache the chunks index in the repository, #8397. Improves high latency repo performance for most commands compared to b10. repo-compress: faster by using chunks index rather than repository.list(). Files cache entries now have both ctime AND mtime. Borg updates the ctime and mtime of known and “unchanged” files, #4915. Rebuild files cache from previous archive in same series, #8385. Reduce RAM usage by splitting the files cache by archive series, #5658. Remove AdHocCache, remove BORG_CACHE_IMPL (we only have one implementation). Docs: user@ and :port are optional in sftp and ssh URLs. CI: re-enable windows build after fixing it. Upgrade pyinstaller to 6.10.0. Increase IDS_PER_CHUNK, #6945. Version 2.0.0b10 (2024-09-09)¶ New features: borgstore based repository, file:, ssh: and sftp: for now, more possible. repository stores objects separately now, not using segment files. this has more fs overhead, but needs much less I/O because no segment files compaction is required anymore. also, no repository index is needed anymore because we can directly find the objects by their ID. locking: new borgstore based repository locking with automatic stale lock removal (if lock does not get refreshed, if lock owner process is dead). simultaneous repository access for many borg commands except check/compact. the cache lock for adhocwithfiles is still exclusive though, so use BORG_CACHE_IMPL=adhoc if you want to try that out using only 1 machine and 1 user (that implementation doesn’t use a cache lock). When using multiple client machines or users, it also works with the default cache. delete/prune: much quicker now and can be undone. check --repair --undelete-archives: bring archives back from the dead. repo-space: manage reserved space in repository (avoid dead-end situation if repository filesystem runs full). Bugs/issues fixed: a lot! all linked from PR #8332. Other changes: repository: remove transactions, solved differently and much simpler now (convergence and write order primarily). repository: replaced precise reference counting with “object exists in repo?” and “garbage collection of unused objects”. cache: remove transactions, remove chunks cache. removed LocalCache, BORG_CACHE_IMPL=local, solving all related issues. as in beta 9, adhowwithfiles is the default implementation. compact: needs the borg key now (run it clientside), -v gives nice stats. transfer: archive transfers from borg 1.x need the --from-borg1 option check: reimplemented / bigger changes. code: got rid of a metric ton of not needed complexity. when borg does not need to read borg 1.x repos/archives anymore, after users have transferred their archives, even much more can be removed. docs: updated / removed outdated stuff renamed r* commands to repo-* Version 2.0.0b9 (2024-07-20)¶ New features: add BORG_CACHE_IMPL, default is “adhocwithfiles” to test the new cache implementation, featuring an adhoc non-persistent chunks cache and a persistent files cache. See the docs for other values. Requires to run “borg check --repair --archives-only” to delete orphaned chunks before running “borg compact” to free space!

Other changes: chunks: have separate encrypted metadata (ctype, clevel, csize, size) chunk = enc_meta_len16 + encrypted(msgpacked(meta)) + encrypted(compressed(data)). this breaks repo format compatibility, you need to create fresh repos! repository api: flags support, #6982 OpenBSD only - statically link OpenSSL, #6474. Avoid conflicting with shared libcrypto from the base OS pulled in via dependencies. restructured source code update diagrams to odg format, #6928 Version 2.0.0b1 (2022-08-08)¶ New features: massively increase archive metadata stream size limit, #1473. currently rather testing the code, scalability will improve later, see #6945. rcreate --copy-crypt-key: copy crypt_key from key of other repo, #6710. default: create new, random authenticated encryption key. prune/delete --checkpoint-interval=1800 and ctrl-c/SIGINT support, #6284 Fixes: ctrl-c must not kill important subprocesses, #6912 transfer: check whether ID hash method and chunker secret are same. add PlaintextKey and AuthenticatedKey support to uses_same_id_hash function. check: try harder to create the key, #5719 SaveFile: use a custom mkstemp with mode support, #6933, #6400 make setuptools happy, #6874 fix misc. compiler warnings list: fix {flags:} formatting, #6081 Other changes: new crypto does not need to call ._assert_id(), update code and docs. https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/pull/6463#discussion_r925436156 check: --verify-data does not need to decompress with new crypto modes Key: crypt_key instead of enc_key + enc_hmac_key, #6611 misc. docs updates and improvements CI: test on macOS 12 without fuse / fuse tests repository: add debug logging for issue #6687 _version.py: remove trailing blank, add LF at EOF (make pep8 checker happy) Version 2.0.0a4 (2022-07-17)¶ New features: recreate: consider level for recompression, #6698, #3622 Other changes: stop using libdeflate CI: add mypy (if we add type hints, it can do type checking) big changes to the source code: split up archiver module, transform it into a package use Black for automated code formatting remove some legacy code adapt/fix code for mypy use language_level = 3str for cython (this will be the default in cython 3) docs: document HardLinkManager and hlid, #2388 Version 2.0.0a3 (2022-07-04)¶ Fixes: check repo version, accept old repos only for --other-repo (e.g. rcreate/transfer). v2 is the default repo version for borg 2.0. v1 repos must only be used in a read-only way, e.g. for --other-repo=V1_REPO with borg init and borg transfer! New features: transfer: --upgrader=NoOp is the default. This is to support general-purpose transfer of archives between related borg2 repos. transfer: --upgrader=From12To20 must be used to transfer (and convert) archives from borg 1.2 repos to borg 2.0 repos. Other changes: removed some deprecated options removed -P (aka --prefix) option, #6806. The option -a (aka --glob-archives) can be used for same purpose and is more powerful, e.g.: -a ‘PREFIX*’ rcreate: always use argon2 kdf for new repos, #6820 rcreate: remove legacy encryption modes for new repos, #6490 Version 2.0.0a2 (2022-06-26)¶ Changes: split repo and archive name into separate args, #948 use -r or --repo or BORG_REPO env var to give the repository use --other-repo or BORG_OTHER_REPO to give another repo (e.g. borg transfer) use positional argument for archive name or -a ARCH_GLOB remove support for scp-style repo specification, use ssh://… simplify stats output: repo ops -> repo stats, archive ops -> archive stats repository index: add payload size (==csize) and flags to NSIndex entries repository index: set/query flags, iteration over flagged items (NSIndex) repository: sync write file in get_fd stats: deduplicated size now, was deduplicated compressed size in borg 1.x remove csize support at most places in the code (chunks index, stats, get_size, Item.chunks) replace problematic/ugly hardlink_master approach of borg 1.x by: symmetric hlid (all hardlinks pointing to same inode have same hlid) all archived hardlinked regular files have a chunks list borg rcreate --other-repo=OTHER_REPO: reuse key material from OTHER_REPO, #6554. This is useful if you want to use borg transfer to transfer archives from an existing borg 1.1/1.2 repo. If the chunker secret and the id key and algorithm stay the same, the deduplication will also work between past and future backups. borg transfer: efficiently copy archives from a borg 1.1/1.2 repo to a new repo. uses deduplication and does not decompress/recompress file content data. does some cleanups / fixes / conversions: disallow None value for .user/group/chunks/chunks_healthy cleanup msgpack related str/bytes mess, use new msgpack spec, #968 obfuscation: fix byte order for size, #6701 compression: use the 2 bytes for type and level, #6698 use version 2 for new archives convert timestamps int/bigint -> msgpack.Timestamp, see #2323 all hardlinks have chunks, maybe chunks_healthy, hlid remove the zlib type bytes hack make sure items with chunks have precomputed size removes the csize element from the tuples in the Item.chunks list clean item of attic 0.13 ‘acl’ bug remnants crypto: see 1.3.0a1 log entry removed “borg upgrade” command (not needed any more) compact: removed --cleanup-commits option docs: fixed quickstart and usage docs with new cli command syntax docs: removed the parts talking about potential AES-CTR mode issues (we will not use that any more). Version 1.3.0a1 (2022-04-15)¶ Although this was released as 1.3.0a1, it can be also seen as 2.0.0a1 as it was later decided to do breaking changes and thus the major release number had to be increased (thus, there will not be a 1.3.0 release, but 2.0.0). New features: init: new --encryption=(repokey|keyfile)-[blake2-](aes-ocb|chacha20-poly1305) New, better, faster crypto (see encryption-aead diagram in the docs), #6463. New AEAD cipher suites: AES-OCB and CHACHA20-POLY1305. Session keys are derived via HKDF from random session id and master key. Nonces/MessageIVs are counters starting from 0 for each session. AAD: chunk id, key type, messageIV, sessionID are now authenticated also. Solves the potential AES-CTR mode counter management issues of the legacy crypto. init: --key-algorithm=argon2 (new default KDF, older pbkdf2 also still available) borg key change-passphrase / change-location keeps the key algorithm unchanged. key change-algorithm: to upgrade existing keys to argon2 or downgrade to pbkdf2. We recommend you to upgrade unless you have to keep the key compatible with older versions of borg. key change-location: usable for repokeykeyfile location change benchmark cpu: display benchmarks of cpu bound stuff export-tar: new --tar-format=PAX (default: GNU) import-tar/export-tar: can use PAX format for ctime and atime support import-tar/export-tar: --tar-format=BORG: roundtrip ALL item metadata, #5830 repository: create and use version 2 repos only for now repository: implement PUT2: header crc32, overall xxh64, #1704 Other changes: require python >= 3.9, #6315 simplify libs setup, #6482 unbundle most bundled 3rd party code, use libs, #6316 use libdeflate.crc32 (Linux and all others) or zlib.crc32 (macOS) repository: code cleanups / simplifications internal crypto api: speedups / cleanups / refactorings / modernisation remove “borg upgrade” support for “attic backup” repos remove PassphraseKey code and borg key migrate-to-repokey command OpenBSD: build borg with OpenSSL (not: LibreSSL), #6474 remove support for LibreSSL, #6474 remove support for OpenSSL < 1.1.1 Support Important notes 1.x Navigation next previousBorg - Deduplicating Archiver 2.0.0b11 documentation » Important notes 2.x © Copyright 2010-2014 Jonas Borgström, 2015-2022 The Borg Collective (see AUTHORS file).

Then I avoid testing my backups because of the work it takes to un-forget it. Because of this, I'm leaning more and more towards rsync or tools that have GUI frontends. reply belthesar 1 hour agorootparentRather than avoid tools that work well, I would encourage you to adopt solutions that solve your use cases. For instance, if you aren't getting notifications that a backup is running, completing or failing, then all you've set up is a backup job, and not built a BDR process. If you're looking for a tool to solve your entire BDR plan, then you're looking at a commercial solution that bakes in automating restore testing, so on and so forth. Not considering all the aspects of a BDR process is what leads to this problem. Not the tool. reply mbrumlow 14 hours agoparentprev> set and forget for me and after 7 years Please tell me you verify your backups now and then? reply Helmut10001 13 hours agorootparentBorgmatic runs consistency checks [1] once a month on all repositories and archives and I occasionally retrieve older versions for selected files (archives with --verify-data only once a year or whenever I feel the need - there's 9TB of data in the borg repo, which takes a bit to scan). Note though that borg is not my main backup, it is the fallback \"3\" in the 3-2-1 principle, where my primary data is a ZFS Raidz2 and my primary backup is an offsite ZFS Raidz2 in pull mode. I added borg because I did not want to rely on a single software (ZFS), although this fear was unstained so far.

This looks really awesome and practical. Thank you so much. reply witten 4 hours agorootparentSure thing! If you have any feedback on how it works (or doesn't) for you, please feel free to file a ticket. reply dewey 7 hours agorootparentprevThis always gets repeated, sounds good and makes sense theoretically but in reality there's no good way to do that and it should be the job of a computer to that. Restoring one file from the backup, works but what if something else is corrupted? Restoring the system from the image, works but what if some directory is not in the backup and you don't see that while testing? reply l33tman 3 hours agorootparentI think the point is that if your data is valuable enough for you, you can't really trust that option in the backup tool to work - maybe you misunderstood some config option and the test now isn't really run, the tool is broken, or is run only on some of the backup files or dirs etc... or your original config might have missed a folder because it was mounted through some other filesystem (happened to me with Borg actually, and my whole /home/user dir especially wasn't backed up for the first 6 months I ran it :). Seems to be good to have another tool that you either manually or automatically can setup to run regularly that tries to locate random files from your existing file system in the backups? Something like that.. though that other tool might be broken as well of course... :/ reply dewey 3 hours agorootparentIt's a very hard problem. In the end everyone is having an increasing amount of data where double checking it manually is not feasible any more and a perfect solution is maybe not possible. Reling on software with good defaults that a lot of people use is probably a relatively safe bet combined with a second or third backup system (Personally I use Backblaze and Time Machine). reply witten 3 hours agorootparentprevborgmatic's \"spot\" check (probabilistically) protects against both of those failure modes: https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/deal-with-very-lar... reply dewey 3 hours agorootparentIndeed, I think these kind of automated checks are much more helpful than telling people they have to \"test\" test their backup. If a backup software doesn't do that automatically and reports if there's something off it's not good software or user experience. reply selcuka 13 hours agorootparentprev> Please tell me you verify your backups now and then? Then one can't call it \"set and forget\", right? reply semanticist 12 hours agorootparentBackup testing can be automated. I don't do this for my personal stuff, but at work there's a box that does a restore of our primary DB from backups, loads it into MySQL, and runs some smoke tests to make sure it looks roughly right. A quick script and a cronjob, and backups get tested every night. I'm sure there's more thorough ways to do this kind of testing, but whatever level of confirmation you need automating it should be viable and then you only have to pay attention if/when something breaks. reply rubenbe 8 hours agoparentprevDoes someone know a good Android client? reply ThomasWaldmann 2 hours agorootparentSome people were installing / using borg on android, but guess that isn't suitable for end users, rather for the nerds. Maybe try SeedVault? reply Mister_Snuggles 3 hours agoprevDoes anyone have an up-to-date comparison of Borg vs Restic? Or a compelling reason to switch from Restic to Borg? I've previously used Borg, but the inability to use anything other than local files or ssh as a backend became a problem for me. I switched to Restic around the time it gained compression support. So for my use-case of backing up various servers to an S3-compatible storage provider, Restic and Borg now seem to be equivalent. Obviously I don't want to fix what isn't broken, but I'd also like to know what I'm missing out on by using Restic instead of Borg. reply kornnflake 3 hours agoparent+1, I'm in a similar situation and be curious too about an up-to-date comparison. reply ThomasWaldmann 2 hours agorootparentComparisons might be interesting, but one needs to be aware that they would be a bit apples to oranges: - unreleased code that is still in heavy development (borg2, especially the new repository code inside borg2). - released code (restic) that has practically proven \"cloud support\" since quite a while. borg2 is using rclone for the cloud backend, so that part is at least quite proven, but the layers above that in borg2 are all quite fresh and not much optimized / debugged yet. reply krick 14 hours agoprevCurrently I'm just using bare rclone to backup to my own remote machines, but obviously this isn't very professional solution. Was thinking to add Backblaze B2 as a remote, but I guess using rclone wouldn't be a state-of-the-art solution here. After all, it isn't really a backup tool, is it? It has some built-in encryption, but it's a bit clunky, and I'd think a proper backup tool should automatically divide data into blocks of suitable size (instead of just creating file-per-file - to make it S3/B2 API-friendly), encode whole directories as tar (if needed to preserve links, for example), do deduplication, and whatever else are best practices I have no idea about, but which backup-proficient people probably invented long time ago. Does anybody have a recommendation? I briefly looked at restic and duplicati, but surprisingly none are as simple to use as I'd expect a dedicated backup-tool to be (I don't need, and kindda don't want GUI, I'd like all configuration to be stored in a single config-file I can just back-up to a different location like everything else, and re-create on any new machine). More than that, I've read some scary stories about these tools fucking up their indexes so that data turns out to be non-restorable, which sounds insane, since this is something you must be absolutely sure your backup-tool would never do no matter what, because what's even the point of making backups then. reply unaindz 1 hour agoparentI've been using bupstash since trying to do backups on an rpi and finding Borg too slow to be usable. Since then I upgraded to a proper server at home but kept bupstash as I found it to just work better for the most part. Keep in mind there's not been much progress since the last release two years ago and its still tagged as beta by the author. Tbf I think he has a higher quality standard than in other projects that are not tagged as such. Useful backup tool comparison: https://github.com/deajan/backup-bench reply Mister_Snuggles 2 hours agoparentprevI'm very happy with Restic backing up to BackBlaze B2. I have a \"config file\", which is really just a shell script to set up the environment (repository location, etc), run the desired backups, and execute the appropriate prune command to implement my desired retention schedule. I've been using this setup for years with great success. I've never had to do a full restore, but my experience restoring individual files and directories has been fine. Do you have any links related to the index corruption issue? I've never encountered it, but obviously a sample size of one isn't very useful. reply RockRobotRock 14 hours agoparentprev>I'd like all configuration to be stored in a single config-file I can just back-up to a different location like everything else, and re-create on any new machine You might want to look into kopia. It accomplishes the same task as restic, but handles configs in a way you might find more appealing. Further reading: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34154052 Don't even bother with duplicati. I've tried to make it work so many times, but it's just a buggy mess that always fails. It's a shame too, because I really like the interface. reply scorpioxy 14 hours agoparentprevWhether something is simple or not I'd say depends on the use case. But I found borg to be great. I'd recommend you check it out and go through the quickstart guide in the documentation. It does de-duplication and encryption. It does a lot more but you don't have to use those features if you don't need them. I couple it with borgmatic to implement a backup and disaster recovery procedure that is meant to decrease the risk of data loss. I also use borgbase and they have a good service but using something like B2 with this rclone support would result in a cheaper alternative if you don't need the extra that borgbase provides. I've been using it for quite a while now both for my personal projects and paid work and have had a good experience with it. reply abhinavk 14 hours agoparentprevrestic + autorestic/resticprofile. Borg 2 is still beta and Kopia is also there. But it's newer so I am testing it on another redundant backup on the same machine. I have space so why not? Every once in a while I run integrity check (with data) so I can trust that metadata and data are fine. reply jjice 4 hours agoprevFor personal use, at what point would one recommend using Borg over a regular rsync? I currently use rsync to backup up a set of directories on a drive to another drive and a remote service (rsync.net). It's been working great, but I'm not sure if my use-case is just simple enough where this is a good solution, or if I'm missing a big benefit of Borg. I do envy Borg's encryption, but the complexity of a new tool tied with the paranoia of me maybe screwing up all my data has had me on edge a bit to make the leap. I don't have a ton of data to backup, say about 5TB at the moment. reply ibizaman 29 minutes agoparentWith rsync, you’re replicating only the last state. With borg, you can see all backups being made and rollback to any previous snapshot. This is true of a lot of backup solutions btw. Concretely, if you inadvertently delete a file and this get rsynced, you cannot use the backup to restore that file. With borg you can. reply zimpenfish 4 hours agoparentprevFor me, the deduping and compression saves a lot of storage. My mail backup (17 backups covering the last 6 months) is originally 837GB, compressed to 312GB and dedupe'd to 19GB. Same with Postgres - 25GB to 7GB to 900MB. You could probably use rsync's hard linking to save space on the mail backup but I'm not sure you'd get it as small without faffing about. reply remram 2 hours agoparentprevUsual problem, if you delete/corrupt a file and find out two days later, your daily backup is not going to help you. Having more than one snapshot is very valuable. http://www.taobackup.com/ etc Rsync is also very slow with lots of files, and doesn't deal with renamed files (will transfer again). reply eikenberry 9 minutes agorootparentRsync backups can be setup to deal with this. I have rsync setup with daily incremental backups, the main sync to a 'current' folder and the old version of changed files staying in a weekday named folder (eg. Monday). So I have a rotating 7 day period to recover files. On top of that I have a monthly long term backup of the last old version of that month. This provides an arbitraribly long monthly window to recover from. Rsync is very versatile. reply nickcw 10 hours agoprevWriting an rclone backend for borg is something I have wanted to do for a long time. However I found that the backends weren't well abstracted enough in v1 to make that easy.

This is the summary of the major changes (more details are in the change log): https://www.borgbackup.org/releases/borg-2.0.html reply elric 11 hours agoprevI've happily been writing borg backups to rsync.net for years. They have support for forcing borg in the ssh session using force-command, and borg has options that can prevent deletion (should the backup ssh key be compromised). Overall it's a robust solution that isn't too painful to setup. reply unbrice 11 hours agoparentI second this. I was looking for a solution that prevented a compromised host from deleting its own backups. Forcing the command as you mentioned works for rsync.net, and its snapshots also provide a protection against fat finger errors. reply mendym 17 hours agoprevis there a reason to use the borg encryption[1] over rclone crypt[2] or vise versa? 1. https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.0b11/quickstart.htm... 2. https://rclone.org/crypt/ reply aborsy 16 hours agoparentRclone crypt is not much related to Borg. That’s a tool for copying files from one machine to another, in this case encrypting before copying. That’s rsync, working with cloud. Borg is a different tool, for backup. It deduplicates, encrypts, snapshots, checksums, compresses, … source directories into a single repository. It doesn’t work with files, rather blocks of data. It includes commands for repository management, like searching data, pruning or merging snapshots, etc. You will then transfer or sync the repository to wherever you want, with a tool such as rsync/SSH or rclone. Rclone is now natively supported, so that you don’t need to store the repository locally and on remote, rather back up directly to remote. reply misanthr0pe 17 hours agoparentprevI would also wonder what the difference between this package and Restic is. as far as efficiency and encryption. reply freeqaz 16 hours agoparentprevHow good at deduping is this when encryption is enabled? I was looking at rsync.net and it killed me that they don't support encryption in a sane way. reply djbusby 15 hours agorootparentIt's very sane: encrypt the bits, then send it to the host. Curious what you think is not right with their methods. reply freeqaz 12 hours agorootparentSure, but there is some requirement to not just blindly copy everything over-and-over, and that is where I've seen things get tricky before. If you enable encryption you have to re-upload the entire snapshot periodically. It's annoying because if you have TBs of stuff that blows. I'm just curious what systems exist for incremental, encrypted backups that don't require full uploading new snapshots. See here in the NOTE section. Re-reading this, it might a limitation of Duplicity. https://www.rsync.net/resources/howto/duplicity.html reply prirun 4 hours agorootparentAuthor of HashBackup here. Duplicity is very old backup software that uses the \"full + incremental\" strategy on a file-by-file basis, like tape backup systems. The full backup must be restored first and then all of the incrementals. This becomes impractical over time, so as with tapes, you must periodically repeat the full backup so the incremental chains do not become too long. Modern backup programs split files into blocks and keep track of data at the block level. You still do an initial full backup followed by incrementals, but block tracking allows you to restore any version of any file without restoring the full first and all following incrementals. The trade-off is in complexity: tracking blocks is more complex than tracking files. It has nothing to do with encryption. reply mendym 16 hours agorootparentprev> they don't support encryption in a sane way. Should the storage provider provide support for encryption on their end? Would you not want to store the keys locally? reply immibis 4 hours agorootparentThe provider should not. It provides a false sense of security. reply ThomasWaldmann 2 hours agoprevPlease note that this is rather recent \"bleeding edge\" code from master branch.

The Pi als runs OpenMediaVault to provide a SMB share on my home LAN. So whenever I scan a new document, just put it on the SMB share and from there it's backed up automatically every day. reply rmoriz 7 hours agoprevIt's a joy that the OSS world has so many active and really good backup tooling projects like Borg, restic and all the fancy wrapper/GUI tools.

Or do you know of a high quality blog post somewhere that does? reply wzyboy 13 hours agoprevI've always been doing \"two-pass\" backups to achieve \"3-2-1\" goal: first pass is to run BorgBackup to backup devices to my home server. The second pass is to use rclone to transfer the repos on home server to an object storage service (B2). With rclone support built-in, the setup would be much easier. reply cl3misch 13 hours agoparentI think this is heavily discouraged? Instead you should have multiple separate borg repos to minimize risk of misconfiguration and data corruption. reply cl3misch 7 hours agorootparentI managed to find the source for my statement: https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html#can-i-c... It is not \"heavily\" discouraged. But you have to pay extra attention to perform a clean copy of the borg repo's files, and ideally check both instances regularly for integrity. I would assume it's easy to forget validating the \"cold storage\" copy of your borg repo in practice. reply gmuslera 5 hours agoprevUsed BorgBackup 1.x with rclone, backing up in a local repository and then sending it to S3 with Rclone. For the way that borg works with files, most of the historic data lies on old, untouched files in the repository, only a catalog and the new blocks create new and update files. So it was great for using some of the S3 tiers that move files that doesn't change for some period automatically to a cheaper class. Having both together makes easier to get this kind of use case. reply singhrac 16 hours agoprevIt wasn't recommended a bit ago to use Borg 2.0 because it wasn't baked enough. Has that changed? Are people using Borg 2? reply aborsy 16 hours agoparentIt is still in beta, and has been in this state for a long time. At some point, the developer thought to delay it further and introduce whatever breaking changes are needed in this release. Note that if you use, say, the 2.11 version, you cannot upgrade to 2.12, you cannot go back to 1.X either. People like me were stuck, it turned out you have to discard the repo. Sometime later they better clarified this point: >> Borg2 is currently in beta testing and might get major and/or breaking changes between beta releases (and there is no beta to next-beta upgrade code, so you will have to delete and re-create repos). I have a 2.X repo. It’s working fine and backs up. I have a lot of snapshots in that repo. If someone knows how to transfer them to a 2.X version once it’s out of beta, let me know. reply DistractionRect 16 hours agoparentprevAuthor calls that out right at the top of the changelog: > Beta releases are only for testing on NEW repos - do not use for production. reply singhrac 13 hours agorootparentThat's fair. There's a lot of software that is generally ok to use in beta, however, and this has been in beta for a long time. reply Freak_NL 12 hours agorootparentBeta is beta. Hard to fault the developer using this label correctly with a clear notice for the way some other projects treat 'beta'. reply eternityforest 14 hours agoprevSo, should I plan to switch to this rather than keep using Kopia? I was using it for years on an external drive, but then I got a NAS, and did not want to fuss with community packages to get Borg working. Kopia works fine, aside from the confusing GUI setup process, but it seems to be the least popular up and coming option. Now it seems that this can directly target SFTP? I wonder what that means for the future of Kopia. reply _flux 12 hours agoparentKopia also supported rclone for a long time, though: https://kopia.io/docs/reference/command-line/common/reposito... . However, in my experience backing up over sftp with kopia can be very slow. I suspect it's unable to use parallel sessions for them (or pipelining, but rclone API probably doesn't do that). My reason to go with kopia was that previously you were not able to backup multiple hosts into the same repo without great inefficiencies. I'm not sure if they still have resolved that. Another was its native S3 support which I use with ceph. A perhaps more superficial personal reason is that at least Go is a statically typed language, even if its type system isn't that great.. reply lasr_velocirptr 2 hours agoprevcan anybody familiar with the tool comment on if the encryption codein borgbackup is audited or is there a tool whose encryption portion of the code is audited to ensure that there are no glaring bugs in the encryption scheme? reply tandav 17 hours agoprevThe lack of s3-like remotes support was the reason I switched from borg to restic reply synergy20 16 hours agoparentrclone has dedupe, I think it does what restic can do plus multiple cloud support. rclone crypt also does encryption. so far I think rclone has it all for me. reply aborsy 15 hours agorootparentRclone doesn’t have deduplication. That’s just finding files with the same name. It’s different from deduplication used in backup software. Think of grinding data in a big machine, and removing blocks that are redundant. You may have every file to be a single copy, and get significant space reduction. reply leetnewb 10 hours agorootparentRclone also has a hash-based dedupe mode. Still different from borg, but it can be a little more robust than name-based. reply wongogue 16 hours agorootparentprevThey also work together. restic uses rclone for backends other than the officially supported 7. rclone also has built-in restic integration. rclone on it own is a syncing solution not backup. reply RockRobotRock 14 hours agorootparent>restic uses rclone for backends This is cool. It sounds like I can set up restic to copy my backups to multiple S3 buckets, or even to an S3 bucket at the same time as a local drive using a union (https://rclone.org/union/) remote reply larschdk 12 hours agorootparentprevrclone and restic are not direct alternatives. They have a slight overlap, but are also different. Rclone is more versatile for moving/copying files. Restic has snapshotting, pruning, client side encryption, deduplication, and compression. Restic actually supports rclone as a backend. reply thangngoc89 16 hours agorootparentprevRestic also offers encryption and compression. That’s the selling point for me when dealing with dozens of TB reply swoorup 11 hours agoprevNew to Borg, and backups in general.

For example, I might have just 15GB Google Drive Storage, whereas on others I might have 100GB available. reply locusm 16 hours agoprevI quite like Borg, others worth checking out are Restic and Kopia. Restic didnt have a UI for a long time, not sure thats changed... reply wongogue 16 hours agoparentNope. No configuration file either.

Has there been any recent progress with that? reply ThomasWaldmann 2 hours agoparentBasic stuff might work in a \"posix-like\" environment, like when using cygwin or WSL. The main problem is that there currently aren't active windows developers within the borgbackup project who continuously test and improve the windows specific code parts. Since recently, we at least have some working CI on windows again, at least that was fixed. reply wg0 13 hours agoprevHow can we use it for large database backups > 500 GB and is anyone doing that on daily basis? reply prirun 3 hours agoparentAuthor of HashBackup here. To use modern block-based backup programs for large databases and VM images (similar situation), you must use a very small block size for dedup to work well. For VM images, that's 4K. For databases, it's the page size, which is 4K for SQlite and 16K for InnoDB by default. With very small block sizes, most block-based backup programs kind of fall over, and start downloading lots of data on each backup for the block index, use a lot of RAM for the index, or both. So it's important that you test programs with small block sizes if you expect high dedup across backups. Some backup program allow you to set the block size on a per-file basis (HashBackup does), while others set it at the backup repo level. To backup a database, there are generally a couple of options: 1. Create an SQL text dump of the database and back that up. For this to dedup well, variable-sized blocks must be used, and the smaller the block size, the higher the dedup ratio. 2. Backup the database while running with a fixed block size equal to the db page size. You could lock the database and do the backup, but it's better to do two backup runs, the first with no locking, and the second with a read lock. The first backup cannot be restored because it would be inconsistent if any changes occur to the database during the backup. But it does not lock out any database users during the backup. The second backup will be much faster because the bulk of the database blocks have already been saved and only the changed blocks have to be re-saved. Since the second backup occurs with a read lock held, the second backup will be a consistent snapshot of the database. 3. The third way is to get the database write logs involved, which is more complex. reply Havoc 9 hours agoparentprevAs long as borg is running on both ends it should hash it I think reply jas39 11 hours agoprevToo late Borg! I specifically chose Restic for the Rclone support. Can't change backup strategy now. It also save me once. Pcloud lifetime + Restic, all in one repo, to benefit from dedup. reply cyberax 16 hours agoprevInteresting. How robust is it in practice? I've been using Duplicacy for a long while, and I've been pretty happy with it. But I'd love to switch to a full open-source solution (Duplicacy is proprietary with sources publically available). reply IshKebab 12 hours agoprevI used to use Borg but the fact that it can't work with a dumb storage device like SMB meant I eventually moved to Rustic, which is even better: https://github.com/rustic-rs/rustic reply snorremd 11 hours agoparentI see they have gotten support for S3 (and other storage providers) via OpenDal. Might need to revisit rustic for my backup needs then! I once started looking at what it would take to build a GUI using Tauri (Rust backendJS/Web frontend), but didn't have time to figure out the APIs. What I really like about Rustic is that it understands .gitignore natively so you can backup your entire workspace without dragging a lot of dependencies, compiled binaries, and other unnecessary data with you into your backups. reply immibis 10 hours agoprevThat's really big and really nice. For anyone unfamiliar, rclone is to online storage what ffmpeg is to multimedia files: a Swiss army knife that adapts anything to anything. It supports everything from S3 and Azure storage, to Google Drive and Dropbox, to sftp mounts; encryption and compression layers too. reply 0xbadcafebee 15 hours agoprev [–] It's kind of ridiculous that there is better tooling for Kubernetes to sync files two ways than there is for the Linux desktop. Rclone is a maze of options, which vary based on version/distro. The configurator is a slow readline console script without enough information. The one decent GUI for Rclone has been abandoned, and despite being able to save \"tasks\", had no ability to just... schedule one every 10 minutes. And yet if you go into most distros and look at packaged Internet apps, or things on Flatpak, you will find 1,000 different open source GUIs for an RSS reader, BitTorrent client, or chat client. I would love it if there were some kind of \"Linux Desktop co-op\", with a couple of staff. Users pay membership dues, vote on apps/features, and some devs get paid to develop it, in addition to \"resume fame\" that can translate over to a higher paying gig. But something tells me the Linux Desktop is so small and nerd-focused that we'd just end up funding more RSS readers and chat clients. reply RockRobotRock 14 hours agoparentI'm not sure what you're on about. This started as a rant on rclone's CLI options, but ended on desktop Linux. rclone is mostly the work of one guy. You can donate to him if you'd like. Making a GUI for a complex, rapidly evolving CLI is not an easy thing to do. There's probably a hundred different attempts to make a good interface for ffmpeg, but you can't please everyone. reply darthrupert 15 hours agoparentprevSyncthing? reply nine_k 14 hours agorootparentSyncthing is great, but it's peer to peer, and it requires block storage (\"filesystem\"). It also has no idea of point-in-time snapshots. Syncthing, is, as is unison, rsync, etc, basically a mirroring tool. By contrast, Borg, Restic, Kopia (anything else?) use object storage, aka binary blobs, like S3 or R2 or One Drive. They store both entire copies and small diffs on top of them, much like video codecs, or like git. You can look at the filesystem you've backed up as it was in a particular moment, and you may have a history of many such moments, say, daily snapshots for a month, stored economically, not as 30 full copies. And it all is encrypted on top. If your source FS supports snapshots (ZFS, XFS on LVM, BTRFS), your backups can be entirely consistent views of your filesystem, of its relevant subtrees. reply oever 44 minutes agorootparentThis is how I run backups privately and at work: hourly local snapshots with btrbk and hourly remote backups of filesystem snapshots with Borg. The local snapshots backups are great for quick restores or finding out recent file changes. Prometheus alerts check that latest backup is at most two hours old and that the filesystem is not reporting errors. This setup running for more than a year now and gives great peace of mind. reply nine_k 19 minutes agorootparentThat's an appreciable integrity assurance! Mine is simpler: Syncthing with staggered versioning for important data, periodic Restic backups of the home directory (excluding caches), keeping several recent backups and a couple of older backups. I've restored from these backups 4 times, both due to crashes and when moving to a new machine, without any adventures in the process. reply TiredOfLife 5 hours agorootparentprevhttps://docs.syncthing.net/users/versioning.html reply nine_k 3 hours agorootparentIndeed; I know and use it. But it's per file, and not very configurable. It's not very helpful is you e.g. have a 1 GB file that gets appended 100 kB every day; Syncthing would store a new full-size copy in each version (immediately usable), while Borg / Restic / Kopia would only store the deltas (and would require slow mounting to access a particular version).

    "originBody": "Mozilla's massive lapse in judgement causes clash with uBlock Origin developer Martin Brinkmann Oct 1, 2024 Firefox48 Software developers who publish their products on third-party stores face all kinds of problems sometimes. From rejected apps or extensions to removed products or unjustified claims about them. ADVERTISEMENT Raymond \"gorhill\" Hill, maker of the world's most popular content blocker uBlock Origin received two emails from Mozilla recently about his Firefox add-on uBlock Origin Lite. Good to know: uBlock Origin Lite is a Manifest V3-compatible version of the content blocker. It is less powerful, but since Google is disabling Manifest V2 support in Chrome, it is what will remain from uBlock Origin for Chromium-based browsers. Mozilla says that it has reviewed the extension and found violations. The following claims were made: The extension is not asking for consent for data collecting. The extension contains \"minified, concatenated or otherwise machine-generated code\". There is no privacy policy. As a consequence, Mozilla disabled the extension on the Firefox Add-ons Store. Hill refuted all three claims that Mozilla made on the GitHub repository stating that the extension is not collecting any data, that there is no minified code in uBlock Origin Lite, and that there is a privacy policy. He admitted further that he does not \"have the time or motivation to spend time on this nonsense\" and won't react to the allegations made or appeal the decision. In a follow-up, Hill criticized the \"nonsensical and hostile review process\" that put added burden on developers. Mozilla disabled all versions of the extension except for the very first one. It still flagged the extension for the very same reasons, but nevertheless decided to keep the outdated version up. Does it affect uBlock Origin? The core extension remains available for Firefox. Unlike Google Chrome, Firefox will continue to support Manifest V2 extensions. Mozilla has not flagged this extensions or disabled it. Hill is now self-hosting the extension uBlock Origin Lite for Firefox on the GitHub repository. Interested users find it on the releases page as a direct download. Mozilla realizes its blunder, but it seems too late Mozilla contacted Hill a few days later, likely after the thing blew up everywhere, stating that the \"previous decision was incorrect\" and that the extension has been restored. The organization issued an apology for the \"mistake\" and recommended to Hill to reach out whenever he has questions or concerns about a review. Hill decided to go ahead with the plan to self-host the extension. He removed the extension from Mozilla's Add-ons repository as a consequence. When you search for uBlock Origin Lite, you won't get the extension returned anymore. It remains to be seen if the two parties will come closer together again or if this breakup will be permanent. Closing Words Most mistakes in review processes are made by machines. Google, for example, uses automated reviews for the most part, but may also manually review extensions. The process does not keep all malicious extensions out, of which plenty are regularly discovered, but it may also block legitimate extensions or updates. In the case of uBlock Origin Lite, it is unclear how the reviewer came to the conclusion that the extension was in violation of policies. Especially the claim that the extension had no privacy policy, when it clearly had one, sheds no good light on the reviewer and process. Mozilla might want to look at the review process to find out what went wrong exactly to avoid another disaster like it in the future. Did you experience issues with removed apps or extensions in the past due to reviews by the owners of the stores? What is your take on this one? Feel free to leave a comment down below.

Phone numbers are exchanged a lot and repurposed. Most providers/carriers will likely have a do-not-use-for-x-amount-of-time bin to put newly reclaimed numbers in, but after a while, it will always be re-used. hence this kind of issue can happen. In my country there's a place to register to disallow unsolicited marketing and other types of messaging. That's not by number you 'STOP' and hence it won't have such effects. A marketeer/sales company is simply not allowed by law to dial your number for sales/marketing, so they have auto-lookups to that registry to prevent breaching the law. translated, it's the 'do-not-call-me-registry' :D aptly named. it won't stop phishing messages etc., but not much will. if you'd block it from 1 number, they will just use the next number.. reply no_op 5 hours agorootparentThe US has a 'Do Not Call' registry for unsolicited phone calls, but technically doesn't need one for texts because it's illegal to send marketing texts without prior consent in the first place. Thing is, 'consent' often just means failing to notice a checkbox during a signup flow or something, so people end up getting junk anyway. Even more annoyingly, politicians wrote in an exception for themselves. In combination with the way campaign finance works in the US, this means that if you've ever give your number to any political campaign, it will be passed around forever and you'll have multiple politicians begging you for money for months leading up to every election. Each individual campaign/organization seems to respect 'STOP,' but once your number is on an e.g. 'Has ever donated to a Democratic candidate' list, there's seemingly no way to get it off for good.

Since (it sounds like) this is talking about blocking and unblocking the flow of messages from that number, using \"UNSTOP\" (remove the thing blocking it) makes more sense than \"START\"; particularly as the latter seems to imply that you're asking to immediately begin receiving messages, whereas the former simply means to no longer block the messages. reply sim7c00 6 hours agorootparentprevit's because of ungood design reply Tagbert 5 hours agorootparentdouble plus ungood! reply dspillett 6 hours agorootparentprevThere probably is a START instruction internally, but it won't take action against a number for which there has been a previous STOP.

For example, if they are messaging you through Twilio, replying with \"STOP\" will cause Twilio itself to opt you out of messages (https://help.twilio.com/articles/223134027-Twilio-support-fo...), and the sender can't disable that (https://help.twilio.com/articles/360034798533-Getting-Starte...). It's kinda like how Mailchimp handles unsubscriptions for recipients, no matter what the sender wants. However, if they're using some other carrier or rolling their own VOIP setup, etc., or sending from a toll-free number instead of a shortcode, there's no guarantee that their particular platform will honor STOP. And there's no way for you, as a recipient, to know which is which. Generally I will reply STOP if it's something I know I signed up for but no longer want. Things I never signed up for just get reported as spam and I don't reply. reply mikesabat 17 hours agoparentSpeaking mostly for the US here. The STOP keyword is mandated as unsubscribe at the carrier level (Verizon, ATT, TMo) not just the vendor level. So if you reply STOP, it's very likely that you will not receive another message from that number. This will be true for any programmatic SMS vendor. There could be smaller scale & more manual approaches, but that would be rare. There has been a big effort in the last year+ to clean up the space and require consent before any SMS is sent.

Police carried on the interrogation, and the Court ruled that statements he made in that period of time were admissible in securing a conviction against him. When this was appealed, the Louisiana Supreme Court declined to hear it, saying, with a completely straight face, that there was ambiguity, and that since the police could reasonably believe that he was in fact asking for a canine lawyer, i.e. Lawyer McDog, Esquire, and that they couldn't find such an attorney, there was no invocation of counsel that warranted a termination of the interview. reply willcipriano 5 hours agorootparentprev> but the courts really don't like people who don't follow the instructions If you contact me without my consent I now have to follow your instructions to stop your harassment?

So if you reply STOP, it's very likely that you will not receive another message from that number. Is that just for programmatic messages, or all messages? I could see problems if it was all messages. For instance suppose a relative coming to visit for weekend and due to arrive around 5 pm Friday. You get a text from them that afternoon saying that there was an accident that has blocked traffic and police say it will be several hours before the road reopens. They ask if you would prefer that they continue as soon as the road reopens, which will probably mean they will arrive around 1 am Saturday, or stop and spend the night with another relative who lives near where they are currently stuck, and then come Saturday morning which will get them to your place around 9 am.

Political organizations do it all the time, if you get on a list you're never getting off. Lookup the numbers sending to you (Twilio's own lookup tool works great for this) and it almost always comes back Twilio/Zipwhip. I only recommend responding STOP to short codes since there's more investment and vetting on getting a short code. Carriers will intercept the request for TFN/local numbers sometimes but I don't really trust it. These numbers are all going to be spammers buying pools of numbers to churn and burn. They'll just import their list into a new account if it unsubs. Oh and btw, it's actually easier now as a spammer to tell when numbers get burned. A few years back when the CTIA handover on regs happened (and sending costs went up) the carriers finally started to respond with the delivery status of the sent messages. Before this they didn't respond and you only knew your provider delivered the messages to the carrier, not whether the carrier delivered them to the handset. reply danielhughes 8 hours agorootparentI think Twilio requires its customers to go through the process of registering with the CTIA before allowing use of the SMS API.

Since then, I get spammed through the year, and close to a major election, it's dozens of emails and phone calls and text messages every week. Thankfully, Gmail catches 99% of the spam emails and my Pixel phone filters out spam texts and calls. It has a built-in Google Assistant mode that screens unknown callers with a robot voice picking up and asking them to describe what they're calling about. Most of the callers just hang up as soon as they hear that, and if they don't and actually say they're calling about so-and-so candidate, I just click the block button. I tried to switch to iPhone for a few weeks (for iMessage), but the spam problem was SO bad (even with Robocaller and some SMS spam filtering app) that I switched back to Android. Google's spam blocking is phenomenal on the Pixel, but they barely even advertise it. It's an afterthought for them, but a lifesaver for me. My phone would be completely unusable without it. ---------------- In the back of my mind, I keep thinking it'd be cool to have an app that automatically looks up whoever the candidate is running against and automatically donating 10 cents (or however much) to their opponent every time they spam you. \"Hi, it sounds like you're running in District _____ against ______. Because of this spam, I've donated 10 cents to your opponent. So far, this app has donated $1,234 to your opponent because of your messages.

If I do reply \"stop\" to one, of course they will stop from that PAC, but a few days later another one will always pop up and pick right back up.

What does your Go-To-Market strategy look like? ...\"), and they often include 'if you don't want more emails from me, just reply \"remove me.\"'. I assume this is either to create a sunk cost, to validate that the email address works, or to avoid me hitting the Report spam button in GMail. The fact that I'm not replying even after your second attempt should be a strong indicator that I want you to remove me. If you send me three mails, I'll mark your email as spam and block you. reply lincolnq 9 hours agoparentIt's actually because replies boost their email domain's reputation.

I don't see any point in replying STOP to an unsolicited message, if they cared about your consent they wouldn't have sent it unsolicited in the first place. I use Google Fi which marks most of them as spam anyway, and the ones it doesn't I flag as spam so presumably other Fi users will automatically have them routed to spam. reply dehrmann 3 hours agoprevHijacking this a bit, but I'm very annoyed around political texts. Banning them is something 95% of Americans would support, but only 5% of politicians would support it. reply chatmasta 18 hours agoprevNo. Reacting to any unwanted contact just moves you further into their funnel. Ideally don’t even open the text. reply autoexec 2 hours agoparentI agree. It's also worth noting that people have had their devices compromised just by opening a text message (for that matter iphones have been hacked just by receiving an invisible text) so it's probably best to delete any spam text unread. reply epcoa 18 hours agoparentprevHow does one “open a text”? reply chatmasta 17 hours agorootparentDepends on the platform, but generally speaking it requires taking whatever action changes its status from \"unread\" to \"read.\" But even then, there has been at least one case of iOS malware that infected the system upon delivery of a text (since BlastDoor parsed the payload upon receipt, IIRC). That's one reason why Lockdown Mode rejects any text from unknown numbers. reply 1_1xdev1 14 hours agorootparentprevHow does one “open an email” Same thing Your messaging client may helpfully request the url they sent you to show a url preview. In an email, your client renders the html including img tags (yes, this can be disabled, and may not even be default for most people anymore; it’s still a thing) reply mikesabat 17 hours agorootparentprevText messages don't have an \"open\" action. Replying STOP will unsubscribe the recipient from future SMS from this number. I have never seen an organization use an unsubscribe as a positive action in their funnel.

URL previews are loaded on message open. A network request to the url they sent you. They know when you opened it Unless the behavior has changed (maybe it has)? reply eddyg 9 hours agorootparentPreviews are generated by the sender. The only network requests for the receiver are to Apple. Quoting from a January 2021 Project Zero blog post⁽¹⁾ on BlastDoor: As an example, consider what happens when a user sends a link to a website over iMessage. In that case, the sending device will first render a preview of the webpage and collect some metadata about it (such as the title and page description), then pack those fields into an NSKeyedArchiver archive. This archive is then encrypted with a temporary key and uploaded to the iCloud servers. Finally, the link as well as the decryption key are sent to the receiver as part of the iMessage. In order to create a useful user notification about the incoming iMessage, this data has to be processed by the receiver on a 0-click code path. As that again involves a fair amount of complexity, it is also done inside BlastDoor: after receiving the BlastDoor reply from above and realizing that the message contains an attachment, imagent first instructs IMTransferAgent to download and decrypt the iCloud attachment. ⁽¹⁾ https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/01/a-look-at-ime... reply 71bw 9 hours agorootparentKeyword: over iMessage.

That's still true for both email and text messages. Just opening text messages can infect your phone too. In one case, iphone users didn't even have to open the message (https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/apple-zero-cl...). There have been similar problems with outlook allowing unread email to infect a device (https://www.csoonline.com/article/3486789/microsoft-outlook-...)

If it's a company/organization that you've done business with, and they got your phone number through legitimate means, replying STOP will unsubscribe you, just like clicking unsubscribe in the email will simply unsubscribe you. Folks saying that the amount of political spam they got after replying STOP to a political message went up, probably submitted their phone number to more organizations than they realized. If it's actual spam (Which in my experience, is more often email-to-sms from Gmail, not actual texting spam) then of course that doesn't work. Unfortunately this is a situation where you just have to use your brain. Oh, and I'm not convinced \"report spam\" does anything. reply benoau 11 hours agoprevI don't even click unsubscribe links anymore, I just CC straight to my government's spam complaint line and report how my contact information has been misappropriated if I actually provided it, or accuse them of acquiring it without my consent too. reply grantsch 2 hours agoprevI’m shocked at the lack of knowledge here.

Otherwise you indicate to the spammer that you’re a bonafide human, and they’ll even sell that information to others. This applies to picking up calls from numbers you don’t know. Sometimes you’ll hear silence while you repeat “Hello?” and the call drops. That’s just a machine testing to see if you’re a worthwhile target. Instead, let unknown calls go to voicemail. reply mckn1ght 2 hours agoparentThis is exactly what I do, but I wonder if, in the case of calls, whether even letting it go to voicemail also indicates at least the possible presence of a human. If the line were simply unreachable, like those messages you get from the carrier about disconnection, that would be harder proof that the line has no value. Anything else would be signal to keep trying it, right? Are those tests actually waiting to hear the disconnection message?

Is there any verification that something happens when you press it? reply mdasen 3 hours agoparentIt does send the message and number to your carrier (and I think Apple as well). With AT&T, you can also manually forward the messages to the short code 7726 (it spells SPAM), but that functionality is integrated into iOS and Android so you don't need to manually do that. https://about.att.com/pages/cyberaware/ni/blog/forward_7726 AT&T does say that they take action based on the reports, but I think it can be difficult because spammers can rotate through numbers pretty quickly and they don't want to block things based on a few reports. For example, lots of people report marketing email as SPAM, but Google can't just block emails from the Gap that are complying with all the regulations around bulk email and which most receivers aren't reporting as SPAM. But yes, those reports do go somewhere and they do try to take some action based on the reports.

I’ll also do this if a third party has has registered with my email with the service without my consent, since they should have verified it before spamming it, so they still deserve the lost sender reputation. reply godelski 17 hours agoprevFirst off, add yourself to the FCC's do not call list: https://www.donotcall.gov/ Once you've done that, they have 31 days to comply. There's plenty of legal entities that still will call you. If you answer, be polite, play the dope a bit to get the necessary unfortunately, ask how they got the number, then request a manager (yes, they have one, they will tell you they don't. Be polite but insist). When you get the manager politely ask for the company details, then tell them to immediately remove you from their list. Their business can be shut down for violations so once they know you know, they take you seriously (FCC takes reports more seriously when more detailed). They'll probably hang up on you, this is okay. Report them anyways (do this legal or not. They can get their voip removed and whatever shell they're using. It's still annoying for them and they might remove you because you're not worth it) Second, don't answer phone calls. It is a practice to call, listen for a voice, then log that number as active. Text messages are more difficult. It depends on the service but you can probably text stop. The difficulty of blocking is that legit services will use the same number to text you verification codes (can we fucking kill sms 2FA‽) You can also sign up for a relay service (I use Firefox, but use whatever). I do this for email and every website has a unique email. Things like + for Gmail don't work and are filtered. You can also do this for phone numbers but it's more expensive. Fourth, aggressively unsubscribe, report to FCC, change settings on devices, and so on. Do this for your non-tech savvy friends and family. Get them to use services like signal that are privacy preserving, don't leak metadata, AND is easy enough Grandma can use. Install ublock origin into their browsers and some other privacy preserving stuff and edit settings. Get them to use Firefox instead of Chrome if you can. You need to do this to others because they will leak your information (most of my information leak comes from my parents. I even get emails in their names...) If you want to take a step further, get a scrubbing service like optery. There's a lot of shady shit so be careful who you pick. Edit: you can do a similar thing for mail. There is a $5 processing fee. Sucks, but sadly it's junk mail that keeps the post office alive (do not put \"return to sender\" unless it's prepaid.

It's not impossible, but it would be an extremely bad process for an organization to have their OTP and their marketing messages (let alone spammy stuff) on the same short code. There are short codes that are dedicated to OTP. Replying STOP to this number should not affect the ability for you to receive OTP for a different company login. reply AStonesThrow 17 hours agoparentprevThe Do Not Call list does nothing for SMS or anything but voice calls. The Do Not Call list only prevents legitimate companies which are cold-calling you. Do Not Call cannot prevent the scams or criminals, and it cannot prevent anyone who has already established an \"existing business relationship\" including political campaigns and non-profit fundraisers. I've been on DNC for decades and, thankfully I do not receive many bad calls at all, but it's difficult to say how much to attribute to DNC itself. I receive, however, a fair measure of suspicious SMS, real-estate scams, political campaigns both legit and sus, and some pretty slick \"USPS shipping\" RCS phishing messages. Now my Pixel Pro has a lot of spam protections and I need to leave them all completely disabled, because I routinely need to answer inbound voice calls from sketchy numbers, time-sensitive, because they could be a delivery driver or a taxi service. I just never know. The app does tag known spammer numbers, which sometimes turn out legit after all? I consider SMS the worst mode of communication bar-none. It's locked to a single device with a single SIM. They can't be categorized, organized, tagged, forwarded, managed en masse, exported, or anything. To me it's a single-stream jumble of electronic jerks demanding my immediate attention and reactions over a most impersonal medium. I likewise disdain voice calls in many cases, so don't get me started. reply godelski 17 hours agoparentprevIf you're an engineer for Google or Apple the best thing you could do is build into an easy way for users to report to the FCC. It's a routine forum, no ML needed but hey, pitch it if you need that to get this shit done. If you work somewhere that is spamming and enshitified, the way to convince your boss is to show them that their domains are being blocked and that leads to less money. That's the language they understand. They don't understand metrics (that's how we got here in the first place. So don't get technical!) reply tzs 7 hours agorootparentUnfortunately if you make reporting too easy whoever processes the reports will have to deal with a whole lot of false positives. A lot of people seem to confuse spam and non-spam that they just happen to not be interested in at the moment. For example if you sell things on the web people will come to your site, add items to your cart, go to your checkout page, enter their email, pay, and then when they receive an emailed receipt mark it spam. Heck, I've seen people who ask for help by sending email to a support email address, and then mark the automatic reply from the ticketing system that lets them know their request has been received and tells them how long it will take before someone gets back to them as spam. I've also seen people complain that a company wasn't responding to their emails to support, when in fact the company is responding but the person had marked earlier receipt emails or emails letting them no that their subscription that they had opted into auto-renew for was going to renew soon as spam. Note: in all the examples above I'm talking about companies that do not send marketing emails except to people who go to a separate page that is explicitly for signing up for newsletters. The only emails sent to the person where receipts, re-bill notices, and responses to mails the person had sent. reply godelski 1 hour agorootparentThere's a lot of people, so a lot of false positives is certainly true. The question is percentage. There's probably better ways to do things but I don't think we should just give up before we begin. Clearly spammers are abusing the systems at play and they're hard to track. So if a bunch of hay comes with your shipment of needles, it is better than getting no needles. Though that isn't to say we shouldn't try to reduce the hay and that there aren't a lot of avenues that this can be done. reply blackeyeblitzar 16 hours agoprevDon’t reply - that can be used to confirm your number is real. That info is used and resold to spam you even more. Also the STOP keyword works only on some source phone numbers technically. In the US you can report the spam texts by forwarding the message to 7726 (“SPAM” on your keypad) at which point your carrier will text you back and ask for the source number. This doesn’t report the message to the government agencies but just your carrier, so they can hopefully punish the platforms sending spam. Use a site like https://www.freecarrierlookup.com/ to see which carrier or platform sent it, which is useful for the next step of reporting offenders. Now report the incident at the FTC and FCC websites. Do this every single time so it eventually creates difficulties for the platforms enabling this. Mention the carrier or platform carrying the spam. Put in all the details correctly. https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/ https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new If it is an iMessage you should use the built in “report junk” feature. You can also go to the website of the platform that carried the message to report things through their abuse reporting pages, but not all of them are diligent. Some are happy taking money from spammers to abuse you, and will make you keep reporting each phone number that spams you because they do nothing about it except block that one number from contacting you. They won’t fix the underlying root cause of why they have all these illegal abusers as customers. My personal experience is that the vast majority of text spam comes from a few offending text messaging platforms - for example Sinch (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinch_AB) and Bandwidth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_Inc.) for example. These are potentially seemingly commercial platforms for spammers. Note that Sinch owns Mailgun and Mailjet too and has a long documented history of legal trouble due to spamming. Businesses should avoid using these platforms because their own reputation and delivery will be affected by being mixed with spammers. reply seb1204 9 hours agoparentGreat that there is a 'procedure' to follow, how can this be automated?

    "originBody": "Is the World Really Running Out of Sand? October 01, 2024 by Wesley Crump [Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.] If you have to know the answer right away, it’s no; or at least, my goal with this video is to convince you that the world is not running out of sand. But if it were that simple, I wouldn’t be here (right?) and you probably wouldn’t be either. In fact, I was really surprised by some of the things I didn’t know as I dug deeper into the topic further, and how some of the most widely spread sand “facts” are dead wrong. The wide world of sand is complicated, and not in a boring, pedantic kind of way. This simple material touches nearly every part of our lives, and the science and engineering behind it is rich and deep, and to me at least, hard not to become obsessed with. There’s a good chance you’ve seen articles or videos over the past few years with essentially the same story about sand. The “Sand Wars” documentary kind of kicked off the modern discussion, and then Vince Beiser wrote an excellent book on the topic, “The World in a Grain.” Of course, a lot of the book’s best reviews focus on the fact that sand is kind of a topic that’s “taken for granted” or “neglected.” But, at least in civil engineering, it is one of the most glected materials out there. And I’d like to give you a peek behind the curtain and show you how we think about this seemingly unlimited resource and why it’s worth knowing a little more about it. But first, I need to head out to the garage and put some sand in a rock tumbler, because I want to do a material property shootout, and this is going to take a little while. I have something really cool in the other barrel, and I’ll show it to you later on in the video. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering. What the heck is sand anyway? It’s kind of a “know it when you see it”-type material. If we use the US Department of Agriculture’s soil textural triangle, sand is any granular material that is at least 85% sand… So, what the heck is sand? For a better answer, we have the Unified Soil Classification System. Geotechnical engineers sometimes say that “dirt” is a four-letter word. Maybe because it undermines the importance of soil (which is also a four-letter word, by the way), but I like to think it’s because we have better names for all the dirts around the world, and here they are. In fact, there are four specific kinds of sand, but they all fit this one criterion, and it’s all about the size of the particles. At least half of those particles have to make it through a Number 4 sieve (about 5 millimeters), but no more than half can go through a Number 200 sieve (less than a tenth of a millimeter, or about 75 microns). That is a pretty wide range of materials, but I think when you picture sand in your mind, you probably imagine what the USCS would call “clean sand” where less than 12% pass the 200 sieve. So, just to make it simple, let’s say that sand is a material where the particles fit through this, but they don’t fit through this. But still, that encompasses a huge range of different dirts. And I hope, at this point, you’re asking, “Who Cares?” because I would love to answer that question. In his book, Beiser calls sand “the most important solid substance on earth…the literal foundation of modern civilization…” We use it to make glass, semiconductors, fiber optics, filters, and abrasives, use it to texture surfaces, to play in, for beauty, and more. But, probably more than anything else, sand is an essential ingredient in concrete. And, you know, I’m a civil engineer; this is a channel about the built environment; so I wanna talk about concrete. And, in fact, if this video sparks your curiosity about one of my favorite materials, I have a whole playlist of topics I’ve covered in the past so you can learn more after this. You can’t really overstate how important concrete is and how much of it we use. There’s a bigger conversation to be had about its environmental impacts, but when compared to alternative building materials, it just has so much going for it. It is an extremely low-cost, durable substance that can be made into just about any shape you can imagine. Concrete has enabled us to build structures that last for generations from some very simple ingredients that are (mostly) available across the world: water, cement, gravel, and sand. Most of those ingredients are mined and used directly as raw materials. And they’re usually mined close by. Transportation makes up a big part of the cost associated with sands used for construction, so the distance between where they’re found and where they need to go is highly correlated with how economical they can be. And that often leads to environmental impacts, some worse than others, depending on local regulations. It turns out that the best sand for concrete often comes from rivers, and mining in rivers can be particularly destructive because the impacts can spread upstream and downstream through changes in the nature of the channel. (I have a series of videos on that topic, too, by the way). Sand isn’t spread evenly throughout the world, and it’s a non-renewable resource. Geologic processes produce it a lot slower than we can use it. So, it makes some intuitive sense to say that we could eventually run out. But here’s a fact that is often overlooked in the discussion: we can make sand. And it’s not that complicated, either. I talked about the definition of sand a little earlier, but here’s another one: it’s just very small rocks. And we have engineered machines that can transform big rocks into small ones. In fact, I have such a machine in my garage. It’s called a hammer. Some might argue that this isn’t the best use of my time, but I spent about an hour to artisanally manufacture a batch of sand just to hammer this point home. First, you crush the rocks. Then you put them through the sieves to remove the stuff that’s too big or too small. It takes a little extra processing, but this is not grain surgery. And this has a lot of benefits compared to sourcing natural sand. Hard rock quarries and crushing operations are already out there producing coarse aggregates like gravel, so sometimes the smaller stuff is a waste product anyway. It opens up possibilities when natural deposits aren’t available and can move mining operations upland, away from rivers, where the environmental impacts are less severe. And, it can make the concrete stronger. Let me show you what I mean. I took some sand out of my kids’ sandbox and put it in a rock tumbler for a week to try and simulate the erosion it might see over years in windswept dunes of a desert. Obviously, this erosion reduced the overall size of the particles. So, I classified both materials with the sieves to make them a closer match for a fair comparison. And both batches are within the spec for concrete sand in the US. Looking in the microscope, you can clearly see the differences. The tumbled sand is rounded with roughly spherical, smooth grains. The manufactured sand is jagged with sharp, angular corners. And watch what happens when I pile them up. I filled up two pieces of pipe with the same amount of sand, and then pulled the pipe away. It’s not a huge difference, but you can see the rounded sand spreads out a little further because the particles have less friction. It makes intuitive sense that concrete made from this sand would be weaker than with this sand. Let’s see if that’s true. I mixed up a simple batch of concrete from the crushed sand, and the tumbled sand keeping the weights of all the ingredients equal. Here’s my recipe if you want to try this experiment yourself. Then I molded some concrete cylinders and let them cure for a week. Most concrete mixes are meant to reach their design strength after 28 days, but concrete strength gain is fairly predictable, so the relative difference between the samples should be consistent in time. Most importantly, my little benchtop hydraulic press would not be able to break these samples if I waited that long. And this load cell is not calibrated, so I’m doing this test in arbitrary Practical Engineering units of force. The tumbled sand cylinder broke at around 2500 units. And the manufactured sand concrete broke at 7500 units. You can easily see the difference in the results. “Goodnight!” It was 3 times as strong. Of course, this is my garage, not a testing lab, and I only did one sample because my arm got tired of hammering rocks. Luckily, people much smarter than me have tested this out, and the results are pretty conclusive that, if you keep everything the same, the angularity of fine aggregate increases the strength of concrete. And that’s the story you probably know if you’ve read anything on this topic. It’s the common explanation for why we don’t use dune sand, the most visible of earth’s sand resources, in concrete. It’s intuitive. Rounded grains don’t lock together. Beiser makes the claim not once but three times in his book. But it turns out it’s not that simple, because strength isn’t the only property of concrete that we care about. Before concrete has to be strong, it has to be placed. Ask anyone who’s done this kind of work, and they’ll tell you it’s hard. Well, it’s liquid at first, but it’s hard to work with. Concrete is about two-and-a-half times the density of water. It’s heavy stuff, and to get it into the forms often can require a lot of different tools: wheelbarrows, buggies, chutes, pumps, hoses, and more. The better the concrete flows, the easier it is to do a good job of placing it. And that matters. If a mix is too stiff, it can clog up hoses, trap air bubbles, and ultimately lead to poor quality in the installed product. This property of concrete is usually called workability. It’s often measured using a slump test. Fill up a cone of concrete, pull the cone away, and see how far the concrete slumps. But the problem with workability is that, in one big way, it works against strength. And it all has to do with water. What happens when the concrete truck shows up to your job site and the mix is too stiff? Depends on if the engineer is there or not, but in a lot of cases, you just tell the driver to add a few gallons of water to the mix. More water; better flow; easier to place. It’s pretty straightforward, but there’s a reason you don’t want the engineer to know: water decreases concrete strength. I’ve done a whole video about this with some garage demos, so again, check that out if you want to learn more. The gist is that the ratio of water to cement is one of the most important factors determining concrete's strength when it cures. Cement isn’t like some types of glue that harden as the water or solvent evaporates. It goes through a chemical reaction, incorporating the water into the final product. That’s why we say concrete “cures” instead of “dries”. But, cement can only react with around 35 percent of its weight in water, so any more than that is just taking up volume in the mix that could be used by the stronger ingredients. More water; less strong. And here’s where the shape of the sand grains comes into play. I did a little garage slump test to gauge the workability of those two mixes I made for the earlier demonstration. Here’s the rounded sand mix… and here’s the manufactured sand. “Haha, no slump at all.” Honestly I expected this to be a subtle difference, but it was like night and day. They weren’t even close. So I wondered, what would happen if, instead of holding ingredient ratios constant, I used the workability as the controlled variable? Let’s find out. First I used the manufactured sand with enough water to get it to a workable level. 100 milliliters got it to here, which is a bit better than the first one. Then I did a second mix with the tumbled sand, slowly adding water and running the slump test until it was pretty close. It took only 70 ml of water to make them match, 30% less than the first batch. After a week, I tested the samples. The tumbled sand sample broke at 4,800 units. And the manufactured sand broke at only 4,300 units. The tumbled sand with the rounder grains was stronger this time (by about ten percent), and it’s all due to the lower water content in the mix. So yes, if you use the same amount of water, more angular sand like you might find from a river or manufactured sand is better, but that’s not what happens in real construction. I say this with many, many caveats, but very generally, you only add as much water as you need for workability. Rounded sand gives you better workability, so you can add less water, and thus get stronger concrete. This idea that we can’t use wind-blown sands in concrete because of their shape is a myth. In fact, the American Concrete Institute has a bulletin that says it better than I can: “The influence of fine aggregate shape and texture on the strength of hardened concrete is almost entirely related to the resulting water-to-cement ratio of the concrete…” I tried to track down the original source of this idea that we can’t use rounded grains in concrete, but got nowhere. Beiser cites an article from the UN, which itself cites a 2006 paper about using two types of desert sand from China in concrete. But that paper doesn’t mention the roundness of the particles at all. They didn’t include any measure of the shape of the grains in their study, and they didn’t make any suggestions about how that particular property of the desert sand may have affected the results of their tests. In fact, the conclusion of that paper includes saying that desert sand is a feasible alternative to other types of fine aggregates used in concrete. And the whole reason it was a subject of scientific study at all has to do with size, not shape. This is a widely used specification for the distribution of particle sizes of fine aggregate for concrete. Any sand in this area meets the spec. And here’s the soil used in that paper. Even if the conclusion was that it doesn’t work, I think this would have a lot more to do with the results than the shape of the particles. And that really gets to the heart of this whole discussion. Fine aggregates are found throughout the world. We can even make our own. And concrete is like baking; different ingredients can change the end results. But just like regional bread recipes evolved based on the availability of local ingredients, the construction industry has developed a lot of ways to use different local materials to achieve good structural properties. The real challenge, like many things in engineering, is cost. It can be more expensive to manufacture sand compared to mining raw materials that can be put directly in a mix, especially when you factor in the other ingredients, like chemical admixtures, that might be required to make it more workable without adding too much water. It’s expensive to transport better quality sand from far away, rather than finding it close to a job site or batch plant. It’s expensive to mine sand in adherence to environmental regulations that are becoming stricter worldwide. It’s catchy to say there’s a scarcity of fine aggregates on earth, but I think it’s misleading. “Sand is getting a lot more expensive than it used to be” just doesn’t make as nice of a headline. And the tricky part is that, in many ways, those costs have always been there; we’ve just externalized them onto the environment and our future. All the ingredients in concrete are mined or harvested just like other natural resources. It’s just that concrete is made on a scale that blows most other materials out of the water. It’s a huge business, and there’s lots of money flowing, which means a lot of potential environmental harm and social conflict as a result. That’s especially true in places that don’t have robust oversight and enforcement of how sand is extracted. And I think it’s important to point out that the low-cost of sand, because of its simplicity as a material and its abundance, is a big part of why we use so much concrete in the first place, even in situations where it’s not necessarily the best material choice in other respects. Everything in engineering is a tradeoff, and if the economics around sand change, the engineering and construction industries can change with them. Look at other examples of this. Diamond used to be exclusively a mined material, but now we can make it in a lab. Synthetic diamond gemstones used in jewelry are now less expensive than mined diamonds, but, admittedly, there’s a lot more to that economy than the costs to make them. What I think is more interesting is that 99 percent of diamond used in the world for industrial purposes is synthetic. It used to be a rare mineral, but now you can pick up a diamond drill bit or saw blade from the hardware store for a fairly small premium. Timber is another example. Natural forests used to be the only source, but now plantations, trees planted specifically for harvest, now make up more than a third of the wood we use globally. And engineered lumber like plywood, OSB, and structural composites can make more efficient use of raw materials. I’m pointing out these examples, not to say they’re good or bad - there are pros and cons in both cases - but just to illustrate how our demand for materials in the construction industry changes with the supply, and how technology can have a huge impact on that. And there’s another parallel between timber and sand: they both can be renewable. I had another barrel in the rock tumbler not going to use, so I broke up some chunks of concrete and threw them in. I ran these through the grits, just like you would with any other rock in a tumbler. Concrete is pretty soft compared to most natural rocks, so it didn’t polish up that nicely, but the result is still pretty cool. You can really see the constituent materials of the concrete after it spent so long rolling around in there: the small and large aggregates and the cement paste locking them together. But the point of this demo is that concrete is pretty much just rock, that’s mostly what it’s made of in the first place. And just like the rocks I crushed to create manufactured sand, concrete can be recycled into aggregates that get reused in the construction industry, either in new concrete or other materials, reducing demand for virgin sources. There’s a lot changing in the construction industry, and a lot of growth in the need for materials like sand and gravel. But I don’t think it’s fair to say the world is running out of those materials. We’re just more aware of all the costs involved in procuring them, and hopefully taking more account for how they affect our future and the environment. October 01, 2024 /Wesley Crump",

    "originBody": "National A tiny town just got slammed by Helene. It could massively disrupt the tech industry Updated October 1, 202411:30 AM ET Originally published September 30, 20243:32 PM ET By Geoff Brumfiel , Scott Neuman , Camila Domonoske Hurricane Helene dropped more than 2 feet of rain on Spruce Pine, N.C. The town is home to one of the world's only sources of high-purity quartz, which is used to manufacture silicon chips and solar panels. Spencer Bost hide caption toggle caption Spencer Bost A tiny town in North Carolina that’s just been devastated by hurricane Helene could end up severely disrupting the global supply chain for microchips and solar panels. Nestled in the Appalachian mountains, the community of Spruce Pine, population 2,194, is known for its hiking, local artists and as America’s sole source of high-purity quartz. Helene dumped more than 2 feet of rain on the town, destroying roads, shops and cutting power and water. From Blue Ridge Public Radio: The latest from Western North Carolina on Helene damage and recovery But its reach will likely be felt far beyond the small community. Sponsor Message Semiconductors are the brains of every computer-chip-enabled device, and solar panels are a key part of the global push to combat climate change. To make both semiconductors and solar panels, companies need crucibles and other equipment that both can withstand extraordinarily high heat and be kept absolutely clean. One material fits the bill: quartz. Pure quartz. Quartz that comes, overwhelmingly, from Spruce Pine. “As far as we know, there’s only a few places in the world that have ultra-high-quality quartz,” according to Ed Conway, author of Material World: The Six Raw Materials That Shape Modern Civilization. Russia and Brazil also supply high-quality quartz, he says, but “Spruce Pine has far and away the [largest amount] and highest quality.” Conway says without super-pure quartz for the crucibles, which can often be used only a single time, it would be impossible to produce most semiconductors. “Purity really does matter,” he says. “You're talking about a process to create the silicon wafers that later become silicon chips, where one single atom being in the wrong place” could derail production. Companies have been pursuing artificial substitutes, but so far, those alternatives can't satisfy the world’s demand for this pure quartz. Help Wanted: Where Are The Workers? America's security may depend on critical minerals. But mine workers are scarce According to an annual report from TECHCET, a market research firm, quartz equipment is a $2.12 billion industry and growing. What's unfolding in Spruce Pine isn't just a local emergency. Like many climate disasters, it has economic costs that could ripple around the world. Helene devastates town Spruce Pine received 24.12 inches of rain from Helene, according to the National Weather Service. The massive inundation caused the North Toe River to flood, devastating the downtown area, according to Spencer Bost, the executive director of Downtown Spruce Pine, the local business development association. Sponsor Message “It’s flooded up to the awnings, about 10 feet,” he says of the downtown’s lower street. “Lower street was destroyed.” The town’s grocery store was also heavily damaged in the flooding. Power, water and cellular service are all down, Bost says. Fallen trees and washed-out roads have left the community isolated from the outside. “We were there for about three days before we got enough chainsaws together to cut a path out of our neighborhood,” Bost says. He and his fiancée spent nine hours working their way to Greenville, N.C., where they’ve temporarily sought shelter. The conditions at the mines that produce the quartz remain unclear. \"Operations at our facilities were stopped on September 26th in preparation of the event and we have no visibility on when they will restart,\" May Kristin Haugen of the Quartz Corporation told NPR in a statement. A technician holds a silicon wafer. Industry experts say super-pure quartz is essential in the production of wafers, and Spruce Pine, N.C., is America’s sole source. Jim Wilson/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Jim Wilson/AFP/Getty Images A second major supplier, Sibelco, based in Antwerp, Belgium, told NPR its operations had also been disrupted since Sept. 26. \"We are working closely with our local team to safely restart operations as soon as we can and are actively coordinating with local authorities and other partners to manage the situation,\" the company said in an e-mailed statement. Images verified by NPR show that even if the mines are intact, getting quartz out of the region may be a challenge. The main CSX rail line in and out of Spruce Pine runs along the North Toe River and has been heavily damaged. The rail line was the primary shipping point for quartz from the mines. Fallout will depend on how long disruption lasts Conway says he believes chipmakers have stocks of ultra-pure quartz that would prevent a short-term supply chain disruption from hobbling production, but he adds that if Spruce Pine remains cut off from the rest of the world for long, it could have a big impact. Sponsor Message Previous disruptions to superconductor supply chains, from earthquakes to fires, have sent ripple effects across the many industries that rely on chips for their products and operations. A 2008 fire at a quartz refinery in Spruce Pine impacted the market. Climate The U.S. needs minerals for green tech. Will Western mines have enough water? Likewise, solar expert Johannes Bernreuter, head of Bernreuter Research says that if a disruption went on for “more than a few weeks,” it would “pose a serious problem for the production” of silicon ingots needed in the photovoltaic, or PV, industry. China is the major producer of solar panels, and it relies heavily on imports of high-quality quartz from Spruce Pine, he says. Lita Shon-Roy, the president and CEO of market research firm TECHCET, has been tracking the supply chain for semiconductors for two decades. She says it’s amazing that the industry hasn’t been more concerned about the vulnerability created from relying on this one region of North Carolina for a crucial material. “Every time I’ve asked in the last two decades, the question always comes back, ‘Well, where else are we supposed to get it?’ “ she says. The United States and China are in a global competition to secure access to raw materials for semiconductors and green technology. Frantic searches are underway for new deposits and new methods, across a range of minerals. But when it comes to pure quartz? “I haven’t heard of any viable sources yet to replace what’s in North Carolina,” Shon-Roy says. NPR's Michael Copley contributed to this report.

The latter is far more pure than this quartz could be, and is produced by a multistage purification process (involving distillation of trichlorosilane) starting with relatively impure metallurgical silicon.

Is it for refining or shaping the plutonium? reply adrian_b 3 hours agorootparentThe crucible is used for holding melted silicon. Any other material for the crucible except quartz would introduce impurities from whatever substance it is made. Quartz is already silicon dioxide. It could introduce only silicon atoms, which do not matter at all, or oxygen atoms, which also do not matter much. The only alternatives to quartz would be other silicon compounds that have a melting point higher than pure silicon, e.g. silicon nitride, but all of them are more expensive than quartz. In the past, besides the crucibles for holding melted silicon, quartz was widely used for the walls of the ovens (typically having the form of a quartz tube) where silicon wafers were heated for various operations, e.g. for diffusion, and also for the wafer carriers on which the wafers were placed while inside the ovens (a.k.a. \"boats\"). These uses expose the material to lower temperatures than in the crucibles, because the wafers are solid, not melted. Quartz is still used for these purposes, but in many cases it has been replaced with polycrystalline pure silicon, which can resist to these lower temperatures and it also cannot introduce any impurities. In comparison with quartz, polysilicon has the advantages of matched thermal expansion with the silicon wafers and of higher mechanical strength at high temperatures. reply mikeyouse 3 hours agorootparentprevThey melt the high-purity silicon in high-purity quartz crucibles to ensure a single crystal in the resulting product; https://www.mmtc.co.jp/en/products/quartz.html \"Semiconductor devices, the foundation of the semiconductor industry, are manufactured by creating a fine electronic circuit on a silicon wafer made of single-crystal silicon.

High-purity quartz from areas like Spruce Pine typically forms in pegmatites, where slow cooling of magma allows large, defect-free crystals to form. Hydrothermal fluids permeate these rocks while they’re cooling, effectively leaching out impurities. If the geochemistry is just right, over millions of years, this process repeats several times creating very high purity quartz deposits that are very difficult to replicate in laboratory conditions. reply justinclift 15 hours agorootparentAny idea how big these quartz crystals needs to be?

The crucible must be bigger than that. The crucible is made from fused quartz glass. So the mine does not need to have big quartz crystals. They must be only pure. The mined crystals are melted together and processed like any glass, except that processing quartz glass is difficult, due to the very high melting point and the high viscosity of the melted quartz. The melting of the pure quartz requires itself a crucible made from materials that resist to even higher temperatures, e.g. a crucible of molybdenum or even a crucible of iridium, for the lowest contamination with impurities. reply pjc50 9 hours agorootparentprevThe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czochralski_method is the actual big crystal growing process, to which this quartz is just the input.

I think there are now three - all on the ring of fire. Then you’ve got stuff like cobalt, which we get at the whim of the DRC, a notoriously stable and functional state.

If I recall correctly, during the 1970s or 1980 there was a critical part of the wafer production process (slicing the crystal into wafers, perhaps?) which relied on highly specialized tooling. As it turns out, a bunch of manufacturers had independently discovered that by far the best source of them was a small company in Japan - unbeknownst to them essentially just one guy and his workshop. So everyone sourced it from him. Which was fine, until he took a holiday for the first time in a decade...

It might not make sense to stockpile raw materials, but stockpiling things with comparatively low storage costs w.r.t. the item cost sometimes makes sense from a capitalist perspective. This assumes the company runs with a long-term perspective in mind, which often isn't the case in western companies that are publicly traded or owned/operated by investment firms. In fairness, governments also frequently fail at accounting for resiliency, even when that's their explicit goal, so perhaps the incapability to account for resiliency goes beyond the economic system. reply p_l 7 hours agorootparentWhat a lot of people (and companies) missed is that Toyota doesn't optimize till there's no slack left, and instead properly run Kanban let's you establish a capacity and slack \"reserve\" in the system.

That's because governments are run by the same braindead efficiency-first mindset these days. It used to be easy to campaign on resiliency back when the USSR still existed - no matter what, all NATO countries had really large armies, months worth of stockpiles of everything from arms and munitions over medical supplies to food. Education was heavily invested in because the countries needed well educated adults to compete with the external threat. Companies kept stockpiles and had detailed disaster recovery plans and drills, not just for natural disasters but also for \"how the fuck do we keep production running when the Red Army is marching towards the border\" and \"how the fuck do we transition from building cars and motorcycles to tanks and fighter planes when the Great War breaks out\". But once the USSR fell and the \"end of history\" was announced [1], all of that resiliency went down the drain - it was expensive after all and neoliberalism / \"starve the beast\" ideologues demanded that the \"inefficiency\" be cut to lower the tax burden on the corporations and the rich... and here we are, our education systems in shambles, companies got screwed left and right when covid hit and supply chains broke, and our societies in shambles as well as the people didn't have much reserves left after decades of wage stagnation and companies didn't either so they laid people off.

It plans to trade under the ticker symbol \"CBRS\" on the Nasdaq. Cerebras had a net loss of $66.6 million in the first six months of 2024 on $136.4 million in sales, according to the filing. It had a net loss of $77.8 million and $8.7 million in sales for the first six months of 2023. Andrew Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Cerebras Systems, speaks at the Collision conference in Toronto on June 20, 2024. Ramsey CardySportsfileCollisionGetty Images Artificial intelligence chip startup Cerebras Systems on Monday filed its prospectus for an initial public offering, with plans to trade under the ticker symbol \"CBRS\" on the Nasdaq. Cerebras competes with Nvidia , whose graphics processing units are the industry's choice for training and running AI models. Cerebras says on its website that its WSE-3 chip comes with more cores and memory than Nvidia's popular H100. It's also a physically larger chip. In addition to selling chips, Cerebras offers cloud-based services that rely on its own computing clusters. Cerebras had a net loss of $66.6 million in the first six months of 2024 on $136.4 million in sales, according to the filing. For the fist six months of 2023, the company had a net loss of $77.8 million and $8.7 million in sales. For the full year of 2023, Cerebras reported a net loss of $127.2 million on revenue of $78.7 million. The company reported a net loss of $50.9 million on $69.8 million in revenue in the second quarter, compared with a $26.2 million loss and $5.7 million in revenue in the same period a year earlier. Operating expenses have increased this year in part because of higher personnel costs to support revenue growth, the company said. AI chips are a growing and crowded market. Cloud providers Amazon , Google and Microsoft have developed their own AI chips. The company said that Group 42, a UAE-based AI firm that counts Microsoft as an investor, accounted for 83% of Cerebras's revenue last year. Cerebras' WSE-3 chip is one example of new silicon from upstarts designed to run and train artificial intelligence. Cerebras Systems In addition to Nvidia, Cerebras cites AMD, Intel, Microsoft and Google as competitors, \"as well as internally developed custom application-specific integrated circuits and a variety of private companies.\" Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company makes the Cerebras chips. Cerebrus warned investors that any possible supply chain disruptions may hurt the company. Cerebras was founded in 2016 and is based in Sunnyvale, California. Andrew Feldman, the startup's co-founder and CEO, sold server startup SeaMicro to AMD for $355 million in 2012. The company said in 2021 that it was valued at over $4 billion in a $250 million funding round.In May, G42 committed to purchasing $1.43 billion in orders from Cerebras before March 2025, according to the filing. G42 currently owns under 5% of Cerebras' Class A shares, and the firm has an option to purchase more depending on how much Cerebras product it buys. The technology IPO market has generally been sparse in 2024, as higher interest rates pushed investors toward profitable assets. Social media app Reddit went public on the New York Stock Exchange in March, and data management software maker Rubrik followed in April. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve pushed ahead with its first rate cut since 2020, prompting gains in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index. Neither Morgan Stanley nor Goldman Sachs, the two leading tech investment banks, are on the deal. Citigroup and Barclays are leading the offering. The biggest investor in Cerebras is venture firm Foundation Capital, followed by Benchmark and Eclipse Ventures. Alpha Wave, Coatue and Altimeter each own at least 5% as well, according to the filing. Other investors include OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim. The only individual who owns 5% or more is Feldman.

    "commentBody": "AI chipmaker Cerebras files for IPO (cnbc.com)208 points by TradingPlaces 20 hours agohidepastfavorite119 comments knowitnone 18 hours agoNVIDIA is pretty established but there's also Intel, AMD, Google to contend with. Sure Cerebras is unique in that they make one large chip out of the entire wafer but nothing prevents these other companies from doing the same thing. Currently they are choosing not to because of wafer economics but if they chose to, Cerebras would pretty much lose their advantage. https://www.servethehome.com/cerebras-wse-3-ai-chip-launched... 56x the size of H100 but only 8x the performance improvement isn't something I would brag about. I expected much higher performance since all processing is on one wafer. Something doesn't add up (I'm no system designer). Also, at $3.13 million per node, one could buy 100 H100s at $30k each (not including system, cooling, cluster, etc). Based on price/performance Cerebras loses IMO. reply fnordpiglet 18 hours agoparentI think the wafer itself isn’t the whole deal. If you watch their videos and read the link you posted the wafer size allows them to stack them in a block with integrated power and cooling at a higher density than blades and attach enormous amounts of memory. Not including the system, cooling, cluster, etc seems like a relatively unfair comparison too given the node includes all of those things - which are very expensive when considering enterprise grade data center hardware. I don’t think their value add is simple “single wafer” with all other variables the same. In fact I think the block and system that gets the most out of that form factor is the secret sauce and not as easily replicated - especially since the innovations are almost certainly protected by an enormous moat of patents and guarded by a legion of lawyers. reply billconan 18 hours agorootparentCan their system attach memory? from what I read, it doesn't seem to be able to: https://www.reddit.com/r/mlscaling/comments/1csquky/with_waf... reply wmf 17 hours agorootparentI think they do have external memory that they use for training. reply anon291 5 hours agorootparentprevFormer Cerebras engineer. At the time I was there, it could not. reply winwang 17 hours agorootparentprevSurprising. DRAM (and more importantly high-bandwidth DRAM) seems to be scaling significantly better than SRAM -- and I'm not sure if that could be seriously expected to shift. reply 7e 18 hours agorootparentprevAt the end of the day, Cerebras has not submitted any MLPerf results (of which I am aware). That means they are hiding something. Something not very competitive. So, performance is iffy. Density for density sake doesn’t matter since clusters are power limited. reply twothreeone 16 hours agorootparenthttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/cerebras-launches-world-faste... reply rajnathani 12 hours agorootparentNothing for the training part of MLPerf's benchmark. If they're competing just on inference, then they have stiff competition from specialized NPU-for-inference makers like Hailo (see: it's even part of the official Raspberry Pi AI kit), Qualcomm, tons of other players, and also some players using optics instead of electrons for inference such as Lightmatter, and also SIMD on highly abundant CPU servers which are never in shortage unlike GPUs (and have recently gotten support for specialized inference ops besides simply SIMD ones). reply 7e 3 hours agorootparentprevThis isn't a benchmark, it's a press release. MLPerf has an inference component so they could have released numbers, but they chose not to. At the end of the day it's all about performance per dollar/TCO, too, not just raw perf. A standardized benchmark helps to evaluate that. My guess is that they neglected the software component (hardware guys always disdain software) and have to bend over backwards to get their hardware to run specific models (and only those specific models) well. Or potentially common models don't run well because their cross-chip interconnect is too slow. reply KeplerBoy 11 hours agorootparentprevI guess it's a software problem. Without optimized implementations their performance will look like shit, even if their chip were years ahead of the competition. Building efficient implementations with an immature ecosystem and toolchain doesn't sound like a good time. But yeah, huge red flag. If they can't get their chip to perform there's no hope for customers. reply beng-nl 11 hours agorootparentThis hypothesis is an eerily exact instance of the tinygrad (tinycorp) thesis, along the lines of “nvidia’s chip is better than yours. If you can’t make your software run well on nvidia’s chip, you have no hope of making it run well on your chip, least of all the first version of your chip.” That’s why tinycorp is betting on a simple ML framework (tinygrad, which they develop and make available open source) whose promise is, due to the few operations needed by the framework: it’ll be very easy to get this software to run on a (eg your) new chip and then you can run ML workloads. I’m not a (real) expert in the field but find the reasoning compelling. And it might be a good explanation for the competition for nvidia existing in hardware, but seemingly not in reality (ie including software that does something with it). reply anon291 5 hours agorootparent> That’s why tinycorp is betting on a simple ML framework (tinygrad, which they develop and make available open source) whose promise is, due to the few operations needed by the framework: it’ll be very easy to get this software to run on a (eg your) new chip and then you can run ML workloads. This sounds easy in theory, but in reality, based on current models, the implementations are often tuned to make them work fast on the chip. As an engineer in the ML compiler space, I think this idea of just using small primitives, which comes from the compiler / bytecode world, is not going to yield acceptable performance. reply zozbot234 3 hours agorootparentOften enough, hardware-specific optimizations can be performed automatically by the compiler. On the flip side, depending on a small set of general-purpose primitives makes it easier to apply hardware-agnostic optimization passes to the model architecture. There are many efforts that are ultimately going in this direction, from Google's Tensorflow to the community project Aesara/PyTensor (née Theano) to the MLIR intermediate representation from the LLVM folks. reply KeplerBoy 10 hours agorootparentprevYes, sure. I'm occasionally reading up on what George Hotz is doing with tinygrad and him ranting about AMD hardware certainly has influenced my opinion on non-Nvidia hardware to some degree - even though I take his opinion with a grain of salt, he and his team are clearly encountering some non-trivial issues. I would love to try some of the stuff I do with CUDA on AMD hardware to get some first-hand experience, but it's a though sell: They are not as widely available to rent and telling my boss to order a few GPUs, so we can inspect that potential mess for ourselves is not convincing either. reply artemisart 18 hours agoparentprevCorrection: it's 8x the TFLOPS of a DGX (8 H100), not 1 H100. But it's true that if it stays at $3M it's probably too much and I don't think the memory bottleneck on gpus is large enough to justify this price/performance. reply Tepix 9 hours agorootparentSo, the corrected statement is: \"56x the size of H100 but only 64x the performance improvement\" Doesn't sound too shabby. reply throwup238 18 hours agorootparentprevThe company started in 2015 so I think they are (were?) banking on SRAM scaling better than it has in recent years. reply bee_rider 14 hours agorootparentprevIf you have a problem that you can’t easily split up into 64 chunks, I guess it makes more sense, right? reply jfoster 16 hours agoparentprev> 56x the size of H100 but only 8x the performance improvement isn't something I would brag about. It doesn't sound like it's too bad for a 9 year old company. Nvidia had a 20-year head start. I would expect that they will continue to shrink it and increase performance. At some point, that might become compelling? reply statguy 11 hours agorootparentNvidia is also going to keep improving, so it will be a moving target. reply jfoster 11 hours agorootparentThat's true, but the advantage of having a head start does eventually diminish. They won't catch up to Nvidia in the next couple of years, but they could eventually be a real competitor. reply Zandikar 15 hours agoparentprevComparing a WSE-3 to a H100 without considering the systems they go in or the systems, cooling, networking, etc that supports them means little when doing cost analysis, be it CapEx or TCO. A better (but still flawed) comparison would be a DGX H200 (a cluster of H100's and their essential supporting infra) to a CS-3 (a cluster of WSE-3's and their essential supporting infra in a similar form factor/volume of a DGX H200). Now, is Cerebras going to eventually beat Nvidia or at least compete healthily with Nvidia and other tech titans in the general market or a given lucrative niche of it? No idea. That'd be a cool plot twist, but hard to say. But it's worth acknowledging that investing in a company and buying their products are two entirely separate decisions. Much of silicon valleys success stories are a result of people investing in the potential of what they could become, not because they were already the best on the market, and for nothing else, Cerebras approach is certainly novel and promising. reply pants2 18 hours agoparentprevAgreed, it just seems like Nvidia chips are going to be easier to produce at scale. Cerberas will be limited to a few niche use-cases, like HFT where hedge funds are using LLMs to analyze SEC filings as fast as possible. reply BuckYeah 6 hours agorootparentWhere/how did you learn of the hedge fund usages? reply bee_rider 4 hours agorootparentIf the poster never comes back, I think it is fair to assume it is just a reasonable guess, right? reply dzhiurgis 17 hours agoparentprev> wafer economics What are they? Is this related to defects? Can't they disable parts of defective chip just like other CPUs do? Sounds cheaper than cutting up and packaging chips individually! reply donavanm 16 hours agorootparentProcess development, feature size, and ultimate yield are probably what theyre after. Yes, for the past 30+ years everyone has used a combination of disabling (“fusing”) unused/unreliable logic on the die. In addition everyone also “bins” the chips from the same wafer to different SKUs based on stable clock speed, available/fused components, test results, etc. This can be very effective in increasing yield and salable parts. My recollection is that theres speculation cerebras is building in significant duplicate features to account for defects. They cant “bin” their wafers in the same way as packaged chips. That will reduce total yield/utilization of the surface area. The actual packaging steps are relatively low tech/cost compared to the semiconductor manufacturing. Theyre commonly outsourced somwhere like malaysia or thailand. reply yieldcrv 18 hours agoparentprevthey don’t need an advantage, they just need orders and inventory get extorted by nvidia sales people for a 2026 delivery date that gets pushed out if you say anything about it or decline cloud services or another provider delivering earlier thats what the market wants, and even then, who cares? this company is trying to IPO at whay valuation? this article didnt say but the last valuation was like $1.5bn? so you mean a 300x of delta between this and Nvidia’s valuation if these guys get a handful of orders? ok reply rwmj 8 hours agorootparentAt the end of the day it's all made in the same factory. If nVidia have problems delivering then so do Cerebras. reply hulitu 12 hours agoparentprev> Sure Cerebras is unique in that they make one large chip out of the entire wafer I'm sure tgey test it thoroughly. /s reply tempusalaria 19 hours agoprevOn the one hand, the financials are terrible for an IPO in this market. On the other, Nvidia is worth 3trn so they can sell a pretty good dream of what success looks like to investors. Personally I would expect them to get a valuation well about the 4bln from the 2021 round, despite the financials not coming close to justifying it. reply imdoxxingme 7 hours agoparentSaying the financials are terrible is a bit of a stretch. Rapidly growing revenue, decreasing loss/share and a loss/share similar to other companies that IPO'ed this year. The more concerning thing is just not having diversity of revenue, since most of it comes from G42. reply parentheses 1 hour agorootparentHas G42 shipped any working AI models? reply imdoxxingme 3 minutes agorootparentarabic and hindi LLMs. https://www.g42.ai/resources/news/meet-jais-worlds-most-adva... https://www.g42.ai/resources/news/g42-unveils-nanda-new-hind... reply m00x 11 hours agoparentprevIPOs are coming back.

You also get a better sharp if you take some money off the table in the form of leverage and put it in other firms within the industry. E.G. Leveraging your NVDA shares and buying Cerebras. reply JumpCrisscross 12 hours agorootparent> take some money off the table in the form of leverage and put it in other firms within the industry. E.G. Leveraging your NVDA shares and buying Cerebras Please don't do this. Sell your Nvidia shares and rebalance to Cerebras, whatever. But financially leveraging a high-multiple play to buy a correlated asset (which is also high multiple) is begging for a margin call. You may wind up having been right. But leverage forces you to be right and on time. reply short_sells_poo 8 hours agorootparentYou are so on point! A huge number of amateur investors get obliterated on this. Your call may be right, but that's no help if you don't survive to see it realized. You may have a hugely profitable idea that could realize crazy gains over a 5 year horizon, but if you get margin called and liquidated in year 3, you'll end up with nothing. The magic of investment is compound returns, not crazy leverage. Take some of the crazy Nvidia profits and reinvest it elsewhere where you expect geometric growth. Keep things decently diversified. reply fancyfredbot 11 hours agoprevThe only way for Cereberas to actually succeed in the market is to raise funds. They need better software, better developer relations, and better hardware too. It's a gamble, but if they can raise enough money then there's a chance of success, whereas if they can't it's pretty hopeless. reply alecco 9 hours agoprevIf Cerebras keeps improving it will be a decent contender to Nvidia. Nvidia VRAM-SRAM is a bottleneck. For just inference, it needs to download a model at least once per token (divided by batch size). The bottleneck is not Tensor Cores but memory transfers. They say it themselves. Cerebras fixes that (at a cost of software complexity and narrower target solution). reply GeorgeTirebiter 19 hours agoprevCerebras is well-known in the AI chip market. They make chips that are an entire wafer. https://spectrum.ieee.org/cerebras-chip-cs3 reply throwup238 19 hours agoparentCerebrus made a great (now deleted) video on the whole computer hosting the wafer: https://web.archive.org/web/20230812020202/https://www.youtu...

And especially don't tell them to start looking into who \"sovereign clouds\" actually are! reply tonetegeatinst 18 hours agoparentprevI'd bet that making a chip the size of the waver has the benefit on not losing any silicon to dicing the wafer up like a desktop or GPU chips coming from a wafer. Major downside is you need to either have a massive x and Y exposure size or break the wafer into smaller exposures which means your still needing to focus on alignment between the steps, and if a defect can't be corrected then is that wafer just scrap? reply throwup238 18 hours agorootparentThey fuse off sections of the wafer with defects just like other manufacturers do in monolithic CPUs (as opposed to chiplets like AMD). reply bigmattystyles 19 hours agoparentprevHow does one cool that!?

Perhaps less concerning since it's a hardware startup? Nah, nvm, I think this will end up cratered within 3 years. reply Nokinside 9 hours agoprevThey use the whole wafer for a chip (wafer scale). The WSE-3 chip is optimized for sparse linear algebra ops, used 5nm TSMC process. Their idea is to have 44 GB SRAM per chip. SRAM is _very_expensive_ compared to DRAM (about two orders of magnitude). It's easy to design larger chip.

That's how lots of things that requite a long lead time and large initial investment get made. It's just a bigger risk for the investors. Tesla IPOed in 2010 after selling only a few hundred Roadsters. reply ggm 17 hours agoprevWafer scale integration has been a thing since wafers. Yet, I almost never read of anyone taking it the full distance to a product. I don't know if it turns out the yield per die per wafer or the associated technology problems were the glitch, but it feels like a good idea which never quite makes it out the door. reply desertrider12 17 hours agoparentThey don't give yield numbers but this says that they get acceptable yields by putting extra cores on the silicon and then routing around the defective ones. https://cerebras.ai/blog/wafer-scale-processors-the-time-has... reply ggm 15 hours agorootparentI found this bit interesting: They worked with TSMC to ensure the off-die areas used for test and other foundry purposes have been more clearly circumscribed so they can use the blanks between the chips for the inter-chip connects. The distances are kept short and they can avoid a lot of encode/decode logic costs associated with how people used to do this: \"The cross scribe line wiring has been developed by Cerebras in partnership with TSMC. TSMC allowed us to use the scribe lines for tens of thousands of wires. We were also allowed to create certain keep-out zones with no TSCM test structures where we could embed Cerebras technology. The short wires (inter-die spacing is less than a millimeter) enable ultra-high bandwidth with low latency. The wire pitch is also comparable to on-die, so we can run the inter-die wires at the same clock as the normal wires, with no expensive serialization/deserialization. The overheads and performance of this homogeneous communication are far more attractive than those of multi-chip systems that involve communication through package boundaries, transceivers, connecters or cables, and communication software interfaces.\" reply mastax 15 hours agorootparentprevI believe I’ve heard them say they have 100% yield.

Not only is what they are doing very challenging, I’ve had some random brokerage house reach out to me multiple times about investing in this IPO. When your IPO process resorts to cold calling I don’t think it’s a good sign. Granted I have some associations with AI startups I don’t think that had anything to do with the outreach from the firm. reply drcode 19 hours agoparentAgreed, it seems like NVIDIA would be happy to make whole-wafer chips if it seemed like a good play. My guess is there are a lot of bespoke limitations that the software has to work around to run on a \"whole wafer\" chip, and even companies that have 99% similar designs to Nvidia already are struggling to deal with software incompatibilities, even with such a tiny difference. reply imdoxxingme 7 hours agoparentprevYou do realize that brokerages earn commissions on selling shares, so why wouldn't they contact people who may be interested? reply ProjectArcturis 4 hours agorootparentThe point is, there are IPO shares available to sell, even to people who have never expressed any interest in the company.

From the article >Cerebras had a net loss of $66.6 million in the first six months of 2024 on $136.4 million in sales, according to the filing. That doesn't sound very good. What makes them think they can compete with Nvidia, and why IPO right now? Are they trying to get government money to make chip fabs like Intel or something? reply hn_throwaway_99 19 hours agoparentYou seemed surprised that this company is having an IPO to actually raise funds for operations and expansion, vs as just an \"exit\" where VCs and other insiders can dump their shares onto the broader public. I might be a bit suspicious if a company in some low-capital-intensive industry was IPOing while unprofitable, but this is chip making. Even if they're not making their own fabs this is still an industry with high capital requirements. We should be thrilled at a company actually using an IPO for its original intended purpose as opposed to some financialization scheme. reply knowitnone 18 hours agorootparentthey don't make chips. they design and contract TSMC to fab the chips. The high capital is in design tools and engineers. reply hn_throwaway_99 18 hours agorootparentThanks - I said that in my comment, but then just realized I had a typo of \"fans\" where it should have said \"Even if they're not making their own fabs...\" reply theogravity 18 hours agorootparentprevDoes this mean that they couldn't find VCs to raise more cash? reply ketzo 16 hours agorootparentVCs offer cash on different terms than the public does. This just means Cerebras believes it can get capital more cheaply (or on otherwise better terms) than it can from VCs. That might mean VCs are turning them down, yeah, but that’s just one of many possible factors into “where do we raise money” reply fakedang 13 hours agorootparentprevCerebras is currently heavily backed by the Emirati government's sovereign wealth fund. reply est31 19 hours agoparentprevNvidia's moat is real but not big enough that one can't surpass it with a lot of engineering. It's not the only company making AI accelerators, and this has been the case for many years already. The first TPU was introduced in 2015. Nvidia has just managed to get a leader position in the race. reply AlotOfReading 19 hours agorootparentSaying it's \"just\" a lot of engineering effort to catch up isn't wrong, but it understates the reality. There are very few organizations on earth that have the technical and financial resources to meaningfully compete with even small parts of Nvidia's portfolio. Nvidia's products benefit from that breadth of strengths and the volumes they ship. They don't just make accelerators, they'll sell you the hardware too (unlike TPUs). They don't just sell you the hardware, the software ecosystem will work too (unlike AMD or Intel). That hardware won't just do a lot of computations, it'll also have a lot of off-chip memory bandwidth (vs Cerebras or others). Need to embed those capabilities in a device that can't fit a wafer cabinet or a server rack's worth of compute, Nvidia will sell you similar hardware that uses a similar stack, certified for your industry (e.g. automotive). Take any of that away and you're left with a significantly weaker offering. Also they benefit from the priority of paying fabs a lot of money and placing a lot of orders. If anything, Nvidia is less dominant than they should be because they've managed to ensure absolutely no one wants to buy from them when there are viable alternatives. reply kortilla 18 hours agorootparentPeople said the same about Cisco, Intel, IBM etc. It will only be a matter of time for companies to eat into the high margin stuff for specific use-cases and grow from there. reply skeptrune 17 hours agorootparentThere's something weird about the market right now in that all the AI budgets being used to by GPUs are loss-leading. Orgs are treating the spend as a waste anyways, so I suspect they aren't going to be looking to cut costs. Make Cerebras a hard sell imo. reply talldayo 16 hours agorootparentprev> Nvidia's moat is real but not big enough that one can't surpass it with a lot of engineering. Yes, but you also need a lot of capital if you want node parity with them. Nvidia (supposedly) spent an estimated $9 billion dollars getting onto TSMC's 4nm node. https://www.techspot.com/news/93490-nvidia-reportedly-spent-... reply will-burner 19 hours agoparentprev> Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company makes the Cerebras chips. Cerebrus warned investors that any possible supply chain disruptions may hurt the company. They get their chips from the same company that Nvidia does. reply ajb 19 hours agorootparentVirtually any competitors to Nvidia would be in the same position. It's not necessarily to TSMC's advantage for Nvidia to become a monopolist either, although they wouldn't be totally dependent on Nvidia even if they did because TSMC serves every chip market. reply alephnerd 19 hours agorootparentprevThey both contract TSMC to fabricate their chips. The actual design and R&D is still done by Nvidia, Cerebras, AMD, Groq, etc. Think of TSMC like Kinko's - they do printing and fabrication which is very low margins. The main PMF for Cerebras is in simulations, drug discovery, and ofc ML. As I've mentioned before on HN, Public-Private Drug Discovery and NatLab research has been a major driver for HPC over the past 20 years. reply est31 19 hours agorootparentTSMC has a market cap of 0.9T USD. It would be the 7 largest US company by market cap if it were one. Manufacturing chips is extremely profitable, at least in the current climate. It used to be that software is more profitable than hardware, which is more commoditized, but AI gave hardware companies a renaissance of sorts. It's not a simple process at all but requires a lot of engineering and engineers to do it. https://companiesmarketcap.com/usa/largest-companies-in-the-... https://companiesmarketcap.com/tsmc/marketcap/ reply alephnerd 19 hours agorootparent> Manufacturing chips is extremely profitable It only became profitable NOW in the last 2-3 years. Before that, foundry after foundry was shutting down or merging. TSMC, UMC, Samsung, Intel Foundry Services, and GloFlo are the last men standing after the severe contraction in the foundry model in the 2000s-2010s due to it's extremely high upfront costs and lack of moat to prevent commodification. reply extesy 19 hours agorootparentprevTSMC margins are over 30% and growing [1] - that's very far from \"low\". [1] https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSM/taiwan-semicon... reply alephnerd 19 hours agorootparent30% net due to a near monopoly and a recent upswing due to Nvidia. Almost every other foundry system died because of low net margins. Software (and fabless hardware like chip design) is expected to have 60-70% gross margins or the ability to reach that. Semiconductors is part of TMT just like Software or Telecom, and this has an impact on available liquidity. This is why TSMC is heavily subsidized by the Taiwanese government. reply extesy 19 hours agorootparentTSMC is neither software nor fabless. I'm not sure we are talking about the same company, there seems to be some disconnect here. For hardware business 30% margins are high, Apple is one of the most famous exceptions. reply alephnerd 19 hours agorootparent> For hardware business When a foundry wishes to raise capital from the private or public markets, it's bucketed under TMT - which includes software and fabless hardware as well. This means it's almost impossible to raise capital without a near monopoly and/or government support and intervention - which is what Taiwan did for TSMC and UMC - because the upfront costs are too high and the margins are much lower compared to other subsegments in the same sector. This is why industrial subsidizes like the CHIPS act are enacted - to minimize the upfront cost of some very CapEx heavy projects (which almost everything Foundry related is). reply Cyph0n 19 hours agorootparentprev> Think of TSMC like Kinko’s What an amazingly reductive analogy :) reply typon 18 hours agorootparentprevKinko's is not the pinnacle of human engineering - TSMC is.

Press Release ESO telescope captures the most detailed infrared map ever of our Milky Way 26 September 2024 Astronomers have published a gigantic infrared map of the Milky Way containing more than 1.5 billion objects ― the most detailed one ever made. Using the European Southern Observatory’s VISTA telescope, the team monitored the central regions of our Galaxy over more than 13 years. At 500 terabytes of data, this is the largest observational project ever carried out with an ESO telescope. “We made so many discoveries, we have changed the view of our Galaxy forever,” says Dante Minniti, an astrophysicist at Universidad Andrés Bello in Chile who led the overall project. This record-breaking map comprises 200 000 images taken by ESO’s VISTA ― the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy. Located at ESO’s Paranal Observatory in Chile, the telescope’s main purpose is to map large areas of the sky. The team used VISTA’s infrared camera VIRCAM, which can peer through the dust and gas that permeates our galaxy. It is therefore able to see the radiation from the Milky Way’s most hidden places, opening a unique window onto our galactic surroundings. This gigantic dataset [1] covers an area of the sky equivalent to 8600 full moons, and contains about 10 times more objects than a previous map released by the same team back in 2012. It includes newborn stars, which are often embedded in dusty cocoons, and globular clusters –– dense groups of millions of the oldest stars in the Milky Way. Observing infrared light means VISTA can also spot very cold objects, which glow at these wavelengths, like brown dwarfs (‘failed’ stars that do not have sustained nuclear fusion) or free-floating planets that don’t orbit a star. The observations began in 2010 and ended in the first half of 2023, spanning a total of 420 nights. By observing each patch of the sky many times, the team was able to not only determine the locations of these objects, but also track how they move and whether their brightness changes. They charted stars whose luminosity changes periodically that can be used as cosmic rulers for measuring distances [2]. This has given us an accurate 3D view of the inner regions of the Milky Way, which were previously hidden by dust. The researchers also tracked hypervelocity stars — fast-moving stars catapulted from the central region of the Milky Way after a close encounter with the supermassive black hole lurking there. The new map contains data gathered as part of the VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea (VVV) survey [3] and its companion project, the VVV eXtended (VVVX) survey. “The project was a monumental effort, made possible because we were surrounded by a great team,” says Roberto Saito, an astrophysicist at the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina in Brazil and lead author of the paper published today in Astronomy & Astrophysics on the completion of the project. The VVV and VVVX surveys have already led to more than 300 scientific articles. With the surveys now complete, the scientific exploration of the gathered data will continue for decades to come. Meanwhile, ESO’s Paranal Observatory is being prepared for the future: VISTA will be updated with its new instrument 4MOST and ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT) will receive its MOONS instrument. Together, they will provide spectra of millions of the objects surveyed here, with countless discoveries to be expected. Notes [1] The dataset is too large to release as a single image, but the processed data and objects catalogue can be accessed in the ESO Science Portal. [2] One way to measure the distance to a star is by comparing how bright it appears as seen from Earth to how intrinsically bright it is; but the latter is often unknown. Certain types of stars change their brightness periodically, and there is a very strong connection between how quickly they do this and how intrinsically luminous they are. Measuring these fluctuations allows astronomers to work out how luminous these stars are, and therefore how far away they lie. [3] Vía Láctea is the Latin name for the Milky Way.

We design, build and operate world-class observatories on the ground — which astronomers use to tackle exciting questions and spread the fascination of astronomy — and promote international collaboration for astronomy. Established as an intergovernmental organisation in 1962, today ESO is supported by 16 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), along with the host state of Chile and with Australia as a Strategic Partner. ESO’s headquarters and its visitor centre and planetarium, the ESO Supernova, are located close to Munich in Germany, while the Chilean Atacama Desert, a marvellous place with unique conditions to observe the sky, hosts our telescopes. ESO operates three observing sites: La Silla, Paranal and Chajnantor. At Paranal, ESO operates the Very Large Telescope and its Very Large Telescope Interferometer, as well as survey telescopes such as VISTA. Also at Paranal ESO will host and operate the Cherenkov Telescope Array South, the world’s largest and most sensitive gamma-ray observatory. Together with international partners, ESO operates ALMA on Chajnantor, a facility that observes the skies in the millimetre and submillimetre range. At Cerro Armazones, near Paranal, we are building “the world’s biggest eye on the sky” — ESO’s Extremely Large Telescope. From our offices in Santiago, Chile we support our operations in the country and engage with Chilean partners and society.

We don't see something like 99% of the light from stars at the center of our Milky Way Galaxy, because the Great Rift is in the way [0]. This fact is astonishing to me and I can't believe more people don't talk about it. Our night sky would be substantially brighter and more spectacular if not for that rift. But the infrared light gets through and that light can be seen by the ESO telescope.

It is like we are given a glimpse of this insane and terrifyingly beautiful expanse with the knowledge that that's all it will ever amount to. Like a child looking through the glass window at the limitless world outside without any hopes of reaching it while knowing that she will never be able to get out of the house. reply Out_of_Characte 5 hours agoparentNo need for nihilism. Alpha centauri is approximately 4.37 light years away. Project starshot is already aiming to get there. This can take anywhere from 20 to 50 years depending on the mission. We already have a spacecraft from 1977 that is still operating today which proves our potential to build on a 50 year timeframe. We'll likely have humans somewhere in our solar system besides earth before anyone attempts to go to alpha centauri but besides that I also think we would be able to live much longer. Life expectancy increases are around 1% or 0.8% per decade at its current pace. There's no guarantee this continues but even so, if that's the average in the coming decades then we'll expect people to live hundreds of years by the time we can send a ship to alpha centauri. reply vlovich123 5 hours agorootparentSo at 50 years, that requires traveling an average of 10% the speed of light. That’s 150x times faster than the peak speed ever built which got a significant amount of speed from gravitational assists. That’s a massive leap to assume we’ll have craft traveling that fast anytime soon considering the considerable fuel costs involved not to mention relativistic problems that going that fast requires (shielding against interplanetary dust, energy requirements growing exponentially etc). And on top of everything, stopping is a huge question when you’re going that fast so how are you achieving that? Is that fuel you had to accelerate as well? And remember - that’s 150x average speed faster than peak so your actual peak to achieve a speed up followed by a slowdown would need to be even faster. As for voyager, that craft is barely operational in some sense. At 10% and at significantly further distances than ever achieved it would be even harder to keep it operational I think. Let’s be optimistic but let’s live in reality and not unrealistic sci-fi. reply Out_of_Characte 4 hours agorootparentIts not unrealistic sci-fi. We have particle accelerators that operate at much, much higher energies. The kind of energy that would succesfully leave earth and our sun behind if these particles were shot out of the LHC. That is to say, you'd be right that any vessel carrying fuel wouldn't reach such speeds. And while its true that even the smallest sattelites today are still at least 1000grams. Getting that up to relativistic speeds would require on the order of 2 billion MJ of energy. Or the equivalent of a large power plant runnning for 20 days to supply all the energy. But that's only the start, any advancements in making sattelites on a chip could massively reduce the weight and therefore power requirements. Even with all losses accounted for. I believe this could be doable in the next 50 years. You just need to build the most powerful laser anyone has every built and power it for as long as you can. reply vlovich123 2 hours agorootparentYou’ve shifted and redefined the goalposts and even then requires orders of magnitude advancement in multiple areas (power generation, lasers, satellite shrinkage etc) and doing it all in space. Thinking any of this happens in a lifetime of anyone alive today seems unrealistically optimistic. And all of this ignores something critical OP said: > we'll expect people to live hundreds of years by the time we can send a ship to alpha centauri. Even hundreds of years is not a realistic life expectancy to reach the nearest star and requires not just an enormous overabundance of energy, the fuel source has to be available at the midway point so that you can decelerate. Humans at another star without discovery of faster than light travel mechanisms (mainly wormholes) seems purely in the realm of science fiction. reply woopsn 3 hours agorootparentprevOptimistic reality means spreading cellular life, not the great ape in particular. People by and large are uninterested in this, they feel it is pointless if not somehow immoral. Our \"weakness\" is not in the flesh but our attachment to it, specifically, these would-be galaxy childs' personal flesh. The 20-50 year mission duration is not a cure for the nihilism but another expression of it. reply gizmo686 4 hours agorootparentprevProject star shot is still very much s research project at this point, but it seems serious. The idea is to not use self powered rockets, but launch a thousand small solar sail based probes. These would launched into orbit traditionally, then accelerated individually from a massive earth based laser array, solving the rocket equation problem while introducing a host of its own. Many probes will not make the trip, but the hope is enough would survive to do a fly by. reply vlovich123 2 hours agorootparentA fly by at relativistic speeds would be an accomplishment but what data are you realistically capturing? And Wikipedia captures my critique of it accurately: > According to The Economist, at least a dozen off-the-shelf technologies will need to improve by orders of magnitude That’s about right. That kind of orders of magnitude improvement within a lifetime requires novel scientific theories (eg similar to quantum mechanics and the impact it had). Without that growth is drastically slower. And consider that even computational and communication capabilities have basically been maxed out at our current tech level - we’re no longer growing them exponentially due to thermal and physics constraints. It’s an ambitious goal worth doing because of the “if you aim for the moon and miss you still hit the stars” kind of effect. And there’s plenty of directed research that needs to be funded. Thinking any of this happens in our lifetimes is ambitious and spaceships carrying humans going to the stars is fantasy* * as always, completely new physics that upend our knowledge of what’s possible changes the calculus. But those come very rarely and there’s no reason to believe the next revolution will be as impactful as quantum mechanics in terms of impact on our technological capabilities. reply ridgeguy 4 hours agorootparentprevWorse yet (for an equivalent vehicle mass), that's 22,500x (150^2) the energy needed. reply JumpCrisscross 4 hours agorootparentprev> Project starshot Is it a live project?

Wild stuff! reply zesterer 4 hours agorootparentprevAh, that explains why 5,000 years ago the average life expectancy was just over 6 months. reply BobaFloutist 3 hours agorootparentprevHonestly I don't think there's that big of a material difference in difficulty between being able to (consistently) live to 150 and being able to live indefinitely (barring catastrophic accidents and intractable diseases). I feel like we're bumping up against the edges of the lifespan that we can reasonably achieve without figuring out how to actually stop or reverse aging. Possibly there's a world where we figure out how to dramatically slow it without stopping it, because there's some entropic principle regarding our ability to reliably lengthen telomeres where we can't replace lost data but we can reduce the rate of loss, but my money's that we don't break 150 until we actually solve aging on a fundamental level. reply afh1 5 hours agoparentprevUnlike a grassy field in a sunny Earth day, space is cold, dark, deprived of oxygen and bombarded by radiation, and the few rocks that exist in the vast void of nothingness are pretty much just lifeless rocks. So yeah, enjoy our house, it's pretty neat here. It would be cool to explore this dark desert, but it's not hard to find happiness inside if you try. reply mway 5 hours agoparentprevMortality can be a tough thing to accept. But, if it helps, just know that it is always a spectrum - it is never binary - in that everything has an end (as far as we, and our physical/cosmological models, can understand). We've got it better than pretty much every other type of animal life on earth (with a few exceptions) - insects or our pets, for example - so while we might not have \"cosmological endurance\", let's call it, we've still got it pretty good. :) Agreed that it's a shame we can't explore everything, though! reply tiffanyh 5 hours agoparentprevHave you gone to a National Park? (assuming you live in the US) You can get similar amazement here on earth, normally within 1-day drive of where most people live, by just visiting a National Park.

Sure, we will settle surrounding few hundred light years, maybe a thousand in next million years, if we as mankind are extremely lucky, I talk range somewhere 1:1000 to 1:million. Other chance is show or quick death. Beyond that, no real settling, just some probes that will take tens of millenia to come back (or send signal back). Think about all the stuff and beauty we have now, to experience and explore it on our pale blue dot, trivially reachable considering our recent past, and all that will be almost inevitably lost to future generations. Compared to what we have here, stuff in cold hard vacuum or some illusions of beauty pale in comparison (and that comes from a guy who loves astronomy). You can experience it now, in its original form and not some crappy re-creation of good ol' days. Trust me, future generations will be wishing for many reasons to be able to live now (at least those healthy). I don't believe we will find some magic above-c transport in Star trek style. Sure, its a nice fantasy and we would love for it being true, but thats not how reality works. Same as some beardy old dude in the clouds fantasy, having for some reason very strict bronze-age morals yet letting billions innocents suffer immeasurably without a care in the world(universe).

Copyright laws were established when it became cheap to \"copy\" creative works, so creativity would continue to be stimulated by guaranteeing rewards for a set time (idea was not to guarantee getting filthy rich, just to make sure creation happens by keeping the authors fairly compensated). Digital \"sales\" are attempts to trick customers into thinking they are buying a copy when they are only getting a license, but this is unrelated to Nintendo killing emulators with an army of lawyers. reply EMIRELADERO 33 minutes agorootparentprev> You can't ignore the entire idea of intellectual property just because you have a physical disc or cartridge in your possession.

The only way to escape that fate would be to maintain proper opsec, stay in the right jurisdiction and not rely on (DMCA sensitive) big tech platforms for the development.

That has never been examined or declared, as the DMCA exemptions are much narrower than they appear. The reverse engineering exemption, for example, does not cover the right to make a product that interfaces with the original - only to examine the technology to build your own product. An obvious example of this is DVDs, which have the same exemptions. The US PTO, and the US Librarian of Congress (who has the power to make DMCA exemptions) are unequivocally clear that a private copying exemption does not exist in their view. This is also why the EFF has been begging every 3 years for the last... two decades... to make such an exemption, and has failed. reply EMIRELADERO 24 minutes agorootparentThe reversing clause doesn't, but the law does. It's \"declared\" specifically in the Act, here: (1)Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), a person who has lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a computer program may circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a particular portion of that program for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and that have not previously been readily available to the person engaging in the circumvention, to the extent any such acts of identification and analysis do not constitute infringement under this title. (2)Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(2) and (b), a person may develop and employ technological means to circumvent a technological measure, or to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure, in order to enable the identification and analysis under paragraph (1), or for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, if such means are necessary to achieve such interoperability, to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title. (3)The information acquired through the acts permitted under paragraph (1), and the means permitted under paragraph (2), may be made available to others if the person referred to in paragraph (1) or (2), as the case may be, provides such information or means solely for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title or violate applicable law other than this section. reply gjsman-1000 20 minutes agorootparentLet's say your interpretation holds water even though I, and the EFF in their handbook [https://www.eff.org/pages/unintended-consequences-fifteen-ye...], and the US legal system just a few months ago [https://www.pearlcohen.com/court-upholds-dmcas-anti-circumve...], do not believe is correct. (It's easy to be an armchair lawyer - if you read the first amendment out of context, threatening to kill someone seems protected.) Nintendo may potentially argue that yes, you are completely right. You have the right to interoperability, in the sense that you are allowed to make a device which physically takes Switch cards, decrypts them, plays them, from the original card, does not copy it to storage media of any kind, and does not allow the user any semblance of a DRM bypass, or any way to resell the original card while maintaining a copy. Interoperability is for building CD players, not CD rippers. EDIT TO REPLY FOR \"POSTING TOO FAST\": Section 117 is very clever, except there's one problem: It was created in 1980, before the DMCA. Thus, if there is a conflict between the DMCA and Section 117, the DMCA is likely to receive the benefit of the doubt. As such, Section 117 is only effective for demonstrating the legality of copying non encrypted programs, or (as an actual lawyer put it), copying a program with the DRM remaining intact, as useless as that is. Combine my point about interoperability in the courtroom + Section 117 likely being overruled by Section 1201 of the later DMCA which is extremely restrictive on bypassing \"technological protection measures\" copied or not, and it's not a clear win. reply EMIRELADERO 7 minutes agorootparentReply to your edit: That's what the first exception in the DMCA itself is for. It provides that: 1. You can manually decrypt DRM'd content if it's software you own a legal copy of and you need to run it. 2. You can make an automated tool that does step 1. 3. You can share that tool with anyone as long as they respect 1. The DMCA DRM clauses only care about that, the DRM itself. Not whether you make a new copy of the content. EMIRELADERO 14 minutes agorootparentprev> Let's say your interpretation holds water even though I, and the EFF in their handbook [https://www.eff.org/pages/unintended-consequences-fifteen-ye...], and the US legal system just a few months ago [https://www.pearlcohen.com/court-upholds-dmcas-anti-circumve...], do not believe is correct.

If someone finds a really good use case then they can scale that with essentially no problems until the vcs are fat and happy. Pouring money into AI garbo also feels like a hedge to investors when they see it as just funneling down to their other investments.

So it wasn't directly grifting or stealing.

But in practice, it’ll become ever so easy to build something similar, and there’ll be numerous free options to choose from. Good enough free options. And quite probably the bigger fish will start buying the smaller, until it naturally becomes a monoculture. All major editors already have free AI extensions, including the legacy ones like Vim. The only subscription you might need is to the LLM. A way better bet would be to make a model over a specific programming language, you’d have unfairly superior end-to-end development quality and performance, plus a niche to cultivate. My opinion is that the age of general models will not last. You will never be able to run the most capable one on current consumer hardware, yet, you will be able to run a specialized model. All in all, it seems like this generation of AI products will be cemented as progress on AI interfacing, that it, the AIs UIs. reply wg0 11 hours agorootparentprevYeah if such a tooling is what you're building, YC is really really great for that.

Also egregious is \"We thought the license in the root repo wasn’t that important, so we just generated one that we thought was open.\" It's hard to trust someone who would think this in the first place. reply beAbU 11 hours agorootparentThey're manipulating the reader into thinking it's their unachievably high moral standards that is to blame here: \"...but that wasn’t good enough\". You can't \"tried to be transparent about what we’d done\" and \"made it look like we were stealing the work\" at the same time. Either you announce yourself as \"Pear, the VS Code Fork that will change the way you code\", or you try to be very low key about it yet hope to retain plausible deniability when people call you on your BS. reply talldayo 16 hours agorootparentprevIt's just such a hollow response. They know exactly what they did, and this apology doesn't obviate any of the problems with their product. Really makes you wonder what YC even looks for in a business these days. They're certainly neglecting their due diligence. reply skybrian 11 hours agorootparentprevThat could go either way. Is there evidence that they “tried to be transparent” or is it a smokescreen? (I don’t know anything about them.) reply zombiwoof 21 hours agorootparentprevI agree. They aren’t sincere. They are only sincere when they get caught by others with morals.

So why didn't they copy the license like they copied the rest of the code? > We thought the license in the root repo wasn’t that important, so we just generated one that we thought was open. Why would the license not be important? And why would they think that the one they generated was open? If they were going to blindly copy and paste from chatgpt, why wouldn't they blindly copy and paste from the original codebase instead, which is already known to be open. Software licenses are a core part of any software company's business model, so I don't believe for a second that these YC-backed founders didn't realize what they were doing. ... With that said, Apache and all other \"OSI approved\" licenses are open to being exploited like this, so I don't think they're necessarily in the wrong.

I suppose they figure they can just buy it out in court appeals or something if someone were to take a grievance up with that. How does Graham, et al justify this lackadaisical attitude... \"You win some you lose some\"? \"It all comes out in the wash\"? I guess if you got masses of money to throw away you don't particular care about the legal ramifications? It's just an entry in the books. How did YC not smell that as a flag, and why should anyone TRUST YC after such a misstep? Or other VCs, not to dish just on YC... How many other situations like this are out there? Are they going to work to verify licenses with all their projects? Or just wait til disaster erupts and someone finds out they done messed up (oh I know the answer based on the SV motto \"ask forgiveness instead of permission\"). I am slightly snarky with my attitude, but this is serious shit, and it matters, because the social contract matters, SV Homo Superior Morality be damned. This is the kind of attitude that leads to bank collapses, because they're so busy huffing greed and damn the consequences. In this case, it's obviously not nearly as catastrophic, but it gets tiring to see this attitude that they get to reap benefits while externalities?

Most Americans are legally naïve. Most founders are, too. A start-up has to make trade-offs--it's far from clear such licensing agreements are make-or-break at the angel or seed stage. Once that's pointed out to you, you hopefully either hire a lawyer or mitigate your legal cross section until you can afford one, e.g. by using template license agreements instead of rolling your own. But until you've been given that feedback, it's not some bizarre conclusion someone can come to. Most small businesses, for example, are formed perfectly well without much legal sophistication. reply Sanzig 18 hours agorootparentTemplate license agreements have been presumably written or reviewed by a contract lawyer somewhere along the line. I certainly wouldn't judge a founding team that chooses to use vetted legal templates - that's a reasonable choice early on when money is better spent on product than expensive lawyer hours. However, using templates is a far cry from asking an LLM to write your agreement and assuming it won't hallucinate something that's going to put you in legal jeopardy. reply JumpCrisscross 13 hours agorootparent> However, using templates is a far cry from asking an LLM to write your agreement and assuming it won't hallucinate something that's going to put you in legal jeopardy Sure. Not disputing it isn’t incredibly stupid.

    "originBody": "Toggle navigation WakaTime Leaderboards Teams Plugins Docs Sign Up Log In All blog posts Bots, so many Bots Oct 01, 2024 Alan Hamlett Engineering 5 min read ProductHunt has over 1 million user signups. More than 60% of those are bots. How it started I’ve used ProductHunt since early 2014. Besides Hacker News, it was a good way to see the latest product launches in tech. Using the comments on products, I could discover similar tools or collect feedback on my own products. Lately though, I’ve noticed most of the comments seem to be generated by ChatGPT. A simple test To test my theory, I launched my own product on ProductHunt but with a simple LLM prompt injection in the product’s description. Sure enough, almost all the comments were automated. Can you spot the bots? Now we see that it’s a waste of time for people launching on ProductHunt to reply to comments. Is launching on ProductHunt even worth it? If so many bots are commenting, they must be upvoting too right? Based on all the emails I receive offering votes for money, some people must be purchasing upvotes. The data To analyze upvotes, I found a publicly available list of all ProductHunt users, launches, upvotes, and comments. ProductHunt has over 1 million user sign ups, over 300 thousand launches, 2.5 million comments, and 20 million upvotes. Each launch also came with the daily rank, which is the rank of the launch after 24 hours from midnight PDT when each new launch day starts. Detecting bot accounts Detecting bots is difficult, especially with only public data. At first, I tried analyzing the times of day of user comments to find trends. For example, here’s one user who signed up 677 days ago, commented 2,009 times and upvoted 4,649 launches. Definitely a power user and using some automation, but probably not a bot (and wasn’t categorized as one). Now look at a bot user’s comments. This user signed up 140 days ago, commented 173 times and upvoted 246 launches. Notice how the bot comments at regular intervals and the chart looks boxy instead of smooth? However, this wasn’t enough to detect bot accounts alone. I assigned each user a risk score based on many different criteria, like account activity duration, upvote patterns over time, and content of comments. Did you know ChatGPT generated comments have a higher frequency of words like game-changer? Bot comments also contained characters not easily typeable, like em-dash. They also commonly included the name and bio word for word from a real person’s LinkedIn profile, but those people said they never created any ProductHunt account. In the end, I detected over 60% of user signups to be automated bot accounts. That’s a conservative number, because I didn’t detect all the bots. It would be a lot easier for ProductHunt themselves to detect bot activity more accurately using insider data. Bot activity over time User signups Since 2018, there have been more bot users created than real users. Comments In late 2022, bot comments really took off... around the same time ChatGPT was first widely available. The spike in 2024 is because over time bot accounts are deleted, I’m not sure if by ProductHunt or by the account owner. Newer accounts are more likely to not have been deleted, so we still have access to their comments. Upvotes Also in 2022, bot upvotes surpassed real votes. These bots form voting rings where makers pay for upvotes to increase their chances of getting into the ProductHunt newsletter. Rankings Most launches get only a few real upvotes. Since bots vote randomly to blend in, the bot trend line is smoother than the real user upvotes. Daily rank First place launches get featured in the daily and weekly ProductHunt newsletter, so let’s see how many bot upvotes the top launches receive. Looks like 15% bot votes is a safe amount to get your product in first place for the day. Anything over 60% bot votes doesn’t seem to make it to first place for some reason. Here’s the same chart limited to launches after 2020, showing bots are accounting for more of the upvotes in top posts lately. Launches paying for upvotes probably aren’t high quality products, so they often rank top 5 instead of first place: Final Thoughts I wanted to create a list of launches without the bot votes, to see if the top launch of the day changes with the bot votes are removed. However, I don’t want to call out launches that didn’t really pay for votes but just happen to have many upvotes from bots, and I don’t want more publicity for the launches that did pay. Either way, I’ve spent too much time on this already so that will have to wait for a possible future blog post. Join the discussion on HN.

I've never made a single comment with it. But 35 attractive women are now following me. Zero men, zero unattractive women. I doubt that it is the result of the animal magnetism of my likes. It's a microcosm of the whole darned web. reply EasyMark 2 hours agoparentI blocked a bunch of those accounts and the number of rando hot girls trying to get me to follow them dropped really quickly. You may give that a try. Maybe they have some very rough algo that does attempt to stop those follow varieties that you block a lot of reply bryanrasmussen 1 hour agorootparentprobably the rando hot girls are all run by the same big bot farms, or bot farms sell suckers lists so if you are a sucker for one rando hot girl bot the others soon find out. reply 93po 2 hours agoparentprevI feel like looking at this sort of behavior would make it really easy to spot bot accounts. I have the same thing happening on my account. reply smileybarry 3 hours agoprevI've said this in another thread here, but Twitter is borderline unusable because of this. I have 5,000+ blocked accounts by now (not exaggerating), and the first few screenfuls of replies are still bots upon bots upon bots. All well-behaved $8-paying netizens, of course. reply cdrini 3 hours agoparentThat's fascinating to me, I've never blocked a single account on Twitter and see very few bots. The most annoying thing about twitter for me are the folks monetising the platform, that keep posting rage-bait to game the algorithm! But note I also generally only use the \"for you\" tab. reply schmidtleonard 2 hours agorootparentYou sure about that? https://youtu.be/WEc5WjufSps?t=193 Dr. Egon Cholakian sends its regards. That is to say, the bots are getting good. LLMs made this technologically easy a few years ago, it would take a couple years to develop and deploy a sophisticated bot network like this (not for you or I, but for an org with real money behind it that timeline is correct) and now we are seeing them start to appear. The video I linked is proof that bots already deployed in the wild can take 40 minutes of dedicated effort from a capable suspicious person to identify with high conviction. Maybe it would have taken you 10, I'm not hear to argue that, but I am here to argue that it is starting to take real effort to identify the best bots and this is the worst they will ever be. I don't care how smart, capable, or suspicious you are, within 3 years it will not be economical for you to curate your list of non-bot contacts on the basis of content (as opposed to identity). reply cdrini 2 hours agorootparentWell on my \"for you\" page, I also follow a pretty niche audience of tech people, which helps :P They're a little easier to verify since they generally also have blogs, or websites, or github accounts, or youtube videos, etc that help verify they're not bots. I also think people create bots for some purpose -- instability, political divisiveness, financial gain, etc. And I'm kind of inherently not using twitter for any of that. I don't think I could find an account on my twitter thread that mentions the word \"liberal\", \"trump\", \"conservative\", or any of that if I tried! I agree that's a muuuuch more likely place to find bots. What sort of bots do you notice the most in your twitter? reply schmidtleonard 1 hour agorootparentYeah I suppose if you are already vetting based on identity from outside the network that probably does scale. Most people aren't as careful about this as you are, though, so it'll still be a problem and it will have to get much worse before it gets better. I'm not on twitter. I left when the tidal wave of right-wing spam started to outweigh the entertainment value of seeing Yann LeCun dunk on Elon Musk. reply akomtu 35 minutes agorootparentprevThat's the Darwin's theory for bots: only the fittest survive on the Twitter lands. reply EasyMark 2 hours agorootparentprevUsing the “for you” tab is the only way to use twitter these days. Their suggest algo is complete garbage. I spent a couple days trying various ways to train it and still I got was complete garbage, so I accepted reality that twitter doesn’t really have an algo for the feed, just a firehouse of crazy people and engagement trolls reply jrhizor 2 hours agorootparentYou mean the \"following\" tab, right? reply blitzar 2 hours agorootparentprev> Using the “for you” tab is the only way to use twitter these days The first 20 posts of my \"for you\" tab is Elon Musk, then it goes on to show me more useful content. I am wondering if following him or blocking him will make any difference. reply kimixa 50 minutes agorootparentprevI have an account I purely use to follow other accounts. I haven't posted anything aside from a \"so, this is twitter then?\" years ago. I get multiple bots requesting to follow me every day, and maybe 10% of my \"for you\" timeline is right-wing political \"discourse\" engagement bots, despite never having followed or interacted with anything similar, aside from slowly increasing my block list when I see them. reply EasyMark 2 hours agoparentprevIf you only use the “following” tab twitter is fine, if you try to use the “for you” tab then you are expecting too much of someone who posts known nazis and says “hmmm…” or “interesting…” reply dewey 3 hours agoparentprevWhy bother if you have to spend that much time curating a good feed? reply smileybarry 3 hours agorootparentUnfortunately it's still the main \"shortform\" social network here for local stuff. Not enough in my country moved to Mastodon or Bluesky. (Referenced HN comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41586643) And no, it's definitely not worth it if you're joining/new enough. Anyone who asks me about Twitter I immediately tell them to not bother and that I'm just \"stuck\" there. My Following feed and most of the algorithmic feed is fine, it's just the replies & interaction that took a huge hit. reply evantbyrne 3 hours agorootparentI'm curious what kind of engagement people who aren't prolific posters are seeing on Twitter these days. Before I left I noticed that engagement went off a cliff to near zero immediately following the aggressive algorithm changes with blue check spam being promoted, but remained normal on my other social channels. It didn't seem like there were any normal people talking with each other on Twitter. reply smileybarry 3 hours agorootparentIt's down there, below the bluecheck promotion. Or in (non-English) circles where the LLM bots haven't proliferated yet, which are also (mostly) why I stuck around. reply EasyMark 2 hours agorootparentI tried using an extension that filters out blue checks and it’s still about 90% garbage from troll accounts who can’t afford $8. The only way is to just follow those who you enjoy, although you’ll likely have to find them outside of twitter, because their useful posts are drowning in a sea of trash reply jjkaczor 3 hours agorootparentprevZero. I post the same things to Mastodon, Threads, BlueSky, and other places and get plenty of engagement. However - because I don't pay for a \"blue checkmark\", that's my best guess as to why I get zero engagement. That's fine - I have always treated Twitter as a \"post-only\", \"fire & forget\" medium. reply imiric 3 hours agoparentprevI haven't used Twitter in ages, but what happened to Musk's paywall idea? That might actually deter bots and real users, so it seems like a win-win for everyone to stop using it. Otherwise, I doubt spammers/scammers are really paying $8/mo for a verified account. How are they getting them then? reply schmidtleonard 2 hours agorootparentGreat, so instead of selling me overpriced intimate shaving accessories the bots will be trying to convince me that Europe will freeze without Russian natural gas. reply vizzier 22 minutes agorootparentI read this comment as a bit tongue in cheek, but to be clear, the aim of the bots isn't generally to advocate for as specific viewpoint but to flood the information landscape with bad information making it challenging for normal people to discern what is real and useful. reply Eddy_Viscosity2 2 hours agoparentprevThere is no twitter, only X. edit: What I meant by this is not the name thing but more fundamentally that what twitter was, is no longer so. It's now a different thing now, its has similarities to twitter, but its not twitter. reply stronglikedan 1 hour agorootparentSeriously. The same people that deadname X would be up in arms about deadnaming other things. reply tomthecreator 3 hours agoprevI wonder the same about HN. Has anyone done this kind of analysis? Me good LLM reply datadrivenangel 3 hours agoparentHN remains good primarily because of the moderators. Thanks Dang! reply imiric 3 hours agorootparentThe mods certainly do a great job of keeping things running smoothly here, but I wouldn't say it's _primarily_ because of them. I think it's primarily due to the self-moderation of the community itself, who flag and downvote posts, follow the community guidelines, and are still overall relatively civil compared to other places. That said, any community can be overrun by an Eternal September event, at which point no moderation or community guidelines can save it. Some veteran members would argue that it's already happened here. I would say we've just been lucky so far that it hasn't. The brutalist UI likely plays a part in that. :) reply conductr 3 hours agorootparentI think it has happened actually. Early on HN was almost purely entrepreneurial although through a tech POV. These days, it’s much more general or broadly tech related. The discussion I gather is most people here are tech employees and not necessarily entrepreneurs. It’s obviously has not gone to hell like the bot ridden examples, but it’s drastically different IMO. reply ffsm8 2 hours agorootparentThe bots aren't completely dominating here yet, because the price/benefit isn't really there yet. Twitter is a source of news for some journalists of varying quality, which gives them a motivation to influence. On HN, who are you going to convince and what for? The only thing that would come to mind would be to convince venture capital to invest in your upstart, but you'd have to keep it up while convincing the owners of the platform that you're not faking it - which is gonna be extra hard as they have all usage data available, making it significantly harder to fly under the radar. Honestly, I just don't see the cost/benefit of spamming HN to change until it gets a lot cheaper so that mentally ill ppl get it into their head that they want to \"win\" a discussion by drowning out everything else reply imiric 2 hours agorootparent> On HN, who are you going to convince and what for? There are plenty of things bots would be useful for here, just as they are on any discussion forum. Mainly, whenever someone wants to steer the discussion away from or towards a certain topic. This could be useful to protect against bad PR, to silence or censor certain topics from the outside by muddying up the discussion, or to influence the general mindset of the community. Many people trust comments that seem to come from an expert, so pretending to be one, or hijacking the account of one, gets your point across much more easily. I wouldn't be so sure that bots aren't already dominating here. It's just that it's frowned upon to discuss such things in the comments section, and we don't really have a way of verifying it in any case. reply pixl97 2 hours agorootparentprev>On HN, who are you going to convince and what for? Eh, following individuals and giving them targeted attacks may well be worth it. There are plenty of tech purchasing managers here that are responsible for hundreds of thousands/millions in product buys. If you can follow their accounts and catch posts where they are interested in some particular technology it's possible you could bid out a reply to it and give a favorable 'native review' for some particular product. reply wickedsight 3 hours agorootparentprevAgreed. There's some Dang good work being done here. Hope he gets rewarded well for it. reply bediger4000 3 hours agorootparentprevWait you mean absolute freedom of speech, countering bad speech with more good speech doesn't work? reply yodon 3 hours agoparentprevReal question for those convinced HN is awash in HN bots: What actual value do you believe there is, other than curiosity, that is driving people to build the HN spam bots you think you're seeing? Karma doesn't help your posts rank higher. There is no concept of \"friends\" or \"network.\" Karma doesn't bring any other value to your account. My personal read is it's just a small steady influx of clueless folks coming over from Reddit and thinking what works there will work here, but I'm interested in your thoughts. reply lompad 3 hours agorootparentHype. HN is _the_ platform to create hype among the early adopter, super-spreader/tech exec kind of people and because of that has an absolutely massive indirect reach. Just look how often PR reps appear here to reply to accusations - they wouldn't bother at all if this was just some random platform like reddit. reply panarky 3 hours agorootparentI'm not convinced HN is awash in bots, but there are certainly some inauthentic accounts here. What if you want to change public opinion about $evilcorp or $evilleader or $evilpolicy? You could explain to people who love contrarian narratives how $evilcorp, $evilleader and $evilpolicy are actually not as bad as mainstreamers believe, and how their competitors and alternatives are actually more evil than most people understand. HN is an inexpensive and mostly frictionless way to run an inception campaign on people who are generally better connected and respected than the typical blue check on X. Their objective probably isn't to accumulate karma because karma is mostly worthless. They really only need enough karma to flag posts contrary to their interests. Even if the flagged posts aren't flagged to death, it doesn't take much to downrank them off the front page. reply duckmysick 2 hours agorootparentprevI've hardly seen here any proselytizers from Oracle, Salesforce, IBM and they are dong just fine. Ditto for Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Facebook - they used to be represented more here, but their exodus hardly made any difference. Gartner has more influence on tech than Hacker News. reply DowagerDave 3 hours agorootparentprevmaybe 10 years ago, but this is not the case today. reply BobbyJo 3 hours agorootparentprevSocial media accounts with high engagement, and a long life, have monetary value. This is true of most social media platforms. HN generally does a good job of minimizing the value of accounts, thus discouraging these kinds of games, but I imagine it still happens. reply Narhem 35 minutes agorootparentThe type of engagement and audience arguably matters more. reply jppope 3 hours agorootparentprevIn theory you could Show HN and have your bots upvote it... that would indeed be good marketing. reply diggan 2 hours agorootparentVote-rings are trivial to detect though, automated or manual. I'd be surprised if HN hasn't figured out ways against it during the time it's been online. reply cryptonector 3 hours agorootparentprev> What actual value do you believe there is, other than curiosity, that is driving people to build the HN spam bots you think you're seeing? Testing. And as siblings say, karma is more valuable than you might think. If you can herd a bunch of karma via botting, you can then [maybe] use that karma to influence all sorts of things. reply yodon 1 hour agorootparent> If you can herd a bunch of karma via botting, you can then [maybe] use that karma to influence all sorts of things. How? Karma on HN is not like Karma elsewhere. The idea of [maybe] monetizing HN Karma reads like the old southpark underpants gnome meme[0].

I think Evon LaTrail is gone now, but for years posted one or more links to his/her/their YouTube videos about personal sanitation and abortion per day. There is a stream of clueless folks, but there are also hardcore psychos like LaTrail. The Svelte magazine spammer fits in this category. reply reaperducer 3 hours agoparentprevIn the seven years I've been on HN, it has gone through different phases, each with a noticeable change in the quality of the comments. One big shift came at the beginning of COVID, when everyone went work-from home. Another came when Elon Musk bought X. There have been one or two other events I've noticed, but those are the ones I can recall now. For a short while, many of the comments were from low-grade Russian and Chinese trolls, but almost all of those are long gone. I don't know if it was a technical change at HN, or a strategy change externally. I don't know if it's internal or external or just fed by internet trends, but while it is resistant, HN is certainly not immune from the ills affecting the rest of the internet. reply jperras 3 hours agorootparent16 year HN vet here. This place has both changed a _lot_ and also very little, depending on which axis you want to analyze. One thing that has been pretty consistent, however, is the rather minimal amount of trolls/bots. There are some surges from time to time, but they really don't last that long. reply diggan 3 hours agorootparentprevHow are you so sure these users are actually bots? Just because someone disagrees with you about Russia or China doesn't mean that's evidence of a bot, no matter how stupid their opinion is. reply iterateoften 3 hours agorootparentHackernews isn’t the place to bring that up regardless of your opinion. So out of context political posts should be viewed with at least some scrutiny. reply imiric 2 hours agorootparentThat's true, but maybe there should be a meta section of the site where these topics can be openly discussed? While I appreciate dang's perspective[1], and agree that most of these are baseless accusations, I also think that it's inevitable that a site with seemingly zero bot-mitigation techniques, where accounts and comments can be easily automated, doesn't have some or, I would wager _a lot_, of bot activity. I would definitely appreciate some transparency here. E.g. are there any automated or manual bot detection and prevention techniques in place? If so, can these accounts and their comments be flagged as such? [1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41710142 reply diggan 3 hours agorootparentprevThis I agree with, off-topic is off-topic and should be removed/flagged.

If the account is new and promoting Ruzzian narrative by denying the reality I can be 99% sure it is a paid person copy pasting arguments from a KGB manual, 1% is a home sovieticus with some free time. reply diggan 2 hours agorootparent> If the account is new and promoting Ruzzian narrative by denying the reality I can be 99% sure it is a paid person copy pasting arguments from a KGB manual, 1% is a home sovieticus with some free time. I'm not as certain as you about that. Last time the US had a presidential election, it seems like almost half the country is either absolutely bananas and out of their mind, or half the country are robots. But reality turns out to be less exciting in reality. People are just dumb, and spew whatever propaganda they happen to come across \"at the right time\". Same is true for Russians as it is for Americans. reply consteval 42 minutes agorootparentI think it's mostly a timing thing. It's one thing for someone to say something dumb, but it's another for someone to say it immediately on a new account. That, to me, screams bot behavior. Also if they have a laser focus. Like if I open a twitter account and every single tweet is some closely related propaganda point. reply simion314 18 minutes agorootparentprevI disagree, Ruzzians are really 1000x worse then MAGA idiots. They really believe that they are superior to everyone else, and I mean they were educated to believe that the Rusky ethnicity is superior, that Ukrainians, Romanians or other Eastern Europeans are inferior to them and they would genocide us again if they had the ability. Americans will not try to deny their slavery past, their genocides of natives, their invasions. Ruzzians will deny genocides happen, or if it happened maybe it was some Georgian at fault and in fact the victims deserve it. reply reaperducer 1 hour agorootparentprevHow are you so sure these users are actually bots? I stated nothing about bots. Re-read what I wrote. reply metalliqaz 3 hours agorootparentprevI don't know about anyone else, but to me a lot of bot traffic is very obvious. I don't have the expertise to be able to describe the feeling that low quality bot text gives me, but it sticks out like a sore thumb. It's too verbose, not specific enough to the discussion, and so on. I'm sure there are real pros who sneak automated propaganda in front of my eyes with my notice, but then again I probably just think they are human trolls. reply diggan 3 hours agorootparent> but it sticks out like a sore thumb Could you give some examples of HN comments that \"sticks out like a sore thumb\"? > It's too verbose, not specific enough to the discussion, and so on. That to me just sounds like the average person who feels deeply about something, but isn't used to productive arguments/debates. I come across this frequently on HN, Twitter and everywhere else, including real life where I know for a fact the person I'm speaking to is not a robot (I'm 99% sure at least). reply metalliqaz 1 hour agorootparentsorry, I didn't mean to give the impression that I was talking about HN comments specifically. I was talking about spotting bot content out on the open Internet. as for verbosity, I don't mean simply using a lot of text, but rather using a lot of superfluous words sentences. people tend not to write in comments the way they would in an article. reply JohnMakin 3 hours agorootparentprevAnyone who’s spent any amount of time in this space can spot them pretty quickly/easily. They tend to stick to certain scripts and themes and almost never deviate. reply dang 3 hours agorootparentIn my experience, that's not true. Rather, people are much too quick to jump to the conclusion that so-and-so is a bot (or a troll, a shill, a foreign agent, etc.), when the other's views are outside the range of what feels normal to them. I've written a lot of about this dynamic because it's so fundamental. Here are some of the longer posts (mini essays really): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39158911 (Jan 2024) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35932851 (May 2023) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27398725 (June 2021) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23308098 (May 2020) Since HN has many users with different backgrounds from all over the world, it has a lot of user pairs (A, B) where A's views don't seem normal to B and vice versa. This is why we have the following rule, which has held up well over the years: \"Please don't post insinuations about astroturfing, shilling, bots, brigading, foreign agents and the like. It degrades discussion and is usually mistaken. If you're worried about abuse, email hn@ycombinator.com and we'll look at the data.\" - https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html reply imiric 1 hour agorootparentHey, I would appreciate if you could address some of my questions here[1]. I do think it's unrealistic to believe that there is absolutely zero bot activity, so at least some of those accusations might be true.

The original comment: > I wonder the same about HN. Has anyone done this kind of analysis? Me good LLM Slightly disingenuous to argue from the standpoint of \"I'm talking about the whole internet\" when this thread is specifically about HN. But whatever floats your boat. reply diggan 3 hours agorootparentprevHow is that different from humans? Humans have themes/areas they care more about, and are more likely to discuss with others. It's not hard to imagine there are Russians/Chinese people caring deeply about their country, just like there are Americans who care deeply about US. reply dcminter 3 hours agorootparentA human aggressively taking a particular line and a bot doing so may be equivalent; do we need to differentiate there? reply diggan 3 hours agorootparentIf the comment is off-topic/breaking the guidelines/rules, it should be removed, full stop. The difference is that the bots comment should be removed regardless if the particular comment is breaking the rules or not, as HN specifically is a forum for humans. The humans comment, granted it doesn't break the rules, shouldn't, no matter how shitty their opinion/view is. reply dcminter 15 minutes agorootparentIf posts make HN a less interesting place to converse I don't see why humans should get a pass & I don't see anything in the guidelines to support that view either. reply JohnMakin 3 hours agorootparentprevC’mon. When you have an account that is less than a year old and has 542 posts, 541 of which are repeating very specific kremlin narratives verbatim, it isn’t difficult to make a guess. Is your contention that they are actually difficult to spot, or that they don’t exist at all? because both of those views are hilariously false. reply diggan 3 hours agorootparentI feel like you're speaking about specific accounts here, since it's so obvious and exact. Care to share the HN accounts you're thinking about here? My contention is that people jump to \"It's just a bot\" when they parrot obvious government propaganda they disagree with, when the average person is as likely to parrot obvious propaganda without involving computers at all. People are just generally stupid by themselves, and reducing it to \"Robots be robotting\" doesn't feel very helpful when there is an actual problem to address. reply JohnMakin 3 hours agorootparentNo, I'm not. And I don't/won't post any specific accounts. I'm speaking more generally - and no one is jumping to anything here, you're projecting an argument that absolutely no one is making. The original claim was that russian/chinese bots were on this platform and left. I've only been here about 1.5 years, so I don't know the validity of that claim, but I have a fair amount of experience and research in the last ten years or so on the topic of foreign misinformation campaigns on the web, so it sounds like a very valid claim, given how proliferate these campaigns were across the entire web. It isn't an entirely new concept or unknown, and that isn't what is happening here. You're making a lot of weird assumptions, especially given the fact that the US government wrote several hundred pages about this exact topic years ago. reply diggan 3 hours agorootparent> and no one is jumping to anything here, you're projecting an argument that absolutely no one is making You literally claimed \"when you have accounts with these stats, and they say these specific things, it isn't difficult to guess...\" which ends with \"that they're bots\" I'm guessing. Read around in this very submission for more examples of people doing \"the jump\". I'm not saying there isn't any \"foreign misinformation campaigns on the web\", so not sure who is projecting here. reply yodon 3 hours agorootparentprevTen years ago those accounts existed, too. Back then we called them \"people.\" reply JohnMakin 3 hours agorootparentNot at all - ten years ago russian misinformation campaigns on twitter and meta platforms were alive and well. There was an entire several hundred page report about it, even. reply SoftTalker 3 hours agorootparentprevHN has mechanisms to detect upvotes and comments that seem to be promoting a product or coordinated in some other way. I'm not sure what they do behind the scenes or how effective it is but it's something. Also other readers downvote bot spam. Obvious bot/LLM-generated comments seem to be \"dead\" quite often, as are posts that are clearly just content/ad farm links or product promotions or way off-topic. reply tomalaci 3 hours agoprevThis is pretty much progress on dead internet theory. The only thing I think that can stop this and ensure genuine interaction is with strong, trusted identity that has consequences if abused/misused. This trusted identity should be something governments need to implement. So far big tech companies still haven't fixed it and I question if it is in their interests to fix it. For example, what happens if Google cracks down hard on this and suddenly 60-80% of YouTube traffic (or even ad-traffic) evaporates because it was done by bots? It would wipe out their revenue. reply brookst 3 hours agoparent> It would wipe out their revenue. Disagree. YouTube's revenue comes from large advertisers who can measure real impact of ads. If you wiped out all of the bots, the actual user actions (\"sign up\" / \"buy\") would remain about the same. Advertisers will happily pay the same amount of money to get 20% of the traffic and 100% of the sales. In fact, they'd likely pay more because then they could reduce investment in detecting bots. Bots don't generate revenue, and the marketplace is somewhat efficient. reply Veuxdo 3 hours agorootparent> In fact, they'd likely pay more because then they could reduce investment in detecting bots. A lot more. Preventing bots from eating up your entire digital advertising budget takes a lot of time and money. reply netcan 3 hours agorootparentprevYes... but maybe also no. Well measured advertising budgets are definitely part of the game. But so are poorly measured campaigns. Type B often cargo cult A. It's far from a perfect market. In any case, Adwords is at this point a very established product... very much an incumbent. Disruption generally, does not play to their favor by default. reply joseda-hg 3 hours agoparentprevThis still breaks some parts of the internet, where you wouldn't want to associate your identity with your thoughts or image reply cryptonector 1 hour agorootparentThink attribute certificates. reply cryptonector 2 hours agoparentprev> This trusted identity should be something governments need to implement. Granting the premise for argument's sake, why should governments do this? Why can't private companies do it? That said, I've long thought that the U.S. Postal Service (and similarly outside the U.S.) is the perfect entity for providing useful user certificates and attribute certificates (to get some anonymity, at least relative to peers, if not relative to the government). The USPS has: - lots of brick and mortar locations - staffed with human beings - who are trained and able to validate various forms of identity documents for passport applications UPS and FedEx are also similarly situated. So are grocery stores (which used to, and maybe still do have bill payment services). Now back to the premise. I want for anonymity to be possible to some degree. Perhaps AI bots make it impossible, or perhaps anonymous commenters have to be segregated / marked as anonymous so as to help everyone who wants to filter out bots. reply consteval 38 minutes agorootparentI think the main argument for having the government do it as opposed to the private sector is that the gov has a lot more restrictions and we, the people, have a say. At least theoretically. Imagine if Walmart implemented an identity service and it really took off and everyone used it. Then, imagine they ban you because you tweeted that Walmart sucks. Now you can't get a rental car, can't watch TV, maybe can't even get a job.

They already give you a passport which can be used as a digital ID. reply JimDabell 3 hours agorootparentServices need the ability to obtain an identifier that: - Belongs to exactly one real person. - That a person cannot own more than one of. - That is unique per-service. - That cannot be tied to a real-world identity. - That can be used by the person to optionally disclose attributes like whether they are an adult or not. Services generally don’t care about knowing your exact identity but being able to ban a person and not have them simply register a new account, and being able to stop people from registering thousands of accounts would go a long way towards wiping out inauthentic and abusive behaviour.

We should be fighting for this. But in the meantime, using a passport ticks most of the boxes in your list. I’m currently working on a social network that utilises passports to ensure account uniqueness. I’m aware that folks can have multiple passports, but it will be good enough to ensure that abuse is minimal and real humans are behind the accounts. reply JimDabell 3 hours agorootparentThe main problem with this is that a hell of a lot of people don’t want to give sensitive personal documents to social media platforms. reply dom96 2 hours agorootparentYeah.

Many of these people are poor, people of color, or marginalized in other ways.

Singapore does this.

There’s a barcode on the physical cards that can be scanned by a mobile app in person to verify that it’s valid too. reply secabeen 3 hours agorootparentprevIn the United States, the lack of citizen identification cards is largely due to Republican opposition. People who lack ID are more likely to be democratic voters, so there is an incentive to oppose getting them ID. There's also a religious element for some people, connected to Christian myths about the end of the world. reply cryptonector 1 hour agorootparentThis is utter nonsense. reply consteval 33 minutes agorootparentIt's kind of half true - there is an association between not having an ID and being blue. Because people without IDs are more likely to be people of color or of other marginalized groups, which then are more likely to be blue. In addition, there's a strong conservative history of using voter id as a means of voter suppression and discrimination. This, in turn, has made the blue side immediately skeptical of identification laws - even if they would be useful. So, now the anti-ID stuff is coming from everywhere. reply bityard 2 hours agoparentprevI've been thinking about how AI will affect ad-supported \"content\" platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, porn sites, etc. My prediction is that as AI-generated content improves in quality, or at least believability, they will not prohibit AI-generated content, they will embrace it whole-heartedly. Maybe not at first. But definitely gradually and definitely eventually. We know that these sites' growth and stability depends on attracting human eyeballs to their property and KEEPING them there. Today, that manifests as algorithms that analyze each person's individual behavior and level of engagement and uses that data to tweak that user's experience to keep them latched (some might say addicted, via dopamine) to their app on the user's device for as long as possible. Dating sites have already had this down to a science for a long time. There, bots are just part of the business model and have been for two decades. It's really easy: you promise users that you will match them with real people, but instead show them only bots and ads. The bots are programmed to interact with the users realistically over the site and say/do everything short of actually letting two real people meet up. Because whenever a dating site successfully matches up real people, they lose customers. I hope I'm wrong, but I feel that social content sites will head down the same path. The sites will determine that users who enjoy watching Reels of women in swimsuits jump on trampolines can simply generate as many as they need, and tweak the parameters of the generated video based on the user's (perceived) preferences: age, size, swimsuit color, height of bounce, etc. But will still provide JUST enough variety to keep the user from getting bored enough to go somewhere else. It won't just be passive content that is generated, all those political flamewars and outrage threads (the meat and potatoes of social media) could VERY well ALREADY be LLM-generated for the sole purpose of inciting people to reply. Imagine happily scrolling along and then reading the most ill-informed, brain-dead comment you've ever seen. You know well enough that they're just an idiot and you'll never change their mind, but you feel driven to reply anyway, so that you can at LEAST point out to OTHERS that this line of thinking is dangerous, then maybe you can save a soul.

In spite of the flack that CAPTCHAs usually get, I still think they have a lot of value in fighting the majority of these spam attacks. The common criticisms are: - They impact usability, accessibility and privacy. Users hate them, etc. These are all issues that can be improved. In the last few years there have been several CAPTCHAs that work without user input at all, and safeguard user privacy. - They're not good enough, sophisticated (AI) bots can easily bypass them, etc. Sure, but even traditional techniques are useful at stopping low-effort bots. Sophisticated ones can be fought with more advanced techniques, including ML. There are products on the market that do this as well. - They're ineffective against dedicated attackers using mechanical turks, etc. Well, sure, but these are entirely different attack methods. CAPTCHAs are meant to detect bots, and by definition, won't be effective against attackers who decide to use actual humans. Websites need different mechanisms to protect against that, but those are also edge cases and not the main cause of the spam we see today. reply cynicalpeace 3 hours agoprevI wonder how much of Meta and other social media ad revenue is based on bot activity.

Does anyone have more resources/inside info that confirms/denies this suspicion? reply FredPret 2 hours agoparentI do - I think the effect on Meta’s ad revenue is nil. Advertisers measure ad campaigns by ROAS (return on ad spend). This is driven by actual dollars spent, cutting out all bots right away.

Especially since advertisers need Meta more than Meta needs any one of them. reply doctorpangloss 3 hours agorootparentprevMeta and ad agencies are definitely incentivized that your ads convert and that engagement is authentic. Otherwise why deal with them at all? SMBs are like 40% of Meta's revenues, the entire world finds the product valuable. It is a little glib to try to make the contrarian case on conversion. The toxic part of their incentives is that they want businesses to commit large budgets on campaigns whose performance you can measure with very little money spent and very little data. reply cynicalpeace 2 hours agorootparentYes definitely. But then that last sentence sorta leads to the first question you had- why deal with them at all? I think it's because despite that toxicity it still seems to be the best ad platform in town.

So, either online ads or other forms of spamming. reply cynicalpeace 3 hours agorootparentprevThis answer is a good answer for some companies, but for other companies it's very hand-wavy.

Maybe not massively (and maybe yes, I don't know and neither do you), and its hard to pinpoint a single actor, so lets point it in ad business.

I want some reassurance that I'm not wasting my time and am actually reaching real humans in my interactions online. Success to me is 1000 MAU. There are companies out there that do passport verification for a reasonable fee with a fair amount of free verifications to start with (which will handle 1000 MAU just fine). If the number of users wishing to take part is significantly higher then I will explore either ads or charging a small fee during registration. I'm still very far from needing to cross that bridge though. Same for some of the other questions you've raised. I'd have to do a lot more research to come to a solid stance of what to do when government data requests come in. But I would guess that there isn't much choice but to abide by the request.

My only gripe with it is that it says \"you're posting too fast, wait a few minutes\" when I wasn't posting fast, and it blocks account activity for hours. I don't like automated messages that lie. reply immibis 16 minutes agorootparentToo fast is more than 5 posts or comments every 6 hours.

    "originBody": "Hey it’s Hassaan & Quinn – co-founders of Tavus, an AI research company and developer platform for video APIs. We’ve been building AI video models for ‘digital twins’ or ‘avatars’ since 2020.We’re sharing some of the challenges we faced building an AI video interface that has realistic conversations with a human, including getting it to under 1 second of latency.To try it, talk to Hassaan’s digital twin: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hassaanraza.com, or to our \"demo twin\" Carter: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tavus.ioWe built this because until now, we&#x27;ve had to adapt communication to the limits of technology. But what if we could interact naturally with a computer? Conversational video makes it possible – we think it&#x27;ll eventually be a key human-computer interface.To make conversational video effective, it has to have really low latency and conversational awareness. A fast-paced conversation between friends has ~250 ms between utterances, but if you’re talking about something more complex or with someone new, there is additional “thinking” time. So, less than 1000 ms latency makes the conversation feel pretty realistic, and that became our target.Our architecture decisions had to balance 3 things: latency, scale, & cost. Getting all of these was a huge challenge.The first lesson learned was to make it low-latency, we had to build it from the ground up. We went from a team that cared about seconds to a team that counts every millisecond. We also had to support thousands of conversations happening all at once, without getting destroyed on compute costs.For example, during early development, each conversation had to run on an individual H100 in order to fit all components and model weights into GPU memory just to run our Phoenix-1 model faster than 30fps. This was unscalable & expensive.We developed a new model, Phoenix-2, with a number of improvements, including inference speed. We switched from a NeRF based backbone to Gaussian Splatting for a multitude of reasons, one being the requirement that we could generate frames faster than realtime, at 70+ fps on lower-end hardware. We exceeded this and focused on optimizing memory and core usage on GPU to allow for lower-end hardware to run it all. We did other things to save on time and cost like using streaming vs batching, parallelizing processes, etc. But those are stories for another day.We still had to lower the utterance-to-utterance time to hit our goal of under a second of latency. This meant each component (vision, ASR, LLM, TTS, video generation) had to be hyper-optimized.The worst offender was the LLM. It didn’t matter how fast the tokens per second (t&#x2F;s) were, it was the time-to-first token (tfft) that really made the difference. That meant services like Groq were actually too slow – they had high t&#x2F;s, but slow ttft. Most providers were too slow.The next worst offender was actually detecting when someone stopped speaking. This is hard. Basic solutions use time after silence to ‘determine’ when someone has stopped talking. But it adds latency. If you tune it to be too short, the AI agent will talk over you. Too long, and it’ll take a while to respond. The model had to be dedicated to accurately detecting end-of-turn based on conversation signals, and speculating on inputs to get a head start.We went from 3-5 to <1 second (& as fast as 600 ms) with these architectural optimizations while running on lower-end hardware.All this allowed us to ship with a less than 1 second of latency, which we believe is the fastest out there. We have a bunch of customers, including Delphi, a professional coach and expert cloning platform. They have users that have conversations with digital twins that span from minutes, to one hour, to even four hours (!) - which is mind blowing, even to us.Thanks for reading! let us know what you think and what you would build.

But could not carry on a conversation and kept trying to almost divert the conversation into less interesting topics. Weirdly kept complimenting me or taking one word and saying, oh you feel ____.

I mean it's basically just a chatbot right? And nobody likes interacting with those. Forcing a conversational interaction seems like a step down in UX. reply andywertner 1 hour agoparentThis is a really good question. While you're right that a common use case would be chatbots for product support, it isn't the only one. Some examples: - interactive experiences with historical figures - digital twins for celebrity/influencer fan interactions - \"live\" and/or personalized advertisements Some of our users are already building these kinds of applications. reply hassaanr 1 hour agoparentprevThe way we see it is that this brings us closer to communicating with computers the way we communicate with each other. It has vision and can (not perfectly) take into account your expressions, your surroundings, and can respond accordingly. reply joshdavham 2 hours agoparentprevThat's actually a good question. For example, the technology is still currently at a level where the user can still cleary tell that it's a chatbot, but now with a face. Does this make their experience better? Or does it add a weird level of uncaninness to the experience? reply hassaanr 1 hour agorootparentIt'll depend on the use case- but with customers that are using it today we're seeing higher engagement and satisfaction rates. It's a different interface to communicate that is more natural to humans (our bullish opinion). reply heyitsguay 2 hours agorootparentprevI don't think the level of fidelity actually matters as much as authority or ability. What can the agent do that isn't accomplished by, for example, a landing page or an FAQ page? I've never encountered a (text) chatbot that did anything useful for me as a consumer, whether for sales or support. reply rpazpri1 1 hour agorootparenttotally agree! agentic capabilities are really important and can significantly elevate the experience. using LLM tools is a great way to get at least part of the way there. feel free to check out our docs for \"bring your own LLM\" here https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interfac... reply Mistletoe 23 minutes agoparentprevI don't even like video calls with real people in my real life. Texting works great. This is really neat but I'd much rather just have a text chat with a real customer service rep. I don't need to see a face, don't want to, and especially don't want to see a fake face. reply nithayakumar 2 hours agoprevOh man - i've been watching you guys for awhile.

I worry about far future events... but since American law is based on precedence: we should be careful now how we define/categorize things. To be clear - I don't think this is an issue NOW... but I can't say for certain when these issues will come into play... So edging on the side of early/caution seems prudent... and releasing 'ownership' before any sort of 'revolt' could happen seems wise if a little silly at the current moment. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
