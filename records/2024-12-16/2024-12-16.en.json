The TW4 decentralized Energy Recovery Ventilator transfers clean outdoor air inside and moves polluted air outdoors, while harvesting ~90% of the heat energy - so you get fresh air without the downsides of heating or cooling it. The WM12 is basically two TW4 modules side by side in a piece of tough polypropylene foam, so you can put it in a window. The design is now in beta. People who request a unit by email will be contacted one at a time as units become available, starting with those most able to handle potential complications that come with the beta phase. Provides fresh air during hot or cold weather, without allowing the loss or intrusion of (much) heat energy. Core performance figures: ~90% sensible, ~80% latent heat recovery on medium speed. Slightly higher at low speed, slightly lower on max. This varies very little with temperature, humidity or season. High air flow - 60 CFM actual average net fresh air in heat recovery mode on maximum speed. Extremely quiet - ~0.25 Sone (~37 dBa) on medium, essentially inaudible on low, ~42.5 dBa on max. ~21x greater rate of return on investment, compared with typical, conventional ductless ERV units, due to long term design, maintenance costs, higher energy recovery and other factors combined. ~3x the return on investment of typical ducted HRV/ERV units. >10x ROI of photovoltaic panels in many areas like Ottawa, Canada. See spreadsheet on learn more page for details. Other details include: Optional HEPA (H13) filter, using widely available filters (requires the outdoor plate attachment and hood) Designed and built to last for >50 years, for greatly superior return on investment, with no long term component availability concerns. Can be configured to work with common home automation systems, including Google Home, Alexa and Home Assistant for scheduling, many kinds of sensor-based operation, interfacing with knobs and switches without wiring, etc using MQTT. Can be controlled over WiFi using MQTT, including from a phone. Very low electrical energy consumption - 2 watts on low, 7 watts at maximum power. Effectively reduces CO2 levels, reduces transmission of airborne pathogens and improves Indoor Air Quality in all metrics. Storm valve add-on to prevent intrusion of air or water during a storm (requires exterior plate and hood) Automatic wind compensation using a very nice pressure sensor, to ensure balanced air flow in both directions, and a precisely controllable influence on total net pressure in the building.

    "commentBody": "OpenERV (openerv.ca)697 points by graboy 15 hours agohidepastfavorite211 comments wakeforce 4 hours agoI'd love to build this. I have access to a 3d printer, use Python, and have some electronics experience. I live in a northern climate and have been eyeing ERV systems for a while. Basically, I'm the perfect target for this. However, reading the docs, they seem written more to discourage any kind of DIY attempt by saying things A, B or C are difficult, than actually explaining how to do them correctly. I'd love to contribute to the project, but it feels like it's not set-up to foster community contribution. If I'm mistaken, I'd love to donate some of my time on this! reply turtlebits 2 hours agoparentUnfortunately the recovery core, which is the interesting part of an ERV, is not included in the 3d stl's. IMO, this feels like a more marketing project than anything open. ERVs are already very simple (a recovery core + blowers/fans). Commercial units last an extremely long time (some with 10 year warranties) and have comprehensive parts availability. Also a long term window install is a bit janky and is likely to lose out on efficiency due to glass being a poor insulator. reply NavinF 1 hour agorootparentI'm pretty sure stls/regen.stl is the recovery core you're taking about tho I can't open it in a online stl viewer: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1py2YwmwBEcvmdw18SKwx... In the photos it seems to be a bunch of nested single-perimeter cylinders that are joined at a few points to maintain spacing. Easy enough to model, but I agree the documentation is horrible and there's no way to contribute. Commercial units are not comparable because they're way more expensive despite being so simple reply bittercynic 1 hour agorootparentPrusaslicer opens it, and it is the right size and shape to be the core, but there's no internal geometry in that STL, at least not how Prusaslicer renders it. I'd be interested in seeing a diagram of how the air flows through it, if such a thing is available. Edited to add: There are instructions in the WM12 manual to use your infill settings to make the old version of the core. Page 15 of the manual states there is a python script in the source files to generate the new core, but it only works for their particular printer. I wasn't able to find the script. reply schneems 29 minutes agorootparentThanks for mentioning that. It seems the PDF and the google docs \"manual\" have diverged a bit. (at least in page numbers). I was curious about materials for the core. I know that they're supposed to exchange humidity as well as heat. I know PLA will absorb and release water but I would guess it wouldn't transfer enough to be very efficient. Though I would be happy to be wrong. I assume the Core in my Panasonic whisper comfort was made out of something more permeable than \"simply\" extruded plastic. (would love to know more if someone has details). reply open_erv2 1 hour agorootparentprevThere is the tw4, which is made to be put in a wall, and there is the WM12, which goes in the window. The main focus is the TW4. There are instructions in the manual for making an ERV core. It is not trivial. reply NavinF 35 minutes agorootparentInteresting. I'll paste it below. Note on printing the regenerator/heat exchanger: The latest and greatest heat exchanger is produced directly with python script generated gcode specific to the printer I use and cannot be practically produced diy, unfortunately. However the old model can be, and the STL is included for that, in the source repository. To do this, simply use Cura, load th STL in, put it in the center of the build plate, and set it to do “lines” infill with about 2.5 mm on center (between centers of the lines) spacing and 0.45 mm width, no top layer and no bottom layer (set them to zero). Check the preview and it should show you a structure which is much like grid infill, parallel channels which are square in cross section, with the outer wall. Tape can be applied over the nubs on the side to fit in an oversized pipe, or they can be sanded if the pipe is too small. You could also use grid infill, but the roads tend to have problems where they intersect. When the nozzle goes over one road, it wipes the plastic off, and not enough is deposited on the lee side. I don’t know how to solve this in Cura without using lines infill. If you could make it so the nozzle went in alternate directions each layer that would probably solve it well enough. reply Aurornis 2 hours agoparentprevI expected a community open source project from the title, but reading the docs led me to the same conclusion: The website is about convincing you to buy one while discouraging you from attempting to build one. It looks like a fun project. I don’t want to discount what has been designed and built. It is confusing to start reading about the project and discover that it’s more of a business than a community project while simultaneously being unavailable for purchase. The person who built it commented on HN that they’re focused on a 3rd different fan project right now, which brings the future of this project into question. It would be great if a community effort could fork this project and work on making it easier to DIY so the community could push it forward. EDIT: After exploring the files I’m not sure I’d even call this open source. I either can’t find some key files or they’re deliberately excluded. True open source projects would also include the CAD source, not only .STLs so others could adapt and modify the source. I think the open angle on this project is more marketing than substance. reply open_erv2 1 hour agorootparentThe step files are also there, which is the best common denominator for CAD files. Again, it's open source for the purpose of maintenance and repair, not cloning, and frankly earlier on I did make it more community oriented and nobody ever contributed even a little bit, so I just gave up on that idea. The most likely scenario for longer term is that people may submit minor patches or suggestions, which I roll into the hardware or firmware. In reality, hardware is not like software. You can't make changes easily. Some wizards may take it upon themselves to spruce up the firmware with fancy features and release something, which anyone is free to do. There would then be multiple compatible versions of the firmware, one which I curate for reliability with minimal features, and others which others can provide. Same as for 3d printer firmware. The firmware is Micropython, which is extremely easy to understand and modify. reply outlog 1 hour agoparentprevjust saw this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-hVUczzlL4 and you get a very smart solution for a fair price, that does coordination etc.. and it's even esp32 based should the need arise. see https://www.bpcventilation.com/bsk-zephyr-single-room-heat-r... I also have this DIY bookmarked: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJB3dyHDa-8 reply danans 13 hours agoprevThe way I like to describe HRV/ERVs to people who don't know about them is: \"Imagine you could open a window to get fresh air into your house and stale air out, but when you did so, most of the heat/humidity would stay in during the winter, or stay out during the summer, leaving you just the fresh air\". In terms of the effect on environment inside a house, I usually say: \"Imagine it's always a fresh-air spring day inside your house\" This is a great project. One problem with ERV/HRV systems right now is that they are very expensive niche products. While this system doesn't achieve the extremely high heat recovery efficiencies of counter-flow units, the perfect is the enemy of the good, and this seems like it could be orders of magnitude cheaper. reply pzduniak 7 hours agoparent>that they are very expensive niche products My entire \"medium sized European suburban house\" runs on a $2.5k 400m3/h unit with HEPA filters made in Lithuania - and that was the more expensive model that I can directly control over MODBUS / 0-10V signal (even turning it into a \"dumb\" unit). Most of the expenses were running the ducts. YMMV It's just awesome. Every single room has fresh-smelling air and after fine tuning all my heating systems with algos implemented in Home Assistant - I'm getting ~60-100ppm over outdoor CO2, perfectly clean air, temperature within 1C of the set value, on-demand humidity extraction after showers etc. All it needs to be properly overengineered now is a bunch of dampers and per-room CO2/humidity feedback :) reply tomashubelbauer 5 hours agorootparentI wish this was as common as having a fridge in the house. The productivity gains from people not being sleepy and tired from shit air would be insane. reply tashoecraft 3 hours agorootparentWhen having my mini splits installed I pushed for an erv system in the bedroom. The installer had only ever done them in commercial units, and he hemmed and hawed about it, but I had two c02 monitors in my room showing it getting to above 2000 whilst sleeping. I've noticed a big improvement in how groggy I feel in the morning. reply BizarroLand 1 hour agorootparentprevIf there were good enough ERVs that could be installed by the DIY'er for about the cost of a cheap refrigerator (~$600 or so) then they would be more common. I get that manufacturing the transfer plates isn't simple or cheap, but other than that one thing they're basically fans, they shouldn't cost that much. reply karussell 6 hours agorootparentprevHow is the noise of these systems? And how often/long need they run to give you clean air and humidity extraction. Is there extra noise when it is windy outside? Is it installed inside the windows somehow or do I need to drill through the wall? reply sgerenser 5 hours agorootparentTypically 2 holes, one for air intake and one for air outtake are drilled through the wall. They’re often installed when a home is being built or heavily remodeled. They can be installed after the fact (especially if you have an accessible basement or attic) but it might be a bit invasive running ducts where you need them. reply ericd 4 hours agorootparentAlternatively, we got one piped into the HVAC ductwork. It's not as optimal as its own ducting, but it's much easier/cheaper than running a bunch of new ductwork. reply organsnyder 1 hour agorootparentThat's what we did. Our house was built in 1916, but the weather sealing we've done combined with six people breathing in it led to quite high CO2 levels. We have a traditional ducted air conditioning system in the attic (heat is hot water radiant), and added the ERV there. It made a massive difference. reply michaelmior 6 hours agorootparentprev> after fine tuning all my heating systems with algos implemented in Home Assistant I'd be very interested in hearing the details of this. reply pzduniak 4 hours agorootparentI'll definitely prepare a longer write-up when I have everything figure out, but here's a summary: I have 4 systems: - Komfovent HRV for ventilation - NIBE F-series heat pump for floor and water heating - Vaillant gas boiler that \"supports\" the heat pump - Samsung multi-split AC units HRV - Komfovent uses the same controllers in all of their units, so you get all the communication goodies you'd want - though it took me a long while to figure out that basic features need to be toggled on :) There are existing YAML presets for their C6/C6M controllers on HA forums. The only caveat is that if you want to feed it a virtual thermostat, you need a stuff a device simulating a 10k NTC inside of the ventilator. Otherwise it's just a single Ethernet cable. Heat pump - I'm not exactly sure if I'm happy with NIBE, but thanks to the community the integration ended up being quite easy. I wasted a bunch of money on their MODBUS40 just to learn that you need to use a certain MODBUS address in the internal bus to make certain registries writeable (eg. thermostat values) - so I took an ESP32 with Ethernet, a galvanically isolated RS485 dongle, a 12V to 5V converter and used https://github.com/elupus/esphome-nibe. The firmware extracts my templated HA sensor's value and feeds it to the heat pump as a virtual thermostat. Vaillant uses this weird \"eBUS\" protocol, there's a bunch of cheap PCBs that you can use to connect to it - I'm using https://github.com/danielkucera/esp-arduino-ebus. That's the last system that I haven't touched :) Samsung ACs use their MIM-B19N modules installed in the outdoor units. There's some magic around enabling remote control, but once you plug their diagnostics device into their indoor units, you can flash all of them at once. I had to mess around with internal NASA addresses to have all the units appear at once. For indoor sensors I have 3 types: - AirGradient units measure CO2, tempeature, humidity, PMx etc. - these are mounted at ~150cm and feed the \"current house temperature\" template. - I have like 8 Everything Presence One devices, powered by a custom PCB that converts 12V/24V sent over wired alarm cables to the device. They have built-in temperature, humidity and motion sensors. These are mostly installed for motion sensing and their height makes the temperature measurements quite useless. - Everything else (and most importantly bathrooms) is done using custom ESP32-C3 devices that use SHT31 sensors to measure humidity and LD2412 for movement sensing. Also using the same adapter PCB for powering. Thermostats are synchronized across all the devices with HA scripts. The HRV specifically uses its own wired temperature sensor to determine if it should enable heat recovery (\"free cooling mode\"), since its extracted air temp is always a bit lower than room temp (laziness :-)). \"Current temperature\" template fed to other heaters is derived from multiple room temperatures (currently using an average), with rooms \"ignored\" if AC is heating there (or was turned on recently). Ventilation has 2 modes set up - 20% and 80% - with the latter toggled by a bathroom humidity threshold. There are 3 remaining things I want to set up: - auto switching to gas heating if it's cheaper / the house is running on batteries - so far I've only imported electricity / gas prices into HA and quickly realized that I'm missing a power monitor on the heat pump circuit - dampening of air ducts to reduce the temp drop when high humidity extraction boost gets triggered - using more of the HRV range by auto-adjusting fan speed depending on real CO2 values - there's max 2 ppl at the house most of the time, so even at 20% the HRV is quite wasteful reply michaelmior 3 hours agorootparentVery cool! I think one of my biggest things is that I need my sensors to be able to manage things well. reply tinco 6 hours agorootparentprevAnyone know if there's a good way to control 0-10V dampers? I looked for a solution to control 5 dampers but I didn't find anything, so I started to design my own a couple years ago but never finished the project. I'm having a hard time imagining something so common doesn't have a common solution. reply pzduniak 5 hours agorootparentIf you're OK with large controllers, the cheap Chinese RS485 stuff seems to work perfectly fine. For \"digital inputs\" I started out with Polish $150 devices, eventually ended up using the cheapest AliExpress listings for some expansions and so far they've been working exactly the same, with the only difference being the quality of the docs. I'd expect the 0-10V modules to be exactly the same. reply yrcyrc 7 hours agorootparentprevWould you have a link/reference? reply pzduniak 4 hours agorootparenthttps://www.komfovent.com/en/products/domekt-r-400-f-c6m-573 I think this is the one I'm using for ~200-ish sqm. reply yrcyrc 2 hours agorootparentGreat thank you reply turtlebits 3 hours agoparentprevERVs are not expensive, 1500 USD will get you a decent whole house unit. The installation is the expensive part, which this project doesn't change. reply kccqzy 1 hour agoparentprevWhat makes outdoor air \"fresh\" compared to indoor air? You said that the temperature and humidity of indoor air are preserved. So is it just CO2 concentration? Would installing a chemical CO2 scrubber have an effect similar to an ERV system then? reply batushka5 6 hours agoparentprevThese units are ubiquitus in northernish Europe, as any new/renovated building needs them to reach A/A++ energy effiency.

Most building codes in US/CA mandate them since about 2015, so I'm not sure how niche they are (at least in new construction).

Naively allowing the air columns to thermally mix would result in the average of the inside and outside temp. So how does this do better? reply IndrekR 6 hours agorootparentThe direction of flow is reversed every 30s. The cycle is short enough that due to the thermal mass there is thermal gradient within the heat-exchanger. So it effectively works as counter-flow heat exchanger. Same principle (but continuous flow) is used in rotor ERV: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_recovery_ventilation#Ther... Heat exchanger there is usually an extruded ceramic grid (ERV) or rolled corrugated aluminum (functions closer to HRV than ERV) reply LukeShu 12 hours agorootparentprevCounter-flow heat exchangers. A parallel-flow heat exchanger would result in the average, as you say; but a counter-flow exchanger means that as the formerly-warm air gets progressively cooler, it is exposed to progressively colder air. reply gwd 7 hours agorootparentI've got a counter-flow heat exchanger, but it looks like they're using a different design: > Each OpenERV TW4 module has a very quiet pair of fans, pointed in opposite directions, and a heat exchanger in a 6 inch pipe, that goes through a wall. The hot, polluted air from inside goes out for 30 seconds, and the heat from it is stored in the heat exchanger. > Then, the fan reverses direction, moving clean air from outdoors to the indoors. On it's way in, it picks up that heat from the heat exchanger. This type of heat exchanger is called a regenerative heat exchanger, or less commonly, a regenerator. The kind shown in the video is a recuperative type, not regenerative. Recuperative types are what most people think of, consisting of a thin layer of material that separates two gas streams. Regenerative heat exchangers are different. They briefly store the energy while air flows in one direction, then release it when the air flow reverses. > The OpenERV TW4 modules are made to always work in pairs. One always sucks air while the other blows air, synchronized over WiFi. This should be done, or hot air would be pushed out from the building through the walls during the ingress phase, causing heat loss. https://www.openerv.ca/learn-more reply llm_trw 9 hours agorootparentprevDuh, thank you for reminding me air flows in a duct. reply empiricus 12 hours agorootparentprevthe intuition: if the 2 colums flow in the same direction, the final temp is the average. but if the 2 columns flow in the oposite directions it is posible to fully exchange the temperature reply jonstewart 5 hours agoparentprevPlanning a renovation of my 1947 rowhome in DC, and I’m really looking forward to adding an ERV. reply bluGill 4 hours agorootparentYou probably cannot do a renovation the tightens up your house enough to matter. Of course you have not specified what you are doing, it is certainly possible to do that, but it is a major effort that makes the house unlivable for a couple months and costs a lot of money. If you don't do that level of renovation your house will have enough leaks that a ERV will not make any difference in air quality (and even that level doesn't always make the house airtight enough to need an ERV). Making a house airtight is very hard - worth doing because of the energy savings, but not easy. If you are doing that level of renovation is is probably better to just tear down the house and rebuild. The costs will be similar and there are a lot of other things people demand of a new house layout that cannot be retrofitted in the old shell. Often the law will not allow this and so you are forced to renovate just to keep some now illegal feature that is worth keeping, but otherwise a tear down would be better. reply BizarroLand 1 hour agorootparentAnyone can do a renovation that \"tightens up your house enough to matter\". Use a qualified professional. Get multiple inputs. It will cost money, and more money as you approach perfection, but it is doable. reply bluGill 24 minutes agorootparentNot really as the structrure of most houses leaks. It can be done but you are doing a lot of work that is easy to skip reply zerr 7 hours agoparentprevTo be fair, the temperature (coldness) of the outdoor air contributes to refreshing the room as well. reply d--b 6 hours agorootparentI don't think this is meant as a replacement for windows :D reply freetonik 6 hours agorootparentIn Finland, many people avoid opening windows altogether, and only rely on various devices for mechanical movement of air. I find it quite alarming actually, as many homes have stale air and subpar ventilation systems, always justified by \"never let heat escape the house\". The idea of opening windows to refresh the air in the house is basically alien to many Finns, while it's a normal thing to do in other countries; in German, there's a term Stoßlüften. reply BlobberSnobber 5 hours agorootparentStoßlüften isn’t merely a term, it’s a German religion reply colordrops 11 hours agoparentprevI can't find anyone to install one in Los Angeles. Is there a particular climate these are suited for? reply jeroenhd 10 hours agorootparentAir exchange HRVs are quite common here in the Netherlands. Not exactly ubiquitous, but common enough that you can find them in most recently built apartments at the very least. If you're going to have mechanical ventilation installed, you may as well save a buck in the long run on the heat loss. There's only so much temperature gradient these setups can handle economically, and it's quite possible that the hot LA summers combined with the cool AC air are too much for such an installation not to leak energy at an unacceptable rate. Then again, just like with ACs that also serve as heat pumps, it could just be a matter of not enough people (or professionals) knowing about these installations to make it viable to build a business around them. reply TheSpiceIsLife 9 hours agorootparentHVAC folk ought to know about ERVs. Type in HRV system in to your preferred search provider and hit the shopping tab. Here in Australia they range from about 1500 Antipodean Dineros for a single room through-wall mounted systems, and around 5500 upward for a centralised unit. Plus installation costs, but HVAC install is one of my paid activities, so I mostly don’t pay that part. NB heat pump is a more accurate term for refrigeration type air conditioners, as in cooling mode they’re ‘pumping’ the heat out of the inside environment and rejecting it outside. But have you heard about brown? reply driverdan 5 hours agorootparentprevThat's surprising. Doesn't CA require them in new construction? All CA HVAC contractors should be familiar with them now. reply bluGill 4 hours agorootparentprevThey have been required by code in all new houses in Minnesota for about 25 years. I'm sure CA requires them too. Though in older houses they are a waste of money as your house already leaks much air. These are a good thing if you have a well sealed house, but older houses universally are not sealed that well and so they won't give you anything. reply throw0101b 4 hours agorootparentprev> I can't find anyone to install one in Los Angeles.

Raising the temperature means that the air can now hold much more moisture. Bringing in cold air at 50% humidity, then warming it up to room temp makes the humidity fall, leading to dryer air indoors than comfortable. reply Notatheist 9 hours agorootparentYep. Humidity will tank to 25% here in winter. I have two humidifiers fighting the HRV continuously when it gets cold. As I understand it an ERV controls moisture as well, but such a module for my system costs over $4000. reply quietbritishjim 4 hours agorootparentprevI think you are agreeing with the parent comment with a tone of disagreement. They say they let cold air in during the winter because they want to lower the humidity. Then you say that, if you let cold air in (and then let it heat back up again) then you end up with lower humidity. The only thing you might disagree on is exactly what humidity you would like inside your house. But that's subjective. (As it happens, I agree with them: I often find it too humid inside during the winter, because I've restricted airflow to keep the heat in.) reply littlestymaar 4 hours agorootparentprevBut household activities like cooking, showering, drying laundry, or even just washing the dishes etc. generate tons of moisture, and this moisture is the reason why your home has ventilation in the first place: to get it out and avoid mold! There's a problem with “dumb” ventilation systems though: they can't really adapt to big variations in outdoor conditions, and as such they tend to such way too much air out of your house than needed during the cold days (and it also tend to be designed to suck cold air into dry room first, and get out from wet rooms, when you want it the other way round when it's very cold). reply crazygringo 1 hour agorootparentNot in the winter though! In the hot and humid summer you're definitely trying to reduce indoor humidity. But in the winter when it's bone-dry? A hot shower barely makes a difference. I keep two humidifiers running all winter long just to bring indoor humidity up to 35% or 40% where it's healthy. Otherwise it often goes down to 15% or even 10% on cold winter days, which is terribly unhealthy. reply danans 11 hours agorootparentprevNot in cold climates where in winter the air outdoors is very dry. Heating systems in such climates often have integrated humidifiers. reply littlestymaar 11 hours agorootparentThen it just means that you're overventilating! We emit much more steam (through cooking and showering for instance) than we consume oxygen/emit CO2 so controlling the humidity is the main purpose of ventilation, air renewal comes for free as a byproduct of that. reply manmal 11 hours agorootparentMy system doesn’t over ventilate - we sometimes have too high CO2 in the bed rooms, but humidity is way too low in winters, sometimes below 30%. That means getting sick more often and having irritated airways at times. reply cwillu 10 hours agorootparentprevFor reference, it is currently 84% relative humidity and -20°C outside where I live. This is about the same absolute humidity as 5% relative humidity at 22°C (i.e., inside). reply littlestymaar 3 hours agorootparentAn all you need to bring that up to above 50% is 2cl/cubic meter of water! A sponge drying up in your kitchen sink is enough to raise your kitchen's air humidity by 10%. Shut down your ventilation and you'll see, you won't suffocate but instead you'll get mold starting to pop-up. Moisture is the reason why houses have ventilation system in the first place. As I said elsewhere in this thread, though, there's a problem with “dumb” ventilation systems though: they can't really adapt to big variations in outdoor conditions, and as such they tend to suck way too much air out of your house than needed during the cold days. reply crazygringo 1 hour agorootparent> A sponge drying up in your kitchen sink is enough to raise your kitchen's air humidity by 10%. That's simply not correct. I go through liters of water a day with my two humidifiers just to try to raise humidity by around 20 percentage points.

In the summer, it’s around 50% with the same level of ventilation. This generally has been the case everywhere I’ve lived; in the summer, you’re cooling air, which (all else equal) increases the relative humidity of that air. In the winter, you’re heating air, which decreases the relative humidity of that air. reply littlestymaar 8 hours agorootparent> while being very poorly ventilated (~900ppm CO2) Aren't you missing a zero of something?

Possibly just different terms used in different countries where the humidity is a bigger problem (very hot and/or very cold outside air). This current OpenERV product appears to use dessicants for this purpose but might be an optional add-on? reply mrspuratic 4 hours agorootparentA perfect ERV will recover the heat (occurs naturally by a temperature difference) and the latent heat (associated with condensation/evaporation). i.e. water vapour in the outbound flow should be transferred the inbound flow. This is to avoid energy loss that would occur when moisture condenses (i.e. the latent heat) by using an adsorbant material to capture moisture before it escapes, or a membrane that allows moisture in the outbound flow to pass to the inbound flow. reply esskay 9 hours agorootparentprevDoes very much depend on your location. In the UK a dehumidifier is still often a good idea in the winter because although our humidity drops, its nowhere near enough. Inside can still be high 50's, in older properties it'll never really go below 60%. Really a lot of our older homes shoud be retrofitted with a MVHR unit to help things as ventelation is awful in most houses. I'm actually quite surprised a lot of landlords in the UK don't do it as theres always a fight between them and their tenants who don't necesserily want to leave a window open all day in the winter to stop mold. reply ZeroGravitas 8 hours agorootparentPositive Input Ventilation (PIV) units seem to be a new thing for landlords to battle this problem. I think it basically trickles in cold (and therefore drier) air into a central space to reduce humidity, like an (slower, quieter) extractor fan in reverse.

I'm sorry I don't have a bunch of units ready to ship out, as the site says it's still in beta, I am to be honest kind of taking my time because I have another project, the big quiet fan, which is actually funded a little better, and thus I've been directing most of my time to that. But I do advance this a bit most days. I have a twitter where I tweet my progress : @open_erv, and also I'm on bluesky. I have shipped a few units to other engineers who have/will test the units so I can share third party confirmation for any skeptics. To clarify some of the discussion, it is not a counterflow heat exhanger, it is a regenerative type. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_heat_exchanger. I prefer this type because they can recover latent heat more effectively than recouperative (such as counterflow) type, and latent heat is 40-50% of the total energy content of the air, seasonal average in Ottawa or Toronto. I am hoping to get the machine tested by the PassiveHaus institute to show beyond doubt how good the efficiency is with a third party test. I have no doubt, I have tested it myself, though. These can theoretically handy any temperature differential, but the TW4 and WM12 are currently made of a polymer that I wouldn't trust in an extremely hot climate combined with direct sunlight. For that reason, I am focussed on cold climate scenarios. I am pretty sure it will not frost up even in extremely cold weather like -30. I used it last year in my window and had no problem, and it did get to like -25 at least iirc. reply schneems 4 hours agoparentThis is neat! I had some issues with ventilation in a foamed house and the only product that’s not a whole home ERV (which, I didn’t have space or ducting) was the Panasonic whispercomfort which actually has some requirements that were hard to meet (minimum duct length) and the overall efficiency isn’t that great. We put in two and have fresh air intake on our HVAC units. Still we’ve taken to running at least one bathroom or laundry fan non-stop. I’m excited for more competition in this space.

Installing it was quite involved, but not hard. Definitely within reach of anyone with basic DIY skills. The hardest part is finding a good spot for the ventilation unit, which is about the size of a large, old CRT TV. You have to run ducting from there to multiple rooms, but their ducting system is easy to install. Mine draws about 20W/hour at its typical setting, and it greatly improves comfort. Keeps some of the humidity out when it's humid out, keeps some moisture in when it's dry out. Fresh air year round. Keeps mosquitos out. Keeps some dust/particulates out. Worth the effort, even in my small house. A decentralized unit would be a lot easier to install, but I imagine it's less efficient, less suitable for larger dwellings, and probably louder. YMMV. reply ilyagr 12 hours agoprevI'm confused how the heat retention could be around 80-90% without expending a ton of energy. Naively, if on average the same amount of air goes in and out, I'd expect the temperature of the heat exchanger (on average in space and time, eventually) to be the average of the outside and inside temperatures. If the outside is hotter, the air coming in would be cooler than the outside air (which is a win), but it couldn't be cooler than the average of the temperatures. So, it would still not be anywhere as cool as the inside air, which doesn't sound like 90% heat retention. Is the heat exchanger attached to a heater or a cooler? The linked video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDCu0IbEn8Q , would suggest not, as it talks about saving the energy needed for cooling or heating. Is there another clever trick? reply singron 12 hours agoparentWhat you describe is kind of like a theoretical heat exchanger that only averages temperature at a single point. You can improve this by exchanging heat across a continuous length along opposing flows. Imagine two parallel pipes thermally bonded where fluids flow in opposite directions. Each point still averages the temperatures, but the average temperature varies across the length and approaches the interior temperature on the interior side and the exterior temperature on the exterior side. reply ilyagr 12 hours agorootparentYeah, I think this makes sense. If you connect many of my heat exchangers in series, the temperature gradient increases; only the middle one will work at the average of the inside and outside temperature (the example of 3 in a row makes sense to me). At the limit, it becomes what you described. Thanks! reply vanderZwan 7 hours agorootparentThe mechanism described is called a countercurrent exchange.

Regenerative exchange is, at least to my understanding, more of a cyclical store and release process. reply snewman 12 hours agoparentprevThere isn't a uniform temperature across the entire exchanger. There's a smooth gradient extending from one end to the other. If the outside is hotter, then the inbound air gradually cools as it gives up heat to the outbound air which is gradually warming. reply GistNoesis 9 hours agoparentprevI find the idea of reversing the air flow direction every 30s simpler to understand than two counter-flowing pipe side by side. Imagine a pipe filled with 3 metallic grid sections (such that the air temperature in the section will equalize with the metal temperature) separated by plastic grids (such that the heat isn't conducted through the metal), and you push air alternatively from one hot side at 20°C to a cold side at 0°C for 30s and in the other direction for 30s. For symmetry reason, the pipe will passively (we don't count the energy required to move the air) have a gradient of temperature from the hot side to the cold side. The first section will be ~15°C, the second ~ 10°C, the third ~5°C. (Each section temperature is the temporal average of the temperature of the air flowing from previous sections : so because air switch direction, it means it's the average of left and right sections.) From the point of view of the house, you only lose energy from the first section of the pipe which will be more like 15°C rather than 0°C. reply LukeShu 12 hours agoparentprevCounter-flow heat exchangers can be very efficient, without a heater or cooler attached. That said, I don't think I've seen a commercial ERV claim to be more than 80% efficient, so I'm skeptical of the 90% measurement. (I've seen ERVs with heaters attached; but for the purpose of avoiding frost buildup when it's below freezing outside.) reply cheeseface 10 hours agorootparentIn my experience 80% plus is quite common in the models sold for colder environments.

Countercurrent-flow heat exchangers (where the two channels of the fluid/gas) move in opposite directions on both sides of the heat-transfer mechanism maintain a heat flow gradient over the entire length of the heat exchanger. This can result in an almost complete transfer of heat from one current to another. High efficiency HRV/ERVs use counter-current flow heat exchangers. reply cyberax 12 hours agoparentprev> I'm confused how the heat retention could be around 80-90% without expending a ton of energy. Imagine two air streams counter-flowing. They \"swap places\" within your heat exchanger, so you can (theoretically) get 100% heat recovery. This principle is used by animals to minimize the heat waste, by counter-flowing warm and cold blood: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rete_mirabile reply cies 10 hours agoparentprevI'm not 100% sure about this. But with ERV (opposed to HRVs), iirc, also the moist of the air is transferred to the incoming air.

Because the flows are counter to each other, there's always a temperature difference driving heat transfer across the dividing walls, even as the warm air gradually cools and the cold air gradually warms. The lightweight plastic walls are advantageous here - while plastic isn't particularly conductive, the walls are so thin that heat transfers readily. It's how these heat exchangers can achieve 80-90% efficiency without needing any expensive materials or thermal mass. The warm exhaust air leaves only slightly warmer than the incoming cold air, having transferred most of its heat to the incoming stream.

Oh man I had this discussion with my wife yesterday, we have a small electric heater in a room where a pipe burst and I still need to fix that (no heating means instant fungus problems). It keeps its fan rotating always, that way it determines the input temp for its thermostat more accurately. But wife insists it is sometimes blowing cold air and thus very very bad... I explain what a thermostat is (bimetals and all) and that she experiences \"coldness\" because a layer of warm air is blown from her skin, it's not blowing cold air... she doesn't follow... I even measure the energy usage and the thing only uses 20 W or so when just blowing, not heating. Even when just blowing it's moving cold moist air from the walls so overall good.

OPenERV states they want to get it tested by Passivehause institute but also say no lab data measured yet.

I didn't find enough information on the hardware side, no BOM, no hardware documentation. I think that, if the author would like to actually boost DIY adoption, it'd be worth having a step by step assembly guide. At the same time, when reading the page, I had a feeling like it's more supposed to be a way of advertising a future commercial product, not really focusing on the FOSS/DIY side.

Have looked in this kind of systems, for my parents. The use case was basically, not about energy efficiency, but rather noise protection - to be able to sleep with a closed windows. I think so far I always had two issues (in that usecase). - First the device by itself - produces a bit noise like 42db might be too much for some people if you want to sleep. Especially some of the devices are using one ventilator, which switches directions and won't produce homogeneous noise. - Second 60 CFM is fine, but if you want to have the feeling of an open window - it should be much more and most devices can't deliver that. Also the heat exchange thing is kind of cool in the winter for sure. In the summer, you often have the case that in the evening you house is much warmer than the air outside - so you would like to turn the heat exchange off in the winter.

In the UK where most houses don't have air conditioning, you really don't want heat recovery for 1/3 of the year.

I would love some sort of intelligent house ventilation system which could do all that. Heat recovery when it makes sense, normal ventilation when it doesn't. All automated based on dT and relative humidities. reply ZeroGravitas 8 hours agorootparentI think with this model you can do this as long as you install them in a synced pair (which I think is the baseline assumption). Normal (heat recovery mode) you have them reverse flow every 60 seconds or so to swap heat. In cooling mode you just run then continually. One is bringing in fresh air and the other is removing stale air. The heat store in the intake will soon cool to the outside temp and the heat store in the output is irrelevant (apart from maybe slowing the air flow and creating noise). If you manually control the system you could combine with a few open windows to create cross breezes even on still evenings. reply farawayea 1 hour agoprevSome of these instructions have fiber glass or similar for insulation which appears to be used for this. It's not something anyone would want next to their ventilation system or inside it. This isn't something to even consider without some expert reviews. The projects are also work in progress and overall incomplete with many details missing. Be careful when you do anything involving ERV and HRV. It's very easy to cause serious damage to the property you live in, harm yourself and others in an irreversible way, or even both. reply coryfklein 1 hour agoprevWait, is the air outdoors generally cleaner than the air indoors? Certainly not true in the Salt Lake valley for the 4 months of the year we get persistent inversion. reply NavinF 1 hour agoparentThe CO2 levels outside are definitely lower than inside. Often by 4x. Fixing that without freezing is the main use case for an ERV reply ucefkh 3 hours agoprevThis is amazing but needs much clearer docs rbh reply londons_explore 8 hours agoprevSo, this doesn't use a traditional heat exchanger. Instead it appears to \"pulse\" air inwards then outwards through a series of fins. It effectively heats the fins slightly in one direction, then cools them again slightly in the opposite direction. Same with wetting and drying for recovering moisture. I am surprised that the fins appear to be plastic - one would imagine that steel fins would have far better thermal capacity reply aojdwhsd 3 hours agoprevThis looks great. How well does the WM12 circulate the air, with the intake and exhaust being so close? reply ZeroGravitas 8 hours agoprevThere's some comments here suggesting that the incoming and outgoing air pass each other in a heat exchanger. But this is a different model that passes he two streams in turn through a heat sink: > Recuperative types are what most people think of, consisting of a thin layer of material that separates two gas streams. Regenerative heat exchangers are different. They briefly store the energy while air flows in one direction, then release it when the air flow reverses. I have to admit I am slightly more dubious about this type as they are new to me, though I did see a YouTube video about a commercial one recently and they seem to be a hot new thing. Possibly this is something sensible that only becomes practical with software and wireless communication? Rather than running ducts to a central location. Though then fitting two side by side in a window seems odd. Why not use the traditional type in that case? reply mrspuratic 5 hours agoparentI have two equivalent regenerative commercial units (HRV, no vapour handling) fitted at opposite sides of a mostly open plan ground floor. They use a heavy ceramic core, and sync for opposite or coordinated flow (optional). They go up to 60m3/h (~35CFM) which is extractor fan level for me, 60CFM (~100m3/h) is quite a step up. They were under €200 a unit about 18 months ago. They are rated 90% recovery at low speed. Today it's 11C 75%RH outside, 18C 65%RH inside, at low speed (15m3/h rated at 1.2W) there's barely a difference: 17.8-17.9C air intake temperature. They keep the air noticeably fresh, drier and also keep the CO2 down (85% sensible and comparable latent efficiency, at 60 cfm. It also has twice the maximal flow of that device. It's got many other features as well, and is more durable. Ultimately, it's about return on investment. You have to make a spreadsheet and see which one is best, given the actual tested values for efficiency flow, maintenance cost, etc. If that's not possible, it's a shot in the dark. reply torginus 10 hours agoprevThis looks wonderful, but it operates on the assumption that outdoor air is something you'd actually want to breathe where you live :) Unfortunately, due to cars and dirty heating systems around where I live, outdoor air tends to be not great. reply madduci 11 hours agoprevNice idea, but why do they use Google Drive for sharing their code? reply m12k 11 hours agoparentPoor man's CDN? reply zo1 8 hours agorootparentOr a very quick way to get your personal email address blocked.

If you have sorbent, it gets grabbed out of the air before it can condense. reply 4gotunameagain 9 hours agoprevThat is very nice, and I really appreciate that the design files are open source. Great work. I cannot help to wonder what brings the total cost to $600, the price of a modern, powerful computer. And yes, I am familiar with the economy of scale :) reply londons_explore 7 hours agoparentLooks to me like a low cost version of the same could be designed with 2 CPU fans ($1), and a large 3D print ($1 - for the DIY version) or injection moulding for a commercial version ($0.30). Do time-sync between the units with grid frequency sampling (free), and have the whole thing controlled by a 2 cent microcontroller and a pair of triacs. The whole thing, designed and made in China could probably come to a BOM under $4, and retail in the USA for $12. reply 4gotunameagain 6 hours agorootparentWhile I agree with your points, $0.30 for injection moulding would need quite the scale, and I have doubts about whether two CPU fans would have enough power to flow enough air even in the absence of a HEPA filter. reply londons_explore 5 hours agorootparentInjection moulding is cheaper than you imagine now. The cheapest moulds start from about $250, and there are plenty of companies who will make a mould and make and ship 5k parts within 7 days. These designs would need quite a few changes to be injection moulding compatible - for one thing the fins are probably going to have to be flat not circular due to draft angle requirements. Changing the core to a roll of embossed steel foil might be a better bet, and whilst that would add about $1 to the price, it would also make the product work better and be more compact or more efficient due to a higher thermal mass in the core. reply 4gotunameagain 4 hours agorootparentGot any links for the $250 moulds and companies ? Maybe I could use them in my own project :) reply londons_explore 4 hours agorootparentSend these guys a message: https://zhongshengmould.en.alibaba.com/ Never pay for a mould to be made with plans to ship the mould itself to another manufacturer - it's a common scam.

I live in a place where supposedly the air is of good quality, and yet, when I open the windows, the all place gets a thin film of black dust on all surfaces - most probably due to the particle emissions and tire degradation dust from vehicles from the highway nearby. The solution I've found is to open the windows every day for about half an hour and then put an air purifier to work. reply londons_explore 8 hours agoparentit appears the air filter is an optional extra, but incompatible with the storm vent. reply open_erv2 5 hours agorootparentThe filter is a bit messed up right now, you can put one on the TW4 but not the WM12. reply 20after4 13 hours agoprevThis looks really cool!

It can't be both! Marketing bullshit aside, this looks great! reply throw4321 12 hours agoparentPeople breathe, so you need outdoor air to replenish the oxygen and get rid of the carbon dioxide. That's \"fresh\" air. Unfortunately, outdoor air has particulate and ozone pollution. Filtering it gives you \"clean\" air. In winter and summer, you also heat or cool the indoor air for comfort. If you just pump in outside air, you effectively also pump out the indoor air. This wastes the energy that had gone into heating or cooling it. These systems save that energy by transfering heat between the air that's getting pumped in and the air that's getting pumped out. reply LukeShu 13 hours agoparentprevFairly standard language for describing what an ERV does. Low-CO2 outdoor air vs high-CO2 indoor air, if you prefer. Important for how air-tight modern energy-efficient construction is. reply 20after4 13 hours agoparentprevThat kind of depends on where you live.

What you want is something like this device with the H13 filter option. Maybe that plus carbon. reply positr0n 12 hours agorootparentprevThink of it this way, since you aren't dying of asphyxiation when you sleep at night, you're already getting some air exchange with the outside air. With an ERV you can control how much air you get, and put whatever filter you want in between the outside air and your room. In fact the fancier systems will let you overpressure your house by running the fan pushing in slightly higher than the air pushing out, ensure air only leaks out of your house not in. reply nubinetwork 12 hours agoprevWhy can't I just glue a fan to an air filter? reply stackghost 11 hours agoparentYou could do this as an air purifier, but it will primarily just remove particulates and other HEPA-y things. It won't actually bring fresh outside air in. You could glue a fan to an air filter and then position the thing in a window, to bring in outside air that then gets scrubbed by the filter. But now you're bringing in cold air in the winter, or hot air in the summer. An ERV brings in fresh air and mostly solves the problem of having cold air rushing in on a winter day, or hot air rushing in on a summer day. reply numpad0 10 hours agoparentprevOr open windows, but outside's cold in many places this time of the year. Energy recovery ventilators run stale outgoing air through a heatsink to pre-heat incoming fresh air to save heating costs. Sounds BS but it's a well established and widely used thing. reply margalabargala 11 hours agoparentprevThat won't decrease CO2 or VOC levels. reply jmb99 11 hours agoparentprevAir filters remove particulates down to some size, varying based on the filter. They do not scrub CO2 or CO, nor do they (generally) remove other things like VOCs - unless they’re really, really expensive filters. Opening a window exchanges all that junk to be roughly equal to the baseline of your environment, which for most people is at least lower CO2 levels. reply Hippocrates 10 hours agoprevWhat’s so good about fresh air? Like I don’t want stinky stuffy air but as someone with central HVAC I had no issues with my indoor air. Are we trying to get outdoor smells? Or is it something else? reply reubenmorais 10 hours agoparentHigh CO2 levels impair cognition and stale air accumulates pathogens, not just smells. The V in your HVAC stands for Ventilation, so you're already getting fresh air, that's probably why you have no complaints. If you live in an air tight apartment with no forced circulation where CO2 levels spike super fast requiring ventilation several times a day, it's a different story. reply ghosty141 10 hours agoparentprevIn the winter it's cold outside and opening the window cools down the room -> no ventilation most of the time. In the summer it's not a problem for me, I leave my windows partially open all the time but in the winter especially when working from home this would be quite neat.

    "originBody": "Map of GitHub This is a map of 400,000+ GitHub projects. Each dot is a project. Dots are close to each other if they have a lot of common stargazers. Logo by Louise Kashcha, 9 years old. Thank you ❤ How was it made? The first step was to fetch who gave stars to which repositories. For this I used a public data set of github activity events on Google BigQuery, considering only events between Jan 2020 and March 2023. This gave me more than 350 million stars. (Side note: Mind blowing to think that Milky Way has more than 100 billion stars) In the second phase I computed exact Jaccard Similarity between each repository. For my home computer's 24GB RAM this was too much, however an AWS EC2 instance with 512GB of RAM chewed through it in a few hours. (Side note: I tried other similarities too, but Jaccard gave the most believable results) In the third phase I used a few clustering algorithms to split repositories together. I liked Leiden clustering the best and ended up with 1000+ clusters. In the fourth phase I used my own ngraph.forcelayout to compute layouts of nodes inside clusters, and a separate configuration to get global layout of clusters. In the fifth phase we need to render the map. Unlike my previous projects, I didn't want to reinvent the wheel, so ended up using maplibre. All I had to do was convert my data into GeoJSON format, generate tiles with tippecanoe and configure the browsing experience. Country names A lot of country labels were generated with help of ChatGPT. If you find something wrong, you can right click it, edit, and send a pull request - I'd be grateful. The query that I used to generate labels was: Please analyze these repository and detect a common theme (e.g. programming language, technology, domain). Pay attention to language too (english, chinese, korean, etc.). If there is no common theme found, please say so. Otherwise, If you can find a strong signal for a common theme please come up with a specific name for imaginary country that contains all these repositories. Give a few options. When you give an option prefer more specific over generic option (for example if repositories are about recommender systems, use that, instead of generic DeepLearning) Geocoding? To implement a searchbox, I used a simple dump of all repositories, indexed by their first letter (or their author's). So when you type a in the search box, I look up all repositories that start with a and show them to you with fuzzy matcher on the client. Design Most of the time I like data presented by this project better than visual design of the map. If you have experience designing maps or just have a wonderful design vision how it should look like - please don't hesitate to share. I'm still looking for the style that matches the data. Support If you find this project useful and would like to support it - please join the support group. If you need any help with this project or have any questions - don't hesitate to open an issue here or ping me on twitter Thank you to all my friends and supporters who helped me to get this project off the ground: Ryan, Andrey, Alex, Dmytro.

It's a bit hazy now, but I remember trying hdbscan algorithm (hierarchical clustering), and on the graph of the GitHub size - I just couldn't fit it in memory.

And then some clustering algorithm makes sense of this giant graph by laying out sets of nodes that have a lot of edges to each other, close to each other The closeness is just layout, the edges is the data structure that determines closeness. reply anvaka 5 hours agorootparentThis is correct! reply minimaxir 17 hours agoparentprevJaccard similarity returns a value between 0 and 1 (in this case the vast majority of the values being close to 0). I suspect there's a hard-coded threshold value to determine an edge, e.g. if Jaccard similarity between A and B is > 0.2, create an edge. reply boxed 13 hours agoprevDjango is in the middle of Pythonia, and not in Djangonia.

In contrast, it's fairly difficult to publish something on Maven Central (the main Java repository).

The language runtime is getting ever faster, the packagist ecosystem in combination with composer (PHP's package manager) are rock-solid, there are event loops and application servers by now, serverless deployments are the default operation mode, and with Laravel or Symfony, there are trusted and extremely versatile frameworks available that do stuff out of the box that require lots of manual efforts with other languages.

    "originBody": "Why Dumb TVs Deserve a Comeback By John Awa-abuon Published 1 day ago Follow Like Thread 3 Link copied to clipboard Sign In To Your MUO Account Africa Studio/Shutterstock QUICK LINKS Smart TVs Are Built to Become Obsolete Smart TVs Have a Bloatware Problem Privacy Risks Streaming Devices Are the Real Smart Choice What Dumb TVs Would Need to Return With a Bang When was the last time you turned on your TV and felt like it was just...a TV? No startup screens, no sluggish apps, no constant reminders to update firmware or sign in to a dozen streaming accounts. For all their conveniences, smart TVs have taken something simple and overcomplicated it, which is why dumb TVs deserve a comeback. Smart TVs Are Built to Become Obsolete Nate Williams / MakeUseOf On the surface, smart TVs seem like the ultimate convenience. They combine your favorite apps, streaming services, and internet connectivity into one device. But there’s a catch: they’re designed to become obsolete far sooner than their \"dumb\" counterparts. The issue lies in the software. Smart TVs rely on operating systems that manufacturers often stop updating within a few years of release. This leaves users stuck with outdated apps, slower performance, and an overall clunky experience. Features you paid for—like built-in Netflix or YouTube—might become unusable as platforms evolve, but your TV doesn’t. Compare this to a good old dumb TV. A basic model focuses on display quality and longevity, often lasting over a decade if well maintained. When paired with a separate streaming device like a Roku or Chromecast, you can keep up with the latest streaming technology by swapping out the device, not the entire TV. Smart TVs are, unfortunately, more like smartphones: designed for frequent replacement. And with their hefty price tags, that’s an expensive cycle. This built-in obsolescence makes the case for simpler alternatives even stronger. Smart TVs Have a Bloatware Problem Have you ever scrolled through your smart TV’s home screen and wondered, “Why are there so many apps I’ll never use?” That’s bloatware—pre-installed software that takes up space, slows down performance, and often serves little to no purpose for the average user. Bloatware isn’t just annoying; it’s a symptom of how smart TVs prioritize profit over user experience. Manufacturers often partner with app developers or advertisers to include certain apps on your TV, even if you never open them. Worse, some of these apps can’t be removed, leaving your screen cluttered with icons that do nothing but remind you of what you didn’t ask for. This extra software can bog down your TV’s performance over time. Smart TVs already struggle with limited processing power compared to dedicated streaming devices, and the more apps they carry, the slower they tend to get. Dumb TVs, on the other hand, don’t suffer from these issues because they focus solely on delivering a high-quality viewing experience. Pair one with a compact streaming stick or box, and you can tailor your setup to include only the apps you actually use. Privacy Risks LG Every time you turn on a smart TV, there’s a good chance it’s watching you back. Many smart TVs collect data on your viewing habits, preferences, and even the apps you use. This data is often sold to advertisers or used to push targeted ads directly to your TV screen. A common security risk associated with smart TVs is Automatic Content Recognition (ACR), which tracks what’s on your screen and sends this data to advertisers. The Center for Digital Democracy (CDD) published an in-depth report in October 2024 exposing how smart TVs were tracking what users watched. Privacy concerns don’t stop at what you watch. Some smart TVs have voice controls or cameras, which, if not properly secured, could be vulnerable to hacking (but there are steps you can take to protect your TV from cyber-attacks). Even when these features are used as intended, they raise questions about how much personal information is stored or shared. Pairing a dumb TV with a trusted streaming device gives you greater control over your privacy, as you can choose a device with robust privacy settings or opt out of certain features altogether. Streaming Devices Are the Real Smart Choice Amazon/Walmart/Apple If you’re wondering how a dumb TV could keep up with today’s streaming-focused entertainment world, the answer is simple: streaming devices. Roku, Fire TV, Apple TV, and Chromecast have become the real brains behind modern viewing. They’re built specifically to handle apps and updates, and streaming devices often outperform smart TVs in terms of performance and longevity. Streaming devices are purpose-built for performance; if one becomes outdated, replacing it is far cheaper and less wasteful than buying a whole new TV. Similarly, smart TVs lock you into a specific operating system, while streaming devices let you choose your preferred ecosystem. Prefer Apple’s seamless integration across devices? Go for Apple TV. Want an affordable option with wide app compatibility? Roku has you covered. Streaming devices are also less intrusive when it comes to data collection. While they’re not entirely free from tracking, they generally allow for more transparency and user control over privacy settings. Streaming devices can be secured against malware with the right steps, offering a safer alternative to smart TVs. What Dumb TVs Would Need to Return With a Bang Samsung Dumb TVs are the perfect solution for simplicity and privacy, but to make a comeback, they need to step up their game. Most current models lag behind in features that modern consumers expect, which is why they’ve been overshadowed by their “smarter” counterparts. One major area for improvement is display quality. If you're shopping for a dumb TV, you may have noticed that many dumb TVs are limited to older resolutions like 720p, which can’t compete with the 4K and even 8K displays offered by smart TVs. For a comeback to succeed, dumb TVs need crisp, vibrant visuals that cater to today’s high-definition content standards. Size is another factor. Dumb TVs are often small, catering to niche markets like kitchen or guest room setups. To compete in living rooms, they need to offer larger screen sizes—think 43 inches and up—while maintaining a sleek, modern design. Connectivity options also need an upgrade. HDMI ports, ARC (Audio Return Channel) support for soundbars, and USB inputs should be standard. This would enable users to easily pair external devices without feeling limited by outdated technology. Finally, dumb TVs should be marketed as a conscious choice, not just a budget option. Promoting their privacy benefits, longevity, and compatibility with external streaming devices could position them as the go-to choice for tech-savvy, privacy-conscious buyers. If manufacturers combine these improvements with the inherent advantages of dumb TVs—longevity, privacy, and affordability—they might just win over consumers looking for a smarter way to watch TV, without the \"smart.\" Entertainment Smart TV Television Follow Like Share Readers like you help support MakeUseOf.

And agree totally that using an external streaming device for longer app access is a better option. How I achieve dumb tv effect on modern offerings? After initial setup of TV to allow any firmware update, that premium TV is denied internet access. Using a streaming device obviously needs net access so that alone of tv + streamer has it. As noted in your article there are generally more/better optout choices in a streamer vs what a modern TV has. Though no streaming devices are ZERO share anything. My solution deals with problem as it exists right now. Buy whatever TV you like for style, features, size, price and simply never use the built in net access on chosen TV. 2024-12-15 23:39:04 Terms Privacy Feedback RECOMMENDED Here's Yet Another Reason Not to Connect Your Smart TV to the Internet Smart TV Owning a smart TV is a tiring, privacy-invading process. 11 Sep 30, 2024 I Stopped Binging Shows and Now I Enjoy Them More Than Ever Media Streaming Treating shows like a race isn't the way to enjoy a good show. 1 2 days ago Why I've Started Listening to 24/7 Live Radio Stations Over Playlists Internet Radio While creating playlists can be tons of fun, sometimes you want to sit back and let the music take care of itself. 2 days ago I'm Done With Streaming Platforms: Here's Why I'm Heading Back to Cable Media Streaming Streaming services are pricing themselves out of the market, and I'm done with it. 19 Aug 28, 2024 Netflix Launches New Virtual Fireplaces to Waste Your Time This Christmas Netflix If you don't have a real fireplace, Netflix's virtual fireplaces are a good alternative. 3 days ago Use These 10 Christmas-Themed YouTube Backgrounds to Set a Festive Mood Media Streaming Get in the spirit with these Holiday-themed ambient backgrounds to help ramp up that Christmas feeling. 1 4 days ago TECHNOLOGY EXPLAINED PC & MOBILE The Best Dark Web Browser for Your Device 22 hours ago You Can Now Talk to Your Podcast \"Hosts\" With This AI Product From Google 3 days ago The 9 Best Local/Offline LLMs You Can Try Right Now 3 days ago See More TRENDING NOW You Can Now Chat to Santa Using ChatGPT's Voice Mode Every Photo Editing App Has AI Features Now, but They Only Need These 7 This Bose Bluetooth Speaker Sounds So Good That It’s Worth Carrying Around",

Manufacturers make recurring revenue by invading the privacy of \"dumb\" users with their \"smart\" TVs. It's probably only a matter of time before TV manufacturers establish their own ad networks. Why? Because they can.

If you are within the allowable time period for returns under the applicable return policy, you may return the Television to your seller for a refund, subject to the terms of such return policy. You should perform a factory reset before you return it to erase data that may be stored on the Television.” reply EMIRELADERO 1 hour agorootparentThat rubbish is probably unenforceable anyway. That being said, this is the first time I've ever seen an EULA be this brazen and predatory. Claiming that I'm not allowed to use the entire device because I don't agree to some post-sale contract? In writing? Are you sure you want to do that TCL?!?!? reply jqpabc123 12 minutes agorootparentThat rubbish is probably unenforceable anyway. It may depend on your jurisdiction but here in the USA, I'm pretty sure it's legal because they offer a full refund if you chose not to accept. There are alternative ways to coerce users into playing along. For example, simply store/retrieve TV configuration in the cloud. Without connectivity configured, the TV starts over from scratch in device setup on every power up. And connectivity obviously opens the possibility for other uses. reply reginald78 5 hours agorootparentprevThe more nefarious play would be to have the TV stop functioning if the EULA is rejected but only after the return period has passed. reply freedomben 19 hours agorootparentprevCan anyone confirm this?

They are not all the same --- even within the same manufacturer. A lot of newer firmwares will launch into setup every time you power up if access is not configured. The TV configuration data is most likely being saved/retrieved from their cloud. This serves as their connectivity test. Without wifi setup, my new Hisense 4k \"budget\" model does this *unless* you run it in \"store\" mode. Dealing with setup on every power up is possible --- but obviously highly annoying over time --- and this is by design. The manufacturers desperately want the data collection $. It's the only way some of them make money. reply cjaackie 12 hours agorootparentprevI think this is the way, just don’t give it wifi access! Fun story, my sony has android tv and can play MKV files off a flash drive (eg. a non-streaming tv show), but the built in player is horrible (drops frames?).

GDPR is simply ignored by any bigger US company, it took 5 years for NOYB to facebook get fined which was less than 0.3% of their income, basically a small tax, not a huge fine. Also GDPR is full of inconsistency (face biometric data is special data, but a photo of your face from what anybody can get the biometric data is not) and loopholes (required by law, legitimate interest). They did something, but I wouldn't call that \"a long way\". reply danpalmer 18 hours agorootparent> GDPR is simply ignored by any bigger US company I work for a very large US company and can assure you that GDPR is something we pay a lot of attention to. This isn't the opinion of my employer, but my personal experience is that the big players take it seriously and meet and exceed all their obligations because it's too risky not to, and they have the necessary local legal teams to understand the law as best as is possible. I think it's the small/medium companies who are where most of the issues are. Small companies write a non-legalese privacy policy because they think that's better for their users, but in fact have written something legally meaningless that gives their users no protections. Some small companies just don't know their obligations because they think they won't apply as they're not in the EU. Then there are the companies who are big enough to know better, but small enough to know they can get away with it because all the scrutiny goes to big tech. I was asked by a medium sized advertising network to implement a keylogger on our website at my previous company so that the network could enforce their revenue sharing by detecting all user data input into our site and match it against their records. I laughed them out of the room, but they made it very clear this was how everyone did it. reply SR2Z 12 hours agorootparent> Some small companies just don't know their obligations because they think they won't apply as they're not in the EU. To be fair, unless a company has a business presence in the EU there is nobody to sue for GDPR violations.

From my experience working at multiple companies, and having interacted with others, the GDPR is not ignored by American companies. websites based out of the US block EU users to avoid fines, or these US based companies which don't block EU users have gone out of their way to comply with the GDPR as interpreted by their respective legal department. reply robertlagrant 6 hours agorootparentprev> less than 0.3% of their income, basically a small tax That's not how tax works.

When I read this I believe the poster is pointing out how the US has a tendency to politicized anything with the word 'regulation' associated with it to the detriment of the issue involved. For what it is worth, I too see the attack on 'regulation' without context or thought and it makes it hard to accomplish things as a society, but it also forces you to think of other ways things could get done. Convincing people to vote with their wallets or just bringing bad press are also ways to influence this issue.

Shit is ridiculous reply GuB-42 17 hours agoprevDumb TVs are called monitors, you can buy them. For large sizes, I guess you can look at the kind of displays they have in shops and meeting rooms. Today, TVs are by nature not dumb, what make them a TV and not a monitor would be the presence of a tuner, and modern tuners are built-in computers that can at least decode compressed video, which is not a trivial task, especially at 4K. The reason people don't like smart TVs is not because they have a computer inside of them with internet connectivity. It is because of ads and partnership deals. And of course people don't like it, because as much as manufacturers advertise them as features, they are not made to add value for the customer, they actually lower the value. But here is the thing: they lower the price even more. Let's say a manufacturer makes a TV intended to be sold for $300, they reach for their sponsors and can get $50 of deals. Now they can chose to sell a \"sponsored\" TV for $250 or one without the annoyances for $300, and as it turns out, the majority of customers will go for the $250 option. So much that there is no good economic reason to even sell that $300 ad-free TV, the niche is too small. Competitors without sponsorship deals and $300 TVs will be out-competed by that $250 TV and will have to adjust. As a result, we all have the \"smart TVs\" we hate (but with a price tag we love). Pros are ready to pay to avoid all that bullshit, but they don't need TVs either, they need monitors, that's why you can find monitors without that bullshit, for a price. reply demosthanos 16 hours agoparentYour model is oversimplified in a way that downplays the value of ads to the manufacturer. They don't reach out to sponsors and get a $50 static offer per TV in deals. They do some math and figure out that they can make at least $X per customer on average over the lifetime of the TV by selling ad slots dynamically. The subtle difference here is that because the sponsorships can be updated live across TVs that have already been sold, the actual value of each TV sale can be made to go up after the date of purchase by updating software and/or changing the ad deals. So the manufacturer isn't pricing the TVs at a discount precisely equal to the ad revenue they receive per TV, they have to price the TVs based on a complicated formula that includes both a rough estimate of the minimum value of ad deals and customer willingness to pay (keeping in mind that customers are choosing their willingness to pay based on a landscape that has no ad-free models!). And what's more, the manufacturer is free to alter the deal after the sale is made to try to make a larger profit per-TV than was originally priced in. You make it sound like it's a reasonable outcome of an efficient market, but the current situation—where one party can and does alter the deal retroactively and unilaterally—does not create an efficient market! reply nitwit005 16 hours agoparentprevIf it was purely competitive pressure, they'd be happy to let you pay extra to not have the ads. Instead, they seem to make an effort to make sure no such model is available in stores. People have go hunt down display models intended for businesses, or never connect them to the internet, and display media from another device. I suspect ultimately, they don't want to be manufacturers. They want control of a \"platform\" they can milk for infinite money, similar to what Facebook, Google, and friends have. reply Shaanie 10 hours agorootparentI suspect it's not quite that simple. First, is there actually enough demand for ad-free TVs to make the option worth including? I personally probably wouldn't pay $20 to avoid ads in the home screen since those kind of ads are just a minor nuisance, which makes me question the size of the market for the ad-free option. Second, what would the pricing be for the option? If it's $10-20, that'd probably be fine, similar to what Amazon did for Kindle. But if it's more than that, then I bet the negative PR they would get for including the option outweighs the potential benefit to customers. \"I would never buy an X, they're extremely greedy and want $50 just not to show ads. Crazy. I'll buy Y brand instead (which has ads but no 'corporate greed' option to not show them)\". reply nitwit005 1 hour agorootparentThey do actually sell screens with no ads for businesses, as mentioned. They just seemingly won't put them in stores where consumers can purchase them easily. reply acdha 4 hours agorootparentprevI would look at Google Contributor and similar efforts as a supporting argument. They tried a few times to allow you to pay directly and not see ads, and each time failed reportedly because it was a not loss for publishers. Google is not unbiased here but I suspect that this was a real problem and that it’d be even worse on TVs since most people are used to disruptive ads there. reply NemoNobody 12 hours agorootparentprevahh - this is what I do and why I've never noticed \"smart\" TVs.

At the high end the manufacturer can have its cake and eat it too. By pricing the TVs in the high income price bracket and ensuring there are no ad-free versions on the market (easy to do because most consumers don't choose devices based on ads or not, even if they find the ads irritating after the purchase), they get both the profit of selling a luxury item and the recurring ad revenue for selling ads that they can confidently tell advertisers will be seen by affluent people. OP's argument assumes an efficient market, which over-the-air updates ensure this market cannot be. reply aidenn0 13 hours agorootparentprevOn top of that, the dumb TVs could come from the same hardware line and just run different software.

The non-ad-supported options cost ~$20 (a bit less than 20%) more. Those still sell well enough to be worth selling both models. reply parineum 18 hours agorootparentprevYou would have to.

You could put in on the coffee table, but that takes up space and doesn't look great. You could mount it to the ceiling, but that's more of a pain than just putting a TV on the stand you already have. And either method makes it significantly more difficult to connect anything, including power, to the projector. Don't get me wrong, I think projectors are cool, but I'm not sure about their applicability to a large percentage of TV use-cases. Aside from expensive home theater type setups or janky dorm room style installs, both of which I'm a huge fan of, I'm not sure how the average person is supposed to use a projector. I would love to be wrong though, especially if it means I can use a projector in my fairly average living room layout. reply imgabe 16 hours agorootparentThe short-throw projectors only need to be a maximum of 12\" from the wall.

That is how I installed mine, above the couch. The install is easier then mounting a TV to the wall. The problem is light control. You want to have blackout curtains and you have to close them every time you want to watch something. And I might be out of touch with current offerings, but I think the sweetspot for price performance still has not LED options. Only entry and high end. The non-led projectors have a bit more fan noise and expensive to change the bulb, which has limited on-time. I had my entry level projector for 10 years now and the bulb is still fine. But I also don't watch that much. Paid ~700 EUR. I shitty smart tv with no internet probably also turns on faster.

Picture quality is substantially worse, and images are substantially less bright, than with TVs. People buy TVs on 3 axes: price, image, and smart features. Here we explicitly don't want the smart features, but TVs are much cheaper and much better image quality (even at that much cheaper price) than with projectors. Brightness matters a lot for where/when you can use them. reply Spivak 18 hours agorootparentProjector image quality is great, what kinds of projectors are you referencing? Image quality per dollar is a win for TVs but it's not that bad. $3k for a nice movie projector isn't crazy especially given the screen size. https://www.benq.com/en-us/projector/cinema/ht4550i.html And I agree that brightness is an issue but if you \"only\" want a 65-80\" screen then even modest ceiling mount projectors can pump out enough light to compete with daylight. reply danpalmer 18 hours agorootparentProjector image quality depends on the surface you're projecting onto, the angle you're projecting at, and the light in the room. Maybe the difference is less around $3k, but that's not most people's budget for a TV. Personally I have disposable income and care about image, and spent A$1k on a TV that I'm very happy with.

Like how the Pro Display XDR is a dumb monitor, not having speakers or a webcam. Apple already makes a good TV remote, which could probably be repurposed easily. And thanks to CEC, I never use my actual TV remote anymore except to navigate its settings menu on rare occasions. To me, the question is would it have an actual TV tuner in it? Would Apple bother with making a whole interface around scanning for channels and such when it’s not a common use case anymore, adds complexity, and isn’t necessarily in their interest financially?

ATSC 3.0 is suppose to have IP networking requirement for ad so Apple would probably be better of abandoning this if they're selling an add free privacy TV. reply dagmx 15 hours agoparentprevWhy would Apple make a dumb TV though? The Pro Display XDR exists because there’s nothing really comparable in the space with those specs and there’s a market to be had for it. The Studio display similarly exists because the only competitor for specs at the time was its own predecessor. Both exist at a price point where the specs (specifically resolution at those specific screen sizes and HDR for the XDR) trump the higher cost of entry, and they get paired with an Apple device to take advantage of those capabilities. TVs are highly competitive on cost because they’re effectively subsidized. Apple might have better processing but they’d get the same panels as everyone else. Unlike the Mac displays, they’d have to deal with the same content that every other TV has so that’s not a differentiator. There’s no money there for a dumb tv and there’s no differentiator for the average customer. Instead the expectation is that Apple would lplay to its strengths of vertical integration. Build in their Apple TV hardware with Homekit etc on board. If they did anything less it would be panned. The Apple TV experience would be the differentiator. It’s already miles ahead of the competition in the ways an average customer would care about, and brings apples privacy+ad stance to bear. reply bubblethink 13 hours agoparentprevThey don't make their displays in house.

It doesn't cost any less for a mfgr to make a dumb TV, in fact it would cost more. Modern TVs need a lot of computing power to make them work properly, so making the thing connect to the internet and show you ads really costs them nothing for hardware. Then they get to subsidize the TV with all the ad revenue, the kickbacks from the various streaming apps pre-installed, etc. A dumb TV would end up having the exact same hardware and a higher price tag. What kind of idiot would buy that? Not enough to make it worthwhile for the mfgr. If you don't want ads, just don't connect the TV to the internet. It's a lot like modern Windows laptops that are cheaper than the same laptop with Linux pre-installed.

    "originLink": "https://danluu.com/nothing-works/",
    "originBody": "There's a cocktail party version of the efficient markets hypothesis I frequently hear that's basically, \"markets enforce efficiency, so it's not possible that a company can have some major inefficiency and survive\". We've previously discussed Marc Andreessen's quote that tech hiring can't be inefficient here and here: Let's launch right into it. I think the critique that Silicon Valley companies are deliberately, systematically discriminatory is incorrect, and there are two reasons to believe that that's the case. ... No. 2, our companies are desperate for talent. Desperate. Our companies are dying for talent. They're like lying on the beach gasping because they can't get enough talented people in for these jobs. The motivation to go find talent wherever it is unbelievably high. Variants of this idea that I frequently hear engineers and VCs repeat involve companies being efficient and/or products being basically as good as possible because, if it were possible for them to be better, someone would've outcompeted them and done it already1. There's a vague plausibility to that kind of statement, which is why it's a debate I've often heard come up in casual conversation, where one person will point out some obvious company inefficiency or product error and someone else will respond that, if it's so obvious, someone at the company would have fixed the issue or another company would've come along and won based on being more efficient or better. Talking purely abstractly, it's hard to settle the debate, but things are clearer if we look at some specifics, as in the two examples above about hiring, where we can observe that, whatever abstract arguments people make, inefficiencies persisted for decades. When it comes to buying products and services, at a personal level, most people I know who've checked the work of people they've hired for things like home renovation or accounting have found grievous errors in the work. Although it's possible to find people who don't do shoddy work, it's generally difficult for someone who isn't an expert in the field to determine if someone is going to do shoddy work in the field. You can try to get better quality by paying more, but once you get out of the very bottom end of the market, it's frequently unclear how to trade money for quality, e.g., my friends and colleagues who've gone with large, brand name, accounting firms have paid much more than people who go with small, local, accountants and gotten a higher error rate; as a strategy, trying expensive local accountants hasn't really fared much better. The good accountants are typically somewhat expensive, but they're generally not charging the highest rates and only a small percentage of somewhat expensive accountants are good. More generally, in many markets, consumers are uninformed and it's fairly difficult to figure out which products are even half decent, let alone good. When people happen to choose a product or service that's right for them, it's often for the wrong reasons. For example, in my social circles, there have been two waves of people migrating from iPhones to Android phones over the past few years. Both waves happened due to Apple PR snafus which caused a lot of people to think that iPhones were terrible at something when, in fact, they were better at that thing than Android phones. Luckily, iPhones aren't strictly superior to Android phones and many people who switched got a device that was better for them because they were previously using an iPhone due to good Apple PR, causing their errors to cancel out. But, when people are mostly making decisions off of marketing and PR and don't have access to good information, there's no particular reason to think that a product being generally better or even strictly superior will result in that winning and the worse product losing. In capital markets, we don't need all that many informed participants to think that some form of the efficient market hypothesis holds ensuring \"prices reflect all available information\". It's a truism that published results about market inefficiencies stop being true the moment they're published because people exploit the inefficiency until it disappears. But with the job market examples, even though firms can take advantage of mispriced labor, as Greenspan famously did before becoming Chairman of the fed, inefficiencies can persist: Townsend-Greenspan was unusual for an economics firm in that the men worked for the women (we had about twenty-five employees in all). My hiring of women economists was not motivated by women's liberation. It just made great business sense. I valued men and women equally, and found that because other employers did not, good women economists were less expensive than men. Hiring women . . . gave Townsend-Greenspan higher-quality work for the same money . . . But as we also saw, individual firms exploiting mispriced labor have a limited demand for labor and inefficiencies can persist for decades because the firms that are acting on \"all available information\" don't buy enough labor to move the price of mispriced people to where it would be if most or all firms were acting rationally. In the abstract, it seems that, with products and services, inefficiencies should also be able to persist for a long time since, similarly, there also isn't a mechanism that allows actors in the system to exploit the inefficiency in a way that directly converts money into more money, and sometimes there isn't really even a mechanism to make almost any money at all. For example, if you observe that it's silly for people to move from iPhones to Android phones because they think that Apple is engaging in nefarious planned obsolescence when Android devices generally become obsolete more quickly, due to a combination of iPhones getting updates for longer and iPhones being faster at every price point they compete at, allowing the phone to be used on bloated sites for longer, you can't really make money off of this observation. This is unlike a mispriced asset that you can buy derivatives of to make money (in expectation). A common suggestion to the problem of not knowing what product or service is good is to ask an expert in the field or a credentialed person, but this often fails as well. For example, a friend of mine had trouble sleeping because his window air conditioner was loud and would wake him up when it turned on. He asked a trusted friend of his who works on air conditioners if this could be improved by getting a newer air conditioner and his friend said \"no; air conditioners are basically all the same\". But any consumer who's compared items with motors in them would immediately know that this is false. Engineers have gotten much better at producing quieter devices when holding power and cost constant. My friend eventually bought a newer, quieter, air conditioner, which solved his sleep problem, but he had the problem for longer than he needed to because he assumed that someone whose job it is to work on air conditioners would give him non-terrible advice about air conditioners. If my friend were an expert on air conditioners or had compared the noise levels of otherwise comparable consumer products over time, he could've figured out that he shouldn't trust his friend, but if he had that level of expertise, he wouldn't have needed advice in the first place. So far, we've looked at the difficulty of getting the right product or service at a personal level, but this problem also exists at the firm level and is often worse because the markets tend to be thinner, with fewer products available as well as opaque, \"call us\" pricing. Some commonly repeated advice is that firms should focus on their \"core competencies\" and outsource everything else (e.g., Joel Spolsky, Gene Kim, Will Larson, Camille Fournier, etc., all say this), but if we look mid-sized tech companies, we can see that they often need to have in-house expertise that's far outside what anyone would consider their core competency unless, e.g., every social media company has kernel expertise as a core competency. In principle, firms can outsource this kind of work, but people I know who've relied on outsourcing, e.g., kernel expertise to consultants or application engineers on a support contract, have been very unhappy with the results compared to what they can get by hiring dedicated engineers, both in absolute terms (support frequently doesn't come up with a satisfactory resolution in weeks or months, even when it's one a good engineer could solve in days) and for the money (despite engineers being expensive, large support contracts can often cost more than an engineer while delivering worse service than an engineer). This problem exists not only for support but also for products a company could buy instead of build. For example, Ben Kuhn, the CTO of Wave, has a Twitter thread about some of the issues we've run into at Wave, with a couple of followups. Ben now believes that one of the big mistakes he made as CTO was not putting much more effort into vendor selection, even when the decision appeared to be a slam dunk, and more strongly considering moving many systems to custom in-house versions sooner. Even after selecting the consensus best product in the space from the leading (as in largest and most respected) firm, and using the main offering the company has, the product often not only doesn't work but, by design, can't work. For example, we tried \"buy\" instead of \"build\" for a product that syncs data from Postgres to Snowflake. Syncing from Postrgres is the main offering (as in the offering with the most customers) from a leading data sync company, and we found that it would lose data, duplicate data, and corrupt data. After digging into it, it turns out that the product has a design that, among other issues, relies on the data source being able to seek backwards on its changelog. But Postgres throws changelogs away once they're consumed, so the Postgres data source can't support this operation. When their product attempts to do this and the operation fails, we end up with the sync getting \"stuck\", needing manual intervention from the vendor's operator and/or data loss. Since our data is still on Postgres, it's possible to recover from this by doing a full resync, but the data sync product tops out at 5MB/s for reasons that appear to be unknown to them, so a full resync can take days even on databases that aren't all that large. Resyncs will also silently drop and corrupt data, so multiple cycles of full resyncs followed by data integrity checks are sometimes necessary to recover from data corruption, which can take weeks. Despite being widely recommended and the leading product in the space, the product has a number of major design flaws that mean that it literally cannot work. This isn't so different from Mongo or other products that had fundamental design flaws that caused severe data loss, with the main difference being that, in most areas, there isn't a Kyle Kingsbury who spends years publishing tests on various products in the field, patiently responding to bogus claims about correctness until the PR backlash caused companies in the field to start taking correctness seriously. Without that pressure, most software products basically don't work, hence the Twitter threads from Ben, above, where he notes that the \"buy\" solutions you might want to choose mostly don't work2. Of course, at our scale, there are many things we're not going to build any time soon, like CPUs, but, for many things where the received wisdom is to \"buy\", \"build\" seems like a reasonable option. This is even true for larger companies and building CPUs. Fifteen years ago, high-performance (as in, non-embedded level of performance) CPUs were a canonical example of something it would be considered bonkers to build in-house, absurd for even the largest software companies, but Apple and Amazon have been able to produce best-in-class CPUs on the dimensions they're optimizing for, for predictable reasons3. This isn't just an issue that impacts tech companies; we see this across many different industries. For example, any company that wants to mail items to customers has to either implement shipping themselves or deal with the fallout of having unreliable shipping. As a user, whether or not packages get shipped to you depends a lot on where you live and what kind of building you live in. When I've lived in a house, packages have usually arrived regardless of the shipper (although they've often arrived late). But, since moving into apartment buildings, some buildings just don't get deliveries from certain delivery services. Once, I lived in a building where the postal service didn't deliver mail properly and I didn't get a lot of mail (although I frequently got mail addressed to other people in the building as well as people elsewhere). More commonly, UPS and Fedex usually won't attempt to deliver and will just put a bunch of notices up on the building door for all the packages they didn't deliver, where the notice falsely indicates that the person wasn't home and correctly indicates that, to get the package, the person has to go to some pick-up location to get the package. For a while, I lived in a city where Amazon used 3rd-party commercial courier services to do last-mile shipping for same-day delivery. The services they used were famous for marking things as delivered without delivering the item for days, making \"same day\" shipping slower than next day or even two day shipping. Once, I naively contacted Amazon support because my package had been marked as delivered but wasn't delivered. Support, using a standard script supplied to them by Amazon, told me that I should contact them again three days after the package was marked as delivered because couriers often mark packages as delivered without delivering them, but they often deliver the package within a few days. Amazon knew that the courier service they were using didn't really even try to deliver packages4 promptly and the only short-term mitigation available to them was to tell support to tell people that they shouldn't expect that packages have arrived when they've been marked as delivered. Amazon eventually solved this problem by having their own delivery people or using, by commercial shipping standards, an extremely expensive service (Apple has done for same-day delivery)5. At scale, there's no commercial service you can pay for that will reliably attempt to deliver packages. If you want a service that actually works, you're generally on the hook for building it yourself, just like in the software world. My local grocery store tried to outsource this to DoorDash. I've tried delivery 3 times from my grocery store and my groceries have showed up 2 out of 3 times, which is well below what most people would consider an acceptable hit rate for grocery delivery. Having to build instead of buy to get reliability is a huge drag on productivity, especially for smaller companies (e.g., it's not possible for small shops that want to compete with Amazon and mail products to customers to have reliable delivery since they can't build out their own delivery service). The amount of waste generated by the inability to farm out services is staggering and I've seen it everywhere I've worked. An example from another industry: when I worked at a small chip startup, we had in-house capability to do end-to-end chip processing (with the exception of having its own fabs), which is unusual for a small chip startup. When the first wafer of a new design came off of a fab, we'd have the wafer flown to us on a flight, at which point someone would use a wafer saw to cut the wafer into individual chips so we could start testing ASAP. This was often considered absurd in the same way that it would be considered absurd for a small software startup to manage its own on-prem hardware. After all, the wafer saw and the expertise necessary to go from a wafer to a working chip will be idle over 99% of the time. Having full-time equipment and expertise that you use less than 1% of the time is a classic example of the kind of thing you should outsource, but if you price out having people competent to do this plus having the equipment available to do it, even at fairly low volumes, it's cheaper to do it in-house even if the equipment and expertise for it are idle 99% of the time. More importantly, you'll get much better service (faster turnaround) in house, letting you ship at a higher cadence. I've both worked at companies that have tried to contract this kind of thing out as well as talked with many people who've done that and you get slower, less reliable, service at a higher cost. Likewise with chip software tooling; despite it being standard to outsource tooling to large EDA vendors, we got a lot of mileage out using our own custom tools, generally created or maintained by one person, e.g., while I was there, most simulator cycles were run on a custom simulator that was maintained by one person, which saved millions a year in simulator costs (standard pricing for a simulator at the time was a few thousand dollars per license per year and we had a farm of about a thousand simulation machines). You might think that, if a single person can create or maintain a tool that's worth millions of dollars a year to the company, our competitors would do the same thing, just like you might think that if you can ship faster and at a lower cost by hiring a person who knows how to crack a wafer open, our competitors would do that, but they mostly didn't. Joel Spolsky has an old post where he says: “Find the dependencies — and eliminate them.” When you're working on a really, really good team with great programmers, everybody else's code, frankly, is bug-infested garbage, and nobody else knows how to ship on time. We had a similar attitude, although I'd say that we were a bit more humble. We didn't think that everyone else was producing garbage but, we also didn't assume that we couldn't produce something comparable to what we could buy for a tenth of the cost. From talking to folks at some competitors, there was a pretty big cultural difference between how we operated and how they operated. It simply didn't occur to them that they didn't have to buy into the standard American business logic that you should focus on your core competencies, that you can think through whether or not it makes sense to do something in-house on the merits of the particular thing instead of outsourcing your thinking to a pithy saying. I once watched, from the inside, a company undergo this cultural shift. A few people in leadership decided that the company should focus on its core competencies, which meant abandoning custom software for infrastructure. This resulted in quite a few large migrations from custom internal software to SaaS solutions and open source software. If you watched the discussions on \"why\" various projects should or shouldn't migrate, there were a few unusually unreasonable people who tried to reason through particular cases on the merits of each case (in a post on pushing back against orders from the top, Yossi Kreinin calls these people insane employees; I'm going to refer to the same concept in this post, but instead call people who do this unusually unreasonable). But, for the most part, people bought the party line and pushed for a migration regardless of the specifics. The thing that I thought was interesting was that leadership didn't tell particular teams they had to migrate and there weren't really negative consequences for teams where an \"unusually unreasonable person\" pushed back in order to keep running an existing system for reasonable reasons. Instead, people mostly bought into the idea and tried to justify migrations for vaguely plausible sounding reasons that weren't connected to reality, resulting in funny outcomes like moving to an open source system \"to save money\" when the new system was quite obviously less efficient6 and, predictably, required much higher capex and opex. The cost savings was supposed to come from shrinking the team, but the increase in operational cost dominated the change in the cost of the team and the complexity of operating the system meant that the team size increased instead of decreasing. There were a number of cases where it really did make sense to migrate, but the stated reasons for migration tended to be unrelated or weakly related to the reasons it actually made sense to migrate. Once people absorbed the idea that the company should focus on core competencies, the migrations were driven by the cultural idea and not any technical reasons. The pervasiveness of decisions like the above, technical decisions made without serious technical consideration, is a major reason that the selection pressure on companies to make good products is so weak. There is some pressure, but it's noisy enough that successful companies often route around making a product that works, like in the Mongo example from above, where Mongo's decision to loudly repeat demonstrably bogus performance claims and making demonstrably false correctness claims was, from a business standpoint, superior to focusing on actual correctness and performance; by focusing their resources where it mattered for the business, they managed to outcompete companies that made the mistake of devoting serious resources to performance and correctness. Yossi's post about how an unusually unreasonable person can have outsized impact in a dimension they value at their firm also applies to impact outside of a firm. Kyle Kingsbury, mentioned above, is an example of this. At the rates that I've heard Jepsen is charging now, Kyle can bring in what a senior developer at BigCo does (actually senior, not someone with the title \"senior\"), but that was after years of working long hours at below market rates on an uncertain endeavour, refuting FUD from his critics (if you read the replies to the linked posts or, worse yet, the actual tickets where he's involved in discussions with developers, the replies to Kyle were a constant stream of nonsense for many years, including people working for vendors feeling like he has it out for them in particular, casting aspersions on his character7, and generally trashing him). I have a deep respect for people who are willing to push on issues like this despite the system being aligned against them but, my respect notwithstanding, basically no one is going to do that. A system that requires someone like Kyle to take a stand before successful firms will put effort into correctness instead of correctness marketing is going to produce a lot of products that are good at marketing correctness without really having decent correctness properties (such as the data sync product mentioned in this post, whose website repeatedly mentions how reliable and safe the syncing product is despite having a design that is fundamentally broken). It's also true at the firm level that it often takes an unusually unreasonable firm to produce a really great product instead of just one that's marketed as great, e.g., Volvo, the one car manufacturer that seemed to try to produce a level of structural safety beyond what could be demonstrated by IIHS tests fared so poorly as a business that it's been forced to move upmarket and became a niche, luxury, automaker since safety isn't something consumers are really interested in despite car accidents being a leading cause of death and a significant source of life expectancy loss. And it's not clear that Volvo will be able to persist in being an unreasonable firm since they weren't able to survive as an independent automaker. When Ford acquired Volvo, Ford started moving Volvos to the shared Ford C1 platform, which didn't fare particularly well in crash tests. Since Geely has acquired Volvo, it's too early to tell for sure if they'll maintain Volvo's commitment to designing for real-world crash data and not just crash data that gets reported in benchmarks. If Geely declines to continue Volvo's commitment to structural safety, it may not be possible to buy a modern car that's designed to be safe. Most markets are like this, except that there was never an unreasonable firm like Volvo in the first place. On unreasonable employees, Yossi says Who can, and sometimes does, un-rot the fish from the bottom? An insane employee. Someone who finds the forks, crashes, etc. a personal offence, and will repeatedly risk annoying management by fighting to stop these things. Especially someone who spends their own political capital, hard earned doing things management truly values, on doing work they don't truly value – such a person can keep fighting for a long time. Some people manage to make a career out of it by persisting until management truly changes their mind and rewards them. Whatever the odds of that, the average person cannot comprehend the motivation of someone attempting such a feat. It's rare that people are willing to expend a significant amount of personal capital to do the right thing, whatever that means to someone, but it's even rarer that the leadership of a firm will make that choice and spend down the firm's capital to do the right thing. Economists have a term for cases where information asymmetry means that buyers can't tell the difference between good products and \"lemons\", \"a market for lemons\", like the car market (where the term lemons comes from), or both sides of the hiring market. In economic discourse, there's a debate over whether cars are a market for lemons at all for a variety of reasons (lemon laws, which allow people to return bad cars, don't appear to have changed how the market operates, very few modern cars are lemons when that's defined as a vehicle with serious reliability problems, etc.). But looking at whether or not people occasionally buy a defective car is missing the forest for the trees. There's maybe one car manufacturer that really seriously tries to make a structurally safe car beyond what standards bodies test (and word on the street is that they skimp on the increasingly important software testing side of things) because consumers can't tell the difference between a more or less safe car beyond the level a few standards bodies test to. That's a market for lemons, as is nearly every other consumer and B2B market. Appendix: culture Something I find interesting about American society is how many people think that someone who gets the raw end of a deal because they failed to protect themselves against every contingency \"deserves\" what happened (orgs that want to be highly effective often avoid this by having a \"blameless\" culture, but very few people have exposure to such a culture). Some places I've seen this recently: Person had a laptop stolen in a cafe; blamed for not keeping their eye on the laptop the entire time since no reasonable person would ever let their eyes off of any belongings for 10 seconds as they turned their head to briefly chat with someone Person posted a PSA that they were caught out by a change in the terms of service of a company and other people should be aware of the same thing, people said that the person caught out was dumb for not reading every word of every terms of service update they're sent (many times, on r/idiotsincars): person gets in an accident that would've been difficult or impossible to reasonably avoid and people tell the person they're a terrible driver for not having avoided the accident At least once, the person did a frame-by-frame analysis that showed that they reacted to, within one frame of latency, as fast as humanly possible, and was still told they should've avoided the accident Often, people will say things like \"I would never get into that situation in the first place\", which, in the circumstance where someone is driving past a parked car, results in absurd statements like \"I would never pass a vehicle at more than 10mph\", as if the person making the comment slows down to 10mph on every street that has parked or stopped cars on it. Person griped on flyertalk forum that Google maps instructions are unclear if you're not a robot (e.g., \"turn right in 500 meters\", which could be one of multiple intersections) and people responded with things like \"I never go anywhere without being completely familiar with the route\" and that you should map out all of your driving beforehand, just like you would for a road trip with a paper map in 1992 (this was used as a justification for the reasonableness of mapping out all travel beforehand – I did it back then and anyone who isn't dumb would do it now) People with those kinds of negative responses were highly upvoted; no one suggested switching to Apple Maps, which gives clear, landmark based directions like \"go through the light and then take the next right\" If you read these kinds of discussions, you'll often see people claiming \"that's just how the world is\" and going further and saying that there is no other way the world could be, so anyone who isn't prepared for that is an idiot. Going back to the laptop theft example, anyone who's traveled, or even read about other cultures, can observe that the things that North Americans think are basically immutable consequences of a large-scale society are arbitrary. For example, if you leave your bag and laptop on a table at a cafe in Korea and come back hours later, the bag and laptop are overwhelmingly likely to be there I've heard this is true in Japan as well. While it's rude to take up a table like that, you're not likely to have your bag and laptop stolen. And, in fact, if you tweak the context slightly, this is basically true in America. It's not much harder to walk into an empty house and steal things out of the house (it's fairly easy to learn how to pick locks and even easier to just break a window) than it is to steal things out of a cafe. And yet, in most neighbourhoods in America, people are rarely burglarized and when someone posts about being burglarized, they're not excoriated for being a moron for not having kept an eye on their house. Instead, people are mostly sympathetic. It's considered normal to have unattended property stolen in public spaces and not in private spaces, but that's more of a cultural distinction than a technical distinction. There's a related set of stories Avery Pennarun tells about the culture shock of being an American in Korea. One of them is about some online ordering service you can use that's sort of like Amazon. With Amazon, when you order something, you get a box with multiple bar/QR/other codes on it and, when you open it up, there's another box inside that has at least one other code on it. Of course the other box needs the barcode because it's being shipped through some facility at-scale where no one knows what the box is or where it needs to go and the inner box also had to go through some other kind of process and it also needs to be able to be scanned by a checkout machine if the item is sold at a retailer. Inside the inner box is the item. If you need to return the item, you put the item back into its barcoded box and then put that box into the shipping box and then slap another barcode onto the shipping box and then mail it out. So, in Korea, there's some service like Amazon where you can order an item and, an hour or two later, you'll hear a knock at your door. When you get to the door, you'll see an unlabeled box or bag and the item is in the unlabeled container. If you want to return the item, you \"tell\" the app that you want to return the item, put it back into its container, put it in front of your door, and they'll take it back. After seeing this shipping setup, which is wildly different from what you see in the U.S., he asked someone \"how is it possible that they don't lose track of which box is which?\". The answer he got was, \"why would they lose track of which box is which?\". His other stories have a similar feel, where he describes something quite alien, asks a local how things can work in this alien way, who can't imagine things working any other way and response with \"why would X not work?\" As with the laptop in cafe example, a lot of Avery's stories come down to how there are completely different shared cultural expectations around how people and organizations can work. Another example of this is with covid. Many of my friends have spent most of the last couple of years in Asian countries like Vietnam or Taiwan, which have had much lower covid rates, so much so that they were barely locked down at all. My friends in those countries were basically able to live normal lives, as if covid didn't exist at all (at least until the latest variants, at which point they were vaccinated and at relatively low risk for the most serious outcomes), while taking basically zero risk of getting covid. In most western countries, initial public opinion among many people was that locking down was pointless and there was nothing we could do to prevent an explosion of covid. Multiple engineers I know, who understand exponential growth and knew what the implications were, continued normal activities before lockdown and got and (probably) spread covid. When lockdowns were implemented, there was tremendous pressure to lift them as early as possible, resulting in something resembling the \"adaptive response\" diagram from this post. Since then, many people (I have a project tallying up public opinion on this that I'm not sure I'll ever prioritize enough to complete) have changed their opinion to \"having ever locked down was stupid, we were always going to end up with endemic covid, all of this economic damage was pointless\". If we look at in-person retail sales data or restaurant data, we can easily see that many people were voluntarily limiting their activities before and after lockdowns in the first year or so of the pandemic when the virus was in broad circulation. Meanwhile, in some Asian countries, like Taiwan and Vietnam, people mostly complied with lockdowns when they were instituted, which means that they were able to squash covid in the country when outbreaks happened until relatively recently, when covid mutated into forms that spread much more easily and people's tolerance for covid risk went way up due to vaccinations. Of course, covid kept getting reintroduced into countries that were able to squash it because other countries were not, in large part due to the self-fulfilling belief that it would be impossible to squash covid. Coming back to when it makes sense to bring something in-house, even in cases where it superficially sounds like it shouldn't, because the expertise is 99% idle or a single person would have to be able to build software that a single firm would pay millions of dollars a year for, much of this comes down to whether or not you're in a culture where you can trust another firm's promise. If you operate in a society where it's expected that other firms will push you to the letter of the law with respect to whatever contract you've negotiated, it's frequently not worth the effort to negotiate a contract that would give you service even one half as good as you'd get from someone in house. If you look at how these contracts end up being worded, companies often try to sneak in terms that make the contract meaningless, and even when you managed to stamp out all of that, legally enforcing the contract is expensive and, in the cases I know of where companies regularly violated their agreement for their support SLA (just for example), the resolution was to terminate the contract rather than pursue legal action because the cost of legal action wouldn't be worth anything that could be gained. If you can't trust other firms, you frequently don't have a choice with respect to bringing things in house if you want them to work. Although this is really a topic for another post, I'll note that lack of trust that exists across companies can also hamstring companies when it exists internally. As we discussed previously, a lot of larger scale brokenness also comes out of the cultural expectations within organizations. A specific example of this that leads to pervasive organizational problems is lack of trust within the organization. For example, a while back, I was griping to a director that a VP broke a promise and that we were losing a lot of people for similar reasons. The director's response was \"there's no way the VP made a promise\". When I asked for clarification, the clarification was \"unless you get it in a contract, it wasn't a promise\", i.e., the rate at which VPs at the company lie is high enough that a verbal commitment from a VP is worthless; only a legally binding commitment that allows you to take them to court has any meaning. Of course, that's absurd, in that no one could operate at a BigCo while going around and asking for contracts for all their promises since they'd immediately be considered some kind of hyperbureaucratic weirdo. But, let's take the spirit of the comment seriously, that only trust people close to you. That's good advice in the company I worked for but, unfortunately for the company, the implications are similar to the inter-firm example, where we noted that a norm where you need to litigate the letter of the law is expensive enough that firms often bring expertise in house to avoid having to deal with the details. In the intra-firm case and you'll often see teams and orgs \"empire build\" because they know they, at least the management level, they can't trust anyone outside their fiefdom. While this intra-firm lack of trust tends to be less costly than the inter-firm lack of trust since there are better levers to get action on an organization that's the cause of a major blocker, it's still fairly costly. Virtually all of the VPs and BigCo tech execs I've talked to are so steeped in the culture they're embedded in that they can't conceive of an alternative, but there isn't an inherent reason that organizations have to work like that. I've worked at two companies where people actually trust leadership and leadership does generally follow through on commitments even when you can't take them to court, including my current employer, Wave. But, at the other companies, the shared expectation that leadership cannot and should not be trusted \"causes\" the people who end up in leadership roles to be untrustworthy, which results in the inefficiencies we've just discussed. People often think that having a high degree of internal distrust is inevitable as a company scales, but people I've talked to who were in upper management or fairly close to the top of Intel and Google said that the companies had an extended time period where leadership enforced trustworthiness and that stamping out dishonesty and \"bad politics\" was a major reason the company was so successful, under Andy Grove and Eric Schmidt, respectively. When the person at the top changed and a new person who didn't enforce honesty came in, the standard cultural norms that you see at the upper levels of most big companies seeped in, but that wasn't inevitable. When I talk to people who haven't been exposed to BigCo leadership culture and haven't seen how decisions are actually made, they often find the decision making processes to be unbelievable in much the same way that people who are steeped in BigCo leadership culture find the idea that a large company could operate any other way to be unbelievable. It's often difficult to see how absurd a system is from the inside. Another perspective on this is that Americans often find Japanese universities and the work practices of Japanese engineering firms absurd, though often not as absurd as the promotion policies in Korean chaebols, which are famously nepotistic, e.g., Chung Mong-yong is the CEO of Hyundai Sungwoo because he's the son of Chung Soon-yung, who was the head of Hyundai Sungwoo because he was the younger brother of Chung Ju-yung, the founder of Hyundai Group (essentially the top-level Hyundai corporation), etc. But Japanese and Korean engineering firms are not, in general, less efficient than American engineering firms outside of the software industry despite practices that seem absurdly inefficient to American eyes. American firms didn't lose their dominance in multiple industries while being more efficient; if anything, market inefficiencies allowed them to hang on to marketshare much longer than you would naively expect if you just looked at the technical merit of their products. There are offsetting inefficiencies in American firms that are just as absurd as effectively having familiar succession of company leadership in Korean chaebols. It's just that the inefficiencies that come out of American cultural practices seem to be immutable facts about the world to people inside the system. But when you look at firms that have completely different cultures, it becomes clear that cultural norms aren't a law of nature. Appendix: downsides of build Of course, building instead of buying isn't a panacea. I've frequently seen internal designs that are just as broken as the data sync product described in this post. In general, when you see a design like that, a decent number of people explained why the design can never work during the design phase and were ignored. Although \"build\" gives you a lot more control than \"buy\" and gives you better odds of a product that works because you can influence the design, a dysfunctional team in a dysfunctional org can quite easily make products that don't work. There's a Steve Jobs quote that's about companies that also applies to teams: It turns out the same thing can happen in technology companies that get monopolies, like IBM or Xerox. If you were a product person at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copier or computer. So what? When you have monopoly market share, the company's not any more successful. So the people that can make the company more successful are sales and marketing people, and they end up running the companies. And the product people get driven out of the decision making forums, and the companies forget what it means to make great products. The product sensibility and the product genius that brought them to that monopolistic position gets rotted out by people running these companies that have no conception of a good product versus a bad product. They have no conception of the craftsmanship that's required to take a good idea and turn it into a good product. And they really have no feeling in their hearts, usually, about wanting to really help the customers.\" For \"efficiency\" reasons, some large companies try to avoid duplicate effort and kill projects if they seem too similar to another project, giving the team that owns the canonical verison of a product a monopoly. If the company doesn't have a culture of trying to do the right thing, this has the same problems that Steve Jobs discusses, but at the team and org level instead of the company level. The workaround a team I was on used was to basically re-implement a parallel stack of things we relied on that didn't work. But this was only possible beacuse leadership didn't enforce basically anything. Ironically, this was despite their best efforts — leadership made a number of major attempts to impose top-down control, but they didn't understand how to influence an organization, so the attempts failed. Had leadership been successful, the company would've been significantly worse off. There are upsides to effective top-down direction when leadership has good plans, but that wasn't really on the table, so it's actually better that leadership didn't know how to execute. Thanks to Fabian Giesen, Yossi Kreinen, Peter Bhat Harkins, Ben Kuhn, Laurie Tratt, John Hergenroeder, Tao L., @softminus, Justin Blank, @deadalnix, Dan Lew, @ollyrobot, Sophia Wisdom, Elizabeth Van Nostrand, Kevin Downey, and @PapuaHardyNet for comments/corrections/discussion. To some, that position is so absurd that it's not believable that anyone would hold that position (in response to my first post that featured the Andreessen quote, above, a number of people told me that it was an exaggerated straw man, which is impossible for a quote, let alone one that sums up a position I've heard quite a few times), but to others, it's an immutable fact about the world. [return] On the flip side, if we think about things from the vendor side of things, there's little incentive to produce working products since the combination of the fog of war plus making false claims about a product working seems to be roughly as good as making a working product (at least until someone like Kyle Kingsbury comes along, which never happens in most industries), and it's much cheaper. And, as Fabian Giesen points out, when vendors actually want to produce good or working products, the fog of war also makes that difficult: But producers have a dual problem, which is that all the signal you get from consumers is sporadic, infrequent and highly selected direct communication, as well as a continuous signal of how sales look over time, which is in general very hard to map back to why sales went up or down. You hear directly from people who are either very unhappy or very happy, and you might hear second-hand info from your salespeople, but often that's pure noise. E.g. with RAD products over the years a few times we had a prospective customer say, \"well we would license it but we really need X\" and we didn't have X. And if we heard that 2 or 3 times from different customers, we'd implement X and get back to them a few months later. More often than not, they'd then ask for Y next, and it would become clear over time that they just didn't want to license for some other reason and saying \"we need X, it's a deal-breaker for us\" for a couple choices of X was just how they chose to get out of the eval without sounding rude or whatever. In my experience that's a pretty thorny problem in general, once you spin something out or buy something you're crossing org boundaries and lose most of the ways you otherwise have to cut through the BS and figure out what's actually going on. And whatever communication does happen is often forced to go through a very noisy, low-bandwidth, low-fidelity, high-latency channel. [return] Note that even though it was somewhat predictable that a CPU design team at Apple or Amazon that was well funded had a good chance of being able to produce a best-in-class CPU (e.g., see this 2013 comment about the effectiveness of Apple's team and this 2015 comment about other mobile vendors) that would be a major advantage for their firm, this doesn't mean that the same team should've been expected to succeed if they tried to make a standalone business. In fact, Apple was able to buy their core team cheaply because the team, after many years at DEC and then successfully founding SiByte, founded PA Semi, which basically failed as a business. Similarly, Amazon's big silicon initial hires were from Annapurna (also a failed business that was up for sale because it couldn't survive independently) and Smooth Stone (a startup that failed so badly that it didn't even need to be acquired and people could be picked up individually). Even when there's an obvious market opportunity, factors like network effects, high fixed costs, up front capital expenditures, the ability of incumbent players to use market power to suppress new competitors, etc., can and often does prevent anyone from taking the opportunity. Even though we can now clearly see that there were large opportunities available for the taking, there's every reason to believe that, based on the fates of many other CPU startups to date, an independent startup that attempt to implement the same ideas wouldn't have been nearly a successful and most likely have gone bankrupt or taken a low offer relative to the company's value due to the company's poor business prospects. Also, before Amazon started shipping ARM server chips, the most promising ARM server chip, which had pre-orders from at least one major tech company, was killed because it was on the wrong side of an internal political battle. The chip situation isn't so different from the motivating example we looked at in our last post, baseball scouting, where many people observed that baseball teams were ignoring simple statistics they could use to their advantage. But, none of the people observing that were in a position to run a baseball team for decades, allowing the market opportunity to persist for decades. [return] Something that amuses me is how some package delivery services appear to apply relatively little effort to make sure that someone even made an attempt to delivery the package. When packages are marked delivered, there's generally a note about how it was delivered, which is frequently quite obviously wrong for the building, e.g., \"left with receptionist\" for a building with no receptionist or \"left on porch\" for an office building with no porch and a receptionist who was there during the alleged delivery time. You could imagine services would, like Amazon, request a photo along with \"proof of delivery\" or perhaps use GPS to check that the driver was plausibly at least in the same neighborhood as the building at the time of delivery, but they generally don't seem to do that? I'd guess that a lot of the fake deliveries come from having some kind of quota, one that's difficult or impossible to achieve, combined with weak attempts at verifying that a delivery was done or even attempted. [return] When I say they solved it, I mean that Amazon delivery drivers actually try to deliver the package maybe 95% of the time to the apartment buildings I've lived in, vs. about 25% for UPS and Fedex and much lower for USPS and Canada Post, if we're talking about big packages and not letters. [return] Very fittingly for this post, I saw an external discussion on this exact thing where someone commented that it must've been quite expensive for the company to switch to the new system due to its known inefficiencies. In true cocktail party efficient markets hypothesis form, an internet commenter replied that the company wouldn't have done it if it was inefficient and therefore it must not have been as inefficient as the first commenter thought. I suspect I spent more time looking at software TCO than anyone else at the company and the system under discussion was notable for having one of the largest increases in cost of any system at the company without a concomitant increase in load. Unfortunately, the assumption that competition results in good internal decisions is just as false as the assumption that competition results in good external decisions.

(2022) (danluu.com)296 points by janandonly 6 hours agohidepastfavorite258 comments mattgreenrocks 3 hours agoThis post is so interesting to me, esp. the build-vs-buy spectrum. As Dan notes, a lot of software is just...not very good. It either isn't upfront with flaws (as in the case of the Postgres -> Snowflake tool), has too much scope, or is abstracted poorly. Finding things to buy/use (as in the case of open source) can often eat a lot more time than you anticipate. I've been dipping my toes into the JS ecosystem, and I keep bumping into the fact that using mentally cheap signals of quality (such as stars or DL counts) almost never indicates the quality of the thing itself. Winners seem to be randomly chosen, almost! The only way to assess is to read the code and try integrating it in. I'd go farther to argue that the larger an ecosystem/market is, the more untrustworthy it behaves as a whole, simply due to the size, and the types of people attracted to it who want to get influence/money. See also: appliances that everyone needs. reply blueyes 2 hours agoparentFor me, what this post illustrates most is the cost of information. By making hasty decisions, buyers are trading present time that might be spent shopping and comparing with future time spent struggling with the wrong product. They're discounting future time. But they're also doing something very rational -- they're making a decision to see what happens. That is, they're testing a hypothesis in the only way the market allows them to. Because people are bad at predicting their own future needs and behavior, and products are bundles of features whose importance is often unknown until you have to use them in high-dimensional futures. So buying is an empirical test. Unfortunately, most consumers, recruiters and sometimes hiring managers are in a position of information assymetry vis a vis the people selling them something. That is, consumers rely on the self-reporting of vendors which purport to be experts. https://vonnik.substack.com/p/the-expert-layman-problem reply milesward 0 minutes agorootparentit's worse than that: nobody knows! how are we supposed to know if all the investment vendor A made in \"reliability\" of their appliance will actually work, or if it was just spent wastefully?

I like to explore alternatives to the most popular choice, but more often than not I end up back at the #1 consensus choice.

Some times they pick some interesting alternatives that I explore. Most of the time they end up with also-ran purchases that die off. I joke that my one friend is the best predictor of impending product line cancellation that I know. He used a Zune when everyone went iPod. He went Windows Phone when iPhone and Android were front runners. He event eschewed Instagram for some other platform that he was sure was going to win the social media wars, but was actually so unnoteworthy that I can’t even remember the name right now. reply atomicfiredoll 1 minute agorootparentI may be one of these types, but at least in many of my cases, I don't really know that it mattered in the end? Maybe after a review I pick something that didn't win in the long term or even eventually exited the market because it wasn't popular enough. But, my requirements are almost never strictly that it's popular. What I end up with does typically do the job very well for the time I have it, and after few years the requirements may change or the need may go away completely. If one of my requirements is that a device is built with metal instead of plastic, maybe I never have to replace it. Another example: Your friend had a Zune, but then I'm guessing they moved on to a phone after phones became better music players. If the Zune did all the things they wanted while they had it, especially if they had a unique need, maybe were happy with it. (Although, that isn't necessarily always the case.) This doesn't seem quite as applicable for selecting software, though. Popularity often is part of what I look at there, because I want to know dependencies won't need replacing and support will be available. Additionally, you can potentially work with the developers so the selection iterates and grows into your requirements. reply PittleyDunkin 30 minutes agorootparentprev> I like to explore alternatives to the most popular choice, but more often than not I end up back at the #1 consensus choice.

It would have been quicker and cheaper if the company just hired more actual developers to integrate properly with existing systems (and resulted in more featureful, less buggy applications), but the prospect of paying lower salaries for less qualified people to do the same end result (as promised by the slopware vendors) seems to be a siren song of sorts to management. reply nradov 25 minutes agorootparentYou're missing the point of low-code/no-code solutions.

I dread every moment I have to work in JS because everything is so badly done. reply ravenstine 2 hours agorootparentA lot of people blame the JavaScript language itself but, the longer I'm around in the world of web development, the more I think that the quality of JavaScript applications is dictated by the economics of said applications. Off the top of my head, the best software I use seems to fall into two categories: - Closed source software that requires buying a license to use - Open source software that is specifically made for developers and promises to do one job well Whatever falls in the middle of those two categories tends to suffer, in my experience. If you think about it, web based software tend not to fit neatly into either category. Most of them are the following: - Closed source but are either too cheap or are free - Open source but promises to do way too many things, and also too cheap or free (describes a lot of frameworks and design tools) Web technology and JavaScript became the dumpster slut of software ecosystems. The end users are not given a big enough reason to pay for them adequately or at all, product owners care little about quality and reliability because it's way too easy to get a zillion low quality users to look at ads, and the barrier of entry for new JavaScript programmers is so low that it's full of people who never think philosophically about how code should be written. reply giantrobot 2 hours agorootparent> Web technology and JavaScript became the dumpster slut of software ecosystems. I think an additional problem with the JavaScript ecosystem specifically is external resources are extremely easy to access and their cost is usually borne by end user resources. Therefore they're too tempting for many developers to avoid. Unfortunately the runtime environment of the end user rarely matches that of the developers and seemingly \"cheap\" resource access at development/test time isn't cheap for the end user. JavaScript is happy to pull in some library hosted on some third party service at runtime. For the developer/tester this ends up cached by the browser and/or at the edge of the CDN. A developer may also have topologically close CDN endpoints. This inspires them to pull willy nilly from third party libraries because to them they're cheap to access and they save time writing some utility function. The same goes for CSS, APIs, or media resources. With JavaScript the delivery is a client issue and costs can be pushed entirely onto the client. If pulling in an external resource(s) costs a developer non-trivial money to store and serve they'll put more effort into tree shaking or other delivery optimizations. They may omit it entirely. I think this massively contributes to the LEGO piece construction of a lot of web apps. It also contributes to performance robbing things like tag managers that insert a bunch of incongruent plug-ins only at runtime from an unbounded number of sources. reply ericmcer 2 hours agorootparentprevI agree that many Frontend libraries are pretty intimidating to step into if you don't have a background in it. Don't agree that JS community is bad, it is the largest community of any language by far, and it has the most money invested into it by a huge margin. There is a lot of trash but there is some seriously good stuff, and you can find 10+ packages trying to do pretty much anything you can think of. reply MichaelZuo 3 hours agorootparentprevDo all the high quality folks just leave the JS community beyond a certain threshold? reply noirscape 2 hours agorootparentJavaScript has the unfortunate situation of having years upon years of terrible standard library design, leading to people building lots of small libraries on top of those libraries to get things that were basic functionality in other languages. Then people started stacking more and more things on top of those libraries, creating a giant dependency morass of microdependencies that larger frameworks are now build on top of. And because all these frameworks do things just different enough from each other, every larger library that a dev would want to integrate with those frameworks now needs a specialized version to work with those frameworks. In most languages, if you want to know how something works, you can usually dig into your dependency tree and by the time you hit the stdlib's optimization spaghetti/language internals, you'll probably have figured out what's causing your snag/what the library is expecting out of you. In JavaScript, you hit the dependency morass and have to give up. Most competent devs then decide to pick another language. You can write very legible JavaScript these days, even without a framework, but it looks nothing like JavaScript used in a framework. The other language I know of with this issue is, ironically, Rust. reply mixmastamyk 2 hours agorootparentPlease explain the rust angle? reply noirscape 45 minutes agorootparentSimilar \"lots of microdependencies\" issue, born in Rusts case from the desire to keep a conservatively sized standard library. It's a smaller problem in the sense that Rust has stronger API contracts as opposed to the absolute disaster that NodeJS is, but in terms of code comprehension you hit a similar dependency morass. The one thing salvaging Rust for now is a lack of similar frameworks, but who knows how long that will last. reply webmaven 1 hour agorootparentprevThe implication is that Rust's conservatism regarding what is blessed to go into the standard library sets up a similar dynamic. reply randall 3 hours agorootparentprevOr start making their own stuff and ignoring most of the community. reply moron4hire 3 hours agorootparentAfter a couple of years of doing this, you've built up a backlog of your own, bespoke library code that makes you into a wizard.

But in a sense, it's kind of right. I didn't work in teams anymore. I manage them. I still do a lot of programming. And I expect my developers to be competent enough to read other people's code and figure out how it works, what it does, how to use it, based on the tests and plenty of extant examples. I don't want developers who can only be productive in libraries that everyone else's is using/posting YouTube tutorials on/feeding LLM training corpus'. The problem with adopting other people's software is that you have to make it work for your purposes, all while accepting it was only ever originally designed for their purposes. And if that's open source and you contribute to it, then you have to make sure all your changes don't break other people's work. But with my own libraries, I can break anything I want. I have, like, 5 projects using them. It's not a big deal to discover an architectural problem and completely refactor it away to a newer, better design, propagating the change to all the others that use it in fairly short order.

And I don't mean that in a particularly bad way; most religions package a bunch of useful concepts (e.g., the golden rule) with some stuff that isn't literally true but does serve social and emotional needs in ways that the useful stuff gets passed down through the generations. As scholar Huston Smith put it, religion gives spirituality historical traction. The notion that markets can drive efficiency is a valuable insight. But people for whom Econ 101 acts as a religion have a really hard time noticing when that effect gets swamped. This is pretty easy to spot these days because you'll find nominally pro-market people cheering oligopolies and monopolies, or getting upset at regulations that make markets more efficient. One easy test is how they feel about sustained high profits. To people who value markets for their ability to drive improvements through competition, that's a sign of something wrong, like insufficient price competition. reply bunderbunder 2 hours agorootparentLately I've been wondering if the efficient market hypothesis was actually more true a century ago than it is now. Not because anything fundamental has changed about economics, but because baselines have shifted to the point that what we expect an efficient market to look like may be very different from what what people expected it to look like in the early 20th century. So, basically, people's definition of \"efficient\" has subtly changed. A century or so ago market economies hadn't caught on to the same extent. In the 1950s you had Khrushchev coming to visit Iowa to learn about US agricultural productivity. He visited family farms, talked to people about how they did things, and then went back home to tell the USSR's farmers that they needed to plant corn everywhere, including in places where the climate is not even remotely suitable for growing corn. All this time talking to family farmers about how they make their own decisions about the best use of their own land, and he somehow still failed to pick up on the idea that maybe the secret ingredient in the sauce was that the USA generally let farmers run their own farms. Sure, the USA's capitalist economy still had charlatans, including agricultural charlatans, and wasteful fads for bad ideas, rent-seeking behavior, pork barrel politics, etc. But maybe it was still easy to see that situation as efficient at the time, because one's reference for comparison included being able to see the greater amount of damage that a planned economy allowed a charlatan like Lysenko to do from his position of power within the Soviet Academy of Sciences. reply travisb 18 minutes agorootparentI think the hypothesis was more true in the past, but mostly because both the necessary dependencies it is based on are less true today than in the past, and the products and services are more complex today. Back when anybody could start building furniture the cost of entry was low and competition high. Switching costs were also low. The cost of entry for a smartphone which is truly different are astronomical, many previously unregulated products are now strictly regulated, so costs of entry is no longer low and therefore competition is also low. For many services like software switching costs are very high. Firms need to be large to produce the complex products which introduces internal inefficiencies which are hard to avoid. reply blihp 44 minutes agorootparentprevI think it absolutely was. Even 50+ years ago there was far more competition in any number of industries and investors looking at a particular widget maker could compare numerous companies and analyze the operations and strategy of each before picking which one(s) to invest in. Today we assume EMH when competition has become increasingly rare... so everyone from consumers to investors have fewer options yet somehow efficiency is supposed to exist. Today most just pile into the megacaps and generally assume 'these guys are the biggest... they must be the best.' Sure, there's a small window of competition in the VC world where money piles into non-public companies for a few years before a winner is selected (often having nothing to do with having the best product/service or even being the most efficient or profitable... it's all about who scaled to the finish line the fastest) and either becomes the 800lb gorilla or gets gobbled up by one. reply rsanek 2 hours agorootparentprevhard to evaluate sustained high profits without context. is it due to continued innovation by the firm? or just rent seeking? both can be causes of profits but we should only be promoting one of those models reply wpietri 2 hours agorootparentSure, although I think it gets easier as time goes on; there a are lot of innovative people out there. But my point here is more about the reaction to it. If people say, \"Well they're making lots of money, so they must be great innovators, great managers, and generally virtuous\", then that's basically a religious answer. People who see markets as tools for efficiency will say, \"Look at those sustained high profits. Is it really that nobody has figured out how to compete with them yet? Or are they misusing their market power or wealth in ways that limit competition?\" reply ponow 1 hour agorootparentprev> One easy test is how they feel about sustained high profits. To people who value markets for their ability to drive improvements through competition, that's a sign of something wrong, like insufficient price competition. We'd need more context. Those sustained profits are \"money on the table\". There may be real advantages to the company earning them, like sustained innovation or other quality, that others have trouble competing with.

You might see some obvious inefficiency that costs millions of dollars, but when the company has twelve figures in annual revenue, that’s insignificant. We all know (probably work at) some company that tries to save money by skimping on hardware for their developers. Some simple upgrades would probably pay for themselves in a few weeks in increased productivity. But what’s the cost, maybe 10% in developer productivity? That’s a lot, but it’s probably not close to make-or-break. It’s definitely true at the extreme, and it’s a major difference between government programs and private enterprise: a business can’t go on losing money forever. In less extreme situations, it’ll be true when the cost of the inefficiency exceeds the company’s moat.

I want them to have something special about them, and then I have to buy fewer products going forward because they last longer. A little later he says: > We define ourselves by the objects we interact with every day. I surround myself with beauty, with high levels of aesthetic pleasure, and it's not only putting on beautiful clothes. It's also using a beautiful nose hair trimmer.

We see similar behavior in natural ecosystems, which tend to evolve toward suboptimal equilibria that is robust to betrayal between groups, instead of global optima that requires perpetual honesty between them.[c] In many settings, robustness against betrayal is an evolutionary advantage. --- [a] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium [b] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma reply mixmastamyk 1 hour agoparentHis stuff is usually quite interesting, but in dire need of an editor.

Even after using Firefox's Reader mode, the paragraphs are too dense. Some people are great writers but could benefit from a designer or editor. reply jacobgkau 2 hours agorootparent> Even after using Firefox's Reader mode, the paragraphs are too dense. If you want to argue about other aspects of his writing style, fine. But those are normal-sized paragraphs. Scrolling through in reader mode, I saw maybe a couple paragraphs that stuck out as \"too long to be a paragraph,\" and even those are only ~5 sentences (so maybe some of his sentences are too long?) Social media has people thinking a paragraph can only be two sentences. At a certain point, you're basically just putting a line break after every sentence. reply soulofmischief 2 hours agorootparent> Social media has people thinking a paragraph can only be two sentences. That is a straw man and extremification. Paragraphs can be longer than two sentences. Formatting is important, however, and some of Luu's paragraphs are hard to parse. You may not notice this, or you just power through it, but if you study enough design and user experience principles then you start to feel when interacting with a medium takes more energy from you than it should. Better paragraph formatting makes you a better writer. You get better at slicing your communication into individual ideas, serving them one at a time at the reader's own pace. Your thoughts become less coupled, more clear and compact, and flow better from one to the next. It's also just important to consider that the reader needs anchor points to avoid fatigue, and we can achieve that with minimal styling and well-formatted text. Luu does not consider that his blog post is not read in isolation. It is part of a stack of information that a reader may consume each day, each communication inefficiency slowly adding up until the reader experiences significant cognitive drain and measurable fatigue. I also had to resize my window to discover the best width for me. I settled on the width of my cell phone, about the only platform this blog post looks readable on natively. And then, I had to resize it back my normal width to interact with hacker news and every other website on the internet. All of that adds friction and fatigue to the consumption process. I barely engage with any social media at all. I don't have Facebook, I don't post on Instagram, Twitter, or anything else. I stick to intimate online conversations and places like hacker news where there is real, meaningful, longform discussion. Your assumption about the nature of my critique is off-base and frankly unnecessary. reply jacobgkau 1 hour agorootparentHacker News is a form of social media, regardless of whether you consider it \"real, meaningful, longform discussion\" as compared to other platforms. \"If you study enough design and user experience principles then you start to feel\" is not quantified enough, imo. Your initial critique was that the paragraphs were \"too dense,\" but we've established it's not necessarily that they're too long. Perhaps if you'd give an example of how you'd fix some of the paragraphs, I'd understand your concern better. I was not defending the formatting of the page at all (that's a strawman itself). Looking at the original page in non-Reader mode, it seems like adding graphics every few paragraphs so it's not a literal wall of text would increase readability, as an alternative to making the paragraphs themselves less \"dense.\" I'm not sure what supporting graphics would be on-topic, though, aside from maybe screenshots of some of the cited sources. reply soulofmischief 1 hour agorootparent> Hacker News is a form of social media, regardless of whether you consider it \"real, meaningful, longform discussion\" as compared to other platforms.

The entire point of typography and formatting is to make text more accessible. Lack of layout is the antithesis of that. Then there's the separate issue of overlong paragraphs, which is simply a sign of poor writing (again making the text less accessible), unless you're trying to argue that the use of fewertags makes the page faster to load and render?

What is \"good\" communication depends on the social context of the communication, the audience, etc. A novel probably shouldn't be written in the same style as a project status update document. IMO one of the downsides of people in our modern education system being drilled on the \"one true way\" of communicating for a small handful of contexts (position paper essays, tactical business memos) is that they begin to think that is the only way to communicate ever in any context to any audience and forget that different people have different tastes and in a lot of contexts catering to your audience's taste is what matters. reply askafriend 2 hours agorootparentprevTrue but if this is just the extent of he can do, maybe it's better that he did it than if he didn't bother to put his thoughts on paper at all.

The author provides numerous examples from various industries, including tech, shipping, and accounting, where companies and individuals have struggled to find reliable and high-quality products or services due to information asymmetry and market failures. The essay suggests that this is often due to cultural norms and expectations that prioritize short-term gains over long-term quality and reliability. As a result, companies may be forced to \"build\" rather than \"buy\" solutions in order to get what they need, which can be costly and inefficient. However, the author also notes that building instead of buying is not a panacea, and that dysfunctional teams and organizations can still produce poor products. Ultimately, the essay argues that trust, both within and between companies, is essential for creating efficient and effective markets, and that cultural norms and expectations play a significant role in shaping market outcomes. reply Workaccount2 4 hours agoparentprevI gave it to gemini 2 and asked for a bullet point summary.

You make a decision and live with it. But if you build it, you can learn that what you wanted wasn't what you thought you needed, and the build can adapt and change to meet that actual need. A bought item/tool will do what it is designed to do, and can sometimes be shoehorned into what you needed, but often what you needed wasn't what you thought you needed. reply eviks 1 hour agoprev> Talking purely abstractly, it's hard to settle the debate, Hm, the mistake in the abstract is pretty obvious and is acknowledge in the theoretical discussions of all the \"perfect efficiencies\" theories - real life is never perfect!

Some examples: Maytag 575 commercial grade residential washer and dryer 1980-early 90s Mercedes W124 or W201 diesels 1980s Volvos (mentioned in article) IBM Model M keyboard Military/commercial security marketed heavy nylon and wool clothing Vintage Yamaha solid state electrical devices (or anything 1970s ish with real hardwood cases, and discrete components you can test and replace) 1970s professional grade Pioneer studio monitor headphones (e.g. Monitor 10s, etc.) I've often had people accuse me of being a 'hipster' into vintage stuff that is impractical because of the aesthetic. In such cases I usually could not convince them that I just had what worked best- I didn't care about the age or aesthetic, but some good stuff happens to be old. For services, companies, and products I recommend reading every 1 star review you can before choosing. For actual good stuff, the 1 star reviews will all be petty: they got what they paid for and it was perfect but are mad or confused about something else, or they just had random bad luck.

It's somewhat ironic as well, because socially I have and have had a reputation as someone who is both 'gadget obsessed' and 'bougie', but I don't think you can really be both. I have much much less 'stuff' than almost anyone I know, but almost everything I own I spent at least a few months researching before buying it and I plan to keep it as long as possible (and repair it if possible when it breaks). As a tech guy, the most obvious place this exists is in my desk setup, which currently (laptop and USB chargers not included) has an average age of around 5 years for everything on it. The oldest item I acquired 12 years ago and have no intention to ever replace if possible. The newest item was acquired as part of a move 2 years ago and pulls the average down. It's a constant struggle though, because even when I find something of high quality (recently pants and shirts), this doesn't prevent the company from discontinuing the product or changing it. I've had to since switch pants and shirts, and rotate my wardrobe because of button and zipper failures on a brand I previously relied on heavily and recommended to others. They likely made this choice as a company to cut materials costs to not move their price point, but I would have happily absorbed a 20-30% price increase to maintain quality and not need to spend another 3 months figuring out which pants to start buying. Instead, they've lost a customer entirely that previously directed them additional customers.

The real problem comes from the manufacturer's idea of \"useful lifespan\" and the customer's. For most people, an appliance's useful lifespan is \"as long as it keeps working\" and they don't care to ever upgrade it if it doesn't fail. Manufacturer's aren't incentivized to make those, however, and only accidentally do so (something designed to last 10 years is likely to last much longer on average). reply giantrobot 1 hour agoparentprevFor many products I think it's incorrect to say they're designed to stop working after a maximum duration. That would be a very expensive thing to actually design and implement. You can test a component and understand its MTBF but it's much harder to design a \"die after X days\" without explicitly putting in way fuses that a burnt after some counter expires. Instead it's more accurate to realize things are made to survive at least a minimum period of time. Components get engineered such their MTBF is longer than some mandated warranty period. While it seems like only a semantic difference I've found thinking this way really helps me price things. If you look at an item and assume it's been engineered to have a MTBF just a bit longer than its warranty/support period you can calculate its amortized price, including an evaluation of extended warranties or service contracts. This is instead of assuming I can buy something and it will last a decade. If something lasts me longer than my estimate that's awesome and I'll likely favor that brand on my next purchase. reply dehrmann 1 hour agoprev> every social media company has kernel expertise as a core competency It gets even more interesting when you're someone like Google who has both search and Android.

If you want to return the item, you \"tell\" the app that you want to return the item, put it back into its container, put it in front of your door, and they'll take it back. After seeing this shipping setup, which is wildly different from what you see in the U.S., he asked someone \"how is it possible that they don't lose track of which box is which?\". The answer he got was, \"why would they lose track of which box is which?\". His other stories have a similar feel, where he describes something quite alien, asks a local how things can work in this alien way, who can't imagine things working any other way and response with \"why would X not work?\" This gem near the end of the article ties in with Marc Andreeson’s quote at the beginning of the article.

For 10% of the cost you get the same (or usually better) service. I've been doing regular dental cleaning since I was a child. Delivery. Ukraine's delivery service Nova Poshta Shopping in Ukraine allows me to order from almost anywhere in the world, including Amazon in the USA (they have shipping addresses and warehouses all over the world). I recently ordered a spare part in the US and a book in the UK from different sellers in those countries, and both items reached me within 10 days in Ukraine at less than the cost of shipping within the original country. Much better the poor experience of international shipping in the US and Canada. Also another cool thing when ordering online in Ukraine is that the post office allows you try and return things in the post office itself. So you can order second-hand items on a market like eBay/Craigslist and you don't need to trust the seller. You can open the box, test to see if it the thing works, and send it back to seller if it's not to your satisfaction -- the post office itself takes escrow of the item for a minimal cost, and transfers money to the seller only if you got to try the item and are satisfied with it. This means you can easily buy second hand stuff online without organizing local meetup or needing to trust the seller. ATMs. You can withdraw cash from most bank ATMs without even having a bank card on you, just by scanning a QR-code from your phone using the banking app. Identity theft protection. All major dealings in the bank in Ukraine are photo-id'ed, i.e. the teller takes a picture of you when you make a request on your account.

I think fundamentally the reason behind info asymmetry in our day and age is that products and services have become so much more complex that there's simply no time to independently assess the qualities such as reliability, durability, and a myriad of other variables in each particular case. I think it's the complexity that is becoming our enemy number one, and too many variables when choosing a product as a consequence of that. Is the air conditioner too noisy? Does it require a WiFi connection and even a mobile app to function? People may omit some of these things even in their Amazon reviews.

A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years’ time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet. — Terry Pratchett, Men at Arms reply potato3732842 3 hours agorootparentThis trope was a slight exaggeration then and is basically false now.

That one replaced an earlier Orvis jacket, daily wear (even through one cool-ish summer we had down here in So Cal). The jacket is fine, the cuffs are a bit worn. I could have probably had a tailor trim them with leather and got several more years out of it. My current jacket is identical to the previous one. I managed to find a \"new old stock\" version of it. I really like the jacket (as you can guess). It's a \"ranger\" style, nylon shell, fabric liner, big pockets on the outside, with hand inserts as well, big pockets on the inside, other little pockets I don't use (what do folks put in those shoulder pockets?), zip up hood, jacket has zipper and buttons and a waist draw tie. It will keep the wet off, but soak through in driving rain, which is rare enough to not be an issue. If it's really cold, I have another long term jacket from LL Bean, or I could just layer under this thing. The LL Bean jacket has not seen substantial wear like the Orvis one has.

That little bit of extra Quality actually adds a fair amount to the bottom line, and drastically reduces the customer base. Most folks that get really rich, do so, by making acceptable-quality stuff, at a fairly low price, and selling lots of them. Making top-Quality stuff can make you feel good (and maybe arrogant), but it won't make the kind of money that selling dross does. reply Suppafly 2 hours agorootparentprevI wish sites like this would develop a shorthand for things like the boot analogy",

      "The efficient markets hypothesis, which posits that markets naturally eliminate inefficiencies, does not always hold true, particularly in tech hiring and product quality.- Silicon Valley companies face persistent inefficiencies due to a talent shortage, and consumers often rely on marketing rather than informed decisions to assess product quality.- Outsourcing can lead to dissatisfaction compared to in-house solutions, as seen with companies like Apple and Amazon, which have succeeded by building rather than buying, highlighting the impact of cultural norms and trust issues on efficiency."

    "commentSummary": [
      "Consumers face challenges in purchasing quality products due to poor design, hidden flaws, and planned obsolescence, which means products are intentionally not built to last.",
      "The abundance of options and difficulty in assessing true quality lead consumers to rely on superficial indicators like ratings, which may not accurately reflect product quality.",
      "Information asymmetry in markets results in buyers lacking the necessary knowledge to make informed decisions, often leading to reliance on potentially misleading vendor claims."

From here the rift and inevitable conflict. > If you are looking for some specific justification for a ban, you're missing the forest for the trees Every reason for the ban comes from the above competition for power and influence in the world.

And as it stands with the current war in Ukraine the EU was further shot in the foot. Today the EU is a good ally to further bolster US' claim for supremacy. China on the other hand has all but openly challenged the US for that title. On the surface at least they are skyrocketing in every area (won't go into how or why). They had the same \"incompatible\" political system for decades but they stood as manufacturing partner for many of those decades until Western leaders noticed a trend with a dangerous slope.

No nation political apparatus should have such a large direct (actual or potential) influence into the minds of the US public. It's a national security risk of the highest priority. Not every security risk is saber-rattling or direct cybersecurity threats. it's one thing if citizens look up and pursue the CCP's philosophies, but this is about stopping the direct injection of said propaganda straight into our toddlers, teens, and tweens brain.

I genuinely didn’t get the supposedly evident message before “Does it tell you anything ?” The bipartisan system in the US show that free and regular elections isn’t enough to prevent some dictatorship drawbacks, like when policies are made to serve a party and not the population interest. They don’t often coincide. To come back to LLM that could be an alteration to favor one party or another, or even both by occulting what people don’t like in the party system.

I don't see much of a difference, and if anything there's a very real possibility the two-party system allows people in charge of policy to distract from many issues with partisan politics. Both parties are the same with how they cater to the wealthy and the capitalist class.

Your list includes the sitting president and president-elect of the country, who do of course have quite a lot of power. Do I think that TikTok has more power than Rupert Murdoch? Probably not, Murdoch owns a wider variety of media even if he doesn't have any single dominant app. More power than Richard Sackler or Bill Clinton? Again, yes, without a doubt. reply Zak 4 hours agoparentprevEngagement driven algorithms do not necessarily show what users are consciously interested in, but what they subconsciously can't turn away from. You are probably a well-regulated, internet-savvy adult who easily recognizes engagement bait and knows to swipe away form it quickly to train the algorithm to stop showing it to you. People arguing for a ban are probably concerned about how it affects those who are not so regulated using logic similar to arguments for banning drugs. I do not share that position, but I'm inclined to support some weakening of platform immunity for services that use an individualized recommendation algorithm to maximize engagement. I did not quickly find an authoritative source, but it is widely reported that Douyin, the Chinese domestic market equivalent of TikTok deliberately favors educational content, especially for children. Here's one news report claiming that: https://abcnews.go.com/Business/tiktok-china/story?id=108111... reply aziaziazi 3 hours agorootparentThanks for sharing that article. > the distinctions largely owe to stiff regulations in China centered on youth social media use and political dissent. > The differences between the two apps highlight a comparatively permissive legal environment for social media in the U.S., protecting free expression but also leaving some users -- especially young ones -- vulnerable to addictive behavior, the experts said. > That same year, Douyin imposed a 40-minute daily limit for users under 14.

Or that not a symptom of a larger problem, or even multiple problems, we face, seemingly now more than ever before? I don’t want to say „banning TikTok is wrong“, I honestly do not know.

It may make it harder to hit these vulnerable demographics directly in the short term, but it won’t solve media literacy, corruption, or any of the other issues involved. reply ethbr1 5 hours agorootparentTaxing social media companies and using the tax proceeds to fund transparency initiatives would be interesting. E.g. grants to researchers and civil society labs Make them pay to monitor the problem they potentially create. reply api 6 hours agorootparentprevThe solution to this is to change the way elections work to make it harder to pull off this kind of short term influence pumping. The problem is that it’s possible to flood the zone with shit before people have a chance to have discourse on it. I’ve heard a number of ideas including multiple round elections with averaged results. That way if someone pops in round one the discourse can focus a spotlight on them and if people don’t like what they see on closer inspection they can push the other way in round two. The other problem though is that establishment politicians are so unpopular in so many places around the world that a rando with a simple catchy meme-worthy message can run in from nowhere and upset things. If the establishment were more responsive to the people it would be harder to do this. reply onemoresoop 5 hours agorootparentAll social media is a fertile ground for propaganda and manipulation by bots. The only way forward is to ban politics in all social media. reply unethical_ban 2 hours agoparentprevIt is important for context that the above poster seems to be of the opinion that government rarely if ever can be useful for citizens.

Typically, censorship* investigation efforts (from academia or elsewhere, such as OONI, Apernet etc.) have tended to focus on non-American countries to map their firewalling infrastructure used to this end. Since the US was never brought up in these investigations, as an outsider, I got the distinct impression that TLS packets were never interfered with, and the US mostly relied on either seizing the domain and its associated resources (such as in the various piracy cases, the raidforums/breachforums investigation etc.) Does this mean that a second-order effect of this directive would be asking the ISPs to block requests based on SNI, and in that case would it be a first in the US? * For the purposes of this discussion, let us step aside the discussion about \"censorship\" and simply use that term to mean any kind of network filtering used by ISPs. reply numpad0 8 hours agoparentWould killing .ipa/.apk distribution not suffice?

The right to freedom of speech enumerated in the US constitution is generally interpreted to mean that the government cannot punish its citizens for speaking out against the government. That's really all you're guaranteed. This has nothing to do with censorship, and in fact censorship in general is quite accepted in US law. You quite plainly do not have the right to unrestricted access to any information you want. No law even suggests that. Just for starters, we regularly ban books at the state level. In some places, you can be arrested for possessing certain materials. Perfectly constitutional. Freedom of speech does not mean you can say or print anything with no consequences. See libel. Freedom of speech does not mean you can read or posses any information you want. See classified materials, state secrets, illegal materials such as CSAM. Freedom of speech means that the government can't put three generations of your family in a concentration camp because you tweeted once that the president sucks. reply HDThoreaun 4 minutes agorootparent> The right to freedom of speech enumerated in the US constitution The problem is people switch between this definition of freedom of speech and the the more general version found in \"on liberty\" and other philosophical works. If youre talking about what the government is allowed to do sure use the first definition but this conversation started by talking about the second. By subtlety switching from \"is this something that is good to do\" to \"is this something the government is allowed to do\" youve derailed the conversation. Philosophical freedom of speech is much more than what is enumerated in the constitution. Cthulhu_ 5 hours agorootparentprevFreedom of speech is not the same as freedom of access to information though (idk if that's in any laws). That said, the basis of freedom of speech and information is that you will not get in trouble for accessing tiktok and co; it does not mean the US government or whoever has to make it easy for you. \"Not illegal\" does not mean \"accessible\". For example, a court ruled that it's legal to sell and trade digital purchases like games on Steam, but that does not mean Steam has to make it possible to transfer games to other people.

The First Amendment absolutely guarantees that right. Not accurate, no, assuming that by misinformation you mean information that the author knows to be false. To name just two quite legally clear examples with no inherent connection to foreign states, US defamation law and US product liability law often create civil liability and occasionally even criminal liability for certain categories of knowingly false statements. But, sure, spreading misinformation is not always illegal, and a blanket ban on that would indeed violate the First Amendment even though more targeted bans have been upheld as passing the relevant judicial tests for laws affecting First Amendment rights. reply Cookingboy 4 hours agorootparent>even though more targeted bans have been upheld as passing the relevant judicial tests for laws affecting First Amendment rights. Such as? reply jkaplowitz 4 hours agorootparentSuch as the two examples I gave in the comment you're quoting: US defamation law and US product liability law. To be more concrete about the defamation example: Imagine someone has a grudge against you for some reason that doesn't involve any history of illegal behavior, like maybe your business won a lucrative contract that they wanted for their business. Motivated by a desire to hurt your personal reputation and cause you social ostracism, they tell all your friends and neighbors that you're a convicted murderer, when they know you've never even been accused of any kind of wrongdoing in any court whatsoever. To the best of my knowledge, this is illegal defamation in every US state, and it's criminal in some of them. Although it's rarely prosecuted as a crime, criminal defamation laws have been upheld as constitutional in certain situations including ones that would cover this scenario (if the available evidence meets the criminal standard of proof in court). Civil defamation lawsuits are commonly enough made across the US, and under scenarios like this one, are also commonly enough won (or settled between the parties). To be more concrete about the product liability example: Imagine that you are a business selling a product and you write \"safe for all ages\" on the box, when you know it has components that are small enough for young children to choke on, but you lie about it on the packaging because your product really appeals to young children and you don't want to lose out on the profits from selling to their parents. If a 2-year-old then proceeds to choke on one of the components in the box, yes indeed there are lots of courts across the US that would award damages to the affected family, and maybe some courts that would find criminal liability as well although I'm less sure of that question. reply shlant 4 hours agorootparentprev> Secondly no, it's not illegal to spread misinformation, no matter the motive. The First Amendment absolutely guarantees that right. Again, does NOBODY know what the first amendment covers???

Low IQ tbh reply libertine 5 hours agorootparentIn Democracies, there are laws in place to protect voters.

Free Speech isn't the freedom to dupe voters, because voters may have the capacity to discern misinformation from information.

For example, would you prefer to live in Xinjang (being Uigur) in China, or let's say in Europe? Also a government of a country can change. Being raised in a communist Poland I was quite used to all government officials treating you quite famously badly. This was still pretty much in full swing around 2004 (many years after the all of Communism) when I emigrated to the UK. Then I went back, full time around 2019. Imagine my surprise when I had one of my first dealings with a tax office (I was registering my company for Vat online and I put in a wrong start date) and it wasn't through registered mail requesting I attend in person at so and so time (to wait 3 hours) and be told I'll be getting a fine. Nope, they rang me, on my phone, and asked if I can please amend it. So I thought, wow, they must have employed a new person who hasn't learned how to put people down properly yet. But then in the course of my business I dealt with social services and such and the same pattern repeated. Now, it is not all dancing cats and roses, the juidiciary is still pretty bad I'm told, but it's not so much about corruption these days, more about ineptitude, slowness and doing their own interpretation of the laws, which they aren't allowed to do in non-precedents system(they can continue mainly because of their independence - can't force people to actually obey the law if they are the law without turning it into a dictatorship, so waiting for them to retire seems to be the only option). So things are bit more nuanced than \"all government is equally bad\". reply snapcaster 5 hours agorootparentI'm not saying this like it's some huge deal but i think this comment illustrates my general frustration with discussion on China. Why would you compare the most marginalized group of one society with a normal person in another? Do you think that's fair?

Using American social media as the control group for neutrality on China is absolutely insane. The most likely cause is that TikTok is just a lot less political and more international than YT and Instagram.

The US Government has tremendously more influence on the local/western platforms, and on people who work there.

Tiktok has nothing to do with it either, America's youth by in large cast off the zionist evangelical brand of Christianity the babyboomers love so much. This has been going on for decades, tiktok isn't responsible for it. Anyway, I don't think this is the reason for the tiktok ban. The zionists have lost control of the narrative on American platforms too, they know it, and they have no actionable plan for getting it back. I think the tiktok ban is instead motivated by concerns for what a PRC controlled tiktok could do to military recruitment. Military recruitment hinges on appealing to teenagers, making tiktok a particular threat to the American government. Sending teenagers videos of drones dropping grenades on helpless wounded soldiers can't be canceled out by flying cool military jets over sportsball games. reply RandomThoughts3 11 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not a censorship issue.

Therefore, removing TikTok from app stores is not censorship, because it's the platform itself that's being targeted, not particular speech that's on it. Either you knew that already and you're making a bad faith argument, or you don't understand the concept of censorship. reply kelnos 10 hours agorootparentprev\"Mistreat\" is a bit unnecessarily dramatic. People in the US were fine (possibly even better off) before TikTok, and they'll be just fine if it goes away. China's level of internet control and censorship does seem to rise to the level of mistreatment (in that they control and shape access to information, in ways that further the interests of state propaganda), but denying Chinese companies (and the Chinese government) market access to American consumers in some spheres seems fine. It's never been a two-way street with China, and I think we should be engaging in a bit of protectionism when it comes to allowing or not allowing Chinese companies to operate here. If the US government were suppressing particular views or discussion of some topics (as the Chinese government does to their own citizens), then I would be alarmed. But that's not what's happening here; if the TikTok ban goes through, US citizens' free speech rights will not be meaningfully impacted, as there are other platforms that can and will carry the same content. Banning a foreign company from doing business in your country isn't automatically censorship. There's nuance. (And beyond all this, I do worry about the Chinese government using TikTok as a platform to influence Western citizens' thought, culture, and politics, for their own purposes.

Given the history of cryptography we can't even rely on that anymore and have to assume a compromise in the future due to how those elliptic curves (and their seeds) are created. Even just assuming that Qualcomm doesn't track you with their two GPS domains that are constantly pinged is very naive. And we've also uncovered a history of abuse in CPU backdoors (looking at you, Intel). So where does transparency have to start?

It's not censorship so this also doesn't make sense. They are being forced to be sold. TikTok can exist just fine, just not under control of ByteDance which is de facto under control of the CCP. The basic point here is that the CCP will not be allowed to control a major media arm in the US which is in turn used to spread CCP propaganda.

Good example, and thank god that is unconstitutional. For example China can arrest American citizens in China without dual process. But we cannot arrest Chinese citizens, or anyone here in the U.S. and just put them to prison without dual process. Americans in China have no freedom of speech. Should we ban Chinese citizens in the U.S. from speaking freely as well? Again, that is unconstitutional. U.S. constitution protects anyone within the U.S. not just U.S. citizens.

Has never censored any opinion? reply kypro 5 hours agorootparentprevI think a ban that prohibits the distribution of a product is fine. My understanding is that private citizens are still legally allowed to use TikTok if they want, but TikTok isn't allowed to market their product directly to US consumers via App stores. That seems pretty reasonable given China's position on US internet products. Free trade and openness only works if all parties agree on the rules. If one party is open while the other exploits that openness by selectively opening up only when it benefits them then undermines the principles you believe in. If we want China to be more open we have to ensure they're playing by the rules and they're not going to do that if we continue to allow them to exploit us. reply Cthulhu_ 5 hours agorootparentprevThat's a straw man argument and kind of a different thing entirely (moral / ethics / human rights vs corporations / entertainment) though. Anyway while I do agree with your statement about censorship vs openness, I do think in the broader sense things need to be done about social media - that is, Tiktok is specifically singled out for being Chinese, but its target audience, addictiveness, usefulness as a propaganda tool, is very much not unique on the market. It was only after Zuckerberg and presumably the SV tech lobbyists raised the issue of Tiktok with Trump and the government that they pulled on the brakes. But this is where the reciprocity argument comes in; US based services in China are under strict regulations and requirements, to the point where at best they can have a subsidiary in China under Chinese management. But while it's not trivial as a foreign entity to have a presence in the US either (e.g. you need to have or be a US company to be able to sell your software there), it seems more accessible and less restrictive than operating in China; in a sense this move levels the playing field. reply corimaith 9 hours agorootparentprev>You don’t fight censorship with censorship.

The issue here is probably caused by the requirement for an ICP recordal which requires removal of violating user-generated content within 15 minutes, which is probably a very tight deadline, probably coupled with a strong false positive rate which is why said companies are also hesitant to introduce automation.

We’re actively pressured to use co-pilot at work, and it’s crammed into every Microsoft product. I’m thankful that my iPhone is old enough not to use LLMs. Companies are afraid of being left behind in the new arms race, but that doesn’t actually mean that the technology actually present use-cases which most people need. (Worse are the meeting summaries or emails which are written by LLMs. The summaries are just not very good, and any sort of LLM writing is a tacit acknowledgement that people don’t really care what they are writing, an that no one is really reading that writing very carefully.) reply ARandumGuy 4 hours agoparentWhat I don't understand is, what benefit is there for 99% of companies to get in on the ground floor of LLMs? If you're not developing your own model, you're effectively just beta testing someone else's model. And if the sales pitch of LLMs being able to do basically anything comes true, wouldn't most companies still get the same benefit if they just wait? It seems like a lot of companies are so terrified of missing the boat that they don't sit down and do actual risk analysis. reply harrall 2 hours agorootparentI’ll tell you why this happens. You might use ChatGPT for a bit and your initial impressions will be great. It does what I ask of it! You might be aware that it makes mistakes sometimes, but when you use it, you don’t notice it because you’re using it interactively. Now if LLMs are just effective as your experience says, they are indeed extremely useful and you absolutely should see if they can help you. It’s only when you attempt to build a product — and it could be one person writing one Python script — that uses LLMs in an automated way with minimal human input that you really get insights into LLMs’ strengths and their limitations. You realize it could be useful, but you have to sometimes baby it a lot. How many people get to step two? That’s a select few. Most people are stuck in the dreamy phase of trying out interactive LLMs. This is a re-occurring issue with all new technology. Heck it happens with new software frameworks. reply hansonkd 2 hours agorootparentThe other problem I find is that LLMs are changing so fast, that what you evaluated 6-12 months ago, might be completely different now with newer models. So the strengths and weaknesses quickly can become outdated as the strengths grow and weaknesses diminish. When the first batch of LLMs people tried in 2023 had a lot of weaknesses. At the end of 2024, we can see increases in performance in speed and the complexity of output. People are creating frameworks on top of the LLMs that further increase their value. We went from thousands of tokens in context to millions of tokens pretty fast. I can see myself dividing problems up into 4 groups: 1. LLMs currently solve the problem 2. It doesn't solve it now, but we are within a couple iteration of next generation models or frameworks to be able to solve it 3. LLMs are still years off from being able to solve this effectively so wait and implement it when it can. 4. LLMs will never solve this. I think a lot of people building products are in group 2 right now. reply rcarmo 1 hour agorootparentRealism eventually sets in and they move to 3 and 4. reply tananan 2 hours agorootparentprevThis definitely resonates but I'm left wondering why there hasn't been a collective \"sobering up\" on this front. Not on a personal/team/company level, but just in terms of the general push to cram AI into everything. For how much longer will new s assault us in software where it ostensibly won't be that useful? It seems that the effort required to make an LLM work robustly within a single context (spreadsheet, worddoc, email, whatever) is so gargantuan (honestly) that the returns or even the initial manpower wouldn't be there. So any new feels more or less like bloat, and if not fully useless, then at least a bit anxiety inducing in that you have no clue how much you can rely on it. reply rcarmo 1 hour agorootparentI can tell you that there has been a lot of sobering up — but that the news isn’t made by those people… reply harrall 23 minutes agorootparentprevLook up any subject on the web and you a dearth of blogs saying you should do X, Y or Z. You can ask your own circle but I'm afraid it's not much different. So it's your job to figure out who actually is worth listening to... all the while you yourself have no experience with it. You have all these camps of people who have varying opinions on a subject and you end up in one of them. The HN camp on AI is a lot more sobering than an ecstatic Reddit subreddit about AI. Who actually has the real answers? The small slice of people who have tried building something. Everyone else is just listening to their circle. reply mukunda_johnson 3 hours agorootparentprevI said the same thing to a previous company before I was let go. Confused why they were butchering their business strategy in favor of a gold rush. The main benefit of LLMs was already abundantly clear: literally just chat with it in day to day work when you can. Ask it questions about accounting, other domains it knows, etc. That's like up to 10-20% performance increase on tasks if you align OK. Still, they were in search of a unicorn, and it was really tiring to be asked regularly how AI could help my workflows. They were not even spending a real budget on discovering \"groundbreaking\" use cases, meanwhile hounding us to shove a RAG-bot into every product they owned. The only thing that made sense was that it was a marketing strategy to promote visibility, but they would not acknowledge that or tell us that directly (but still--it was not their business strategy to get NEW customers). reply bitcurious 3 hours agorootparent> The main benefit of LLMs was already abundantly clear In my industry the main benefit (so far) is taking all of our human-legible unstructured data and translating it into computer-legible structured data.

LLMs are quite good at answering questions about accounting in ways which are superficially convincing-looking, yet also complete nonsense. \"But the magic robot told me it was okay\" will not fly in a tax audit, say. reply graemep 2 hours agorootparentExactly my immediate reaction. Accounting has to follow very strict rules and needs some application of judgement. It might answer questions in a useful way, but you have to make sure you understand the answers and that they match accounting standards or tax rules (and one danger, at least in some places, is that they are different and you might apply the wrong one). reply cyberpunk 1 hour agorootparentI couldn’t be arsed typing a reference number into my online banking for a bill payment the other and it was a copy protected pdf, so I fired a screenshot into Claude and GPT and asked it to extract the details I need and both of them repeatedly got the OCR wrong.

In reality, the decisions are made by individual executives and managers with their own interests in mind who are being asked by the people they report to what they’re doing in AI. And this goes all the way to the top where the CEOs are basically required to tell shareholders how they’ve implemented AI and how it’s helping them a bunch.

Of adding them to the workflow, training their employees, and understanding quickly how it impacts their space. If you just wait and all of your competitors have a workforce enabled and equipped with the best tools, you are at a disadvantage. It's being the company that put off computerization or automation when everyone else went wild. And FWIW, I cannot imagine a programmer, in 2024, that remains dismissive of LLMs or the related tooling. While they are grossly oversold by the LinkedIn crowd, and are still a far ways from so-called \"prompt engineers\" replacing devs, they're a massive accelerator and \"second set of eyes\", especially if you're doing varied, novel work. reply layer8 3 hours agorootparent> especially if you're doing varied, novel work. What do you mean by that? In my experience they mostly help when you are doing mainstream, well-trodden work for which a company’s/project’s/domain’s inside knowledge isn’t needed. Maybe you mean the latter by “novel”? reply llm_nerd 2 hours agorootparent>What do you mean by that? Varied and novel to the programmer. If you're doing the same thing day in and day out it probably isn't much use. If you're like many programmers and you're jumping between libraries and languages and platforms and APIs and domains and spheres, it's immensely helpful. >doing mainstream, well-trodden work for which a company’s/project’s/domain’s inside knowledge isn’t needed A core disconnect in this discussion is that many people seem to be arguing from the position of \"I tried to generate whole solutions with these tools and it failed, so it's useless\". Everything is well-trodden. One of the commentators in here, who declares themselves a unique snowflake where these tools are useless, does \"sockets with encryption and messaging\", which is some of the most well-trodden ground in this domain. Everything is glue. Everything is a lot of relatively simple things strung together. And for all of those, portions are helped and accelerated with these tools. reply pera 2 hours agorootparentIt's alright that you like LLMs but you don't need to name-call (\"luddites\", \"snowflakes\") those who don't find them as useful as you do. reply llm_nerd 2 hours agorootparentNeither case are name-calling, and I don't think pearl clutching for effect is useful here. Everyone is working in unique domains and spaces with weird rules and restrictions and needs. The whole point of the special snowflake comment is specifically that people aren't remotely unique in being a special snowflake. And the Luddism argument isn't \"name-calling\", it's an observation of an absolute truth on here. reply layer8 2 hours agorootparentprevEverything isn’t well-trodden. I’m mostly doing non-glue, heavily domain knowledge-based work. The main issue I’m running into is that explaining the domain and context to the LLM will take significantly more time than just doing the work myself, and also that parts of the necessary knowledge and most of the source code are NDA-protected, so only a local LLM would do. reply llm_nerd 2 hours agorootparentSigh. Everything is extremely well-trodden at the code level. You're taking some inputs and generating some outputs. You're calling some functions. You're manipulating some strings or lists or sets. You're sorting some things or filtering things. You're building a client to a given API. You're doing some messaging and some encryption. I guarantee that your code isn't remotely as unique or novel as you think it is. Of course on here everyone is 240lbs, 6'2\" and benches 350, and their magically novel, super unique code is just too secret. So everyone's special. If you had to explain the domain and context to these tools, you might be using them wrong. reply Smaug123 1 hour agorootparent\"It's all just code, how hard can it be, and your NDAs don't apply\" is certainly a take, but some people do actually solve problems whose solutions aren't already on the Internet and are forbidden from exfiltrating code! The fact that you don't solve such problems and are not bound by such NDAs is not a huge piece of evidence, to be honest. Can you imagine even in principle a piece of evidence that would convince you otherwise? reply llm_nerd 1 hour agorootparentWho said that NDAs don't apply? If you need to strawman to make an argument, just save the bits and skip doing it. And yes, in the end all code distills down to shit that is very similar to the countless billions of lines of code on the internet. Everything -- every single project that anyone on this site is working on -- is a bunch of glued together shit where 90% (more like 99% Probably 99.9%) of it is in common with code seen in countless other projects. Utterly regardless of domain or business or project specific uniqueness. Someone would have to be profoundly incompetent to not realize this. Again, I seem to arguing with people who think that using a tool means feeding it their whole projects and having it rewrite it in Rust or something. In reality a programmer could yield immense value from such tools having a) given it zero lines of their code, b) used zero lines of the code it generated. This isn't a difficult concept, but I'm going to continue getting insane responses by all of the unique people who work on the amazingly unique situations where instead of sorting from A-Z, they sort from Z-A! reply Smaug123 2 minutes agorootparentYou certainly strongly implied that NDAs don't apply with the phrase \"their magically novel, super unique code is just too secret\". You used the words \"is just too secret\" sarcastically, which led me to believe you think in fact the work is not too secret to exfiltrate to the LLMs on the Internet: that is, that NDAs don't apply. > In reality a programmer could yield immense value from such tools having a) given it zero lines of their code, b) used zero lines of the code it generated. We simply have different experiences of life! I think with the advent of Claude 3.5 Sonnet the LLMs have just about edged out ahead in terms of time saved vs time wasted, for me, but before Sonnet I'm fairly confident they were moderately net negative for me. Can you give some concrete examples of where they've helped you this dramatically? With links to chat logs? I still don't understand how people are finding them so useful, and I keep asking people and they keep not providing chat logs so I can see what they're doing. furyofantares 2 hours agorootparentprevNovel to the programmer. Even the best programmers have very narrow skills relative to the whole field. Yeah, I've used 20+ languages and hundreds of technologies and a variety of different types of product and can pick things up quickly. But it's still a drop in the bucket of technologies you can use and types of problem you can solve. Programmer skills are deep but narrow. LLM skills are shallow but wide.

For example you can directly ask it to solve a simple math problem, which nowadays it will usually do correctly by generating and executing a Python script, but then ask it to write a speech announcing the solution to the same problem, to which it will probably still hallucinate a nonsensical solution. I just tried it again and IME this prompt still makes it forget how to do the most basic math: Write a speech announcing a momentous scientific discovery - the solution to the long standing question of (48294-1444)*0.3258 reply llm_nerd 2 hours agorootparent4o and o1 get this right. LLMs should never do math. They shouldn't count letters or sort lists or play chess or checkers. Basically all of the easy gotcha stuff that people use to point out errors are things that they shouldn't do. And you pointed out something they do now which is creating and run a python script. That really is a pretty solid, sustainable heuristic and is actually a pretty great approach. They need to apply that on their backend too so it works across all modes, but the solution was never just an LLM. Similarly, if you ask an LLM a chess question -- e.g. the best move -- I'd expect it to consult a chess engine like Stockfish. reply Merad 2 hours agorootparent> LLMs should never do math. They shouldn't count letters or sort lists or play chess or checkers. But these aren't \"gotcha questions\", these are just some of the basic interactions that people will want to have with intelligent assistants. Literally just two days ago I was doing some things with the compound interest formula - I asked Claude to solve for a particular variable of the formula, then plug in some numbers to calculate the results (it was able to do it). Could I have used Mathematica or something like that? Yes of course. But supposedly the whole purpose of a general purpose AI is that I can use it to do just about anything that I need to do. Likewise there have been multiple occasions where I've needed ChatGPT or Claude to work with tables or lists of data where I needed the results to be sorted. reply llm_nerd 2 hours agorootparentThey're gotcha in the sense that people are intentionally asking LLMs to do things that LLMs are terrible at doing. LLMs are language models. They aren't math models. Or chess models. Or sorting or counting models. They aren't even logic models. So early on the value was completely in language. But you're absolutely correct that for these tools to really be useful they need to be better than that, and slowly we're getting there. If you're asking a math question as a component of your question, firstly delegate that to an appropriate math engine while performing a series of CoT steps. And so forth. reply recursive 1 hour agorootparentIf this stuff is getting sold as a revolution in information work, or a watershed moment in technology, or as a cultural step-change, etc, then I think the gotcha is totally fair. There seems to be no limit to the hype or sales pitch. So there need be no bounds for pedantic gotchas either. reply llm_nerd 1 hour agorootparentI entirely agree with you. Trying to roll out just a raw LLM was always silly, and remains basically a false promise. Simply increasing the number of layers or parameters or transformer complexity will never resolve these core gaps. But it's rapidly making progress. CoT models coupled with actual domain-specific logic engines (math, chemistry, physics, chess, and so on) will be when the promise is actually met by the reality. reply TRiG_Ireland 2 hours agorootparentprevWith general mathematical questions, I've often found WolframAlpha surprisingly helpful. reply e1g 3 hours agorootparentprevo1 gets this correct. reply dagaci 2 hours agorootparentprevAnd here lies the dichotomy of correctness: Context?

That is not even remotely my experience. Like I can envision a programmer who would get benefits from it, but bluntly put, the code I work on day to day is far, far too interesting to be handled by copilot, simply because there aren't nearly enough stackoverflow pages about it to be scraped. Honestly if you found yourself able to automate most of your job with copilot, if anything, you have my sincerest condolences. I can't imagine how utterly bored you are in your day-to-day. IF copilot could get to a place where it could understand, comprehend, and weigh-in on code, that would be incredibly useful. But that's not what Copilot is because that's not what transformers are.

While it's certainly possible that this divide is based on how 'hard' the problems people are using them on, my current theory is that some people use them like the proverbial rubber duck - in other words, a way to explore the code, and generate some stuff to work on, while thinking through the problem. Personally, I have not yet tried it, so I'm curious which side of the discussion I'll fall ... reply furyofantares 2 hours agorootparentI think young programmers who are less heavily invested in their skills and who haven't built a life that's highly dependent on using them are generally more interested in figuring out what programming with LLMs means. But so are much older programmers who have seen it all, including the obsoletion of many of their skills, and who are not so dependent on continuing to use them as they could retire anyway. It's more the middle (programmer) age senior programmers who are less likely to see any use. I've seen the same pattern with artists' interest in generative AI. But it's complicated because it IS also dependent on what you're doing. So it's hard to know if something is being dismissed correctly due to domain/expertise, or prematurely due to not putting the work in and figuring out what these tools mean. reply llm_nerd 3 hours agorootparentprevThis really touches on it. I'm a big advocate of these tools, but they author approximately zero lines of my code, yet I still find them invaluable and a wonderful tool to leverage, and do so constantly. Particularly in challenging projects and needs.

I personally can tell you that for what I work on, in my domain, these tools have been a net time suck and not a gain, and I pretty much only use them to ask questions about documentation, which it often gets incorrect anyway (again, in subtle ways that are probably hard for someone who isn't very senior to detect). Hope that helps. reply marxisttemp 2 hours agorootparentprevYes, absolutely, they’re an ideal rubber duck and I’ve come to really value them for my work.

My take is: if the project is doing something that has been asked a thousand times on stackoverflow and has hundreds of pages in the tutorial content mills, the LLM will tell you something reasonably meaningful about it. I'd hazard a guess that most people overenthusiastic about those tools are gluing together javascript libs. This is not necessarily a bad thing, we even asked a LLM today at work to generate some code for a library that we didn't know how to use but seems fairly popular, and the output looked like it would make sense. (Can't tell you how it ended up because I wasn't the one implementing the thing.) However, we also spent 2 hours in a group debugging session because we're working on a completely custom codebase that isn't documented anywhere on geeksforgeeks, stackoverflow or anywhere else public. I highly doubt that even a local LLM would be able to help, and no way this code is leaving the premises. reply llm_nerd 1 hour agorootparent>if the project is doing something that has been asked a thousand times There are many billions of lines of high-quality, commented code online, covering just about everything.

At this point it's comedy how often this \"oh I understand that the noobs get value from this, but not us Advanced Programmers\". It's absurdist and honestly at this point I just shake my head. My day is filled with C++, Python, Rust, Go, the absolute cutting edge of AI research, and I find these tools absolutely invaluable now. They are a massive accelerator. Zero JavaScript libs or \"LOL WEB DEV\" programming in my life. reply nottorp 51 minutes agorootparentYes, you mentioned those things that are documented everywhere. I do use LLMs to give me skeleton code for those parts I'm not familiar with. How about a full equivalent of Qt that is proprietary and has absolutely nothing public in it? How is a LLM going to help with that? There is no public info anywhere. > the absolute cutting edge of AI research No offense but there are billions of public pages about \"AI\" research since it's the new gold rush. Of course LLMs have material about all your libs. reply llm_nerd 40 minutes agorootparent>but there are billions of public pages about \"AI\" research Billions? For many of the things I am working on there are zero public pages outside of research papers. I said nothing about working with libs. Again, I'm not asking an AI \"here's my project now finish it\", I'm working with AIs for the countless little programming challenges and needs. Things that mirror things done in many, many other projects, most having nothing to do with my domain. As an aside, starting that with \"no offense\" as an attempt to make it insulting is...weird. I feel like this discussion is taking place ten years ago. The weird reference to StackOverflow is particularly funny. reply ToucanLoucan 3 hours agorootparentprevSome people seem to be taking me saying \"you must work on boring code\" as a judgement against them as developers, and it isn't. I'm speaking directly from my experience: If I asked it beginner-tier questions about how to do X in Y language, it would get those right quite often. I could see Copilot being very useful if you're breaking into a new language, or just knocking the rust off the gears of one in your head. And like, even for those who write a lot of boring code, like... cool man. I don't judge people for that. We need all code written and all code is not exciting, novel, or interesting and there's nothing wrong with doing it. Someone's gotta. I'm just saying that the further up the proverbial complexity chain I went, the less able Copilot was. And once I was quite in the weeds, it seemed utterly perplexed and frankly, not worth the time in asking. reply llm_nerd 2 hours agorootparent>as a judgement against them as developers No one takes it as a judgment, and no one is offended. It's just a truth that when people make such claims, they're often exaggerating the uniqueness or novelty of what they're doing. You described your work in another comment, and what you described is the most bog standard programming in the field. It's always the case. reply aftbit 2 hours agorootparentprevYeah, at least 90% of any job is just making license plates. I have worked on both very complex and challenging code and also very simple and easy code in my career, even within one job. reply beardedwizard 3 hours agorootparentprevThere is a lot to unpack here, but is your code so interesting that it defies understanding by an AST? Code models are trained to semantically represent code, so unless you use semantics that exist outside of software engineering the claim that your code is too unique for llm is false. Maybe you are imagining a case where the entire codebase is generated by a single prompt? reply malcolmgreaves 3 hours agorootparentAn abstract syntax tree is not semantics. And language models don’t do this kind of explicit syntax parsing and representation at any rate. reply beardedwizard 2 hours agorootparentI'll admit I haven't seen the training data but some basic googling shows a subset of the labeling is syntax annotations. I am not claiming LLMs parse code in the way you are suggesting, but they certainly have token level awareness of syntax and probable relations which are the roots of any programming language. reply ToucanLoucan 3 hours agorootparentprevThe shorter and also \"not breaching confidentiality\" answer I can give is we're dealing with setting up custom sockets over incredibly long range wireless connections that require clear and verified transmission of packets of data, rolling both our own messaging protocol and security features as we go. When last I tried anyway, Copilot was, frankly, useless. reply cube2222 1 hour agorootparentFwiw, copilot is not a particularly powerful LLM. It's at most glorified smarter autocomplete. I personally use LLMs for coding a lot, but Copilot is not really what I'd have in mind saying that. Rather, I'd be using something like the Zed editor with its AI Assistant integration and Claude Sonnet 3.5 as the model, where I first provide it context in the chat window (relevant files, pages, database schema, documents it should reference and know) and possibly discuss the problem with it briefly, and only then (with all of that as context in the prompt) do I ask it to author/edit a piece of code (via the inline assist feature, which \"sees\" the current chat). But it generally is the most useful for \"I know exactly what I want to write or change, but it'll take me 30 minutes to do so, while with the LLM I can do the same in 5 minutes\". They're also quite good at \"tell me edge-cases I might have not considered in this code\" - even if 80% of the suggestions it'll list are likely irrelevant, it'll often come up with something you might've not thought about. There's definitely problems they're worse than useless at, though. Where more complex reasoning is warranted, OpenAI o1 series of models can be quite decent, but it's hit or miss, and with the above prompt sizes you're looking at 1-2$ per query. reply llm_nerd 3 hours agorootparentprev>Hi. I was being dismissively rhetorical. I can actually imagine them because we see them on HN constantly, with a Luddism that somehow actually becomes a rather hilarious attempt at superiority.

It's honestly just embarrassing at this point. >but bluntly put, the code I work on day to day is far, far too interesting to be handled by copilot Hilarious. It's a cliche at this point. Let me take it further and turn this on its head: The people who usually think LLMs aren't valuable to coders generally work on the most boring, copy/paste prattle. They stick to the same tiny niche all day every day. They're basically implementing the same thing again and again. It's so rote, and they're so profoundly unchallenged, that tooling has no value. reply Clubber 3 hours agorootparent>with a Luddism that somehow actually becomes a rather hilarious attempt at superiority >The people who usually think LLMs aren't valuable to coders generally work on the most boring, copy/paste prattle. Here you are doing the same thing, aren't you? Instead of calling people names, the biggest tell of a weak argument, why don't you explain the type of work you do and how using an LLM is faster than if you coded it yourself and and/or also faster than any current way of doing the same thing. I'm assuming you are a senior+ level coder. reply llm_nerd 3 hours agorootparentBut...I'm not doing the same thing. In actuality I'm saying I'm a fairly typical programmer in a common situation: I work across a variety of languages and platforms and toolings and projects, building solutions for problems. The truth is that extraordinarily few programmers are working on anything truly novel. Zero of the readers of this comment are, in all likelihood. The ridiculous notion that someone has so unique of a need that it hasn't been seen is kind of hilarious nonsense. It's the \"I'm so random! Other girls aren't like me\" bit. >Instead of calling people names Who called anyone a name? Luddism? Yes, many HN participants are reacting to AI in a completely common rejection of change / challenge, and it recurs constantly. >how using an LLM is faster than if you coded it yourself I am coding it myself. Similar to the other guy who talks about putting an LLM in \"charge\" of his precious, super-novel code, you're setting up a strawman where using an LLM implies some particular scenario that you envision. In reality I spend my day asking questions, getting broad strokes, getting code commented, asking for API or resources, etc. reply mrtranscendence 2 hours agorootparentI suspect you're overstating the degree to which an LLM might be unsuitable for some types of work. For example, I'm a data scientist who works primarily in the field of sales forecasting. I've found that LLMs are quite poor at this task, frequently providing answers that are inappropriate, misleading, or simply not a good fit for the data we're working with. In general I've found very limited use in engaging LLMs in discussion about my work. I don't think I'm calling myself a super special snowflake here. These models are just ... bad at sales forecasting. LLMs aren't entirely useless for me. I'll use ChatGPT to generate code to make plots. That's helpful. reply llm_nerd 2 hours agorootparentI would never recommend an LLM for sales forecasting. It's just the wrong tool for that job. reply Clubber 2 hours agorootparentprev>Who called anyone a name? Luddism? Sorry, perhaps I misinterpreted it. >In reality I spend my day asking questions, getting broad strokes, getting code commented, asking for API or resources, etc. Can you give me some concrete examples? I'd like to use it, but I'm currently of the mind: 1. If it's boring code, I can write it faster than asking LLM to do it and fixing its issues. 2. If it's not boring code, like say a rules engine or something, I'm not sure the LLM will give me a good result based on the domain. I mainly stick to back end work, automation, building WebAPI's and DSS engines for the medical field. Maybe I'm under and over thinking it at the same time. FWIW, I typically stick to a single main language, but where I usually work, the companies dictate a GP language for all our stuff: C# in my example. I do a small amount of Python for LLM training, but I'm just starting out with Python. I can see it being useful saying, \"convert this C# to Python,\" but honestly, I'd rather just learn the Python. reply ToucanLoucan 3 hours agorootparentprev> Who called anyone a name? Luddism? Yes, many HN participants are reacting to AI in a completely common rejection of change / challenge, and it recurs constantly. You should read up on what Luddism and Luddists were actually about. They didn't think the machines were evil or satanic, which is the common cultural read. They assumed (correctly) that the managerial class would take full advantage of increased productivity of lower-quality goods to flood the market with cheap shit that would put competitors out of business, and let them fire 4/5 of their workforces while doing so. And considering the state of the textile industry today, I think that was a pretty solid set of projections. Luddites didn't oppose automation on the basis that machines are scary. They were the people who worked the machines that already existed at the time, after all. They opposed them on the basis that the greedy bastards who owned everything would be the only ones actually benefiting from automation, everyone else would get one kind of shaft or another, which again: is exactly what happened. This, actually is incredibly analogous to my opinions about LLM. It's an interesting tech that has applications but is already being situated to be the sole domain of massive hyperscalers and subject to every ounce of enshittification that follows every tech that goes that way, while putting creatives, and yes some coders, out of a job. So yes, it was name calling, but also I don't object to the association. In this case, I'm a Luddite. I am suspicious of the motivations and the beneficiaries of automation being forced into my industry and I'm not going to be quiet about it. reply robotresearcher 1 hour agorootparent> the greedy bastards who owned everything would be the only ones actually benefiting from automation, […] which again: is exactly what happened.

They were primarily opposed to automation because it devalued the work they did and the skills they held. That is the core essence of Luddism.

There were some post-facto justifications like product quality, but if that was true they'd have no problem out-competing the machines. Yes, it is Luddism that drives a lot of the AI sentiment seen on HN, and it is not only utterly futile and basically people convincing themselves and each other while the world moves on.

I work with a distributed team that has four different native languages, with substantial engineering staff for each. LLMs have made our cross-geo communications so much better. I can get a summary of a standup that happened overnight (to me) and in a foreign language (to me) when I get up in the morning. I can write idiomatically and naturally without worrying it will be confusing or misinterpreted. Plenty of people are not naturally talented writers, especially in your language of choice. LLM writing doesn’t mean they don’t care, it means they DO care about communicating clearly. reply numpad0 1 hour agorootparent> I can write idiomatically and naturally without worrying it will be confusing or misinterpreted. Note that this depends on the language. LLM translations aren't that much more accurate than predecessors other than that it's more strongly constrained to grammatical English, and there's limit to how natural one could be through translations, depending on how much cultural co-development your own background had with the target environment - your framing and storytelling will sound off even through human translators if the cultures are too far apart. LLMs tends to be a bit more robust than previous MTs, that's for sure. reply mukunda_johnson 3 hours agorootparentprevI like that--generally I agree that LLMs inflating text is not adding value, but it is a great point that LLMs can help bridge language barriers. reply mey 3 hours agorootparentprevHow accurate are the summaries? reply bunderbunder 3 hours agorootparentThis is what worries me.

If they're wrong - they also look good (we tried the latest fad, pushed everyone to really give it a go, and decided it wasn't worth it).

It's easy to explain: there's so much content around \"AI is going to increase productivity\", and \"if your company doesn't use AI it won't be competitive\". AI evangelists are everywhere, from the internet to their direct network, reinforcing the idea. Investors are also influenced the same way, and put direct pressure on the leaders.

Someone gets sold on or just excited about the features claimed by a particular product and becomes the czar for that thing.

Therefore, every meeting I'm in has notes taken, though no one else is even aware (unless they are taking their own, which I assume many are). I think this is relatively common (since I can't see how one can function in most knowledge work without some version of this) so I would assume that you probably are in meetings where notes are taken, even if you never see them. reply dylan604 2 hours agorootparentThis is moving the goal posts, though, and you know it. In a meeting with \"notes taken\", there is someone tasked with doing so in an official manner usually decided by the person coordinating the meeting. It is also typically known by the meeting attendees that this is the case. Those notes are usually made available after the fact in whatever form is normal for that company. In Zoom type meetings, we all get the \"recording\" notice during the meeting. What individuals do is not the point of this thread. However, we've seen plenty of examples of where individuals do record on their own devices meetings which were meant to be private but leaked later.

I've never experienced the situation you describe, and literally didn't know that this was a practice. I've seen formal meetings run by Robert's Rules, which have a secretary keeping \"minutes\", which are a subtly different thing and are generally not useful for anything other than official purposes. I've also seen meetings where some enterprising project manager says they will \"make notes available\". Sometimes they even do this, but even when they do, the notes are useless for everyone who isn't them -- they've just distributed their personal notes in the hopes that somehow they would be useful to others in the meeting, which of course they aren't. Have a nice day. reply mrtranscendence 2 hours agorootparentprevWe're not allowed to record meetings at work, with some exceptions such as trainings.

This to me sounds silly but in retrospect, I'm starting to believe this was exactly the case. Apple has been on a wrong trajectory for the past few years: - They were busy building Apple Car. Then when the AI pressure finally kicked in, they stopped the car project. Why were they in the car business in the first place?! And why did they simply tell most Apple Car employees to work on AI now? Cars also have AI but it's not the same thing. - They built Apple Vision Pro but have failed to showcase any real-world use case for it yet. Apple Intelligence isn't even supported on the AVP. I don't want to call it a failed project but by many measures it is. - Apple, and specifically Tim Cook, are great at optimization: from the supply chain to setting optimal prices that extract the most value from customers. But they forgot what allowed them to do this in the first place: a decade-long vision set by Steve Jobs. Current day Apple isn't going to disappear, but it's becoming less and less relevant in the broader tech landscape. In a sense, Apple has become the McDonald's of handheld gadgets. But if I want the latest tech, the most interesting use-cases of AI, or simply ground-braking devices no one has heard of, I'd go to a French/Persian/etc. restaurant instead of Apple's McDonalds. reply brookst 3 hours agorootparentThanks for the obligatory “Apple is doomed” comment. I get it, and odds are one day it will be true so no harm trotting it out decade after decade, but I don’t think that time is now. - Watch and AirPods have both been incredible successful and were pure Cook-era Apple. Both were first envisioned after Jobs died. - Car was a failure, but it seems odd to criticize Cook for being a mere optimizer when he enthusiastically spent billions on the project. Which is it? No vision, or too-ambitious vision? - Agree that AVP has been disappointing. But again, so what? It’s similar to the Newton. Not every product will succeed. And again it’s hard to see AVP as a “McDonalds” effort. I don’t know what it is about Apple that attracts these “they are doomed if every product isn’t as revolutionary as the iPhone” takes.

Of course, the real value lies in ironing out all the edge cases, but compared to doing all of that manually, it should still be orders of magnitude cheaper. reply wizzwizz4 24 minutes agorootparentIt's not, because \"ironing out all the edge-cases\" is orders of magnitude more expensive than just designing a system without edge-cases in the first place.

Also how does power control or history cycles have anything to do with curing macular degeneration? reply nerdjon 4 hours agoprevI disagree, I think the problem with surveys like this is the focus on billing everything as \"AI\" instead of just what it used to be as a nice feature. A lot of the small things that Apple has introduced, are things that blend in and are not screaming \"AI\" at you. Which is a good thing. So many of the things that are being pushed by other companies are AI crap that is flashy to show off but either the utility of it is nowhere near the promise due to fundamental issues with AI, or the novelty of it wears off and is actually useless and no one cares. Sure I wish that Apple was a bit faster with some of this, but when compared to things like Recall, rabbit, or other vaporware. They are going about it the right way, we just need to stop trying to throw around the \"AI\" name on everything when most users didn't have \"ML\" shoved down their throats for the features that they used every day powered by (fundamentally) the same tech. reply layer8 2 hours agoparentThe article is specifically about what Apple calls “Apple Intelligence”, not about other AI/ML-based features they have incorporated. reply TheJoeMan 3 hours agoparentprevI think you are downplaying just how many eggs Tim Cook has put in this basket to pitch to shareholders vs. the perceived low % of apple engineering staff that seems to have been involved in its creation. ATT has been advertising \"get the new iPhone with Apple Intelligence\" before it was even available for sale! And now it's here, and it's a tiny bump in feature set. A super missed opportunity to rebrand/completely revamp Siri, and instead an implicit acceptance of defeat that Siri is still so dumb, you should just ask her to ask \"someone else\" (ChatGPT). Cook is feeling pressure to explain how Apple is going to crank out unsustainable revenue growth even after basically saturating the world (at some point you've won capitalism). reply nerdjon 3 hours agorootparentApple has to balance it, clearly investors want to shove AI into everything but most users simply don't care or want to be reminded its \"AI\" every moment. Apple has to walk the line between both of these groups. You are right about investors, but how many of those investors have also funded and continue to push for vaporware products and features? We have seen this many many times over the last couple of years. So I do think their importance needs to be downplayed since they are clearly making bad decisions. Also, this article was about customers not investors. Apple for years has been marking \"Siri\" as far more than just the voice assistant and instead encompassing many of their ML systems. For example the \"Siri App Suggestions\".

I've enabled Apple Intelligence and don't have anything negative to say except that it's difficult to figure out where I can and can't use it when I want to. It mostly stays out of the way, and when I do notice it it's been useful, which imo is about exactly what I want in an AI product built into the OS. My favorite feature has to be the email summarization thing. When I get inexplicably cc'd on a long thread by some clients, it's nice to have a summarization at the top so I can quickly determine whether it's something I need to deal with now or later.

I don't understand how, but its AI message summaries often completely flip the meaning of texts I've received. I've gotten summaries that say \"X person hates Y\" and I read the message and it's them talking about how much they love it. It is impressively, wildly inaccurate. It confuses things like people's names and the messages they're sending and sometimes will paraphrase names that are also english-language words into related concepts and blend them into sentences that make no sense. The only thing it seems to do accurately is describe images that have been sent to me, though I don't really see the value in a 2 sentence summary of an image being sent (folks with limited visibility will probably feel differently.) I have never received a summary that gave me any idea of what the hell the messages it was summarizing was about. It's impressively bad. I'm shocked apple shipped this. reply reilly3000 1 hour agoparentIt’s bad because they are using very small local models on device, like on the order of 3 billion parameters as opposed to the trillion+ param models available in the cloud. They could keep the security model and have larger, slower models for summaries (what’s the urgency of a summary?) but that would be a battery killer. It’s clear they need to train on messaging content, but they have promised not to use their users content.

A deeply integrated version of the best o1 chat and vision models with context from all various apps and ability to do complex app interactions could be amazing. They could even have the ability to have AI basically create on demand personalized new applications for specific use cases. They could integrate it to be a proactive AI agent regularly interacting with you regarding various goals (instead of just answering questions).

At best right now it may give me a Wikipedia entry or make a chipped tooth emoji. I think Apple started with hardware that can run little LLMs and asked “what can we run on these that people would like?” They didn’t start with a vision of what novel machine Intelligence feels like for a user, and slowly but thoroughly build a satisfying realization of that new relationship.

The big \"Allow Apple to collect anonymous data to help improve...\" screen you get when setting up your device is the master opt-out switch where you can turn all data collection off. For those that leave it on I think Apple have become very good about finding means to acquire user engagement data in a privacy-compliant way. For starters, by identifying user data with a cohort identifier when they can (which will cluster hundreds or thousands of user's data into arbitrary groups). Or if specific user engagement is wanted in order to see if usage patterns change they might create a rotating random identifier (that is regenerated to a new random identifier every 11 months so as to not build up an identifying profile). I think the bigger question for me is if they have the tools and teams in place that can take full advantage of that data to improve user experience. Or if it is just a firehose of data points that are left instead to just curdle in a large vat. reply andix 4 hours agoparentprevThe most useful thing for AI on an operating system level is in my opinion aggregation and summarization of data from different apps.

I'm still disappointed by what I'd consider to be simple stuff, like hands-free operation of my phone while driving, or even just simple instructions on operating the phone without needing to touch it (let alone look at it). I'm having trouble imagining what the product owners at Apple are actually expecting it to help us with - do they use it in their daily lives? A family member is blind, and in many ways digital assistants and AI voice control have been a godsend, and Apple Intelligence should have been enabling in so many ways. Instead it's an exercise in frustration, advertising hope where there is nope, as well as being all but hostile to blind users (Apple's is the best of a bad bunch).",

I've done some part-time work (retainers and project-based) over the past year and it's gone well. It's relatively high pay for part-time work, leaving me time and flexibility to work on my own project. The thing, I haven't really put much work into finding this kind of work.

I've gotten 99% of my contracts through word-of-mouth. You will get better long-term results than simply grinding through job boards (which you should still do--you never know). You will want to do two things: 1) Cultivate your existing network. Just the other day I reconnected with a friend I haven't seen in several decades. Guess what? He just so happened to be a software dev, and needed another dev to help him with a project. This is just one of many, many stories I have. Call or email people to see how they're doing. Even better, meet up with them for coffee or a meal. This doesn't have to be mercenary; you're probably already doing those things. But start reaching deeper into your network. 2) Build your your network by meeting others in your field and/or potential customers in person (e.g. at user groups, meetups, tech talks, etc.). Talk about what you do and love to do. Presumably that involves your skills that you want to get work in. Finally, be consistent and reliable and communicate clearly. As for selling yourself when you're more of a generalist, I wouldn't worry too much about this yet. The key will be when you're presented with a job opportunity that leans in one direction (e.g. 90% dev, 10% management), and you'll have to decide how far you're willing to bend to fit it. But right now you're just getting the word out. reply catigula 19 hours agoparentIt is truly an extravert's world. What you just described sounds like torture to me. reply bdndndndbve 17 hours agorootparentContracting as a solo dev is taking on sales and marketing as well as development. You have to charge accordingly. But you also have to be comfortable doing all of those roles, or else you won't have any work. reply ghaff 16 hours agorootparentYou seem to have a lot of people on forums like this who are just looking for some magical web form to fill out which will result in money flowing in after a couple of emails. Maybe that exists for some really transactional low-paid small tasks. But, as you say, it's not the reality for most opportunities. In \"semi-retirement\" (as I prefer to call it), I've contacted various people I know about random possibilities, that may or may not bring in any money, but it keeps doors open. If that's \"torture\" (per an upstream comment) I don't know what to say. reply cpfohl 17 hours agorootparentprevNetworking is not just for extroverts. One on one time with friends, and small group networking is still valuable networking. reply Suppafly 1 hour agorootparent> One on one time with friends, and small group networking is still valuable networking. Sure, but it isn't as likely to get you new opportunities in new fields the way being extroverted is. reply kmoser 14 hours agorootparentprevDoes sending emails to people in your network fall into the torture category as well? (Serious question, not judging.) Because if it is, I'm wondering what is the exact pain point: composing the email? Sending it and not feeling silly? Something else? reply deanmoriarty 13 hours agorootparentIn the vast majority of cases, when I left a job I was genuinely excited about never having to see or talk to any of my coworkers/managers for the rest of my life, so breaking such streak with an intentional outreach would qualify as lightweight torture to me. In a career of 15+ years I don’t think I have ever reached out to an ex coworker, not even once. My current company happens to be particularly “prestigious” at this point in time and I have received hundreds (yes, 100+) of LinkedIn messages from ex coworkers ranging from “meet and catch up” to “can you refer me there”. Some have gone as far as finding my phone number and texting me, after they didn’t receive a reply on LinkedIn. The nerve someone has after causing me so much pain and stress during code reviews or random acts of corporate backstabbing to ask for a referral years later. I ignored each and every one of them. I am not saying this is healthy at all and I well understand the problem is “me”, I would say I suffer from quite a bit of misanthropy against pretty much every coworker I ever had, and on top of that I am an extreme introvert, relationships forced upon me cause a lot of contempt. Fortunately I have a very small circle of people that I love (wife, blood family and a few good friends), so despite the misery of my comments I am not too unhappy when I’m not at work. To be clear, I am not the one looking for part-time gigs, I have decided that the solution to my struggles is to become financially independent via above-average frugality and diligent savings/investing, and then withdraw from the obligations of modern work. Technically I am already there, just trying to find the courage to quit my current (and last) job. reply sfn42 7 hours agorootparentYou think every single one of your coworkers \"cause you pain and stress during code reviews\"? Yeah man, the problem is 100% you. That's a crazy thing to say. Have you ever seen a therapist? And how in the world do you expect these people to just magically know that you're a weirdo? The nerve to reach out after having reviewed your code.. man I'm baffled. reply deanmoriarty 3 hours agorootparent> You think every single one of your coworkers \"cause you pain and stress during code reviews\"? Yes, I have a right to have an opinion on how other people’s behaviors make me feel, and so long as I’m still functional at work it’s not a problem (and I am, I always put up a good face and don’t cause any drama, I will refactor my perfectly working PR 1000 times to make all the nitpickers happy). Fortunately “being functional” doesn’t require to answer their referral or Zoom request years later, the hell with that, why would I want those people in my life again. I simply have no tolerance for most coworkers and managers, it is not that hard to believe and I know a lot of people who despise their coworkers, I am not a unicorn. My spouse is pretty much the same and has her own small solo business because she couldn’t stand the 9 to 5. My dad, a very wise man living in a different side of the world and the happiest person I know, decided in his 30s after a corporate stint that he couldn’t live his life being told what to do by managers and coworkers, and became entrepreneur. Clearly he had ups and downs, but he has always been very happy with the independence this choice afforded him. I earn 7 figures a year through my job in Silicon Valley and so I am putting up with this fundamental pain until I have enough to withdraw, which should be soon! reply sfn42 2 hours agorootparentSure you're allowed to feel that way, I just think it's ridiculous to phrase it the way you did above. I'm sure a lot of people have issues with some of their coworkers, but hating all of them across multiple jobs is insane. If you smell shit everywhere you go you probably need a shower. reply ldbooth 2 hours agorootparentprevDamn this is a bleak view of the world. > Yes, I have a right to have an opinion on how other people’s behaviors make me feel, how others act is outside your control. how you interpret and 'feel' is within your control, and quite empowering when you take the reins. > and so long as I’m still functional at work it’s not a problem But what about when you retire and carry this this forward, likely alone. Sounds like you have 'good' problems. Good luck to you. reply billy99k 17 hours agorootparentprevHow do you expect to be successful at anything without being somewhat social? reply hnthrowaway121 16 hours agorootparentThey might not. That’s why they’d describe it as “an extrovert’s world”. reply ghaff 16 hours agorootparentIt is at some level if you take definitions to extremes. If you actively avoid conversations and socializing with other people, you will probably suffer personally and professionally. Of course, that doesn't mean you always have to be the \"life of the party.\" reply SoftTalker 15 hours agorootparentI’m not sure if suffer is the right word. Some people prefer a quiet life and accept what comes with that, because that’s what they want. And that’s fine. Of course if you want to live a quiet life and avoid socializing very much, and want to be a successful independent contractor, those might be fairly incompatible goals. reply shadowerm 6 hours agorootparentThis all really has nothing to do with extroversion to me. We are talking about what is essentially sales and marketing skills. I am the life of the party but I would never try to freelance because I hate sales and marketing so much. This is all really asking how to start a business without having to do sales and marketing. Obviously, that is not going to work. One can either gain these skills or do something else. reply ghaff 3 hours agorootparentThere are some correlations. But I agree that you can be extroverted (whatever that means exactly) but most sales and marketing roles (which vary quite a bit) just don't appeal. reply SoftTalker 54 minutes agorootparentAll true but I think an introvert is going to have difficulty taking on a \"face of the company\" sales and marketing role. That just naturally requires a lot of extrovert personality traits. reply ghaff 39 minutes agorootparentCertainly. I have heard of a number of senior execs who really hated public speaking (even when they were very good at it given sufficient rehearsal). But I agree in general. If you have a public/customer-facing role you're going to find it exhausting and probably not going to be great at it if it is uncomfortable/unpleasant. I'm certainly not the classic stereotype of the outgoing sales rep (whether that's a fair stereotype or not) but that didn't keep me from attending a ton of conferences, customer meetings, and giving public presentations. reply hsuduebc2 15 hours agorootparentprevI personally don't have a problem with communication with people but honestly I cant really imagine let's say dev meetups or saturdays brunch with purpose of networking anything but somehow awkward experience. reply ghaff 3 hours agorootparentWell, \"networking events\" at least tend to be forced socialization of people basically looking for jobs as opposed to something more organic. Less true of meetups although they mostly never checked a lot of boxes for me either. reply space_oddity 11 hours agorootparentprevEven the most introverted among us benefit from some level of networking or relationship-building—it’s not about being extroverted, but about finding ways to connect that feel authentic to you reply dyauspitr 14 hours agorootparentprevWhich is what is the sad part. Seems like all forms of a living wage now involve working closely with people which wasn’t how the world was in the decades and centuries past. reply Beijinger 21 hours agoparentprevI am from a total different field but: I've gotten 99% of my contracts through word-of-mouth. Yes, no brainer. But how to get the first contract? I exploited myself, my client vastly underpaid but I had my first client. reply deaddodo 18 hours agorootparentNetworking, honestly. There is no \"go do this, go buy this, etc\" advice. You've never had a friend/colleague who needed contracting work done on their house? Or who was helping another friend develop a Wordpress site for their business? Or a person who knew a lawyer/doctor/plumber that could solve your problem? That's networking. You start doing work for people around you and/or at conventions/social events for networking and then start cultivating long term contacts that continue giving work or referring others. reply memjay 19 hours agoparentprevSoftware dev, curious about freelancing here. Just recently deleted my LinkedIn profile out of being disappointed with the value it brought to me over several years of using it. Instead, I now note down relevant contacts in a private “CRM”. Do you think it is important to have a public facing profile of yourself and your work history for attracting new clients or is a broad in person network more relevant? reply Bilal_io 18 hours agorootparentSome new people you meet will prefer to see who you are by looking you up online. At least to me, someone's online presence is a testimony that the person is who they claim to be when it comes to their experience. reply SoftTalker 15 hours agorootparentI’m the opposite, I think online profiles are completely untrustworthy and likely as not to be filled with exaggerations or outright lies. But I’m probably in the minority? reply kmoser 14 hours agorootparentprevThis shouldn't be an either/or thing. Any public facing profile, especially on a platform like LinkedIn which is large and has many eyes on it, is better than none if you're looking to get the word out. I've had a LinkedIn profile from nearly the beginning, and although I nearly never use it, I am occasionally contacted by people about work. If I spent even an iota of time filling out my profile and posting regularly, it would probably bring me many offers. (Whether they'd be what I'm looking for is another story.) If I had to choose between a public facing profile or a broad in person network, I'd choose the in person network. But you really shouldn't discount the online profile, since it's free advertising for you. reply itbeho 18 hours agorootparentprevI've been on Linkedin from the start and I don't think I've ever gotten work or meaningful benefit from it other than seeing what some acquaintances have been up to over the years and occasionally getting a message from an old friend reaching out to catch up personally. reply ghaff 16 hours agorootparentIt's a useful online Rolodex (to show my age). I've had a few recruiters reach out over the years but it's never been useful for that purpose beyond that. reply bilsbie 18 hours agoparentprev> Call or email people to see how they're doing. Even better, meet up with them for coffee or a meal I like this idea but it feels inauthentic. Can you share examples of how you broach this? reply hsuduebc2 15 hours agorootparentIt does radiate \"selling an insurance to old buddy\" vibe. reply invalidOrTaken 18 hours agorootparentprevThe key is to mean it. Then it's not inauthentic. reply aziaziazi 16 hours agorootparentI also find that proposition very inauthentic because the first reason for the approach is showing interest to your friend (how do they do?) but he second reason is literally (not judging) selfish (how can I get a new job?). Someone call you after 10 years to know how you do, precisely at the same time he look for a job… what a coincidence! He might genuinely care for me but the original reason of his call wasn’t that and he probably wouldn’t have call me if not. I would receive better an honest call: \"hey I know its been 10 years but I look for a job, any idea?” Some people around me find that way of communicating too direct and impolite. I find it genuine. But I’m probably the one that should be fixed, others seems to find relations easy and pleasant. reply cutemonster 10 hours agorootparentI agree with you :-) I like the \"Hey it's been 10 years and now ...\" approach. Nothing strange about that at all? It's just not possible to stay in active contact with everyone one has met in life and likes being with. (Well, of course it depends) reply kmoser 14 hours agorootparentprevLike I alluded to in my comment where I said it doesn't have to be mercenary: if you would otherwise have a reason to get together with somebody in person, make plans to do it. It can be one-on-one or with others, but the point is that the main reason for the meeting is social, i.e. you're doing exactly what you would have normally done. Then, during the customary \"what's new with you?\" part of the conversation you can let them know what type of work you do and that you're looking for. The main point is that you're actively seeking to get together with your friends, rather than waiting for them to call you. This is just keeping your network warm and planting seeds; you're not grilling them for job opportunities, and there is nothing inauthentic about it since it truly is a social call. Think of it as a slow burn, or the long game, or whatever metaphor works. When it comes to people you don't know well enough to ask to get together with in person, shoot them an email or text. There's nothing wrong with being up front with what you're looking for, e.g. \"Hey Joe, this is Mike (friend of your acquaintance Jane from Company XYZ), just letting you know I'm focusing on technical project management [or whatever] these days, wondering if you know of any part time opportunities in the field?\" Receiving this request from an acquaintance is light years more acceptable than receiving it from a total stranger. reply garrickvanburen 18 hours agorootparentprev“Hey it’s been forever, grab a coffee and share what we’re both working on and how we might help each other?” reply JoshTriplett 17 hours agorootparentThat doesn't come across as authentic, that comes across as transactional and having an agenda. \"Hey, it's been forever, want to catch up over some food?\" If you end up hearing about a useful opportunity, or providing them with a useful opportunity, great. But you still got to catch up with a friend, and came across as that being the primary goal. If you are looking for part-time work, it's fine to say that, and there's nothing wrong with reaching out to friends to find out if they know of good job opportunities. But \"share what we're both working on and how we might help each other?\". That comes across terribly. reply garrickvanburen 16 hours agorootparentIn my experience, it's a coin toss on whether having the last bit increases or decreases a chance of the appointment being made. Some people require it. Ultimately the only thing that matters is: you have a phrase that you can say comfortably and expresses genuine curiosity about the other person. reply shermantanktop 15 hours agorootparentprevAccepting this type of invite is how I got pitched Amway. Twice. The go-getter networking ethos of founders and small business owners can be hard to distinguish from the way MLMs find and prey on people. reply neilv 13 hours agorootparent> The go-getter networking ethos of founders and small business owners can be hard to distinguish from the way MLMs find and prey on people. Aren't all those the same thing? A different thing would be someone wanting to meet up only because they wanted to see you (not to nurture or harvest a resource). reply shermantanktop 3 hours agorootparentWith MLMs, the people doing the pitching know that it’s a bad deal, and they are trying to suck you in so that you will suffer and they will gain. It’s overt that the system can only work via deception, and the MLM is tuned to make that work at scale. reply space_oddity 12 hours agoparentprevThe point about being consistent, reliable and a clear communicator is what turns a one-time gig into repeat work. In my experience, many freelancers underestimate how much clients value those soft skills reply kevinsync 19 hours agoparentprevI'm a sucker for replying to any sort of \"how do I [career]\" HN posts if they're relevant to my own experience, just can't help myself. I also freelance exclusively, and opportunities come from word of mouth + the personal network that I've built over years of working with (or in) digital agencies. Full-timers jump from agency to agency at a fairly high clip and it's inevitable to run into people you've worked with before because they eventually need somebody and just think back to who they worked with in the past who they have fond memories of. Generalism isn't a hindrance IMO because the job itself, like it or not, is a service job. You're not there to learn on the job, be part of the family, or find growth opportunities / upward career tracks inside of the organization -- you're there to help solve immediate problems, augment staff, and by God get things done. The more you know, the better! The way project resourcing works internally in these places is, the wider the skillset, the easier it is to slot you into a particular project that needs extra attention. The engagements are also pretty low risk for the agency since whatever you charge, they just inflate your rate to make sure they make money and pass it on to the client (which almost always gets paid), deliverables get delivered, the client is happy, and life marches on -- and if you're ineffective, they can just let you go with no notice, no offboarding, no extra costs, etc. For me personally, that's a win-win. For a lot of people, it's too much stress / risk / uncertainty, but different strokes for different folks! Every now and then I'll get a gig or retainer that's more in line with \"we're a small, thriving business, we need expertise, we have some budget, but we've also had bad experiences with small-to-medium tech shops. Help!\" -- these are right in my wheelhouse because it's an easy retainer, quite low-risk for the client, and you can really make some meaningful impact on their bottom line as just one person. You become \"their guy\", and the relationships can last for years and years and years. Again, this is a service job, and generalism REALLY helps on these types of engagements -- to be clear, you're not being paid to R&D a product or do academic research on cutting-edge algorithms -- you're just helping a client or business navigate the often-murky waters of technology to help them win. It might not sound \"world-changing\" in the context of big tech, but it can be quite satisfying work that really means something significant to real people just trying their best to make their thing go. Anyways, to OP, good luck man! There's infinite opportunity out there if you've got the personality and the drive! reply leros 18 hours agorootparentThat sounds exactly like what I'm trying to do. I have no experience with the agency world and most of my contacts are in giant corporations. Do you think it would help to do some work in the agency world? reply kevinsync 18 hours agorootparentI guess it depends on what country you live in; I'm in the US, not sure what it's like elsewhere with regards to advertising, but if USA-based then yeah I would pursue that. Initially it'll probably be easier via a recruiter who already has a relationship with the agency where they bring you in and put you on the bench until a gig opens up. From what I've seen, brands (clients) rarely do much in-house -- they hire agencies (for periods of time, then will go to others depending upon results), sometimes hire as Agency of Record for a period of time as well (all creative, from web/app/digital through social management, media, print, etc, flows through their AOR) -- everything runs on quarterly client budgets (so frequent initiatives that \"ladder up\" to XYZ intangible \"KPI\" -- you'll get used to the arbitrary and capricious lingo) -- and it's really not that far off from a modern version of Mad Men. \"Agency life\" is another phrase that encapsulates \"we probably have time management issues and/or over-commit to stuff, so if you want to succeed in this business, be willing to be patient, present and available for the duration and parameters of the project\" -- as a freelancer though, you get paid by the hour, rather than being a salaryman. I did 15 years of full-time employment, salaried. Overtime === a slice of pizza, a pat on the back, a vague promise of promotion; as a freelancer, it's dollars-per-hour, nothing more nothing less, you get paid for your efforts. I've only been fortunate enough to benefit from that having done full-time salaryman in these places long enough to meet enough people and make enough contributions to become a known quantity. That said, I do have friends though that were ONLY contractors the entire time, usually via a recruiter as mentioned above, they worked in the same places on the same projects, and they've been able to flip that into similar situations or even full-time with the companies they gelled with the most. There are a bunch of ways to approach it, but the fluid, always-changing clientele of ad agencies provides quite a lot of opportunities for work that isn't just \"employee\". reply garrickvanburen 18 hours agoparentprevThis is the answer reply dyauspitr 14 hours agoparentprevHorrible.

But we're doing everything we can to accelerate this. We have about 5 new jobs launching tomorrow. reply codingdave 20 hours agorootparentThrough some work I've done the last couple years, I've been exposed to a couple consultants who specialize in using fractional work within organizations. Between them, their clients, and others I've known who have gone that direction, I think I see a flaw here -- such jobs exist, but are rarely posted on the web. \"Fractional\" is a term that is often focused on leadership roles more than part time IC gigs. You will find such roles when talking to C-level leaders at organizations who are having growing pains - maybe their IC hiring is outpacing the director-level hiring, maybe they grew too fast to fully develop all the skills needed. Either way, the exec team is overwhelmed. They know they need more leadership, but don't want to build out a large middle management layer. So they are looking for solutions to a problem. Because of that, if you are trying to accelerate, stop scouring the web. Scouring the web just puts you in a reactive position, acting as a recruiter and hoping the people you find happen to match the posting. Instead, get talking directly to C-level execs and board members at small/medium-sized growing companies, and be the consultant guiding them to decide whether they need to hire, or if contracting a fractional leader into their org is a better solution. Let your postings be the results of those conversations, and keep getting to know people who are looking for fractional work. Tie those two together, and you'll see acceleration. reply djaouen 22 hours agoparentprevNone of these have worked for me lol reply tbird24 22 hours agorootparentWhat kind of role are you looking for?

Even full time jobs are this hard to get RN! reply Aurornis 22 hours agoprev> Ideally, I would get 10-15/hr a week retainers, but project-based work is ok too. The key is that I can keep getting the work with consistency. Work like this is more commonly described as freelance, consulting, or contracting. If a job is advertised as \"part-time\" they're usually expecting you to work every single one of those hours, unlike a retainer where you're expected to be available for up to that many hours. It may sound pedantic but it's important to understand the difference when searching for roles. If you take a \"part-time\" job they're generally going to want you to be working for every one of those hours, even if you have to find your own work to do. If you treat it like a retainer job where you're only expected to be on-call if they need you, you could run into some disappointment. Using the right terms will also help you find roles that more correctly match your expectations. True part-time work is hard to find because most companies would rather hire someone to work 4 x 40 hour weeks on a project instead over the part timer who wants to do it in 8 x 20 hour weeks or 16 x 10 hour weeks. This leaves work that is sporadic and spread out, or companies that have a need but can't fit full-time compensation into the budget right now. That's a hint for the type of work and companies you'll need to seek out. Trying to pitch yourself as a valuable contractor who needs 3-4X longer to finish a project due to your short workweek isn't a winning strategy for most jobs. reply singron 13 hours agoparentPart time makes sense for a company if it's a specialized role that they can't saturate with 40 hours of work per week but still need on an ongoing basis. E.g. * Remote hands for 10s of racks at a datacenter * SOC2/auditing paperwork * Customer service * DBA * Accounting, HR, and other backoffice For most other roles (e.g. developing product software), the company would rather onboard the minimal number of people to finish quickly, so they will want full-time. It's pretty rare that a company needs part-time work for a fixed-length project, but it's sometimes useful if it's a small part of a larger project. E.g. a designer could be part time on a typical web-dev project once implementation starts. A really good tester would be awesome to hire for 1 hour per day, but it seems like that part of the industry is unfortunately a race to the bottom, so it's probably hard for talented people to get paid what they are worth. reply foobar1962 17 hours agoparentprev> True part-time work is hard to find because most companies would rather hire someone to work 4 x 40 hour weeks on a project instead over the part timer who wants to do it in 8 x 20 hour weeks or 16 x 10 hour weeks. My last two contract jobs have been old customers - more than 5 years ago - with whom I left on good terms and who reached out for more work. Secondly, I've started \"team\" working with a colleague so I can apply for 40 hour per week jobs and only have to put in 20 hours per week myself. The clients were unsure about it at first but soon realised they are actually getting two full-timers for the price of one, particularly when something goes wrong or something needs to be delivered asap. With my colleague, I charge a 10% admin fee because I'm the one invoicing the client and I pay the colleague immediately each week whether or not the client pays me. My colleague has reciprocated and I've done work for them (and paid their 10% admin fee). reply danenania 22 hours agoparentprevI think it depends a lot on supply and demand dynamics for the specific role. If the company is having a hard time finding someone qualified and they see you as a good fit, they definitely might prefer to get someone working part time immediately compared to waiting who knows how long for another good candidate. This especially applies to startups under time pressure. And then once you get in the door and show you’re a net positive, why not keep you? 15 hours per week of net positive is better than 0, even if they’d really prefer 40+. reply Aurornis 21 hours agorootparentI've been on the managing side of part-time employees. We did part time when people were going back for advanced degrees or had other short-term needs away from work, but still wanted to keep their jobs. Unfortunately it's really hard to have one person working 10-15 hours per week while everyone else is working 40. You encounter a lot of situations where teams are delaying meetings until the part-time person is available. You have to catch the part-time person up on things that have changed while they were away. If the part-time person doesn't finish an important task before their 10-15 hours is up, someone else might have to take it and restart the task to remove it as a blocker. It only really works when the part-time person's project is really independent and not time sensitive. Anything that interacts with the rest of the team or the rest of the company comes with additional overhead that might come close to cancelling out the productivity of having one person working 10 hours per week. There's a lot of wishful thinking about part time work where all hours worked contribute equally to the project, but in the real world having 4 full-time employees and 1 part-time person working 10 hours on a project is basically the same as having just 4 full-time employees working on the same thing. Having only 4 full-time employees might even be more efficient due to the lower communication overhead. So that leaves independent projects and work that isn't time sensitive. reply danenania 21 hours agorootparentYeah, these are definitely valid points. But is it so bad that you don’t hire someone great who comes along and only wants part time when you’ve got no other decent candidates in the pipeline? The challenges you mention are real, but many companies will still be tempted even if they have to make an effort to carve out specific tasks that are a good fit. reply Aurornis 15 hours agorootparent> But is it so bad that you don’t hire someone great who comes along and only wants part time when you’ve got no other decent candidates in the pipeline? Sorry to tell you this, but this is correct. If I hire someone part-time while I search for another person then I have to fire the part-time person when I find a full-time person. Then I have to do all the work of on-boarding two people, the work of transitioning work from one person to another and the struggle of turning the position over. If I have the part-time person onboard for 4 months and they're working 10 hours per week, I'm only getting the equivalent of maybe 1 month of extra productivity. That 1 month of productivity is probably offset by all of the overhead and transition time. I know it's not what you wanted to hear, but it's how things go. If someone is only available part-time, we reserve isolated project-level work for them on an as-needed basis. Hiring someone to be part-time for a temporary time is so much overhead and work for someone who's barely working 1-2 days per week. reply ethernot 23 hours agoprev1. Networking and keeping contacts. Not LinkedIn which I have found to be completely useless and full of lunatics and weirdos. Good old fashioned email and exchanging details when you work with other people. Check in with people occasionally to remind them you still exist. I have to turn work away. 2. Mostly bullshitting people then winging it. reply esperent 18 hours agoparentOn the contrary, I get a decent chunk of my work through LinkedIn. I only get a few messages a month, most from recruiters, but occasionally there's decent work in there too.

I think there's a bit of give-and-take there.

For the latter two, I try to focus on quality over quantity. The handful of people who know me well, tend put me in touch with better matching gigs than the large group of superficial contacts.

Using copywriting techniques can make one seem fake if you don't know what you're doing. reply hakanderyal 22 hours agoprevIf you are asking this question, probably the best answer for you is old fashioned sales/marketing. Relatively high paying jobs usually fulfilled via network, which happens the way you described (\"land in my lap\"). You need to do marketing activities to extend your network, so more work lands in your lap. In person works best if where you live has opportunities for this. Try chamber of commerce if there is one. They usually have lots of events for local business owners where you can meet with many potential customers. Try cold emailing otherwise, it has the best ROI when done right. Bonus points: This skills will be needed to get the project you are working on off the ground too. reply svilen_dobrev 4 hours agoprevmmh, i see here some new \"term\", or new meaning of old term.. that might be useful.. that fractional thing. You know, being a generalist, and helping some company, means you are 5/8 of something, 1/3 of another, 1/7 of yet another, and 3/10 of... And These don't have to sum up to 1.0, they are in different dimensions. It's like wearing-many-hats at same time (i think this was the wording so far), but this way may be better. As you may be at 100% a CTO today but not being the best-specialized-CTO-ever, and 30% tester tomorrow (this time being the best possible tester), and a little bit of architect in the meantime, and code something to try it out, and/or fix a dreaded bug, etc.. And this fractional essence somehow aligns with my idea from few years ago that software-making as profession is being commoditized. Pick-n-match whatever is on display?. Interesting what will come after that. But i have been staying away from the corporate highways / market-squares ... and as marketing/sales isn't my thing.. even if it is about selling meself. Networking? hmm. not really working. 4 months already. ah anyway. Have fun. reply 4m1rk 19 hours agoprevI've always been craving freelance/part-time/project-based gigs so that I could live with the dream of building my side projects into a real business. Back in my home country, I built a good network of clients/co-workers and it was working relatively well until we relocated to another country and the work visa forced me to become full-time. After a few years, about 2 years ago I was free, so I started from scratch, now in a different country. It didn't take me too long to find out the rules are the same everywhere. Now, I'm marketing myself as a Fractional Head of Engineering for small teams[1]. This is a kind of generalist hands-on role and a good position for small businesses, but it won't work for large organizations which usually have better budgets. Regarding finding gigs, as everyone mentioned, networking is the best though it takes huge effort and time IMO. But it's 100x more efficient than applying in generic job boards or freelance marketplaces (which are the worst in my experience). However, some specialized boards have worked well for me. Like HN whoishiring posts for freelancers[2]. I actually built a super simple tool[3] to hunt part-time/freelance/contract jobs from HN. I found one good client using it within two months. BTW, Though it's rare, I ended up finding another fractional gig by advertising myself in the same HN whoishiring thread.

Some will be annoyed, but you’ll avoid getting filtered out before meeting an actual decision maker who can make an exception for you if they like you. reply JeremyBarbosa 21 hours agoparentprevMy solution for this was switching careers. I found that anyone hiring engineers wanted someone doing 40 hours a week at least, which makes sense since you have to have such a large mental model to build a system. Content and copy writing on the other hand is much more flexible because the unit of work is so much smaller. Any content marketing manager would love a real engineer to write for their blog once a week and help sell their product. Then just stack up different clients until you reach whatever weekly load you are comfortable with. reply em-bee 22 hours agoparentprevi pretty much gave up looking for part time roles. i apply for full time roles and hope i can talk them into reducing my hours later. in germany, by law after i think 6 months you have a legal right to reduce your hours to part-time unless it is a small company and they can show that reducing your hours would cause serious difficulties for the company. reply lobsterthief 22 hours agoparentprevI’ve found it’s best to squeeze them in the morning, before you’re tired from daily work ;) But I understand not everybody can function well that early reply em-bee 21 hours agorootparentwhen i was in highschool, i used to get up at 5am to do my homework. it was quiet (and i was sharing my room with my brothers) and i was awake. best time of day to get work done. i think when applying that to your side project, it has the added benefit that you start into the day doing something worthwhile which can be encouraging (no matter how bad it gets at work, i already did something useful today) reply senorrib 19 hours agorootparentI began doing that much later in my life, but totally worth it. reply rossdavidh 22 hours agoprev1) It will probably not be \"consistent\", so you need to ask for more pay than you require, so you can last through the droughts. 2) Your best opportunities are places you've already worked, because they know you and you know at least some of their infrastructure, code base, etc. 3) Very small companies are more likely to need a generalist, and be unable to pay for a full-time on-staff person.

The key is to have regular but not annoying conversations with prospects. Don't put them on a mailing list (unless you're somehow uniquely interesting and cool, I guess) but send them personalized emails every so once in a while - these can be \"oh I thought you'd find this interesting\" (and it has to actually be interesting to them) or just a short hello reminding them that you're always looking for work. And I mean SHORT. \"Hey just checking in, really enjoyed working with you, please keep me in mind if you're looking for help!\" I've tried it all, from personal CRMs to complex alerting and the bottom line is that nobody's going to do the extra work to get you involved unless they have a no-pressure, friendly connection with you.

The user interface for sending the Action command with parameters is shown as a Text entity. Method: Settings > Devices & services > Configured > Xiaomi Home > CONFIGURE > Debug mode for action Security Xiaomi Home Integration and the affiliated cloud interface is provided by Xiaomi officially. You need to use your Xiaomi account to login to get your device list. Xiaomi Home Integration implements OAuth 2.0 login process, which does not keep your account password in the Home Assistant application. However, due to the limitation of the Home Assistant platform, the user information (including device information, certificates, tokens, etc.) of your Xiaomi account will be saved in the Home Assistant configuration file in clear text after successful login. You need to ensure that your Home Assistant configuration file is properly stored. The exposure of your configuration file may result in others logging in with your identity. FAQ Does Xiaomi Home Integration support all Xiaomi Home devices? Xiaomi Home Integration currently supports most categories of Home device. Only a few categories are not supported. They are Bluetooth device, infrared device and virtual device. Does Xiaomi Home Integration support multiple Xiaomi accounts? Yes, it supports multiple Xiaomi accounts. Furthermore, Xiaomi Home Integration allows that devices belonging to different accounts can be added to a same area. Does Xiaomi Home Integration support local control? Local control is implemented by Xiaomi Central Hub Gateway (firmware version 3.4.0_0000 above) or Xiaomi home devices with built-in central hub gateway (software version 0.8.0 above) inside. If you do not have a Xiaomi central hub gateway or other devices having central hub gateway function, all control commands are sent through Xiaomi Cloud. The firmware for Xiaomi central hub gateway including the built-in central hub gateway supporting Home Assistant local control feature has not been released yet. Please refer to MIoT team's notification for upgrade plans. Xiaomi central hub gateway is only available in mainland China. In other regions, it is not available. Xiaomi Home Integration can also implement partial local control by enabling Xiaomi LAN control function. Xiaomi LAN control function can only control IP devices (devices connected to the router via WiFi or ethernet cable) in the same local area network as Home Assistant. It cannot control BLE Mesh, ZigBee, etc. devices. This function may cause some abnormalities. We recommend not to use this function. Xiaomi LAN control function is enabled by Settings > Devices & services > Configured > Xiaomi Home > CONFIGURE > Update LAN control configuration Xiaomi LAN control function is not restricted by region. It is available in all regions. However, if there is a central gateway in the local area network where Home Assistant is located, even Xiaomi LAN control function is enabled in the integration, it will not take effect. In which regions is Xiaomi Home Integration available? Xiaomi Home Integration can be used in the mainland of China, Europe, India, Russia, Singapore, and USA. As user data in Xiaomi Cloud of different regions is isolated, you need to choose your region when importing MIoT devices in the configuration process. Xiaomi Home Integration allows you to import devices of different regions to a same area. Principle of Messaging Control through the Cloud Image 1: Cloud control architecture Xiaomi Home Integration subscribes to the interested device messages on the MQTT Broker in MIoT Cloud. When a device property changes or a device event occurs, the device sends an upstream message to MIoT Cloud, and the MQTT Broker pushes the subscribed device message to Xiaomi Home Integration. Because Xiaomi Home Integration does not need to poll to obtain the current device property value in the cloud, it can immediately receive the notification message when the properties change or the events occur. Thanks to the message subscription mechanism, Xiaomi Home Integration only queries the properties of all devices from the cloud once when the integration configuration is completed, which puts little access pressure on the cloud. Xiaomi Home Integration sends command messages to the devices via the HTTP interface of MIoT Cloud to control devices. The device reacts and responds after receiving the downstream message sent forward by MIoT Cloud. Control locally Image 2: Local control architecture Xiaomi central hub gateway contains a standard MQTT Broker, which implements a complete subscribe-publish mechanism. Xiaomi Home Integration subscribes to the interested device messages through Xiaomi central hub gateway. When a device property changes or a device event occurs, the device sends an upstream message to Xiaomi central hub gateway, and the MQTT Broker pushes the subscribed device message to Xiaomi Home Integration. When Xiaomi Home Integration needs to control a device, it publishes a device command message to the MQTT Broker, which is then forwarded to the device by Xiaomi central hub gateway. The device reacts and responds after receiving the downstream message from the gateway. Mapping Relationship between MIoT-Spec-V2 and Home Assistant Entity MIoT-Spec-V2 is the abbreviation for MIoT Specification Version 2, which is an IoT protocol formulated by Xiaomi IoT platform to give a standard functional description of IoT devices. It includes function definition (referred to as data model by other IoT platforms), interaction model, message format, and encoding. In MIoT-Spec-V2 protocol, a product is defined as a device. A device contains several services. A service may have some properties, events and actions. Xiaomi Home Integration creates Home Assistant entities according to MIoT-Spec-V2. The conversion relationship is as follows. General Conversion Property format access value-list value-range Entity in Home Assistant writable string - - Text writable bool - - Switch writable not string & not bool existent - Select writable not string & not bool non-existent existent Number not writable - - - Sensor Event MIoT-Spec-V2 event is transformed to Event entity in Home Assistant. The event's parameters are also passed to entity's _trigger_event. Action in Entity in Home Assistant empty Button not empty Notify If the debug mode for action is activated, the Text entity will be created when the \"in\" field in the action spec is not empty. The \"Attribute\" item in the entity details page displays the format of the input parameter which is an ordered list, enclosed in square brackets []. The string elements in the list are enclosed in double quotation marks \"\". For example, the \"Attributes\" item in the details page of the Notify entity converted by the \"Intelligent Speaker Execute Text Directive\" action of xiaomi.wifispeaker.s12 siid=5, aiid=5 instance shows the action params as [Text Content(str), Silent Execution(bool)]. A properly formatted input is [\"Hello\", true]. Specific Conversion MIoT-Spec-V2 uses URN for defining types. The format is urn::::[::], in which name is a human-readable word or phrase describing the instance of device, service, property, event and action. Xiaomi Home Integration first determines whether to convert the MIoT-Spec-V2 instance into a specific Home Assistant entity based on the instance's name. For the instance that does not meet the specific conversion rules, general conversion rules are used for conversion. namespace is the namespace of MIoT-Spec-V2 instance. When its value is miot-spec-v2, it means that the specification is defined by Xiaomi. When its value is bluetooth-spec, it means that the specification is defined by Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG). When its value is not miot-spec-v2 or bluetooth-spec, it means that the specification is defined by other vendors. If MIoT-Spec-V2 namespace is not miot-spec-v2, a star mark * is added in front of the entity's name . Device The conversion follows SPEC_DEVICE_TRANS_MAP. { '':{ 'required':{ '':{ 'required':{ 'properties': { '': set }, 'events': set, 'actions': set }, 'optional':{ 'properties': set, 'events': set, 'actions': set } } }, 'optional':{ '':{ 'required':{ 'properties': { '': set }, 'events': set, 'actions': set }, 'optional':{ 'properties': set, 'events': set, 'actions': set } } }, 'entity': str } } The \"required\" field under \"device instance name\" indicates the required services of the device. The \"optional\" field under \"device instance name\" indicates the optional services of the device. The \"entity\" field indicates the Home Assistant entity to be created. The \"required\" and the \"optional\" field under \"service instance name\" are required and optional properties, events and actions of the service respectively. The value of \"property instance name\" under \"required\" \"properties\" field is the access mode of the property. The condition for a successful match is that the value of \"property instance name\" is a subset of the access mode of the corresponding MIoT-Spec-V2 property instance. Home Assistant entity will not be created if MIoT-Spec-V2 device instance does not contain all required services, properties, events or actions. Service The conversion follows SPEC_SERVICE_TRANS_MAP. { '':{ 'required':{ 'properties': { '': set }, 'events': set, 'actions': set }, 'optional':{ 'properties': set, 'events': set, 'actions': set }, 'entity': str } } The \"required\" field under \"service instance name\" indicates the required properties, events and actions of the service. The \"optional\" field indicates the optional properties, events and actions of the service. The \"entity\" field indicates the Home Assistant entity to be created. The value of \"property instance name\" under \"required\" \"properties\" field is the access mode of the property. The condition for a successful match is that the value of \"property instance name\" is a subset of the access mode of the corresponding MIoT-Spec-V2 property instance. Home Assistant entity will not be created if MIoT-Spec-V2 service instance does not contain all required properties, events or actions. Property The conversion follows SPEC_PROP_TRANS_MAP. { 'entities':{ '':{ 'format': set, 'access': set } }, 'properties': { '':{ 'device_class': str, 'entity': str } } } The \"format\" field under \"entity name\" represents the data format of the property, and matching with one value indicates a successful match. The \"access\" field under \"entity name\" represents the access mode of the property, and matching with all values is considered a successful match. The \"entity\" field under \"property instance name\", of which value is one of entity name under \"entities\" field, indicates the Home Assistant entity to be created. The \"device_class\" field under \"property instance name\" indicates the Home Assistant entity's _attr_device_class. Event The conversion follows SPEC_EVENT_TRANS_MAP. { '': str } The value of the event instance name indicates _attr_device_class of the Home Assistant entity to be created. MIoT-Spec-V2 Filter spec_filter.json is used to filter out the MIoT-Spec-V2 instance that will not be converted to Home Assistant entity. The format of spec_filter.json is as follows. { \"\":{ \"services\": list, \"properties\": list, \"events\": list, \"actions\": list, } } The key of spec_filter.json dictionary is the urn excluding the \"version\" field of the MIoT-Spec-V2 device instance. The firmware of different versions of the same product may be associated with the MIoT-Spec-V2 device instances of different versions. It is required that the MIoT-Spec-V2 instance of a higher version must contain all MIoT-Spec-V2 instances of the lower versions when a vendor defines the MIoT-Spec-V2 of its product on MIoT platform. Thus, the key of spec_filter.json does not need to specify the version number of MIoT-Spec-V2 device instance. The value of \"services\", \"properties\", \"events\" or \"actions\" fields under \"device instance\" is the instance id (iid) of the service, property, event or action that will be ignored in the conversion process. Wildcard matching is supported. Example: { \"urn:miot-spec-v2:device:television:0000A010:xiaomi-rmi1\":{ \"services\": [\"*\"] # Filter out all services. It is equivalent to completely ignoring the device with such MIoT-Spec-V2 device instance. }, \"urn:miot-spec-v2:device:gateway:0000A019:xiaomi-hub1\": { \"services\": [\"3\"], # Filter out the service whose iid=3. \"properties\": [\"4.*\"] # Filter out all properties in the service whose iid=4. \"events\": [\"4.1\"], # Filter out the iid=1 event in the iid=4 service. \"actions\": [\"4.1\"] # Filter out the iid=1 action in the iid=4 service. } } Device information service (urn:miot-spec-v2:service:device-information:00007801) of all devices will never be converted to Home Assistant entity. Multiple Language Support There are 8 languages available for selection in the config flow language option of Xiaomi Home, including Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, English, Spanish, Russian, French, German, and Japanese. The config flow page in Simplified Chinese and English has been manually reviewed by the developer. Other languages are translated by machine translation. If you want to modify the words and sentences in the config flow page, you need to modify the json file of the certain language in custom_components/xiaomi_home/translations/ directory. When displaying Home Assistant entity name, Xiaomi Home downloads the multiple language file configured by the device vendor from MIoT Cloud, which contains translations for MIoT-Spec-V2 instances of the device. multi_lang.json is a locally maintained multiple language dictionary, which has a higher priority than the multiple language file obtained from the cloud and can be used to supplement or modify the multiple language translation of devices. The format of multi_lang.json is as follows. { \"\": { \"\": { \"\":} } } The key of multi_lang.json dictionary is the urn excluding the \"version\" field of the MIoT-Spec-V2 device instance. The language code is zh-Hans, zh-Hant, en, es, ru, fr, de, or ja, corresponding to the 8 selectable languages mentioned above. The instance code is the code of the MIoT-Spec-V2 instance, which is in the format of: service: # service service::property: # property service::property::valuelist: # the value in value-list of a property service::event: # event service::action: # action siid, piid, eiid, aiid and value are all decimal three-digit integers. Example: { \"urn:miot-spec-v2:device:health-pot:0000A051:chunmi-a1\": { \"zh-Hant\": { \"service:002\": \"養生壺\", \"service:002:property:001\": \"工作狀態\", \"service:002:property:001:valuelist:000\": \"待機中\", \"service:002:action:002\": \"停止烹飪\", \"service:005:event:001\": \"烹飪完成\" } } } If you edit specv2entity.py, spec_filter.json or multi_lang.json in the custom_components/xiaomi_home/miot/specs directory in your Home Assistant, you need to update the entity conversion rule in the integration's CONFIGURE page to take effect.

Device can be fully setup without internet, and used without internet Personally I aim to be fully within 3 as much as I can, but some devices are really hard to find at a good price point that falls into 3. All my HA devices are within 3, except some real-time cameras which I couldn't find below ~300 EUR if I wanted them in 3, so those are within group 2 and now isolated after the setup. reply mrandish 2 minutes agorootparentI like the taxonomy you've outlined. It would be great if the Home Assistant org were to formalize something like it into levels with logos manufacturers could use in ads and packaging. It would help clarify products for users and, most importantly, provide an incentive for manufacturers toward more local-first interop. It might be good to invert the order above and name the levels with something like Platinum, Gold, Silver to clearly signal better and best. Manufacturer's marketing people love having external compliance logos, especially manufacturers of commodity hardware. reply dietr1ch 1 hour agorootparentprevI'm not buying any device that's not 3, everything else turns into a brick as soon as there's some larger change.

At AirGradient, all our air quality monitors can completely run local. Our official firmware is on GitHub and people could even flash their own (adjusted) version. We believe this is how IoT devices should be and are very vocal about it. So I think there are a few manufacturers that think different. reply alamortsubite 43 minutes agorootparentprevYou're giving them the benefit of the doubt here. In my experience, not only are they greedy, but they're also inept and lazy. reply asveikau 2 hours agoparentprevThis is how a lot of home assistant integrations work. Sure, many HA users (self included) try to avoid dependence on cloud services and opt for local only solutions, such as zwave or ZigBee or products that work with local-only wifi. But the nature of the beast is that some devices out there are built to talk only to a cloud service. Having a company start an upstream project is probably a better sign than not having that, however sure, they could pull the plug on their access to cloud service, people may have privacy and security concerns, etc. reply pkulak 1 hour agorootparent> This is how a lot of home assistant integrations work.

Once they turn them into true IoT shits, then I'll be worried. reply reaperducer 1 hour agorootparentprevthey could pull the plug on their access to cloud service It's happened to me twice. The first time was about seven years ago, when Fiet Electric sent out a software update that deliberately bricked all of its home hubs, and consequentially turned all of the connected smart light bulbs into dumb light bulbs. Speculation on IoT forums at the time was that Fiet failed to properly license some piece of code that was critical to its system; but that was all speculation. I seem to recall that Fiet put out an e-mail long after the fact letting people know they could no longer use their \"smart\" devices. The second time was earlier this year, when Sylvania ended its cloud service, and turned its smart bulbs into merely clever bulbs. They'll still work with the stand-alone Sylvania app, but new bulbs can no longer be added to Apple HomeKit setups. So you need to use two apps (Home and Sylvania) to control the devices in your home. That is, until the Sylvania app is no longer available in the App Store, or compatible with modern devices. Avoiding Fiet Electric products was easy. But I thought I'd be safe with a big name like Sylvania. The \"L\" in IoT stands for \"Longevity.\" reply danieldk 1 hour agorootparentI completely agree with the grandparent. This is all avoided by using Zigbee or Z-Wave devices. All our smart lights are Hue. If they decide to stop supporting it, they can be controlled with the Samsung/Aeotec SmartThings Hub, Home Assistant, Zigbee2MQTT, or whatever you please. Similarly, our smart plugs are also Zigbee and we use a couple of Aeotec Z-Wave temperature/humidity sensors. Best of all, less worries about yet another IoT device with probably vulnerable software that we have to put on a VLAN/IoT WiFi network. Zigbee and Z-Wave are also much simpler than WiFi/Bluetooth, so less likely that they are a swiss cheese of vulnerabilities. reply holoduke 1 hour agorootparentWith hue there is still potential risk of a lockin with their hue app. They allow it still, because their sales are not really good. But otherwise they might have restricted it. reply X-Istence 19 minutes agorootparentHue bulbs currently are stock standard Zigbee compatible light bulbs. You can pay them into ZHA/Z2M without any issues and control them without any Hue hub or app. If Hue were to suddenly switch to something proprietary their existing bulbs will all continue to function without their app or hub. reply yurishimo 41 minutes agorootparentprevHue Bulbs use Zigbee. If hue stops supporting the hub or older devices, you can reset and pair them to anything. The Hue bridge is IP based but can be controlled entirely over your local network. It’s a slim possibility of something breaking (the mobile app mostly) and then the bulbs are still fine. reply duckworth 17 minutes agorootparentYeah, I ditched the Hue Hub last year and paired them all directly with Home Assistant via Zigbee reply nemomarx 1 hour agorootparentprevwhat's the state of bulbs that don't use apps?

A lot of Ikea devices also use Zigbee, though it sometimes takes a while before they are supported properly by SmartThings, Home Assistant, etc. reply iamjackg 2 hours agoparentprev\"Integration\" is just the term the HA project uses for code supporting a specific device/brand/platform. Home Assistant shows a label on each integration clarifying whether it's entirely local or cloud-based. reply carlgreene 2 hours agoprevHome Assistant is one of the best open source projects I've come across. I've been using it for 5+ years on an older RPi and it's been pretty rock solid. Countless updates and everything just keeps on chugging. I've landed on a mixture of MQTT and Zigbee communicating devices, the latter being much easier to set up and maintain. There's an integration for just about everything I've wanted, some better than others, but all in all just a great project. reply diggan 2 hours agoparent> I've landed on a mixture of MQTT and Zigbee communicating devices Almost everything I use is ZigBee, but at first, I used the built-in Zigbee support for it, not realizing what I was missing out on. After a move, I setup everything again, but this time via ZigBee2MQTT instead and the compatibility is miles ahead of the built-in integration. Just a word of advice to others who are using the built-in integration atm, not realizing the big difference between the two :) reply cassianoleal 1 hour agorootparentI experimented a bit with ZHA (native Zigbee integration) but soon realised I needed something better, and Z2M was that something. It had all been working wonderfully, until I had a problem recently that meant I had to redo the entire Zigbee setup. I run HAOS on a VM, with the Zigbee radio being passed through from the host. Recently I wanted to play with Thread so I added a radio and passed it through to the VM as well. All was fine, though I wasn't having a lot of time to experiment and the Thread dongle was connected in an awkward position so I decided to yank it out. At this point all hell broke lose. Z2M wouldn't start, throwing cryptic error messages. After a lot of trial and error, I removed both USB passthroughs, rebooted the VM, shut it down again, re-plugged the Zigbee dongle and re-added the passthrough. At this point the hardware side of things was fine but my Zigbee network was gone. To make it worse, a new one couldn't be initialised because it was trying to use the same ID as the previous one. I had to manually change the ID in the config YAML, restart everything, then re-pair all devices. I really feel like this stuff should be more resilient to failures. Otherwise, it's pretty good! reply 3abiton 1 hour agorootparentprevI second Zigbee2mqtt. Koen's work is legedenary, I also been fascinated by Zigbee and been using ever since.

ZHA works just fine for me? reply qwertox 1 hour agoparentprevI've been rolling my own stuff, mostly devices posting to custom python servers, storing data into influxdb and mongodb, triggering other servers on events, and lately also integrating Tasmota devices via MQTT, like the microwave, washing machine, computer monitors, small heating fans and the like. I migrated all Hue devices to zigbee2mqtt and am happy with the flexibility. Initially (7 years ago?) I refused to use HA because I've all too often had the issue that then projects become stale and I need to migrate to something else. But lately I've gotten the feeling that HA is really here to stay, with a community big enough for this project not to die and maintaining very good hardware support. What I'm missing out on is an (Android) app, and I think that this would be a good reason to think about moving over to HA. reply cassianoleal 1 hour agorootparentI think the launch of Open Home Foundation [0] is a very good sign for the future of Home Assistant.

Yes, there is a little bit of a curve with rewiring your opener, but there is great documentation available, and safety in the fact that if you mess up, your door just won't open. If you snap a picture ahead of time, it's easy to undo. And from there, you can hook it in to Home Assistant or HomeKit and do whatever you want, which is amazing.

Why aren't these just bluetooth and or wifi so my car and open when I pull up and close when I leave? Hell, if they just added an 'open if closed' and 'close if open' it would make it way better for the car to controll. IMO they are purposely making the non myQ options suck and stuck in the 80s just so they can upsell to a monthly subscription. 2. Their security is a joke. After moving to new phone their app would refuse to login yet would still show me notifications for door events. The only way to stop the notifications was to uninstall the app. My newer garage door is lacking wifi just so I can add my own automation without even bothering with theirs. reply danieldk 1 hour agoparentprevFor example Philips Hue is overpriced, I wouldn't call them overpriced (at least not all products), their quality is typically great, you get what you pay for.

Jackshafts are predominantly LiftMaster and Chamberlain => the smarts are myQ, which I don't want anywhere near my network. Genie jackshafts seem fine, but Genie's reputation is bad to the point where garage door companies may refuse to work on them. These motors also usually come with the ability to hook up a hardwired button. There are a couple of pre-made (konnected, ratgo) solutions or one could jury rig a z-wave relay. Alternative is Overhead Garage door company that have separate SKUs for the unit, the battery and the smarts so one can pick two and use the same relay (my current plan). There may be _some_ proprietary shenanigans with LM and Chamberlain hardwired buttons but Overhead's one really seems to just work through bridging two contacts reply asveikau 2 hours agorootparentNot sure how it works with a jackshaft vs. the more traditional residential opener, but ratgdo can speak the myQ protocol and control it from mqtt or home assistant.

Long-term changes are inevitable (company goes out of business, randomly changes API, etc.) * I fundamentally do not like Amazon Key integration. It gives someone else control over my security hardware which makes me very uncomfortable. I am not sure if it's opt-in or out, but the point is that a myQ device that is installed _can_ be configured to let arbitrary third party to open the door. If I have a choice, I'd rather set up a system that I control from the get-go rather than try to lobotomize a system that I can't fully control. reply asveikau 51 minutes agorootparentRatgdo doesn't go through the cloud.

Once I feel I’m reaching diminishing returns territory, I stop. Only use HA if I need to mix different vendors (e.g. turn on the hue lights if the tuya sensor switches to on) or if the vendor app/service has a limitation that doesn’t allow me to do what I want. For instance, I have some automations for my Mitsubishi airco units cause their app sucks. Otherwise I’ll just use the default app or service. Only configure an integration if I’m going to use it in an automation; I have a bunch of integrations detected that I don’t configure. I decided to follow these rules a couple of years back, and since then I could address all my needs with almost 0 maintenance. reply darknavi 2 hours agoprevI'll be the one to plug Valetudo in this thread I guess.

HA environment is vast. There are myriads of options, features, and functions. There are some gotchas that can be costly down the road. All of the following are \"for now, as you start out\": Do not gyrate over which version of HA to run. Run the HAOS loaded on RasPi, or a dedicated machine. You can migrate to other solution if that does not end up to be the best choice. Make sure you get the latest Zigbee radio dongle the HA Forum recommends. I use in all my HA installs a combination dongle for Zigbee & Z-Wave and it works flawlessly (NORTEK Quickstick Combo). Start with a few cheap Zigbee devices. Stay away from WiFi, LoRaWAN and other solutions. Z-Wave devices are great, but more expensive. You know you do not know if you even want to do this. Initially, just use the built-in Zigbee (ZHA) integrations. Once you are comfortable deploying other ways, like MQTT can be established easily. Do not spend too much on the devices now. I suggest you pick up a PIR motion sensors, door & window opening sensors, temperature & humidity sensors, smart plugs, and light bulbs. Anything else is overkill to try out. Sub-tip: all of these are battery operated, so try to consolidate on a standard battery. The ones I listed can all run off of 2032 cell batteries. Ikea sells most of these, Aqara is well known, and so on. If it is Zigbee (not Matter) you will have 96% chance it will work with HA.

    "originBody": "25 years of Dillo Written on 2024-12-15 by Rodrigo Arias Mallo Back in 1999, a group of developers lead by Jorge Arellano Cid forked the Gzilla/Armadillo code originally developed by Raph Levien, and began working on what is now known as the Dillo web browser. Today, as of December of 2024, Dillo is 25 years old! During this long journey, the project has seen a lot of changes and has stalled several times, but it managed to survive to this day. As a commemoration of this milestone I wanted to write a short history of the project. Notice that Jorge had lead the project from 1999 until 2019, and as of today, we don't have more news about him. I hope he is okay and just decided to move on to other projects. Since then, I (Rodrigo) decided to resurrect the project and bring it back to life. I have no relationship with the previous developers, but I try to do my best to keep the original goals intact. This document tries to tells the history as I have observed it through the pieces I was able to collect from the mailing list, the changelog and the git history. GTK period (1999 - 2006) When Dillo was forked, it was using GTK 1.0 as the UI library. The first releases were done in December of 1999 as recorded in the ChangeLog. At the time, this is how Gzilla 0.3.9 looked like: Dillo 0.8.3, source WikiMedia During the initial development, Jorge first designed and wrote the naming convention for the function names (like prefixing them with a_ when they are public) or using 3 spaces for indentation, and began adjusting the code base to follow the same convention. On March of 2000, the license was changed to the GPL with the permission of Raph Levien (the main developer of Gzilla/Armadillo). The browser experimented a large rewrite with the idea to maintain several flows of communication following a signal driven approach. This work ended up in the publication Network programming internals of the Dillo Web browser by Jorge Arellano-Cid and H.H. Von Brand. This work would later derive in the Concomitant Control Chain (CCC), the mechanism that Dillo still uses today to track multiple connections and among its internal modules. Sebastian Geerken began working on the code base at least since June of 2000. First submitting small patches and then moving to the rendering engine, of which he became the main architect. The rendering engine is one of the most important components of the browser, which essentially reads a tree of elements and determines the size and position of each element on the screen, like the words of paragraphs and images. The support for HTML and CSS features started to grow during the coming years, specially for tables and text elements. Shortly after GTK2 was released, the team was considering porting Dillo to it, but there were some concerns regarding the complexity and size of the new GTK version. On October of 2003, Jorge asked the FLTK maintainer Michael Sweet if it would be feasible to port Dillo to FLTK, as it was considered to align better with the objectives of speed and stability: We were following our plan to port dillo from GTK1 (currently used TK) to GTK2, when one of our list subscribers suggested considering FLTK because of shared philosophy backgrounds The team decided to focus on FLTK 2 instead of GTK 2.0, as it was considered far more bloated and slow. Notice that at the time, FLTK 2 was not yet released, but is was planning to be released \"soon\". On August 2004, Sebastian decided to make an interesting design decision, to make the Dillo widget toolkit independent. This way it was posible to continue the development of GTK1 and FLTK2 in parallel, among other benefits. The most complex part is certainly Dw, since it is tightly bound to Gtk+. By all means, I want to prevent, that there exist different versions of Dw, with different features (e.g., when the development of the Gtk+ version continues, while the FLTK version is developed), which are hard to integrate. For this reason (and others), I'm currently working on a redesign of Dw, which will make Dw toolkit independant. This is not the single goal of this redesign, it will also make some other features possible, e.g. a preview window, in which the whole page may be seen with reduced size, also, it will make reusage of Dw within graphical plugins possibel, and some more. (Actually, the idea for this design is already older, except the platform independency, but this was simple to add.) During this period, the DPI mechanism (plugins) was improved and some functionality was moved to external programs that talk to the browser via the DPI protocol, like the downloads, bookmarks, FTP and also HTTPS. The version 0.8.3 released on October, 2004 had already HTTPS support. Here is how it looked like (still using GTK1): Dillo 0.8.3, source WikiMedia During the following years, the development of the FLTK port was underway. The functionality that was provided by glib was implemented in a custom Dlib library so Dillo would not need to depend on glib anymore. On February 2005, Jorge and Sebastian gave a talk at FOSDEM about the Dillo browser. Unfortunately, there is no recording of that talk. But shortly after, Jorge gave another talk at LSM in 2005, which was recorded, and was the first time the FLTK2 implementation was shown. Picture of Jorge from the LSM 2005 video, from the YouTube video The last release that still used GTK1 was 0.8.6 on April, 2006. We will have to wait two years until the next release 2.0.0 was finally published with the port to FLTK2 completed. FLTK 2 period (2005 - 2011) The porting to FLTK2 was intended to make the browser smaller and provide other features like antialiasing. On April 2005, Jorge reported that the port to FLTK2 was making great progress. Here are some good news with our current progress in porting dillo to FLTK. It has being going-on very fast and we have made great progress so far. Here is how the browser looked like with FTLK2: First versions of Dillo using FLTK2 During this time however, the source code for the new FLTK2 port was not available in the CVS to the public. Instead, Jorge was focusing on rising funding to cover the project development from some interested companies. On March 2006, Jorge reported that so far it was not being successful in attracting funding. The project faced a serious risk of stalling. After mid 2006, there were no more releases of Dillo until 2008, and so far no success in getting more developers involved or funding for the project. The project was considered frozen or stalled and the FLTK2 port remained closed source. On April 2007, Jorge reported that he had intentions to release the FLTK2 port as soon as Sebastian agreed. In fact, I think it was more or less 6 months ago, after some emails with Andrew Tanenbaum, who finally helped me to see that it was a good time to release the code again. Since then, I've tried to contact Sebastian to agree on this. On September 30, 2007, Jorge finally announced that the FLTK2 port was now available: This is an alpha release of the next generation of the Dillo web browser. The code underwent a major rewrite: significant parts of the codebase were ported to C++, and the rendering engine now uses the FLTK2 library instead of GTK1. Please read the README inside dillo's tarball. Developers willing to join the project and contribute are highly encouraged. Sebastian did an excellent work documenting the new dillo widget engine (just run doxygen inside DW tree). This move started a lot of patches from other developers that were quickly integrated in the FLTK2 port. These contributions pushed Dillo towards an active state of development again. On September of 2008, Jorge announced the support for tabs, which was included for the release. After a lot of bug fixing, the next version based on FLTK2 was ready and on October of 2008, Dillo 2.0.0 was finally released. A year later, on July of 2009, Jorge announces that he is now a father, and his time for developing Dillo will (understandably) be affected. I'm quite happy to let you know that yesterday 19 Aug [July], my first daughter Lisa was born! Everything is OK, we're vey happy with this \"release\" :) and I just wanted to communicate it here, so you more or less know or understand my activities (or lack of) in the next days. More features and bug fixes were added in the coming releases, until the last release of the 2.X series, the version 2.2.1 released on 2011. During this period, we don't observe more patches from Sebastian or emails in the mailing list. Here is how Dillo was looking in the 2.2 version, very similar as how it looks today: Dillo 2.2, source TuxArena During this period, another problem was coming in FLTK. The development for FLTK2 was considered stalled and there was no official version released. This caused issued in downstream distributions, as Dillo required to link with a FLTK package that was not available. So, the team decided to switch to FLTK 1.3 as soon as it was released, and bump Dillo to the series 3.X. FLTK 1.3 period (2011 - 2016) On June 2011, with the FLTK 1.3 release done, the port of Dillo to FLTK 1.3 was underway. Only a few months later, the first 3.0.0 release using FLTK 1.3 was published. On July of 2012, Sebastian presented a new hyphenation algorithm that implements the same mechanism used in TeX. This new implementation makes its way to the 3.0.3 release on April of 2013. Several releases were made until the version 3.0.5 on June 2015. During these last two years, we see a shift in the amount of commits introduced by Sebastian, which grow quite substantially. On that time, Sebastian was working on the GROWS redesign, which changed the way the size of the widgets (elements of the page) where computed. Sadly, on October 2016, Sebastian passed away, leaving much of his work not included into a new release. Since then, the development quickly stalled until in 2019 Jorge sent his last email recorded by the mailing list, recommending a user to simply use the current version of the repository, rather than waiting for the 3.1 release: > According to the info on > https://hg.dillo.org/dillo/raw-file/default/ChangeLog, dillo-3.1 [not released yet]. > > I will probably wait until they release it officially. IMHO, you should get it. It's being stable for years. -- Cheers Jorge.- After this moment, the project began to deteriorate. On 2022 the DNS domain of dillo.org was lost, causing the website, the mercurial repository, the mailing list and the email server to disappear. The project quickly became abandoned, as there was no more developer activity anywhere. The dillo.org site now became a weird zombie copy of the once original website, but now plagued with SPAM in a Wordpress blog. The resurrection (2024 - present) On December of 2023, I began spending some time patching Dillo to make it build again. I tried to fix some simple bugs, and when I saw that the Atari forum had managed to port Dillo to Atari (!) based on my repo I though that it may be feasible to try to resurrect it. I commented it on Hacker News and it got surprised on the of interest it drew. I first made a GitHub organization to hold the Git repositories and used the GitHub pages to make a new Dillo website. I tried to get a copy of all materials I could, and upload them to the new website and mailing list. I tried to fix all the issues to finally make the 3.1.0 release, and after some months of work in my free time, I managed to release it on May of 2024. It caught the attention of several news sites and soon later it made its way to several Linux distributions. As of today, 15 of December of 2024, I continue to maintain the project, and we are getting some new contributors which help with patches and discussion about the development. We are still far from having enough developers to cover all the issues, but we are slowly making some progress. The last release of Dillo is 3.1.1, and this is what is looks like when loading the new Dillo website: Dillo 3.1.1 on my computer ← Home",

Delayed gratification. That and developers often conflate knowing how to construct UIs with how to design UIs. When lynx was first built, the difference in speed probably wasn’t that noticeable and people didn’t have the same expectations for responsiveness, so it didn’t matter, though times quickly changed. I don’t know about that project specifically, but based on my experience trying to do design work in developer-controlled projects, maintainers and core users often convince themselves that some terrible user-hostile counter-intuitive UI— focused on graphically representing the API to the back end rather than using abstractions to solve the problems users actually want to solve— is the proper UI approach and if it doesn’t fit your use case, the problem is either you or your use case. reply sshine 18 hours agoprevI used Dillo when I ran OpenBSD on my laptop in 2003.

My laptop died, so I wound up borrowing my parent's 500mhz pentium with 64 mb of ram as my 'college machine'. Shockingly, it could actually run firefox at the time. Anyway, this meant that I didn't have a computer when I visited them. The only one left in the house was a 486 with 24 mb of ram. What's an enterprising coder to do? Did I really want to leave my cs homework until I returned? No! So I put slackware on it, and let me tell you dillo ran wonderfully, at least well enough to pull up javadocs. I'd edit my src files locally, ssh into my uni's unix lab, transfer the src files there and compile. This workflow was surprisingly productive, or maybe it was just the sheer force of will young devs have. I honestly think having to 'figure things out' with bad hardware is a great learning experience. I am now sitting beside my workstation with 64 GB of ram and 24 gb of vram and a beefy 16 core cpu.

Probably the right call if you want to promote a brand of professionalism for your company. But it is a bit more than that. About boxes that indicated the engineers that worked on the software are kind of cute in a way — recalling a time when a couple of programmers could write The Finder. Credits (and Easter eggs) also speak of a time when engineers, if not driving the boat, were at least given a good deal of leeway to sign their creations. I feel like there were a cadre of engineers that Jobs tried desperately to keep out of the public eye around the time of iTunes, etc. Worried, I suppose, about poaching. Presenting at WWDC turned out to be the best way an Apple engineer could pass out their resumé. When the engineers were essentially muted I think it represented a power shift at Apple toward management, marketing, design. Good for Apple. It served the company and the brand well. No one can argue with the stock trajectory.

I can also name many of the key NeXT players, like Avie Tevanian and Bertrand Sertlet.

It was industry-wide. It's true that teams had to grow in size as software got more complex. Was commoditization the best way to do it? It certainly aggregated power in the hands of management. That was probably an intended consequence. One unintended consequence is that tech leads and staff engineers became increasingly selected more for political than technical merit. That in turn decreased the per-capita merit of the workforce as a whole.

He was probably working with the best information that he had, but going on the friendly advice of tech journalists may not have been the best move.

The iPhone launched that year with obvious deficiencies (no apps, no 3G) but managed to evolve into something much better quickly enough that it didn't really matter. The Foleo was really limited, but I'm not sure that would have killed it if they would have gotten subsequent versions right. reply filmgirlcw 21 hours agorootparentI don’t think we can even reasonably talk about Palm circa 2007 and iPhone 2007 in the same sentence. PalmOS was an aging clusterfuck that was a PDA with cellular glommed onto it (and the good Treo’s of the era ran Windows Mobile, which was better in some ways but a ridiculous mess for its own reasons) and the iPhone, even without apps or 3G was such a revelation and improvement that it single-handedly reshaped not just mobile, but personal computing, nearly overnight. The software the iPhone did have was truly impressive — at least for the core feature that really set it apart: the web browser. The capacitive touch screen and the on-screen keyboard made mince meat out of every other mobile operating system in existence or even in development; Google completely changed Android from being a Palm/BlackBerry clone to being an iPhone clone as soon as they saw it. People were willing to jailbreak and reverse engineer their iPhones to run apps on it. Palm, like most everyone else, was caught completely flat-footed. They weren’t working on webOS in 2007; their next-gen version of Palm OS (the name escapes me) was not going to set the world on fire and Windows Mobile (who they increasingly had offloaded software duties to) was also not doing super well. It took new investors (and management changes that included ousting Colligan, who by all accounts is a pretty great guy and who did lead Palm and Handspring well in different environments) and a brand new engineering team for Palm to create webOS, an OS that had a lot of promise but was still largely better as a tech demo than a finished product, and even with insane work, webOS launched 2 years after iPhone and couldn’t compete on hardware or software. Foleo, which was from the older era of Palm, never could have worked. Ever. Even in a world without iPhone, it’s a dud. But with iPhone, it’s DOA before it even gets to production. reply sillywalk 16 hours agorootparent> heir next-gen version of Palm OS (the name escapes me) It was called Cobalt. https://www.palmsource.com/palmos/cobalt.html reply gnachman 19 hours agorootparentprevI moved across the country to work for Palm on a secret project which was revealed to be the Foleo only after I started.

The rumour I was told for the cause of all the delays was that some executive had decided the screen was too low resolution way too late in the project and everything had to be redesigned. Released a year or two earlier they might have been decent devices, IMHO. reply wkat4242 10 hours agorootparentprevI was really looking forward to the foleo actually. Most likely would have purchased one. reply filmgirlcw 21 hours agorootparentprevBut the Foleo was by all accounts a bad device (when Palm enthusiasts were able to use obtain nearly final release Foleo’s years later, this was vindicated by even the most strident of Palm fanboys). The price was ridiculous ($600 before a $100 introductory rebate) for a thing that also required a $400 or $500 phone to work. It wasn’t a netbook at all, it was a thin client for an extremely underpowered mobile phone with a very outdated operating system. Ignoring for a moment that the netbook craze was extremely short-lived and largely a placeholder for what people really wanted (sub $500 laptops), no attempt at any of these sorts of companion devices has ever achieved critical mass and Palm was right to cancel a product that wouldn’t have moved the needle. Why Samsung even bothers maintaining DeX mode is beyond me. Another smart phone pioneer that struggled and was never able to adequately respond to the iPhone did release their own take on the Foleo. It was called the BlackBerry Playbook and it was an absolutely terrible tablet and a colossal failure. Canceling Foleo in 2007 was prudent. It is a shame the post-Colligan Palm was never able to find success; webOS had many great ideas. But the Palm Foleo was a product that absolutely did not need to exist. reply wkat4242 10 hours agorootparent> Why Samsung even bothers maintaining DeX mode is beyond me.

Whether the repercussions were enough is a valid question, but Jobs was dead by the time the civil action was ruled on and on medical leave when the DoJ settlement in 2011 took place, so it’s hard to play a “what if” game here — especially since these lawsuits and DoJ investigations (correctly) caused tech companies to have to change their policies. But Apple’s egregious no-poach agreements and collusion with other companies to do the same didn’t cause Palm’s collapse. And being able to more easily hire Apple employees wouldn’t have saved Palm. reply saghm 18 hours agorootparentThe repercussions Apple faced were essentially insignificant to them as a company. The money they had to pay was a drop in the bucket, and having to stop doing something illegal is not a punishment for the illegal thing; it's literally what everyone who didn't do anything illegal has already been doing the whole time!

A lawsuit would not serve either of our interests, and will not stop employees from migrating between our companies. This is a very exciting time for both of our companies, and the market is certainly big enough for both of us. We should focus on our respective businesses and not create unnecessary distractions. Compare this to Eric Schmidt's spineless response when Jobs complained to him about Google poaching: >Can you get this stopped and let me know why this is happening?\" Schmidt wrote. >Google's staffing director responded that the employee who contacted the Apple engineer \"will be terminated within the hour.\" >He added: \"Please extend my apologies as appropriate to Steve Jobs.\" Then again, Google thrived afterward and happily enjoyed the fruits of illegally suppressing wages, while Palm's market share plummeted soon after Jobs' threat. reply MaxPock 18 hours agoparentWasn't Schmidt serving on Apple board board too at that time? reply xyst 22 hours agoparentprevYet after a massive paper trail, \"do not call\" lists, and \"gentlemen's agreements\" with C-level executives between not just Apple and Google but with a large majority of SV in a conspiracy to avoid competition in wages.

I'll give you time to study basic micro economics (supply and demand). reply knuckleheadsmif 21 hours agoprevThis crap happens all the time between companies. When I worked at Apple around 1990, Steve who was as we all know was CEO of NeXT at the time was recruiting 6 Apple folks (including me) to help add the internationalization infrastructure to NeXT OS. We were invited to dinner at his Woodside home (the one where the Ducati motorcycle was parked inside at the bottom of the stairs which I can confirm to be true.) The first thing, after we sat down for dinner, is Steve read us a letter that the Apple Lawyers sent him threatening to sue for poaching employees. He then sat down and we had a wonderful vegetarian meal prepared by his two ex. ahead Panisse chefs. What was memorable about the meal was that Steve was still very emotionally attached to Apple and most of dinner was him asking us about Apple. None of us took him up on the Job offer and I letter learn that the Apple lawyers found out about the meeting before hand because one of us (who I’ll kept nameless) alerted them about the meeting. reply knuckleheadsmif 21 hours agoparentA decade or so later I worked at Intuit where Intuit, Adobe, Apple, Google, Pixar (and one or two other companies that escape me) had an anti-poaching agreement not to approach anyone for a job (if they however we approached by someone they would consider them.) All the companies were later fined (I think it was a court case) and employees between certain years at those companies who were looking for jobs got a significant settlement. I missed the date of qualifying for the settlement by one year but I know for a fact that this was indeed true because as a hiring manager at Intuit HR more than one time told me I could not cold call people at these companies to recruit. reply knuckleheadsmif 20 hours agorootparentAs another aside to this story, when I was at Intuit Bill Campbell who was on the Apple Board and CEO/Board Member of Intuit in 1999 or 2000 arranged for my project (An entirely internet version of Quickbooks as a subscription service) to support the then crappy Macintosh Microsoft IE browser that was the main Mac browser. You have to remember that Microsoft IE on the Mac was a completely different code base than on windows, did not have any debugging, and not feature compatible especially as far as CSS and DOM functionality is concerned. So we did meet with Apple but told them that we could not support what they wanted unless we could get a debugger for that Mac IE at a minimum. The response from them was just to debug on IE in windows. We laughed and left the meeting. I think Apple got that response from a lot of early web app developers and was a factor into them taken control of their browser destiny and eventually releasing Safari. By the way, although I left Intuit in 2007, our product is the version of Quickbooks that they mainly sell, and is supported by all the modern browsers but in 1999 when the project was started developing a complex easy to use web app was a challenge. reply lern_too_spel 20 hours agorootparentprevIt was an insignificant settlement. This agreement was in place at the start of the mobile wars. Apple spent a lot of money suing its competitors instead of spending that money paying engineers to leave its competitors. Immediately following the ruling against the companies, salaries shot up industry-wide, by far more per year than each engineer got from the settlement for multiple years of illegal activity. reply snowwrestler 22 hours agoprevThe thing that strikes me is the disparity in length. I think a lot of people don’t realize how hard it is to write succinctly. Jobs was (is?) probably under-appreciated as a writer. Colligan was correct such an agreement would be illegal and could have just stood on that. reply vidarh 22 hours agoparentColligan was putting down what had occurred in writing so that the details of what Jobs had said would be a matter of record should it come to a lawsuit down the line. This is a common - and highly useful - strategy if you've just been in a meeting where things have been said that you were uncomfortable with. Being succinct would have defeated the purpose. This is a useful strategy to employ in all kinds of situations. A dated note written shortly after the event is going to carry more weight than recollection later. An e-mail sent to the other party that they have not contested the understanding of is going to carry more weight than just a note. And if, as Jobs did, your other side responds, you now have ammunition for any future lawsuits. EDIT: Creating a paper trail is a method to take note of in other contexts too.

Android wasn't even out when the email was sent, and I know webOS didn't come out to the public until 2009, but I am rather curious how long it was in development prior-to... I was a webOS dude -- I still have a Palm Pre 1, 2 and 3 in a box. I tried to explain to my hipster doofus buddy at the time why I fucked with the Palm vision over the Apple vision (regrettably, in hindsight, part of it was due to Palm holding onto the physical keyboard, part of which was I was a huge fan of that due to entering the smartphone era after being a previous T-Mobile Sidekick 1 - 3 user) -- they both preached the same philosophy of web apps over native apps, except something intangible and aesthetic about the Pre resonated with me in late 00's more than iPhone did. Apple also hadn't yet started deploying most of its critical infrastructure (walled-garden interoperability, APNS, any of that stuff) that lead to eventual dominance and ended up justifying the current stock price / mobile supremacy -- it was just a phone vs phone comparison. These days, IMO, Apple is on top of the pile. They're launching satellites that likely will completely sidestep mobile carriers in the short term. They're doing stuff with hardware that today we think is stupid, but tomorrow might just be an accepted part of life. They've made it easy for anybody to lock their digital lives inside of the Apple vaults for a recurring monthly subscription lol.

Or \"how to blow your lead by wasting half a decade doing nothing\". I _loved_ my Palm Treo 600, that was released 5 freaking years before the first iPhone. It had everything I needed, but the OS felt anachronistic even in 2003. So I was eagerly awaiting for Palm OS 6 to come, so I could upgrade. And waiting. And waiting. And then Palm died. reply ndiddy 20 hours agoparentPalm didn't have anything to do with Palm OS 6, they spun off Palm OS development to a company called PalmSource (later ACCESS). Palm OS 6 was finished around 2004, but never shipped on a device because the performance was horrible compared to Palm OS 5. This was due to poor software architecture. PalmSource threw out the kernel used by previous versions of Palm OS and replaced it with a microkernel that focused on message-passing between processes. Most of the Palm OS API got re-implemented using IPC. This meant that each API call would require at least two context switches, more if the API implementation needed to make another API call that was implemented with IPC. The ARM chips that were available at that point flushed their caches on each context switch. The result was that doing something like opening an address book with around a thousand entries went from taking a few hundred ms to taking seconds, as displaying each entry required an IPC call to the service responsible for handling contacts data. It's definitely a shame, as Palm OS 5 is a stopgap OS that got shipped on devices way after the point it became obsolete. Third-party developers couldn't even write native ARM software, they had to compile for 68k and add small chunks of ARM code for performance intensive areas where the 68k->ARM emulation became a bottleneck. reply cyberax 17 hours agorootparentThat's interesting.

The downside to being a passionate customer & engineer. — I felt similarly with Netscape. If Navigator had been consistently both web browser and editor, it would have been a better product, a real service in keeping the web a two way tool for most people. Tim Berners-Lee’s vision tied creation & browsing together, which is why the web happened at all. Staying true to that would have produced more value, and maintained enough (constructive) lock in for Netscape to keep innovating in a way that mattered. Instead they announced their imagined threat to Windows, before that threat was realistic, then drowned in Microsoft’s response. And the disparity in their emphasis on browsing vs. creation left a big hole in the side of their boat, leaving them extremely vulnerable to browser competitors. Microsoft was convicted in court for product tying & other over anti-competitive behavior. But Netscape was convicted in the market for not fulfilling the full circle value of the web they were pioneering. They commoditized themselves. And the web has never recovered from the unnecessary creation/browsing dichotomy. I was so mad at them! (Laughing tears emoji) reply nicolas_t 22 hours agoparentprevSame.

Apple participated in an illegal anti-competitive anti-worker chilling of the market. If they hadn't, perhaps some of the people that worked on iPhone over the next decade might have joined Palm, and improved it. Instead, Apple retained them and artificially deflated their wages at the same time. Don't get me wrong, Palm is still more to blame. But...there's a reason Jobs perpetuated this policy. He knew the value one or two key people can make in changing the entire history of product and technology. reply msteffen 20 hours agoprevLot of comments observing that Apple is doing much better than Palm these days, but IMO they miss the point.

Palm is dead too, but its investors and employees are doing something else now, and I don’t think they’re generally much worse for the wear. And the time that Palm’s engineers spent there is indelibly better because their boss respected them.

I think you can make the argument that what Jobs brought to the table was impeccable taste. He was very good at pushing (some would say abusing) his people to make things that people genuinely loved.

Your comment is on the milder scale, so this is only tangentially a response to you. — With highly related choices, it can make sense to add & cancel moral choices. Good & bad behavior are like positives & negatives. But life and incidents are not simple sums. Relations between choices & their outcomes are highly nonlinear. They can have thresholds, be multiplicative, exponential, roots or logarithmic relations. Choices & their outcomes rarely simply add or cancel. Jobs was an incredibly prolific innovator whose personal characteristics often translated to important advances in the quality of computing, independent of the general industry’s shared march of compounding quantity/efficiency of computing. No amount of moral lapses not on that scale cancel any of that. At the same time, his positive contributions, no matter how large, don’t cancel out his poor behaviors. Like a polynomial, or more complicated algebraic or calculus expressions, it takes several “numbers” to characterize human being’s contributions. — The worst cases of overly reductive thinking happen in politics. The prevalence of judging people and peoples’ behaviors as simply net positive or negative, and their opponents as simply the other sign is endemic.

Very adult and levelheaded. Something we all expect and deserve from anyone that makes it to the CEO level. Unfortunately, it has been rare and even more so lately. You will never be able to avoid the type of people that only care about the most money they can make. These people don’t care about the product, the mission, or the company. They will bounce from Apple to Palm and then somewhere else. Totally fine. I hope they are doing the level of work and have the level of skill that warrants their pay, if only for the sake of their colleagues that have to put up with them. I don’t have any sympathy for companies or people at the top of those companies that hire dipshits that can’t produce anything and still pay them unnecessary money. Obviously, we hope companies pay employees that have passion for the mission and treat them fairly. Then they have a reason to stay. Unfortunately, a lot of these employees fall through the cracks and it’s a shame.

But when they were discounted to $99 - $149, they sold out instantly. They even did a second production run and sold more at $249. This was a huge missed opportunity for Palm. WebOS was pretty good at that time. They needed more software for it - this is a perpetual problem for most platforms at launch.

    "originBody": "nokia Nokia 5110 - Back from the dead. Part 1: Nostalgia I loved my Nokia 5110 and I wonder if it was possible to breathe new life into this long-shelved and still-memed mobile phone. As it turns out, not only is it possible, but it's going to be a lot easier than I anticipated. OpsBros Admin Nov 28, 2022 • 3 min read The eniminable Nokia 5110 has been the stuff of legends. They are famous for being, probably accidentally, but nonetheless near indestructable in daily use. While the Memes generally refer to the 3210 or the 3310, the classic 5110 is no less a condender for most robust general use mobile phone available. The unique ability to change its outer faceplate was novel at the time and has only seen a resurgence with the advent of the modern phone case in its style and durability. My first ever phone was a Nokia 5110, given as a hand-me-down from my father and it's always held a special place in my soul. With that sentiment, I had always had thoughts about bringing the old beast back to life. The Nokia 5110 is a 2G telephone, meaning it uses the original 2G mobile network to communicate. This network has long been decommissioned in most western countries, including Australia. And the 3G network is only a 2 or 3 years from the same fate. So while pondering this, I wondered if there were any good universal 4G SoC modules I could use to 'retrofit' the 5110. And to my surprise, there is an exceptionally fitting candidate. Enter: The SIM7600SA. The SIM7600E-H System on a Chip (SoC). This little module is capable of communicating with the 4G network, and facilitating SMS and Calling, as well as a myriad of other functions like TCPIP, Data transfer and other things that definitely wouldn't be very useful in a 5110, but none-the-less impressive for a module that is 30mmx30mm in size. The overview sourced from the SIM7600 hardware design document Now armed with this chip, my next mission was to disassemble a Nokia 5110 and see how much effort would be required to retrofit this phone. I had horrid visions of bodge wires everywhere, modded button interface and not being able to use the classic 5110 display. My disassembled Nokia 5110. Such a simple and elegant design nowadays, but revolutionary for its time. To by absolute suprise and delight, the construction of the 5110 has meant that this project is going to be decidedly easier than I originally hoped, and will allow me to maintain the entirety of the look and feel of the 5110 while giving it new life as a 4G phone. Remember when electronics had service manuals? Pepperidge farm remembers... Inside the 5110, there are two PCBs. The baseboard which is the board I will need to recreate, and the interface board. Complete with a board-mounted B2B interconnect. Thanks to Nokias design skills, i will simply be able to recreate the baseboard with the new 4G module, a microcontroller, and some audio processing and power management circuitry and it will be able to seamlessly fit inside the phone. A closeup of the UI Board and Baseboard showing the clearly defined and separated roles. Thanks mostly to the phones age, interfacing with the UI board will be rather trivial. The B2B interconnect contains a standard ROWx/COLx pinout for the buttons, a separate line for the Power button, lines for the LED backlights, buzzer and Speaker, and even the display is a standard I2C interface. I couldn't have hoped for more. Stay tuned for part 2 where I break down the design of the new board, determining what is needed to fulfil the functions the phone needs to operate and ensuring this phone will last for many years to come.",

I know very little about this stuff but presumably he would need to write some code for the SIM7600SA that would allow it to interface seamlessly with the UI board, which sounds far from trivial (unless maybe the UI board is very well documented)? reply josephernest 6 hours agoprevPro tip: don't buy the new versions \"Nokia 3210 2024\" and similar models. I did, two times, with slightly different models, and they are of exceptionally poor quality: dead after one year, very buggy firmware. The customer support is an AI with no real answer. They recommended to install an app \"from the Google Play app store\" which is nonsense for a dumbphone. They are very cheap noname phones, branded with the name Nokia, but I am sure no Nokia R&D team was involved in these products. reply numpad0 5 hours agoparentThey clearly don't have the old code base, workforce to hypothetically adapt it to VoLTE, or factories to manufacture the phones. New Nokia TA-xxxx phones use MediaTek/Unisoc(Spreadtrum) SoC and MediaTek MAUI software rebranded as \"S30+\". Which means those are reskinned Chinese phones. Old Nokia had RM-xxx or RX-xxx model numbers, so it's also clear that some of their corpo structure did survive. reply neilv 1 hour agoparentprevI tried a Nokia-in-name-only modern dumbphone (a compact one without the retro styling), and it did what I needed, which was mainly SMS 2FA. Until a manager for a tempting job wanted to do the first call on the phone. The call quality was so bad, it bombed the interview for me. So I kissed my privacy goodbye, and bought an iPhone.

The reason for that (I think) is not that the 5110 is less robust, but that the 3210 and 3310 were much more widespread - they came onto the market when mobile phones really started to become widespread, while the 5110 (their predecessor), with its stub antenna and bulkier size, looks a bit like the last representative of the previous era... reply ljf 7 hours agoparentTotally! When I got my Nokia 5146 (still basically a 5110) - you had to pay I think £50 for the phone, plus the contract of £15 a month. A month or two later you could get the 3210 for free, plus a better contract from orange, that took advantage of the MMS options - plus had the programmable ringtones which was soooooo much cooler than the 5110. I was lucky to jump from the 5110 to the 8210, and then to a 8250 which I adored and used on an off through to 2007 - when I moved to the E61 then e71 - which both still hold a very special place in my heart! reply dfox 4 hours agorootparent3210 did not support MMS, but EMS with some semi-proprietary extensions. Sending images and ringtones over EMS was generally not interoperable between different vendors. MMS is much later technology where the user data go over HTTP, which implies at least WAP support and GPRS to be really practical. reply ljf 3 hours agorootparentYou are totally correct - I was thinking of 'picture messages' which this could send.

Even if the baseband/modem chips miraculously do conform perfectly to some I/O protocol at the hardware level despite being multiple generations apart, wouldn't the difference in timings break whatever firmware the Nokia 5110 has, which was expecting only a single very specific hardware configuration? Or is the author planning to also hack the drivers? reply grishka 7 hours agoparentThese phones didn't have the modern smartphone architecture where there are separate CPU cores for the user OS and the modem. It's one single CPU core that does both the UI and all the low-level stuff required for communication with the tower. They were going to replace the board that contains that CPU and all the radio circuitry with one they were going to design from scratch around that 4G module. reply toast0 3 hours agoparentprevAs a sibling says, this likely won't work for a Nokia feature phone, because it's an integrated design and there's no separate modem. For a design with a modem module and a ux module, it might possibly just work to swap things out, but it would depend on how VoLTE is supported. If that is all managed by the modem module, then you're probably good. These modem modules are generally a serial port that speaks Hayes (AT) protocol. Plus some analog lines for mic and speaker. Some 4g modules might be serial over USB and may leave VoLTE entirely up to the application module, that's going go look different. Some of the modules are a qualcom SoC that runs headless Android. Which works, I guess, but seems bizarre. reply numpad0 5 hours agoparentprevNo, it's like reusing keyboard and monitor for a new PC. This phone uses those parts fully separated from the computer part that the author argues it should be possible to remake just the host computer part to recreate the experience. 4G doesn't even have a proper voice call support, and substitutes that with a carrier grade Discord type thing called VoLTE(oversimplification). Zero chance old firmware could work. reply wolrah 1 hour agorootparent> 4G doesn't even have a proper voice call support, and substitutes that with a carrier grade Discord type thing called VoLTE(oversimplification). That \"carrier grade Discord type thing\" is more or less standard SIP VoIP, just over a prioritized data channel similar to how DOCSIS has PacketCable which is more or less MGCP VoIP over a prioritized data channel. It's absolutely proper voice call support, the majority of calls you make or receive in 2024 have been connected over SIP at some point along the path. > Zero chance old firmware could work. The sorts of modules like the author was proposing using can be interacted with over relatively standard AT commands, so it's actually plausible that if there were a separate application processor it might be able to perform basic functions like placing/receiving calls without any firmware changes. The module handles all the VoLTE stuff and just exposes it as if it were any other modem. That said it's not uncommon for \"dumbphone\" type applications to run the application code on the baseband processor, in which case obviously it's incredibly unlikely that this new module is even a related family of processor, much less compatible with existing code. reply upofadown 1 hour agorootparent>That \"carrier grade Discord type thing\" is more or less standard SIP VoIP, just over a prioritized data channel... It is completely restricted to one SIP provider. Which raises an interesting idea for improved competition. Make it possible for the user to choose their SIP provider. Force the phone companies to allow the use of that priority to any SIP RTP stream and otherwise make those companies just sell data service. That would make a project like the one in the linked article come down to getting a magic module that provided an internet connection... reply amyames 4 hours agoparentprevNo. This phones keypad , controller, and screen are on a separate board.

The other was remakes of the \"old classics\", which were cheap, and claimed to cover roughly what I was hoping for, but are actually horrible quality, as another commenter said.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2G AFAIK, in the US, T-Mobile still has a 2G network. reply memsom 1 hour agoparentI am forever horrified when my 5G phone, which at my house already only gets 4G at best (the politics of cell towers in Southern England is just a sad sad story) drops now to 2G!!! Dropping a modern smartphone to 2G is like basically saying \"no network\". The only things I use it for are unusable. I rarely make calls. I rarely send SMS. Vodafone dropped 3G, O2 will drop it early next year and the others some time soonish too. Using a smart phone in a rural area now kind of feels like going back to 2007 if I am going to be honest. reply cardanome 4 hours agoparentprev2G is still strong in Germany as some industrial applications rely on it. It is not going to be deprecated any time soon. Maybe once they run out of spare parts. Germany's mobile network is worse than most third world countries. Working on a train? No internet for you! Going a few meters outside a settlement? Might not even be able to do calls. reply morsch 3 hours agorootparentSuch an exaggeration. >92% of the area is served with 5G. Calls are available in 98%-99% of the area (though sometimes just from one of the operators). Some trains were built in a way that blocks reception, though those have had repeaters or wifi for a while. I know plenty of people who work from the train every day.

I still use my Nokia 6030 2G phone with T-Mobile in Minnesota/Wisconsin. And it's battery still lasts a week and I can't even feel it in my pocket it's so small. Impossible to destroy too; I've used roughly it since ~2008. reply upofadown 1 hour agoprevI think that you would still end up with the inferior battery life of 4G. That was the killer feature of those phones. Our technology seems to have degraded in that regard over the years. reply aziaziazi 1 hour agoparent4G drain faster our batteries but we also now download multiple orders of magnitude more data than we used to with the 5110 (I count voice call as \"data\").

EVs of today are really heavy and even with a fairly small range, I fear the weight from the batteries would butcher any kind of driving experience for a car like that. In time though, I hope we get plenty of old cars retrofitted to be EVs as the tech becomes lighter, cheaper and more standardized. reply rbanffy 7 hours agorootparentThe 914 was always more toy than car anyway, so a short range is not really a deal breaker. reply toast0 3 hours agorootparentprevPeople have been making EV VW Beetle since forever.

If you want to add low-bandwidth connectivity in a project you can just get a BG95 or this Simcom as a devkit and e.g. a 1NCE SIM card, hook up the UART pins to your microcontroller and you're off to go.

The hardware usually feels really good, but all of them have had poor phone quality (even on different carriers). People would tell me if sound like I was underwater or far away from the phone while not using speaker), sometimes it would just drop the audio and I couldn't hear the other person, etc. I guess I still have nostalgia for some of the late Nokia phones, like the n900 and e72. My current Android HMD has been fine, but still has call issues (people often don't hear me for like 5-8 seconds when I call them; speak from just randomly stops working during calls). reply rjsw 5 hours agorootparentI have had three HMD phones now, all have had very good call quality when used in Europe. reply josephernest 6 hours agorootparentprevThese new Nokia models/re-issues are of very poor quality, see my other comment.
