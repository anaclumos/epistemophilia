    "originBody": "Simon Willison’s Weblog Subscribe How to succeed in MrBeast production (leaked PDF). Whether or not you enjoy MrBeast’s format of YouTube videos (here’s a 2022 Rolling Stone profile if you’re unfamiliar), this leaked onboarding document for new members of his production company is a compelling read. It’s a snapshot of what it takes to run a massive scale viral YouTube operation in the 2020s, as well as a detailed description of a very specific company culture evolved to fulfill that mission. It starts in the most on-brand MrBeast way possible: I genuinely believe if you attently read and understand the knowledge here you will be much better set up for success. So, if you read this book and pass a quiz I’ll give you $1,000. Everything is focused very specifically on YouTube as a format: Your goal here is to make the best YOUTUBE videos possible. That’s the number one goal of this production company. It’s not to make the best produced videos. Not to make the funniest videos. Not to make the best looking videos. Not the highest quality videos.. It’s to make the best YOUTUBE videos possible. The MrBeast definition of A, B and C-team players is one I haven’t heard before: A-Players are obsessive, learn from mistakes, coachable, intelligent, don’t make excuses, believe in Youtube, see the value of this company, and are the best in the goddamn world at their job. B-Players are new people that need to be trained into A-Players, and C-Players are just average employees. […] They arn’t obsessive and learning. C-Players are poisonous and should be transitioned to a different company IMMEDIATELY. (It’s okay we give everyone severance, they’ll be fine). The key characteristic outlined here, if you read between the hustle-culture lines, is learning. Employees who constantly learn are valued. Employees who don’t are not. There’s a lot of stuff in there about YouTube virality, starting with the Click Thru Rate (CTR) for the all-important video thumbnails: This is what dictates what we do for videos. “I Spent 50 Hours In My Front Yard” is lame and you wouldn’t click it. But you would hypothetically click “I Spent 50 Hours In Ketchup”. Both are relatively similar in time/effort but the ketchup one is easily 100x more viral. An image of someone sitting in ketchup in a bathtub is exponentially more interesting than someone sitting in their front yard. The creative process for every video they produce starts with the title and thumbnail. These set the expectations for the viewer, and everything that follows needs to be defined with those in mind. If a viewer feels their expectations are not being matched, they’ll click away - driving down the crucial Average View Duration that informs how much the video is promoted by YouTube’s all-important mystical algorithms. MrBeast videos have a strictly defined formula, outlined in detail on pages 6-10. The first minute captures the viewer’s attention and demonstrates that their expectations from the thumbnail will be met. Losing 21 million viewers in the first minute after 60 million initial clicks is considered a reasonably good result! Minutes 1-3, 3-6 and 6-end all have their own clearly defined responsibilities as well. Ideally, a video will feature something they call the “wow factor”: An example of the “wow factor” would be our 100 days in the circle video. We offered someone $500,000 if they could live in a circle in a field for 100 days (video) and instead of starting with his house in the circle that he would live in, we bring it in on a crane 30 seconds into the video. Why? Because who the fuck else on Youtube can do that lol. Chapter 2 (pages 10-24) is about creating content. This is crammed with insights into what it takes to produce surprising, spectacular and very expensive content for YouTube. A lot of this is about coordination and intense management of your dependencies: I want you to look them in the eyes and tell them they are the bottleneck and take it a step further and explain why they are the bottleneck so you both are on the same page. “Tyler, you are my bottleneck. I have 45 days to make this video happen and I can not begin to work on it until I know what the contents of the video is. I need you to confirm you understand this is important and we need to set a date on when the creative will be done.” […] Every single day you must check in on Tyler and make sure he is still on track to hit the target date. It also introduces the concept of “critical components”: Critical components are the things that are essential to your video. If I want to put 100 people on an island and give it away to one of them, then securing an island is a critical component. It doesn’t matter how well planned the challenges on the island are, how good the weather is, etc. Without that island there is no video. […] Critical Components can come from literally anywhere and once something you’re working on is labeled as such, you treat it like your baby. WITHOUT WHAT YOU’RE WORKING ON WE DO NOT HAVE A VIDEO! Protect it at all costs, check in on it 10x a day, obsess over it, make a backup, if it requires shipping pay someone to pick it up and drive it, don’t trust standard shipping, and speak up the second anything goes wrong. The literal second. Never coin flip a Critical Component (that means you’re coinfliping the video aka a million plus dollars) There’s a bunch of stuff about communication, with a strong bias towards “higher forms of communication”: in-person beats a phone call beats a text message beats an email. Unsurprisingly for this organization, video is a highly valued tool for documenting work: Which is more important, that one person has a good mental grip of something or that their entire team of 10 people have a good mental grip on something? Obviously the team. And the easiest way to bring your team up to the same page is to freaken video everything and store it where they can constantly reference it. A lot of problems can be solved if we just video sets and ask for videos when ordering things. I enjoyed this note: Since we are on the topic of communication, written communication also does not constitute communication unless they confirm they read it. And this bit about the value of consultants: Consultants are literally cheat codes. Need to make the world's largest slice of cake? Start off by calling the person who made the previous world’s largest slice of cake lol. He’s already done countless tests and can save you weeks worth of work. […] In every single freakin task assigned to you, always always always ask yourself first if you can find a consultant to help you. Here’s a darker note from the section “Random things you should know”: Do not leave consteatants waiting in the sun (ideally waiting in general) for more than 3 hours. Squid game it cost us $500,000 and boys vs girls it got a lot of people out. Ask James to know more And to finish, this note on budgeting: I want money spent to be shown on camera ideally. If you’re spending over $10,000 on something and it won’t be shown on camera, seriously think about it. I’m always interested in finding management advice from unexpected sources. For example, I love The Eleven Laws of Showrunning as a case study in managing and successfully delegating for a large, creative project. I don’t think this MrBeast document has as many lessons directly relevant to my own work, but as an honest peek under the hood of a weirdly shaped and absurdly ambitious enterprise it’s legitimately fascinating.

That’s the number one goal of this production company. It’s not to make the best produced videos. Not to make the funniest videos. Not to make the best looking videos. Not the highest quality videos.. It’s to make the best YOUTUBE videos possible. Replace \"youtube videos\" with whatever the company is trying to achieve. I see it all the time in large organizations, where different teams forget what the goal of the company is and instead get hyperfocused on their teams KPI's to the detriment of the company as a whole. Lawyers finding problems and trying to stop things from happening instead of finding solutions. Security blocking things and not suggesting alternatives. IT blocking this or that instead of trying solve problems, etc. reply bayindirh 6 hours agoparent> Replace \"youtube videos\" with whatever the company is trying to achieve. Some counterpoints: - Xerox knowingly didn't fix the problematic gear trains to guarantee periodic part changes, prioritizing money over \"best copier possible\". - Ford didn't fix Pinto's fuel tank, prioritizing cost minimization over \"best possible car in its class\". - Microsoft is did tons of shady things in its OS development history to prioritize domination over \"best OS possible\", sometimes actively degrading the good features and parts of its OS. - Dyson's some batteries are notorious for killing themselves via firmware on slight cell imbalance instead of doing self-balancing. Dyson prioritize \"steady income via killing good parts early\" instead of \"building the best vacuum possible\". - Many more electronic and electromechanical systems are engineered with short lives to prioritize \"minimizing costs and maximizing profit\" over \"building the best X possible\". - Lastly, Boeing's doing all kinds of shady stuff (MCAS, doors, build quality, etc.) since they prioritize \"maximize shareholder value\" over \"building the best planes possible\". - ...and there's Intel, but I think the idea is clear here. reply folken 6 hours agorootparentI think this is exactly the point that MrBeast is trying to make. By being best YOUTUBE videos it means to focus on whatever appeals to the algorithm. It doesn't mean you are better informed, or better entertained, as long as the click-through-rate is great and the minutes people watch the video is maximized. You could say the same thing is true for Xerox, for them the best doesn't necessary mean that they sell you the best most reliable copier, but the highest grossing product, with a guaranteed post-sale income. And this is why we can't have nice things. reply duxup 6 hours agorootparentThere was a blog post linked on HN a while ago, it was about their start up they ran many years ago. They got traction with clients and were a very \"engineering focused\" (or similar term) organization. Their code was rock solid. It was all going great, until suddenly some new company showed up and started taking their customers. Their new competitor's software was a mess with all sorts of incomplete or pure vaporware features.... but they did get features out fast. They got beat out by Salesforce... We as people pick the winners with our money, we don't really want nice things. reply wpietri 5 hours agorootparent> We as people pick the winners with our money, we don't really want nice things. We do generally want nice things, but we can't be experts in all the things. In markets where you have mostly responsible actors, that can work out fine. But absent effective regulation or other feedback mechanisms, in many markets an actor who only cares about short-term cash extraction can beat out the people focused on long-term value by taking advantage of consumer ignorance. A good example here is food. Before the rise of industrial meat production, you would process meat yourself or buy it from a local butcher. You had a lot of information about the meat because the processing chain was short and local. You knew the people touching your food and could smell how clean they kept the butcher shop. But scaling that up created a lot of opacity. Suddenly it was much harder to know what went into your sausage. It was tens, hundreds, thousands of people involved, spread over many miles. Some dubious people took advantage, and so we ended up with food standards like the Federal Meat Inspection Act. [1] The system that grew out of that works pretty well; things Boar's Head recently killing 9 people [2] are surprisingly rare. For things less risky than safety, I think a lot of good is done by people like Consumer Reports and Wirecutter. Less ignorance about which products are really good is less room for bad actors to exploit consumers. If people really didn't want nice things, those would be much less popular. Instead, I think they're a sign that people do want nice things, but just have an awful lot to do, and so can't spend much time on a single purchasing decision unless it's a really big deal for them. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Meat_Inspection_Act, with a nod to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_listeriosis... reply DwnVoteHoneyPot 2 hours agorootparent> We do generally want nice things, but we can't be experts in all the things. Counter-point: People complain a lot about leg-room on airplanes. They say they'll pay more for leg room. However, it's very well known (empirically) that they won't pay. People want the cheapest seat - period. Leg room is very transparent. Consumers can't be fooled. People may want nice things, but they won't pay for it. Mr. Beast is just giving people what they empirically want. reply wpietri 1 hour agorootparentI don't think that's a great counterpoint for a few reasons. One is that leg room isn't particularly transparent. If I search for flights, the price is much more visible than a leg room measure. Two, people can certainly be fooled; for a long time airlines have been playing a game of gradually ratcheting back amenities without being up front about it. This is the same game that consumer packaged goods companies play with apparent package size. Three, people pay for more leg room all the time. Last I booked a flight, about half the plane was first class, business class, economy plus, or exit rows. Personally, I sometimes pay for it and sometimes don't. When I don't, it's sometimes because I resent how grossly extractive airlines have gotten. I also think \"empirically want\", however cute it is as a linguistic trick, is not particularly accurate. Is it what gets him paid? I'd believe it. Is it what they watch? Sometimes, for some people! But pretending that short-term behavior is equivalent to what somebody really wants is choosing to ignore a great deal. It's like saying alcoholics \"want\" to drink themselves to death. reply arcticbull 1 hour agorootparentGoogle Flights shows the leg room in inches, and there's several sites that you can research it on. However most concretely, back in 2000, American removed a few rows of coach across its entire narrow body fleet to give passengers an extra 3-5 inches of legroom throughout coach. They did not recover the costs and walked it back. jetBlue provides more legroom through all of coach, and even I as a very tall person, don't go out of my way to book them. Some people will pay more for extra legroom, and I think the current split of seating in planes is likely right around the optimal distribution based on who will and won't pay. > Two, people can certainly be fooled; for a long time airlines have been playing a game of gradually ratcheting back amenities without being up front about it. Kind of but not really. Yeah they're not going to put out a press release when they take the olives off your salad. Airlines are an incredibly low margin commodity business. Many years they're negative margins. American's current operating margin is 3.41% [1] This is typical. These aren't B2B SaaS margins we're talking about. So generally when they take the olives off your salad, instead of putting out a press release they just lower fares on competitive routes. Because most people book on fare or based on corporate contract, which is a second-order effect of fare. [1] https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAL/american-airli... reply bobthepanda 32 minutes agorootparenti think the Jetblue thing is historically true but not anymore. The Jetblue thing is also not really altruistic, but a nice side effect of an optimization they did; the removal of the seats brought the capacity to their planes to a round number of 50, which happens to be the FAA required ratio of persons per flight attendant. reply david422 30 minutes agorootparentprevWell the other thing is paying for luggage. No-one wants to pay for luggage. But if luggage is free, it means that everyone with no/small luggage is just subsidizing those with luggage. reply campbel 3 hours agorootparentprevGreat examples. I think another case, especially in business/it, is that the people doing the purchasing aren't often the people using the products. This means the incentive structure often doesn't prioritize a good product, but instead whatever appeals to the buyer (perhaps lower cost, features, created by a known entity, e.g. no one got fired buying ibm). reply awuji 5 hours agorootparentprevBut most of the time, we as engineers don't pick the winners. Some C-Suite executive or middle manager, who isn't very technically inclined, picks the winners, and we as engineers are forced to make it work. As I don't think a engineer has ever had the chance to choose a company's CRM, the CRM with better marketing would always win over the CRM with better engineering. reply NikolaNovak 4 hours agorootparentQuestion I would pose is, why should engineer have the decision on a new CRM? They can provide input regarding e.g. maintainability, but majority of input would come from other stakeholders - users and business unit owning the customers whose relationship we want managed, ideally primarily. And it is somebodys job to take these inputs into collective whole. It was a mind blowing exercise to me 15 years ago when I was telling my boss how horrible our current installation of some ERP software was, and be asked me what's the user perspective. They log in every day, run financial reports they need, and log out. The system was great from their perspective! They had even less concern for my perspective of poor architecture and suboptimal implementation, than I (at that point) had of their perspective and goals. Thank krishna I didn't make the decisions on the CRM :-) reply PhasmaFelis 3 hours agorootparentUpthread, bayindirh posted half a dozen examples of financially-motivated decisions that were actively, deliberately hostile, sometimes fatal, to the customer. We're not just talking about good-enough fiddly details here. reply throw0101a 4 hours agorootparentprev> We as people pick the winners with our money, we don't really want nice things. What was the price(s) of that start up and what was the prices of Salesforce? What were the features of the start up and that of Salesforce? Different people think different things are \"nice\" (correctly or incorrectly). If you're offering things that you think are nice, but the customer does not care about, are you surprised that they go elsewhere? You also have to understand what customers say they want, and the things that they are actually going to evaluate on: the two may not be the same. And even if we want the nice things, we may not actually be able to afford them. reply whizzter 5 hours agorootparentprevThe question is, was it rock solid with few features? I don't know if it was this article I saw earlier but seeing how Salesforce has a lot of customizability and a Visual builder and maybe much of it was vaporware initially but maybe they simply scratched the right annoyances the customers had by providing features for that quickly enough. Seen some ERP's for mid-sized customers and the good ones makes it easy to build views and otherwise customize the software up to a point for non-engineers. The code is shit but they've also produced a lot of things needed internally that we wouldn't have gotten done quickly enough by doing it manually. https://retool.com/blog/salesforce-for-engineers reply duxup 4 hours agorootparentIIRC the start up was beaten out by volume of features, granted some didn't work on Salesforce, but people buy software based on features for sure. reply maxrecursion 3 hours agorootparentprevI've been seeing a product we use at my organization roll out incomplete/trash feature fast to have a product, and then fix them after the fact. We've gotten tons of blow back as other teams use the product and find it next to useless with tons of bugs, and I'm stuck trying to push it. Not a fun place to be. Learned a lot about the software market and capitalism though. reply wyager 2 hours agorootparentprev> We as people pick the winners with our money, we don't really want nice things. I do, and I reject being branded as part of \"we\" here; most people and orgs just have bad taste. (\"Taste\" at an organizational level obviously being an emergent property rather than literally the same as the homonymous trait in individuals.) reply MisterTea 3 hours agorootparentprev> We as people pick the winners with our money, we don't really want nice things. We? I was IT for a brief period and one day management says \"We need this Salesforce Outlook plugin deployed to all the front office users.\" No one bothered to tell us \"Hey, we're evaluating CRM software and would appreciate your technical opinion.\" So there's your \"we\" and I'm sure they weren't looking for quality engineering or rock solid code when deciding. In fact it was picked because the manager heard the name salesforce at some business conference and was told by someone there it was the best CRM out there so you better get on that train or be left in the dust. So we installed the plugins, got paid and moved on with life. And to be honest we didn't care either. reply hyperadvanced 4 hours agorootparentprevThis is exactly correct. See distinction between “best produced videos” and “best YOUTUBE” videos - it’s not about making the best video, it’s about making the one that minmaxes the metrics reply throwaway48476 2 hours agorootparentprevYoutube needs a metric to not promote low quality videos with low intentionality. No one searches for Mr beast videos with intent to watch them. The audience is primarily children who will watch whatever slop the algorithm puts in front of them. We need something like china where algorithms push quality educational content. reply forrestthewoods 1 hour agorootparent> The audience is primarily children Ask me how I know you didn’t read the handbook! Over 50% of the audience is >=25 reply montag 1 hour agorootparentprevMr. Beast is FAR from the most pathological content on YouTube. reply GTP 4 hours agorootparentprev> And this is why we can't have nice things. Indeed, and that's why OP wrote its list of counterpoints. In theory, a company can make a lot of money by creating products that are aligned with users' interests. Unfortunately, in today's world this is more difficult to do rather than taking advantage of users in some way. Still, if we don't oppose these practices there will never be a change, so it's worth fighting for our rights as users. reply kmacdough 6 minutes agorootparentprevWell a lot of these aren't counterpoints but rather examples of when companies naively followed KPIs to their own detriment. Boing has fallen from dominance to a distant second, Windows has been steadily losing dominance, Ford's darker years were around the Pinto fiasco. While Microsoft as a whole is still quite strong, Ford and Boeing lost significant market position and the losses are partially attributed to these very mistakes. reply throw0101a 4 hours agorootparentprev> Some counterpoints: The goal would be to be more customer-focused in those cases. \"No one prospers without rendering benefit to others.\" — Tadao Yoshida, founder of YKK zippers, https://ykkamericas.com/our-philosophy/ With MrBeast, the \"best YOUTUBE video\" would be one that causes engagement with the viewer throughout the video: > The creative process for every video they produce starts with the title and thumbnail. These set the expectations for the viewer, and everything that follows needs to be defined with those in mind. If a viewer feels their expectations are not being matched, they’ll click away - driving down the crucial Average View Duration that informs how much the video is promoted by YouTube’s all-important mystical algorithms. You have to both entice the viewer with the thumbnail/title, and meet the expectations of the viewer so they continue watching. Your counterexamples are a bunch of instances where the company did not meet customer expectations. reply daymanstep 3 hours agorootparent> \"No one prospers without rendering benefit to others.\" — Tadao Yoshida This quote describes how things should be, not how things actually are. reply CooCooCaCha 3 hours agorootparentprevI hate that so many people live by “wisdom” that falls apart at the slightest scrutiny… reply borroka 34 minutes agorootparentOur lives are made up of and guided by narratives that sound good and just on paper, but are empirically proven wrong time and time again. Yet they persist. Some come from the zeitgeist, others are eternal, biblical, and worse, unfalsifiable: \"everything happens for a reason,\" \"if you're meant to be together, you will be together,\" \"just do a good job and you'll get what you deserve\". The latter was voiced by my postdoc advisor, who did not take the time to look at the percentage of researchers who did good work but did not get a tenure-track position. But perhaps those who did not find jobs did not do good enough work, and the charade continues. reply someothherguyy 4 hours agorootparentprev> No one prospers without rendering benefit to others Plenty of counterexamples for this as well. Snake oil salesmen, drug dealers, woo peddlers, gurus, politicians, grifters, scammers, thieves, and on and on... reply ngneer 1 hour agorootparentprevI do not view these as counterpoints. You are making the same point, which is that the metric one optimizes for is extremely important. MrBeast is solely focused on maximizing revenue on the YouTube platform. The examples you cite also demonstrate the same exact metric (i.e., profit) in other domains. I know HP was in the habit of crippling its printers to extract more money, to add to your other examples. Out of curiosity, what's wrong with Intel? Are you referring to their selling more capable parts for more money? If so, that does not strike me as a shady practice to maximize profits. More like how the best fruit goes for export, where it can fetch the most return. reply willvarfar 6 hours agorootparentprevTheir definition of \"best copier possible\" was \"most-profitable copier possible\", meaning they had to balance getting people to not hate it so much they chose competitors, while not being so reliable it didn't need warrantees and services and parts etc? reply bayindirh 6 hours agorootparent> not being so reliable it didn't need warrantees[sic] and services and parts etc? The thing is, nothing is completely maintenance free, esp. if there's something mechanical. Make wearing parts wear, core parts robust. All my laser printers were Samsung/Xerox (hah), and their \"core\" is made like a tank. Only its rollers, toner and imaging/drum kits wear down, and these are already consumables. The device keeps track the life of every of these replaceable components, and you replace them you hit these marks, because they're already worn down to hinder reliable operation (Imager dies at 9K pages, rollers at 20K pages IIRC). You don't need to make things fail prematurely to make something profitable. First one of these printers didn't have replaceable rollers, so I had to donate it after 11 years of operation. This one is almost 8 years old IIRC, and it's still going strong. I'll be using it as long as I can find spares for it, because it's engineered \"correctly\", not \"for profit\". Meantime, its manufacturer can still profit from parts, toner and imaging units. reply willvarfar 6 hours agorootparentNot copiers, but the ice cream machines in mcdonalds resturants were kept unreliable because mcdonalds made money on the constant repairs. It didn't matter to them that the franchisee was losing money. When 3rd party companies jumped in to fix the machines the manufacturer and mcdonalds acted to stop that happening.

[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrDEtSlqJC4 reply flyingpenguin 4 hours agorootparentprevI think something that companies often miss is that improving the experience in an area where you have a monopoly can still increase profits by encouraging increased usage of that area. The example I always go to is U-Haul in the US. They have a functional monopoly on quickly getting a pickup truck or small box car. I used to tell people there was no need to own a pickup truck because I could go grab one for $30 once or twice a month when I needed it. After a year of shitty apps, constantly being sold things I didn't need because they try to secretly upsell you 50 times during checkout. Having to go into the store to get the keys and wait in line for 1 hour behind people screaming about how they were cheated... I bought a truck. U-Hual still has their monopoly, but they lost my business, not because I went to a competitor, but because I altered my life to no longer need their business. Maybe instead of buying eink tablets, I would have kept printing things had printers been better products. reply nothercastle 3 hours agorootparentU-haul is one of the shittiest experiences possible. Right there with calling comcast and going to the dmv. Compare that to truck rental from Lowe’s or Home Depot that’s actually probably more expensive but way more pleasant. Only problem is that everyone else also has figured that out so hard to secure one. reply singleshot_ 5 hours agorootparentprevWhy did you write sic after you quoted “warrantees”? reply bayindirh 5 hours agorootparentThe correct spelling is \"warranties\" (since singular y becomes i when it gets plural). [sic] means \"I copied the word as written in its original, and it was already written that way\" [0]. [0]: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sic reply willvarfar 5 hours agorootparentI probably meant warranties but warrantees works in the sentence just fine too :) reply bayindirh 5 hours agorootparentHey, as long as it's readable, I don't care. I just wanted to note that I quoted you verbatim, not judge you because you pressed letter \"e\" twice instead of once in an internet forum. :) reply michaelt 4 hours agorootparentIn my experience, people very rarely use [sic] when quoting on internet forums - readers will assume any quote was copied and pasted; and the quoted text is directly above yours. reply deaddodo 4 hours agorootparentprevThat's not a counterpoint, that's a list of examples of exactly what they're saying. They're not saying make the best product possible, they're saying make the product that sells the most despite quality. reply cwyers 1 hour agorootparentprevA good example here is Betamax. A lot of people lament that Betamax lost despite being better on a lot of measures: picture quality, etc. But what Betamax wasn't better at than VHS was runtime, and an early application of home VCRs was to time-shift NFL games, which ran longer than Betamax could record. It turns out that the end of NFL games is often the most important part, so people bought VHS instead of Betamax. So best is not some idealized thing, but depends a lot on what exactly you're measuring. But also... this isn't doing well for Boeing? It's costing the money? I don't think Boeing is a template for success. reply IanCal 6 hours agorootparentprevThose are problematic business goals, right? I think that's very different to aligning team goals to company goals. reply kogus 5 hours agorootparentprevYou are not wrong, but I'd suggest that in those cases the company prioritized short and medium term profit over the long term success of the company.

Pretty much every big company did and is doing unethical things, but for most people it doesn't matter because they're \"successful\". If you equate amounts of money with success, as our system does, then it is pretty much guaranteed that people will do unethical things to reach \"success\", i.e., X amounts of dollars. reply ljm 10 hours agorootparentprevI think the ethics are important when you're looking not just at Mr Beast's businesses themselves but also their internal culture, especially when squaring it up against the perception of himself he's created as some sort of squeaky clean philanthropic billionaire, particularly among his primarily young fans. Those big charity videos aren't done altruistically, they serve another purpose of deflecting criticism. You have the façade presented to the public, then the operations of the businesses he runs, then the culture built within them. If you ignore the ethics then you won't see that a significant part of his success is in his PR muscle, and how (young) people then expect that follows through to working for him or going on his show.

Mr Beast’s “youtube success hacking”, or whatever you want to call it, excels in the most obvious of ways: use hyperbole all of the time and use extreme and borderline misanthropic interpersonal interaction to achieve goals. I don’t think either of these activities would surprise anyone at achieving success in _some_ form, despite how manipulative and sociopathic they are. What exactly is to be learned here? Where is the deep understanding? People click on things that are hyperbolic. When people are threatened with losing their jobs unless they perform at an extremely high level, they will work to the best of their ability to achieve that level, at the expense of practically everything else they value in their lives. None of this is new or novel. Most people avoid employing these structures because they’re viciously misanthropic and cynical. Some, of course, do, but I don’t see us using that information to ignore them or prevent them from existing. I just see them lauded for “thinking outside the box” on Hacker News. reply tpmoney 6 hours agorootparentWhat’s interesting about this conversation is the different perspectives on the material, not necessarily the material itself. Nothing I read in the document reads like “use hyperbole all the time” or “extreme and borderline misanthropic interpersonal interaction”. Instead most of it reads like the sort of things you’d expect to see in any high paced, high competition industry, just written for the sort of people that grew up in and would work at a YouTube company vs folks that grew up in and would work for a major manufacturer. Every company, whether explicitly said or not distinguishes between employees who are excited to be there and excited to be working on the company goals and the ones who are just there to punch a clock. And at every company the clock punchers have always been held in lower regard than the excited employees. We can worry about how that tendency can lead to worker exploitation (see also the game development industry), but the reality is any time you get a group of people together, the folks who have a vision and a mission are going to be more drawn to and get along better with the people who share a passion for that vision and mission. reply dclowd9901 12 hours agorootparentprevLet me ask that question a different way: let’s say what you learn had no value or it was something that was already pretty well understood (such as the fact that people click misleading or hyperbolic links).

(Personally, I can see the encouragement angle; disagree with legitimization.) - There's often a side thread going on about how the atrocities and those who committed them were not Up To Scientific Standards, therefore all their data is invalid, so there's no reason to use it anyway.

Most of the high prices come from further up the supply chain, or other parts of the local economies like rent, utilities, transportation, and labor. Obviously some stores are better than others, but if some company is just milking people in any given grocery market, competitors will show up in a second to take their customers away. Even in food deserts served only by expensive bodegas and the like— selling fresh food at low volumes is fucking expensive because of how much waste you have, and beyond that, your street corner retail space is a whole lot more expensive per food item than a grocery store on the edge of town. reply hsbauauvhabzb 8 hours agorootparentAustralia has two major grocery chains who stockpile vacant land to remain monopolistic.

One may take advantage of a few people and is probably not extremely biased towards the most vulnerable, (e.g. the participants are probably not homeless), the other is taking advantage of everyone, homelessness is surging in aus atm.

I was responding to the statement you made. Selling a product cheaper than your competitors, even if you're using unfair leverage to do it is not by any measure 'gouging.' In the US, discount stores are most likely to play the \"strategically let this useful land moulder in a densely populated area during a housing crisis\" game but they're definitely not price gouging.

Then those movies/shows don't do so well, so they lower the budget of the next one, and it devolves into what it is now. reply bulbosaur123 7 hours agorootparentprevWhat's wrong with being shady? Morals are a meme reply hnbad 11 hours agorootparentprevMarvel films, which (like much of big budget Hollywood at this point sadly) at this point are infamous for their exploitation of cheap unorganized effects artists, are probably a bad example for something being \"not shady\". HN actually discourages high engagement by having the front page items change fairly slowly (rather than algorithmically customizing them to each user), not making scrolling beyond that (i.e. pagination and the \"latest\" feed) any less awkward to navigate than it has been forever and actively preventing you from commenting too much within a given timeframe (which it doesn't actively disclose when you hit the limit). That's probably a bad example for something being \"shady\". reply xupybd 13 hours agorootparentprevThis is not comparable reply thisisabore 9 hours agorootparentprevNo but bro, listen bro, he does numbers. reply simonw 21 hours agoparentprevI’m with you on the management vibes - it doesn’t sound like a culture that I’d enjoy. That’s one of the things I find so interesting about this document: it does feel very honest and unfiltered, and as such it appears to be quite an accurate insight into their culture. And that’s a culture that works if you want to create massive successful viral YouTube videos targeting their audience. How much has that specific chosen culture contributed to their enormous success in that market? There’s no way to know that, but my hunch is it contributed quite a bit. reply tpmoney 19 hours agorootparentWhat I find interesting in reading this is that it's not particularly surprising in content. And I don't mean that I expected some hugely toxic culture from a youtube company and found it. I mean that the whole document is largely pretty standard \"how to make it in a competitive industry\" advice. The tone might be a little unprofessional for folks who are used to big corporate talk, but if you'd leaked internal Microsoft or Google documents to a bunch of long time IBM folks they would have thought the same things I'm sure. The tone might be different, but most of the points seem identical to stuff anyone should be familiar with. \"Follow up when you ask someone for something\", \"Don't commit to giving X if you can't actually get X\", \"Have a backup plan\", \"Try to turn a failure into something useful\", \"Own your mistakes\", \"Make sure you've exhausted all the avenues for something before you decide it's impossible\", \"Do the hard work early so you're not cramming it all in at the end\", \"You are the subject matter expert on your specific project, assume everyone else doesn't know anything\". Even the \"A,B,C\" employee thing is pretty standard stuff folks know intuitively. Fast food is garbage no matter where you go, yet somehow Chick Fil A has lines around the block at lunch time and if there's 3 cars in a Wendy's drive through, you'll go somewhere else. Why? Because Chick Fil A really tries to not have \"C\" employees (relative to fast food employees in general), and it shows in the customer experience. Two fast food places can have the same quality of food, and the one with the drive through attendant that acknowledges people and responds to phatic phrases, and marks the diet soda cup is going to have more traffic and customer satisfaction than the one where the attendant barely acknowledges you've arrived at the window and leaves you to figure out which was the diet coke when you get home. reply bnralt 9 hours agorootparentThat's the same impression I got. It's odd seeing the discussion veer off into morality, because most of it seems to be standard and non-problematic advice (IE, understanding what your product is and don't get distracted by focusing on what it's not). And though the advice isn't particularly novel, it was worth reading since a surprisingly large amount of people don't do these simple things. reply safety1st 5 hours agorootparentI read the entire PDF and I felt he was pretty spot on about works and what doesn't in running a business. This is Hacker News, ostensibly created as a website for hackers and founders. If you are a hacker and a founder then a ton of this advice is spot on. For example it's a simple concept but he absolutely nails a key factor by distinguishing between A, B and C employees. A high performing team really can't have more than one or two C's. It moves them out even if they're nice, cool, good people. If the team is run by good humans it does what Mr. Beast does and gives them severance. I can smell a couple C employees fuming on here and in the Twitter thread. I've had C employees",

Within that, the number of people who would be deeply affected is 5 (kids, spouse, parents). Aside from them, the number of people who would think \"wow, weird\" on hearing of my death is maybe a couple dozen, and the number within that who would think of me for >20 seconds more than a year from my death is probably less than half dozen. It doesn't bother me that these numbers are \"small.\" reply passion__desire 6 hours agorootparentWe have limited familial / personal attention and care to give to others.

I can't say I'd be too disappointed though, being missed by a handful of friends and family would already signal a life well lived. I will miss Dan's comments, and this community was better for his participation. reply vasco 5 hours agoparentprevI'm sure it brings Alexander the Great a lot of comfort knowing he is remembered. I say, enjoy life without optimizing for what happens after you're dead. reply sim7c00 4 hours agorootparentThough a little cold, you are correct. \"fear is the mind killer\", and fear of death or not being remembered is ultimately not a positive thing to hold on to whilst being alive. With respect to DanBC, whom I did not have the pleasure of knowing very well, I am happy for him that he seems to be celebrated and loved widely - a clear sign of a good person (regardless of how valuable that ultimately might or might not be in the minds of outside observers like myself) who had a positive impact of those he touched throughout his life. I wish all people who knew him all the best in processing this surely tough to swallow pill. Despite someone having a long-term illness, if you care a lot for someone, it is always seemingly unexpected for it to end. Dealing with a passing of a friend is always difficult, and I hope anyone who misses him, has people to share with good memories of him to process and deal with this in a good way.

To be clear, I'm not implying that you weren't those things, just making a personal observation. reply xupybd 20 hours agoprevI hate and fear cancer so much. Why does it seem like so many are dying of cancer :( reply tacon 19 hours agoparentOn some podcast a longevity doctor asked the host to estimate how much longer the average person would live if we eliminated/cured cancer. The answer was about three years. Eliminate heart disease? Another three years. Eliminate both? About five years. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori reply A_D_E_P_T 18 hours agorootparentWas this a well-corroborated and fact-based opinion, or was it off-the-cuff and handwavey? Podcast answers aren't always totally reliable. But you mention \"the average person,\" which is really the crux of the matter. Cancer strikes perfectly average people, oftentimes in their 30s or 40s, and hands down death sentences at random. A bad roll of the dice. A stray cosmic ray hit a dividing cell. Who knows? That is what is scary. Eliminating cancer may perhaps only increase the average lifespan by three years -- though I have my doubts -- but what's much more important is that it would cut down tremendously the number of premature and random-seeming deaths in the prime of life. reply Theodores 15 hours agorootparentThe thing is that we are led to believe that cancer just strikes at random, and anecdotally we know of someone that never smoked to get lung cancer that spread everywhere to strike them dead. Yet we also know it is not quite like that. If you smoke, drink, make sculptures out of asbestos dust, eat processed meats, shoot depleted uranium rounds down at the range and work with radium in a gun sight factory then you probably have stacked the odds. Now imagine you have an identical twin, maybe not cojoined, but living with the exact same stacked odds. However, you eat a strict diet of highly processed foods and only play tiddlywinks for physical activity. Meanwhile, your twin rides eats a strict diet that is mostly whole food, plant based and gets a lot of physical activity due to a passion for dancing. One of you is going to be likely to suffer a cardiovascular event before the other and that same person is going to run the risk of catching cancer first. Now we all know that eating processed foods, maybe with the exception of processed meat, isn't going to 'give you cancer' and neither is playing tiddlywinks. Equally, a few extra antioxidants and a bit of fibre from eating a few more carrots isn't going to spare you from cancer, neither is dancing for that matter. Nonetheless, cardiovascular and gut health is important for reducing cancer risks. I say this with anecdotal evidence provided by a car dependent relative that chose not to eat a fibre rich diet and now has cancers that I would not wish on anyone, with his digestive tract having to be trimmed from the far end due to cancer. Because he took the medical route with meaty pies and moderate alcohol levels, his life might only be cut short by three years. However, by then, there will be two decades of extreme medical interventions and a smorgasbord of medications that have to be taken daily. Lifespan is not as important as healthspan and there is much we can do through diet and physical activity to maximise healthspan. The trouble with my relative is that advice to go absolutely teetotal, stay off the processed meats and to eat fibre (as in vegetables) was not a message that was well received. This advice is in line with WHO recommendations but this can be simply ignored once lifestyle choices have been decided on. reply michh 3 hours agorootparentThis is getting scarily close to “most people who get cancer only have themselves to blame” which can be a comforting thought if you’re putting in a lot of effort to reduce your own risk of cancer but at the end of the day it’s not true and kind of a shitty thing to say when we’re commemorating someone who fell victim to this horrible disease. Reduce the odds it’ll get you too as much as you want, you’re wise to do so, but keep in mind it can still get you too and it is never somebody’s own fault. More importantly, you can (almost) never say that if a cancer patient had done this and that or not done such and so they wouldn’t have gotten sick. You just can’t know and even if you did it’d still be a shit thing to say. reply A_D_E_P_T 9 hours agorootparentprev> Yet we also know it is not quite like that. Oh, come on. Even if you're correct and cancer is not completely random but rather has clear causative factors, a lot of those factors -- perhaps the majority -- are uncontrollable. Radon exposure. Naturally occurring radioactive isotopes or beryllium in your vegetables or water. That virus you fought off a few years ago. That course of cyclosporine you once took. That cosmic ray from the Andromeda galaxy that happened to hit you and scramble some DNA. Many, many other factors. Cancer strikes in ways that seem truly random because many or most of its causative factors have absolutely nothing to do with lifestyle choices. reply freedomben 5 hours agorootparentExactly. There are definitely people who lead higher risk lives by having exposure to carcinogens, but even that has some randomness to it. I had a family friend that smoked like a chimney his entire life, and died in his late '80s with tar-filled but cancer-free lungs. Another was an x-ray tech in the earlier days before they took nearly as many precautions as they do now to protect the technicians. No cancer. Contrast this with some aunts and uncles who lived relatively clean lives, and still ended up dying of different cancers. Sure, I don't doubt there is a cause if we dig deep into it, but there's still some randomness. reply Theodores 31 minutes agorootparentprevI hear what you are saying, however, the vast majority of toxins that enter our bodies come through our mouths and out of choice. Some of these toxins, such as alcohol, cigarettes or processed meats are known to be carcinogens. There is a very different level of dosage involved, that one cosmic ray from outer space that one time is vastly outnumbered by the trillions upon trillions of atoms that could be carcinogenic that come through the mouth, typically on a daily basis, for decades. The body is pretty good at taking out the trash, including the mutant cells that did not reproduce properly. This goes on all the time. One cosmic ray from outer space might scramble some DNA but your body can deal with that as an isolated incident, the mutated cell(s) just get taken out with the trash. If you overwhelm this system with too much garbage for the body to deal with then that is a causative factor that was not controlled. It is helpful to see things this way because it enables a sense of perspective. It is not going to be 'forever chemicals', 'insecticides' or anything like that, you need to worry about. What goes in the mouth rather is what counts rather than these theoretical other things. This means taking seriously what research in cancer, diabetes and other disease has to say. For cancer there is clear advice on what to avoid, same with diabetes and much else nobody would wish on anyone. It is defeatist to be in denial about this to assume that random cosmic rays play as much a part as the garbage we willingly consume when it comes down to it. reply commodoreboxer 3 hours agorootparentprevEh, it's still a numbers game. Changing your chances of contracting terminal cancer in the next 5 years from 1% to 0.5% is still significant. In this case, the specific percentages are all the significance. When a lot of the factors are controllable and a lot of them are uncontrollable, the most reasonable question is \"How much do the controllable factors actually change the odds?\" reply A_D_E_P_T 2 hours agorootparent> Changing your chances of contracting terminal cancer in the next 5 years from 1% to 0.5% is still significant. Short of quitting smoking, there's almost no way to do that, because you don't know what the factors are or how they're weighed & influenced by individual genetic, immune, and metabolic factors. > \"How much do the controllable factors actually change the odds?\" Not only does nobody know, nobody has the foggiest notion. I've never seen a relevant population-wide observational study that wasn't so full of methodological flaws that you could spend hours picking apart its defects. Of course we know that there's a set of factors associated with the development of cancer -- like, e.g., long-term exposure to polonium in drinking water -- but there's also a large set of factors that nobody is aware of or which can never be controlled for. To use only the first set -- the set of what we know and can control for -- to accurately estimate the odds of contracting cancer within the next five years is impossible. reply melling 18 hours agorootparentprevMaybe looking at the average is the wrong thing to do. People who die from cancer can be robbed of a lot of years. A couple of other recent cancer deaths I saw on HN: Walter Ehmer died at 58 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41490388 Jake Seliger was also known on HN died around 40: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41201555 reply w3gS34k354K7978 16 hours agorootparentprevI find those estimates believable in a narrow interpretation of the question - i.e. if we solve cancer but change nothing else. I would expect a longevity M.D. to understand the spirit of the question and answer accordingly, though. I'm curious which podcast / doc this was? It's true that solving cancer, heart disease, and even all other similarly deadly diseases, would not automatically mean humans living indefinitely, because there's still cellular senescence to contend with. Fortunately, we've effectively solved senescence (or at least it seems we're well on our way). Check out the picture of the twin mice from David Sinclair's lab (https://sinclair.hms.harvard.edu/research) - it's hard to believe the two mice were born at the same time... And if I recall correctly, they didn't even do any sort of telomere modification in that study either... Don't quote me on that. But telomeres are another potent avenue towards >10x extension of life span, and also as it turns out, fairly trivial to lengthen and thereby allow a cell to continue mitosis indefinitely. The problem to solve is cancer, though. Telomeres limit the number of times a cell can divide by design, and seemingly the purpose of limiting division in the first place is to mitigate risk of developing cancers. reply Panzer04 16 hours agorootparentprevThis sounds surprisingly short. Surely the average person with cancer isnt going to live just three additional years? Went and did a brief lookup (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6710558/) - life expectancy is reduced by at least 3 years, even for the oldest patients, and increases significantly as age at diagnosis goes down. I suppose from the perspective of an 80 year old, curing cancer would in theory increase life expectancies by ~ 3 years, though I wonder how many people die of \"old age\" but have an undiagnosed cancer of some form contributing. reply pcwalton 14 hours agorootparentIt's because of the Gompertz mortality law [1]--the probability of dying at a certain age is exponential. If you assume that the mortality of each age-related terminal illness itself follows the Gompertz law, then eliminating any one of those illnesses won't affect the overall life expectancy much, because exponential growth is so powerful. Even if we had cures for all age-related diseases except, say, Alzheimer's disease, the fact that Alzheimer's disease mortality also follows the Gompertz law (probably a reasonable assumption) would lead to lifespans not dissimilar from our present ones. Essentially, in order to achieve dramatically longer lifespans, we would need to eliminate, or at least significantly slow, all aging-related causes of death. [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz%E2%80%93Makeham_law_o... reply petercooper 6 hours agorootparentprevMy total guess(!) is because relatively few people lose a large number of years to cancer, due to both the median age of diagnosis and long term survival rates of some common cancers being high? (For example, breast cancer has a 75% 10 year survival rate with a median age of diagnosis of 62. Bowel cancer is about 60% and 71 respectively.) reply The_Colonel 10 hours agorootparentprevKeeping the body alive is a low bar. Lost quality-adjusted life years would be a better measure. Many people survive for many years with cancer, but the quality of life drops significantly. reply pessimizer 15 hours agorootparentprevMost people don't have cancer, so the average lifespan reduction of everyone is going to be quite a bit lower than the average lifespan reduction of people diagnosed with cancer. reply adamredwoods 13 hours agorootparentprevThree years would be an amazing amount of precious time with a loved one. I know this. reply shepherdjerred 17 hours agorootparentprevThis reminds me of a video I saw on HN yesterday: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkWS4t4l0k reply zelphirkalt 19 hours agoparentprevBecause if nothing else gets you, cancer risk rises as you get older. At some point it gets you, I guess. reply viraptor 19 hours agorootparentYes, a few types are basically a numbers game. We're continuously successfully not getting them every day. But the longer we live and not die of other things, the higher chance there is of losing that game. And we're actually getting quite good and not dying of other things. Then again, cancer treatments and vaccines are progressing recently, so that's good news. reply freedomben 5 hours agorootparentI don't think prolonging the life in a biological body is going to be the winning route. We will have to Star Trek it up and transfer our consciousness to computers. That, or replace parts, maybe even the entirety of our bodies with a machine that can be maintained and repaired rather than age. reply guerrilla 19 hours agorootparentprevThis sounds good, but it can't be right. There are animals that live centuries. Greenland sharks may live up to 500 years, for example. There are trees that live millenia. reply viraptor 19 hours agorootparentTurns out they have lower mutation rate which helps them. Their chances are much lower, but still not zero. https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/sharks-cancer-secret-al... reply thfuran 18 hours agorootparentprevBut they aren't human. We don't survive being dessicated and heavily irradiated like a tardigrade or regrow severed limbs like starfish, and we aren't as good at avoiding cancer as some other animals. reply cogman10 17 hours agorootparentAnd some animals are worse. Dogs, for example, are most likely to die from cancer. They also get cataracts decades earlier than humans do. reply guerrilla 5 hours agorootparentprevYou're supporting my point. The reason we suffer from this is not solely probabilistic. There are many other factors. reply kragen 18 hours agorootparentprevbeing warmblooded is a huge disadvantage for longevity reply AlphaCharlie 18 hours agorootparentCan you expand on that subject? What are the traits of warm blooded species that lead to higher cancer rates? reply kragen 17 hours agorootparentnot just higher cancer rates, but higher rates of all kinds of aging-related deaths the advantage of being warm-blooded is that your metabolism is more precise and much faster, but, as james dean quoted willard motley saying, 'live fast, die young' most of the causes of aging are unwanted chemical reactions; https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0092-8674%2813%2900... is a highly-cited paper reviewing what we knew about the causes of aging 11 years ago. chemical reactions of all kinds follow the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhenius_equation which makes them happen about 2–3 times faster per 10° temperature rise (being old is a more important risk factor for cancer than anything else i can think of, even smoking and radioactive fallout) small sharks around greenland, to take an extreme example, are at essentially the temperature of the seawater, about -1.8°. larger sharks could conceivably raise their internal body temperature, but greenland sharks swim very slowly to avoid this even when they are large. so their metabolism is about 16× slower than yours is—both healing and aging processes happen slower. their gestational period is about 8–18 years reply guerrilla 5 hours agorootparentThank you. This is the kind of thing I was looking for. After posting, I also found out that plants are even further in the other direction because their strong cell walls prevent metasticization. reply kragen 1 hour agorootparenthappy to help! another weird thing is how rare cancers of the skeletal muscles are reply guerrilla 1 hour agorootparentThat is interesting. I'm currently obsessed with exercise physiology. I might look into that. reply pfdietz 17 hours agorootparentprevProbably constant generation of reactive oxidizing chemicals from the higher metabolism needed to maintain body temperature. reply jmcgough 14 hours agoparentprevYou become a lot more aware of it as you get older, and what you see to some degree depends a lot on your socioeconomic status. A big part of it is that we've made so much progress when it comes to heart disease. Most people who go to my hospital are on public insurance, and they're dying more frequently from lifestyle-related diseases (like T2DM which leads to hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure) https://www.clubvita.net/us/news-and-insights/top-charts-23-... reply danielvf 19 hours agoparentprevCancer (outside behavior related cancer like lung cancer) is on the rise. In spite of better treatments, a twenty year old today is more likely from cancer while in their twenties than at any time before. Each younger age cohort has an increase risk of cancer, and at younger ages. Cancer deaths overall are still going down though, as the smoking generation still alive goes out. reply kragen 19 hours agoparentprevprobably because it's the first, second, or third leading cause of death in every country, depending on how you slice it up, killing about a quarter of everyone reply layer8 19 hours agoparentprevTo be a little more precise, roughly 1 in 6 deaths are due to cancer. It’s the second leading cause after heart diseases, which are 1 in 3. reply photochemsyn 18 hours agoparentprevThe problem of controlled cellular growth in a multicellular organism is a really hard problem that evolution has spent billions of generations on, and any cell in any of the dozens of systems that keeps the human body going can potentially escape the normal cell cycle control process and go out of control, leading to cancer. (edit: the fact that so many people lead full lives without coming down with cancer is more remarkable from this view, it's one of the miracles of life). While the ability to treat cancer using modern technology (especially if it is detected relatively early) has made vast advances, we're also surrounded by and exposed to a wide variety of molecules that can, especially in high concentrations, inflict damage on the cellular control system (a whole lot of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, cofactors, etc.) and while that damage may be somewhat random in nature, if it happens to hit a key sequence in the cell control DNA you get a cancer cell. You can greatly reduce the prevalance of such carcinogenic mutagens in the food, air, water and soil with suitable regulations but this cuts into profit margins for the producers of various commodities and products who in turn lobby governments to eliminate said regulations (which to be fair may not have been well-designed or implemented). Yes there are genetic factors which may increase one's cancer risk but these are very complicated and often overemphasized by those who dont't want to see clean air, water, soil, food etc. regulations implemented. reply rlpb 18 hours agorootparent> ...a really hard problem that evolution has spent billions of generations on... I think it's worth noting that this isn't evolution's \"goal\". We just need to produce offspring and give them a good start in life such that they are competitively successful. Beyond that, evolution doesn't care. Even for that, there's a budget. If it's not economical over letting us die and not taking valuable resources from our offspring, then evolution also doesn't care. reply tjpnz 5 hours agorootparentHaving grandparents around to care for the young would allow for more procreation. reply rlpb 5 hours agorootparentYes, but only to a limit. The resource cost in ensuring longevity must be less than the benefit provided in caring for the young. reply photochemsyn 18 hours agorootparentprevThat could suggest why longevity in humans (or primates ) was under active selection, as they put a lot of effort into raising the children so you'd expect that cancer in younger people would result in the death of their children, so evolution selects for robust anti-cancer systems (like the human immune system, which is relatively good at detecting and eliminating cancer cells as well as pathogenic bacteria, etc.). These explanations are however always a bit hand-wavy, eg why do galapagos tortoises live to 150 when they don't seem to do much parental investment? reply rlpb 10 hours agorootparentThere must be other evolutionary pressures that change cancer resistance as a side effect. reply j33zusjuice 17 hours agoparentprevBecause they are. reply SV_BubbleTime 19 hours agoparentprevI have two people in my direct circle get and have stage4 lymphoma and adult leukemia this year at the time of their initial diagnosis. Does seem like it is on the rise from my perspective. reply Yawrehto 6 hours agoparentprevTL;DR: Because today, people are regularly living long enough to get it. It's often a good sign to have higher cancer rates -- societies with higher cancer rates are richer, happier, and live longer than those with lower cancer rates. I mean, cancer is bad. But it's a good sign for society if lots of people die of cancer -- they tend to hit the elderly. Historically, about 80 percent of people who die of cancer are over 50, and that's fairly constant. (Interestingly, the share of cancer deaths that are in people over 70 have been rising, from about 36 percent to 49 percent - that's as a portion of the total.)[1] The ranking for prevalence of cancer is higher income countries, upper-middle-income countries, lower-middle-income countries, and finally with the lowest rates low-income countries. Since the world is getting richer, it stands to reason that it's likely there will be higher cancer rates (of course, it's not guaranteed; it's possible being European makes you more likely to get cancer, which would explain the higher rankings of high-income countries, which are often European, but not lead to higher numbers elsewhere).[2] This is borne out individually. Countries with the lowest rates of cancer tend not to be great places to live. Our World In Data has three countries[2] tied for the lowest cancer rates (0.1 percent), Niger, Chad and Benin, which have life expectancies of 62, 53, and 60[3][4] and had happiness scores (self-reported life satisfaction) of 4.56, 4.47, and 4.38 (out of 10; for reference, the world average is 5.27, with numbers for individual countries ranging from 7.74 to 1.72) respectively.[5] The full list of countries with a prevalence of cancer below 0.5 percent is as follows: Niger, Chad, Benin, Gambia, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Mali, Yemen, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Liberia, Angola, Guinea, Cameroon Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria, East Timor, Tajikistan, Mozambique, Senegal, Togo, Papua New Guinea, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Oman, Sudan, Nepal, Kenya, Mauritania, Maldives, Bhutan, South Sudan, Ghana, Vanuatu, Equatorial Guinea, Bangladesh, Tanzania, Solomon Islands, Sao Tome and Principe, Eritrea, Malawi, Rwanda, Laos, India, Uganda, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Djibouti, Congo, Botswana, Zambia, Kiribati, Lesotho, Algeria, Gabon, Mongolia, Eswatini, Morocco, Comoros, Honduras, Haiti, Samoa, Zimbabwe, Guatemala, Turkmenistan, Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan, Marshall Islands, Namibia, Philippines, Egypt, Cambodia, Indonesia[2] The happiest of those is Guatemala, at 6.29, and a prevalence of 0.4 percent. But most of them are much less happy. To take a random example (I used random.org to randomize the list and chose the top one and the top six, excluding Sao Tome which had no happiness data), Uganda is at 4.37, and the average of Uganda, Comoros, Turkmenistan, Yemen, and Bhutan is 4.41, nearly a point below the world average. Life expectancy is no better; again doing Uganda, Comoros, Turkmenistan, Yemen, and Bhutan, Uganda had a life expectancy of 62.7 years, and the average of them is 66.2, almost 5 years below the world average of 71 (range of typical life expectancy is from 85.9 to 52.5). Okay, so life expectancy and happiness are both lower for countries with lower rates of cancer, seemingly. What about those with higher rates? Well, those with cancer rates up to or including 3 percent are as follows: Monaco, Bermuda, Italy, France, Netherlands, Finland, Germany, United States, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Denmark, Portugal, Greece, Croatia, Spain, Estonia, Canada, Norway, Andorra, United Kingdom, Slovenia, Belgium, Iceland, Switzerland. Monaco comes in at the top, with 5.9 percent with some type of cancer. Monaco has a life expectancy of 85.9 years, the highest. In the world. There was no happiness data available for it or the runner-up Bermuda, but Italy ranked itself at 6.32. Of the top five countries in life expectancy that show up on the cancer list at all (Monaco, not Hong Kong or Macao, Japan, Australia, Switzerland, Malta), all of them but Malta show up on the list, and Malta just misses the cutoff (2.9 percent). In happiness (Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, Israel), Sweden and Israel aren't ranked. Sweden just misses the cutoff at 2.9 and Israel is at 1.6 percent but has a notably much younger population than any of the others. Again using random.org and taking the top one and then the follow-up four, Monaco came in at number one (data already covered and missing happiness, so excluded), followed by the US, Switzerland, Iceland, Australia, and Italy. The US has a life expectancy of 77.2 years. The average for the five is 82.26, so if it were a country it would be number 21 globally and over TEN YEARS above the world average of 71, above even the Oceanian average (the highest) of 79.4; for happiness, the US is number 18 worldwide excluding ties, ranking itself at 6.72; the average is 6.938, meaning if it were a country it would come in number fourteen including ties and almost two points above the world average of 5.08.

    "originBody": "By Péter Szász in Wartime — Sep 5, 2024 How to Lead Your Team when the House Is on Fire William Sadler the Younger: The Burning of the Arcade in College Green, Dublin (1837) The tech industry is going through challenging times: from one side, funding dried up due to the end of the Zero Interest-Rate Period; on the other one, the rapid rise of AI disrupts previously safe domains and business models. These forces are pushing companies to \"wartime\" mode, a concept I first read about in the works of David B. Black, some of which were published in \"Wartime Software: Building Software when Speed Matters\"; or the Peacetime CEO / Wartime CEO article from Ben Horowitz, similarly from more than a decade ago. These works describe \"wartime\" as an existential fight for survival that requires a different type of leadership compared to the relative prosperity of \"peacetime\". Many of the principles outlined by both Horowitz and Black are as relevant as ever for Engineering Managers leading in today's climate. For EMs, wartime means leading low-morale teams through ambiguity, hard constraints, frequently changing goals, and intense pressure to perform. It can feel like working in a house on fire. What can an EM do in this situation? Let's get back to the basics, and look at the role of an Engineering Manager first. The three focus areas of an Engineering Manager Ensuring delivery that's aligned with company goals; Building and sustaining a high-performing engineering team; Supporting the success and personal growth of the individuals on the team. Wartime doesn't change these fundamentals, but it does require some shifts in approach and priorities. Let's go through them by focus areas. Focus Area 1: Ensuring Goal-Aligned Delivery In wartime, you need your team laser-focused on shipping what matters most, now. Your organization might not have the luxury of years of runway, and the environment you're operating in is rapidly changing. A few key things to get right: Ruthless prioritization is essential. Narrow the team's attention to the top few goals that are critical for the company's survival and success. Communicate these repeatedly and reinforce them through your own behavior. Be ready to say no and drop anything that doesn't directly contribute. It's hard because you'll also need to say \"no\" to genuinely valuable, profitable things, projects you were planning to work on, just to be able to deliver the ones that are the most impactful now. Mentally you might find it easier to categorize these projects as \"not now\". Next, you need to empower the team to move fast. Decentralize decision-making authority as much as possible. Remove barriers in their way, slash approval layers, attack dependencies. \"Perfection is the enemy of done\" and \"Better to ask for forgiveness than permission\" are good guidance. To enable quick decisions, ensure you are frequently and clearly giving high-level context to the team, so they are aligned on company objectives. Set up a clear process for them to rapidly get input on critical choices and transparently communicate the decision to keep everyone aligned. Bias heavily toward action - it's better to decide and be wrong sometimes than to paralyze the team with analysis. Protect the team's focus time. The chaos and uncertainties of wartime can be incredibly distracting. Set up processes to shield the team from constant interruptions so they can have deep, creative work sessions. Remove them from low-value meetings and relieve them from monotonous administrative duties. One effective technique is to establish a rotating \"firefighter\" role to singlehandedly deal with any incoming requests, represent the team in meetings, and handle the necessary amount of bureaucracy, allowing the rest to stay heads-down on the critical priorities. Another option is to get in the trenches with your team. If you're a hands-on manager, wartime is when you can put some effort into technical tasks. Stay closely involved to understand the technical context, and help out where it makes sense. This can mean doing some code reviews, participating in pair programming, handling an incident, and even pushing small commits if that's what's needed. Make sure you're not taking the spotlight from your team members, and know that your impact in management areas can be magnitudes bigger than a small code cleanup. It's important to note that these wartime actions will probably increase tech debt in your code. With the emphasis on velocity over quality, architectural compromises and maintenance shortcuts are often taken. To mitigate this, consider techniques like: Keeping a visible, prioritized backlog of tech debt items to revisit later Allocating a small percentage of each sprint to debt paydown Pairing tech debt work with feature development Conducting regular architecture reviews to spot and address emerging issues Encouraging engineers to flag risky shortcuts during code reviews You have more chance to succeed if your tech debt strategy is backward-looking, refactoring parts of the code that are causing concrete pain for developers today – as opposed to forward-looking, dreaming up grandiose plans for new frameworks that will be ready for any unknown challenge of the future. (Recognise that these challenges are unknown by definition, so your solution for them will be a hit-and-miss.) The risk of overengineering is real and can cripple developer performance significantly in a wartime era. Focus Area 2: Building and Leading the Team Retaining To keep your team engaged and performing at their peak, don't neglect morale and energy. Celebrate quick wins, show frequent appreciation, praise the behavior you want to see. Acknowledge that the situation is tough, but project confidence that you'll get through it together. One major pitfall to avoid is letting an \"us vs. them\" mentality take hold on the team. Naturally, the stress of painful decisions can erode trust in leadership and other departments, but reinforcing a negative mindset will hurt you more than the temporary warm camaraderie you'll enjoy by joining the chorus of cynics. Don't dismiss or avoid the negative reactions, in fact, you should actively solicit concerns and input rather than waiting for issues to erupt. You cannot choose if people will discuss stressful events, but you can choose to be a part of these discussions or not. So never skip your one-on-one meetings, hold ad-hoc Q&As, and maintain these as a safe, open forum for any topics. Share the \"why\" behind difficult decisions, even if you can't always explain all the details – and acknowledge what you don't know transparently. Assume good intent and extend empathy, even when tension is running high. (I write more about this and related topics in How To Represent Decisions You Disagree With.) Focus on the positive aspects of the job that can be taken for granted, like the opportunity to work on cutting-edge challenges, the company's still existing perks and benefits, the amazing team you have, the chance to work with a modern tech stack, or how your product is helping its users. Showing your team how you appreciate what's still good can help with morale. At the same time, accept that you won't be able to retain everyone through a stressful wartime period. If someone does decide to leave, support their decision and work to make the transition as smooth as possible for them and the remainder of the team. Hiring Yes, there is still hiring in wartime, though more limited than during the growth-heavy periods of peace. If for no other reason, you might need to backfill folks due to the increased attrition. When you receive a new headcount, you need to prioritize hiring experienced, self-sufficient, autonomous engineers who can tolerate (even better, strive) in high-stress environments and are experienced enough to contribute immediately. Tighten onboarding to the bare essentials and focus on deploying code fast. You don't have months to train, the company might not exist long enough to get back the investment in juniors if you focus on the long term now. Fortunately for you, the current job market is full of experienced developers due to mass layoffs. However, expectations are still high (especially around compensation and remote work), and AI companies are paying above market rate to the best talent. These, and the massive work necessary to go through sometimes hundreds of applications make your work harder, so you need to get creative and proactive to attract great candidates. Some ideas: Leverage your network for referrals and backdoor references; Emphasize anything that makes your company unique: its mission, product, tech stack, learning opportunities, compensation policies, hybrid friendliness, etc. Maybe someone out there is looking for the same exact criteria. Partner closely with recruiters or the talent acquisition team to increase the quality of the first-level filtering, and to refine and expedite the hiring process; Move quickly and decisively when you find a strong fit, to minimize the distraction of hiring on you and the team – but due to the current job market you have more luxury now than a few years ago. Consider allowing 2-3 candidates to pass through all rounds, and choose the best fit from them. Still, don't let this grow into indecisiveness, and don't drag the team into a long period of interviewing. Performance Management Wartime pressure can breed negativity that you'll need to manage carefully. Understand the context that may be contributing, like uncertainty around job security or maybe some additional personal issues. However, infectious negativity and lack of engagement are performance issues, so handle them accordingly: give clear feedback on actions and their impact, separate from any judgment of the individual. Avoid public confrontation, but set firm expectations. Try to redirect negative energy productively by reframing complaints into problems to solve. (I write more about this topic in How to Deal with Negative Behavior.) Crucially, hold everyone to the same standards, regardless of circumstances. You can't afford to make exceptions for someone just because they have key knowledge or skills you don't want to lose. Consistent accountability is essential for team cohesion and morale – and if you forget this, you might end up with a disengaged, demoralized team, and the underperforming key developer that you wanted to save might already be interviewing anyway. Focus Area 3: Supporting Individuals to Succeed When the house is on fire, it's tempting to put personal development on the back burner (no pun intended). But now is the time when your team members need to feel more than ever that you're still invested in their success, to help them stay engaged and motivated. The trick is to reframe growth to fit the wartime context. Instead of formal skills training or career pathing, focus on maximizing each person's impact by leaning into their strengths. Help them see how this challenging period is an opportunity to stretch and step up in ways that will serve them well in the future. Call out the valuable, transferrable experience they're gaining by operating in this high-stakes environment. Emphasize that they're building \"career security\" - capabilities and experiences that will be valued anywhere - even if short-term \"job security\" may feel shaky and uncertain. Identify on-the-job learning opportunities, like giving someone the chance to lead an incident response or a high-visibility project. Critical mistakes can still be catastrophic, but because of the fast-changing nature of wartime work, it's easier to process smaller errors with a healthy learning mindset. (Read more about Celebrating Failure.) Finally, don't forget to look for opportunities to display small gestures to show you care about your team members' personal well-being despite everything that's going on. Make the few team-building occasions count, or simply send a note acknowledging a tough week. A little goes a long way. Finally: Take Care of Yourself First Leading in wartime is incredibly demanding. You won't be able to show up for your team if you're running on empty. Remember to put on your own oxygen mask first, before you try to help others. Prioritize the basics of healthy eating, sleeping, and exercising. Treat your body as a machine that needs regular maintenance. Find peers within or outside of your organization who get the challenges you're facing, to vent with and get support. Carve out little breaks of relief, whether it's a walk, a short meditation, or just a quick game of chess (or backgammon!) in the communal area. A small recharge can help a lot. Keep a healthy context: while it might seem overpowering during the day, after all, this is just a job, and you should find other sources of satisfaction in your life besides your work. Conclusion Wartime stretches and strains Engineering Managers especially hard because they receive pressure from above and below. By ruthlessly focusing on well-aligned delivery, building a resilient team, investing in individuals, and maintaining your own health, you can lead your team to not just survive but thrive under pressure.

It's cosplay. Real wartime footing: 1. Direction and technical decisions are driven by priorities of board-level members and often arrive in email form late on Friday evening. The entire organisation is expected to pivot immediately. A new senior leadership team member starts scheduling daily read-outs on project progress, and half the organisation spends the weekend frantically hallucinating project plans into Google Sheets. 2. Engineering staff react with dull-eyed disbelief on Monday; they knew this was coming, because the same thing happened a month ago, and six weeks before that. 3. Emails come from HR that there are are new, even-more-labyrinthine approval processes for expenses, and shrinking budgets for anything not directly related to whatever the projet du jour, which will be fed enough to make it look like it's succeeding until the next Friday evening email kills it. 4. There is wide-spread burn-out across Engineering teams, and people are reduced to reactive, sarcastic automatons. 5. A creeping understanding seizes the better engineers that things cannot improve; they sign articles of Armistice, pretend to comply, and start interviewing elsewhere. 6.

It comforts with a classic remedy: level up your game and you can win the game. Replace negativity with a \"bias heavily toward action\". Tell yourself and your reports: \"perfection is the enemy of done\", have \"ruthless prioritization\", be \"laser-focused on shipping what matters most“. Believe in this all until you get a new position (with real agency), then you can discard this illusion along with your reports.

I'm not sure how companies fall prey to these problems, but they seem to be incredibly hierarchical. What I means specifically is that the lower level employees and mid-level managers seem almost rabid to praise, cater to, and and be swept up by the useless whims of nearly anyone in the executive suite. It's sickening, and not because of the impacts on work. Why do so many grown adults act so pathetically servile to someone who is in a higher rung in a company? These executives don't have better ideas inherently, and due to being so far removed from the real work, are often a misinformed distraction. No one seems to think that an executive would want to be told that they are wrong, or misinformed, or missing the point. But, a worthwhile executive would want to hear exactly that. They would want to know if their ideas were actually going to disrupt work, make the firm worse off, etc. And I know what you're thinking: many executives are self-interested, and just want to see their ideas implemented, company health be damned. Yes, that's true. But then why does anyone give them the time of day? If an executive is nakedly self-interested they should be sidelined as aggressively as possible, both to neuter them and also to protect the company. reply _heimdall 5 hours agorootparentI had a bit of hope when companies started down the OKRs path. That model could work really well when done bottom-up, with individuals defining what they see as most important in their context and managers rolling that up into coherent strategies at each level as it goes up. Effectively, managers should be puzzling together what those closest to the product and customer find rather than forcing down goals and metrics. Unfortunately companies don't work that way and leadership fundamentally doesn't trust their employees, especially employees they are a few layers away from in the org chart. OKRs ended up being just another name for leadership slamming goals down the org, no different than the Company Pillars I would see at Microsoft 15 years ago. reply la64710 2 hours agorootparentprevWhy do so many grown adults act so pathetically servile to someone who is in a higher rung in a company? - Because the alpha apes on the top of the pyramid got all the bananas and they will share it only with the ones they like.

Peace. reply bangaroo 4 hours agorootparentprevI mean, I think there are a lot of motivations for people who behave this way, but one of the core ones is less a matter of servitude or slavering desire to satisfy upper management and a lot more a result of the kind of language this article uses. People want to believe the things that they do matter and are often willing to gussy up their jobs to make their contributions feel important, to make themselves feel important, to feel like the world needs them. It's the same thing that motivates mall security guards to dress up in tactical outfits. \"If I spend all my time doing this thing that doesn't matter and isn't super important, then I don't matter, and I'm not super important.\" They convince themselves that whatever this current thing is Truly Does Matter, and then are willing to run themselves into the ground to prove the point that they contributed to the thing that matters. I see the sort of self-aggrandizing \"identifying as your job\" behavior that leads to this mindset in software more than a lot of other jobs. People get into software and their personality becomes \"I'm a software engineer\" or \"I'm a coder.\" They're better than the average - they're a highly-compensated expert who understands concepts like \"UX\" and \"Architecture\" and \"Infrastructure\" and they are going to run a Beta Test and Have To Stay Late To Deploy The New Version. They have an Important Deadline! The things they are doing Matter. I think lots of people in software had this idealized image of themselves as a core contributor to a product that's broadly loved and people care about and are unwilling to accept that they are toiling away to marginally reduce the time to first meaningful paint on yet another shopping cart page which only a few people use because the company they work for is niche, not particularly innovative, and not interesting. I don't think a lot of people are doing this for the promotion - I think they're doing it for the validation. So they can believe that what they do actually matters. The sad reality is that 95% of software is bad and uninteresting and the people working on it are mashing together lego pieces to re-solve completely solved problems for management that doesn't get what they're doing and customers who don't like their work, and the desire to create importance where there isn't any is a self-defense mechanism more than anything. Breaking out of this mindset was a key development in my career and I've not seen any less success but I am substantially more happy. reply lazide 7 hours agorootparentprevThey act that way because anyone who didn’t got fired, and those that did got promoted.

No amount of \"existential threat\" pressure on teams to perform will replace leadership going through the balance sheet and figuring out where profits/growth/etc is getting it's highest return on investment and where it's not. Then planning for how to change that. I was at a newly IPO'd company a few years back and it was almost laughable the gap between leadership's fantasies about profitability and the raw data in the earnings statement. Not a single decision planned or statement made addressed the mathematical reality of the balance sheet. A simple \"We need to get X% more out of this, and reduce the cost of that by Y% and we'll be good, here's our plan...\" would have been endlessly more productive then feel good speeches and pressure on teams to improve performance in unspecified areas. reply FuriouslyAdrift 2 hours agoparentprevAlso, war-time leaders usually make terrible peace time leaders and vice versa.

It’s a lie. Executives and VPs and all those folks that earn 5x what a normal engineer earns, don’t really care about the company they work for. All they care about is to keep receiving the big pay checks until the ship sinks. Obviously you cannot just mandate “normal mode”, otherwise it wouldn’t look as if everyone is doing their best to keep the company afloat.

(As something of a bonus: I'll bring in the military given the whole \"wartime\" trope.) In particular, Scrum is only there to establish rituals that enable empiricism in decision making. A sprint is a reporting period to keep the team from spending too much time in the weeds. A standup is there to keep the team working together. The andon cord (which is often missing I find) is there when the facts have changed so utterly profoundly that everyone needs to regroup. Anyone who's been through RTC (\"boot camp\"), and even some who haven't but have lived vicariously through others, understand that being constantly yelled at by RDCs (\"drill instructors\") on how you make your racks and fold your clothes is all about building certain habits and only tenuously related to what you'll be doing after A-school. It all has more to do with building trust that the rest of the folks in your ship will help carry you when the going gets tough. Scrum, at its core, is kinda like that. I really dislike the term \"Scrum Master.\" They're a team captain. The more military-minded might be keener to use \"gunnery sergeant\" or \"chief petty officer:\" they're just the most senior person in the rating group^W^W^W^Won the team. (Though, I'd probably take more inspiration from the Marines than the Navy here: a culture of servant leadership seems to bring out the best in people.) The most popular implementations of Scrum tend to come with a ridiculous amount of meeting and tool baggage, and it's so unnecessary. Use Excel. Hold your standups at the close of the day so people can go home. Write your product backlog items in delivery order so that sprint planning is less about sitting in one room playing poker and more about just getting valuable shit done. That said, what isn't unnecessary, however, is kneecapping command a little: the engineering officer of the watch has comparatively little understanding of the actual operation of the machine. They just know that they want operational excellence. However, that excellence also sometimes comes with the watch supervisor—a subordinate—publicly calling out mistakes that the watch officer makes. reply tbrownaw 18 hours agorootparent> I really dislike the term \"Scrum Master.\" They're a team captain.

This way, it's a little more familiar with the way Western management hierarchy operates without turning it too much on its head. It's something of a leadership billet without removing the ability to be technical, which is important for a lot of folks. It tends to work pretty well in an environment that both lacks a bug tracker (so that individual people aren't assigned things) and has a culture of pairing or mobbing. reply vishalontheline 19 hours agoparentprevThere is such a thing as a first mover advantage, as long as one doesn't focus on competitors as much as unserved / underserved customers.

They may also just be competitive by nature and insecure due to a lack of experience, and bad at communicating - also, due to a lack of experience. Agile / Scrum: people quickly realized that they had to give up control in order to be agile. It's possible to do Agile and to structure a waterfall software project into smaller chunks that feel agile, but you need PM's who know how to do that, and they need to show their work to the team in order to get buy-in.

Value responding to change over following a plan And then there are the 12 principles: 1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software. 2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development. 3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months). 4. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers. 5. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted. 6. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location). 7. Working software is the primary measure of progress. 8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace. 9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design. 10, Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential. 11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. 12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.

You have to understand the bigger picture to fit the Agile points in there. For example your >> Value responding to change over following a plan > ?????????? Does anyone know what the fuck this means? In waterfall, once you start developing, it's very hard to change something during the process. Due to Agiles iterative and incremental approach (principles 1 & 3), it allows you to change priorities, features, integrations, etc, during development. New technology also allowed this iterative approach. For example in the past, software was released on disk or CD-roms, which meant a huge release cycle. Nowadays with SaaS, you can constantly release and improve your products (using CI or CD for example, widely adopted now). Maybe you have to look into other software development processes to really understand what sets Agile appart, for example Waterfall, Spiral, Incremental, Rational Unified Process, etc. A good overview is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process reply rrr_oh_man 9 hours agorootparentThat really doesn't answer GP's question reply koonsolo 9 hours agorootparentMaybe I'm not understanding it completely indeed.

Intentionally left vague. “Working”depends on many factors that only the people involved with the building of it can know. Mainly by getting on a train and sitting down with your users to figure out exactly what they consider to be working software. See above. > “Value customer collaboration over contract negotiation\" You’ve not been around much contract consultancy work then? Hey, company X we’d like some software that does Y. Do you 1. Enter into a lengthy process to establish exact requirements and agree on exactly what needs to be delivered up front, without having touched any software, and trying to cost it all out etc etc 2. Get on a train and sit with the user developing some proof of concepts quickly to figure out what the hell it is they want. 1 is waterfall and contract negotiation. 2 is responding to change. example is a user saying “oh, actually, could we try the page header in pink instead please” after asking for it to be blue last week. > lol.

They may be “of their time” but they’re definitely not stupid. They seem more right the more I think about them. I think about agile a lot and how to teach the attitudes contained within the principles to my juniors. Just to reiterate the important point there — the principles are a collection of attitudes. They are not explicit instructions. No, it’s actually useful. Would I base an entire team methodology solely on this? No. But it informs a significant part of it. Executives don’t care about by he agile manifesto. Mostly because no one posts about it on linked in and they’d rather pay someone ridiculous sums of money to make the team “Scrum” and fuck about doing whatever the fuck sprint poker is (execs always want to spend money instead of doing the work).

Also, these items must be delivered by end of Q4; let's schedule some meetings with management to discuss why the team's burndown chart is going up and not down.\" Agile is like true communism: always preached, never reached. It is a fig leaf for toxicity. The ideal true Agile practitioner cannot be faulted; and you will never encounter them. The word \"Agile\", when encountered in real-world corporate scenarios, does not mean the things described in the manifesto, though the manifesto will often be quoted; rather, hearing it invariably means the frog has reached boiling temperature and it is well past time for anyone who can still flee to flee. \"Agile consultant\" is the modern term for an outsider that management have brought in to whip the thoroughbreds so that the resulting negativity falls on the outside party - which can then be let go again - and not anyone permanently employed by the company.

Just another stupidity forced on them. The question is how can people collaborate? That is the question. Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) begins to help us think about how we can do that. Simplistically we can just throw bodies at problems and we get \"the mythical man month\" mentality. Or we can do it with militarism - we all get marching orders. Unfortunately, good programmers do not do well with this mentality. So is there another way? At this point, as a community, we do not really understand how people work together. Despite the face that millions of people can live in a large city, we have no clue as to the mechanism that allows this to happen. $. The city does not degrade as the Mythical Man Month predicts, nor are the people ordered about in a militaristic manner. So what gives? How does that work? $. Why do I keep putting $ in this post? Because $ is a \"messaging bus\". (You tell me a better word - signalling system?). Everyone can read (get money) and write (spend money) on this messaging bus providing signals to other people.

I wasn't aware of his other book, so very much looking forward to reading this. I first read this book when I was starting out as a Dev some 20 years ago. It made a huge impression and is still relevant. Some things I remember off the top of my head. - It was the first time I came across Occams Razor. This really helped me understand how to approach debugging issues and generally dealing with problems. - It discusses the dangers of people who don't understand areas at a technical level being in charge of programs that depend on those technical things. Even more so when they have an inflated ego. Apparently Churchill was very good at seeing through this. - If I'm remembering correctly, there was a section about a practical joke someone played on their apartment neighbour that involved swapping out their pet tortoise for gradually larger versions. I very recently read a Roald Dahl childrens book to my kid which had this exact story. Now I have no idea if this actually happened as RV Jones wrote, or if it was a well known story at the time that Roald Dahl also adapted. - The dangers of making assumptions. I'm sure there are more.

According to his own LinkedIn, the author has never been a first-level engineering manager. His blog is accordingly heavy on cliches and mostly free of actual work experience.

The part about not fostering a \"us vs them\" mentality was good food for thought, as I do find it tempting to build short term camaraderie. When faced with big picture issues that can't be changed (believe me, they can't) it's easy to reach for a \"We all know that these exec decisions don't make sense, but we can still do right for each other among this BS\" type of conversation. But it's worth thinking about what that will do for the long term motivation of that team member at the company. reply pavel_lishin 7 hours agorootparentWhat about what \"this BS\" does to morale and motivation?

Yeah, such people would be able to spot and smell \"this BS\" from a mile and trying to sell it to them by re-packaging won't exactly help raise motivation.

If you're on the struggle bus then you should prioritise self-sufficiency in the hiring process (as the post suggests) and be honest about what people are walking into (as you kind of suggest).

When you are in full panic mode with a clear goal, a lot of decisions are very clear and easy to make. And everybody knows you can't scrutinize every little thing.

These particular ones are troublesome because they fall closer on the spectrum to \"reduce executives\". If you're pushing decision-making downstream, it should also be reduced upstream. If you reduce it upstream, you have less (not zero) need for leadership there. That has to manifest either in fewer leaders or leaders doing a better job at their other duties. In particular, they need to be producing much clearer stronger vision for the downstream folks to align their decisions to. Vision is perhaps the hardest task in the org and when it's hard it's easy to shirk on. Often, when leaders talk about trying to move to a bottom up culture, they are (unconsciously?) trying to absolve themselves of the vision work. And they're usually doing it while still gatekeeping information and resources they were meant to have because they were decision makers. This is going too far, but directionally: Leaders should largely not be advocating for delegation and bottom up decision-making. It's not that this can't be better for the company, it's that they could be executing the goal better by quitting or firing their peers.

There's no appetite for the risk of moving faster by removing approval bottlenecks or changing processes. The advice here is to challenge what actually needs to be centralised. Identify things that could be safely delegated. For example, why does a list of managers and an exec need to approve a $10 per month subscription that saves a bunch of engineering time by managing cascading PR merges? And identify safe ways to delegate. For example, if we move container image vuln scanning into CI/CD pipelines, the dev team can update dependencies themselves without a security team being involved to do it for them and approve. These might seem like silly examples to someone working at a half decent start up or tech first org. But these kinds of centralised control structures are the norm for most large organisations until they are very strongly challenged. reply AdrianB1 20 hours agorootparentprevThe idea is that you should already have the decision in the right way, if you push more towards decentralization then you are already in the danger zone.

Things are actually looking pretty good at this point and we have some perspective on revenue growth and even team growth. Being bootstrapped means we can set our own pace. The thing with fire fighting is that you 1) need to recognize that you are doing it. 2) put a stop to it. Firefighting simply doesn't work. You have a 100 fires to put out and you put out 1 or 2. The house will still burn down. And you will be too stressed to do a good job at what little you are still actually doing. So you'll cause a few more fires in the process. Firefighting leads to more fire fighting. Also the constant context switching actually means you are less productive. In terms of people management (including yourself), fire fighting is not sustainable for very long. It just makes people miserable, stresses them out, and eventually they leave, get burned out, etc. And that includes yourself. You have a breaking point and you want to stay on the right side of it. In my case, if I step out the company dies. It's that simple. So, I use my weekends to recover, not to work my ass off. Coming in well rested on Monday is more important than getting whatever done on a Sunday. So, take the tough decisions you need to make (who gets to stay, which things to cut, etc.) and then stabilize at whatever level is sustainable. De-prioritize the things that won't get done anyway. Stop pretending that you are even doing them. Ruthlessly prioritize what needs doing and filter that list by do-ability and then by available resources and then by short term priority. Smaller teams mean things actually get easier. Less need for meetings, less conflicts, etc. I'd run this thing differently if I had a ten person team. But I just don't.

It couldn't be altered once it was accepted, so the \"war mode\" had a fixed goal and deadline.

Here’s the story… I was working from home with my girlfriend (at the time), when suddenly I get an urgent ping from my coworker: “Our service is experiencing a SEV 2! We need all hands on deck!” Uh oh, our team’s application has gone down! However, as I scrambled to figure out how to fix the issue, I smelled something burning from another room and heard a fire alarm go off. “Will! There’s a fire! Help!” I heard my girlfriend shout. Now I was stuck in a conundrum — restore a critical Amazon service, or put out the fire in my apartment? It was at that time I remembered Amazon’s famous leadership principle “Customer Obsession”. There are customers who depend on my team’s application — I can’t let them down! So I ignored the fire and my girlfriend’s pleas, and started debugging the production issue. But all of a sudden, the smoke in my apartment cleared and the fire alarm fell silent. My girlfriend walked into the room, and to my astonishment, peeled off a wig and revealed herself to be Jeff Bezos himself! “I’m proud of you for being obsessed with our customers,” he said, and gave me a $5 Amazon gift card. He then leaped out of my window and hopped into a waiting Amazon Prime delivery van that quickly peeled away.

    "originBody": "Greetings, Stranger. Ease your mind. Settle into silence. And simply do nothing. You've been idle for 000 seconds. Nothing—a timer that tracks your intentional choice to do... nothing. No goals to chase, no notifications clamoring for your attention, no pressure to fill the silence with productivity. It simply exists, quietly counting each second you allow to pass. This is a space where inactivity is the point—a digital oasis amidst the chaos of endless tasks and to-dos. Yet the essence of Nothing isn't about fixating on your screen, though you're welcome to if you wish. It's about setting aside your phone or computer, taking a step back from the relentless grind, and reconnecting with the world around you. Nothing is more a concept than an app—a quiet reflection rather than a tool to be used. It stands as a gentle rebellion against the incessant noise of modern life, which demands constant action. Stay as long as you like, watch the seconds tick away, or let your gaze wander elsewhere. There's no reward for lingering, just the peculiar pleasure of simply being. Sometimes, the most profound act is to pause, breathe, and do nothing at all—a reminder that it's perfectly acceptable to embrace stillness and just... be.

Cycling seems to be perfect as the scenery changes much faster and there is more opportunity to challenge myself (; reply seadan83 1 hour agoparentprevInteresting you mention walking as what our ancestors did. Until about 100 years ago, food and energy scarcity was the norm. Our ancestors would have been lean and would not have typically expended energy for just pure leisure. In other words, everyone was busy trying to not starve. There was plenty of physical activity in the day, lots of chores and things to do. I say this to demonstrate how un-adapted we are now for what is relatively recently a radically different lifestyle. reply abdullahkhalids 20 minutes agorootparentThis is not supported by anthropological facts in the slightest. First of all, the argument conflates hunter gatherers, nomadic tribes, and farming societies. The mean and variance in food supply in all three across the world and time varied quite a bit. Were the numbers so bad uniformly that people had no time for leisure activity!?! Across history, there is evidence of people having huge celebratory festivals, involving excess food, dancing, and other rituals. People have been building for thousands of years humongous temples and pyramids and other structures requiring decades of continuous work, most of them without slave labor but voluntarily. Spending significant part of the day praying to the gods has also been the hallmark of humans. Do any of these strike you as low energy activities? Or take a look at biology.

But cycling is what gave me the best of all. Riding for 7-8 hours even once a week just gave me a boost that would let me cope with everything that I had to face in daily life, and now after I've diagnosed with ADHD, I realize it was also helped me a lot to keep myself somewhat sorted. It's kinda therapy for me. It's relaxing, and clams the racing mind so much. Now I don't get a chance to ride anymore, but I miss it so much. And I feel ADHD affects me more now reply my_brain_saying 1 hour agorootparentprevThis is excellent advice. Spending 5 hours on a weekend cycling is extremely relaxing, not only because you are intensely using your body, but because you are completely and utterly distracted. When I cycle, the first twenty kilometers are usually fairly painful: I am tired, I feel my knees, back, and muscles hurt, and am generally uncomfortable. After those twenty kilometers I enter a meditative, gelatinous phase, were I no longer really feel my body. I just ride. This is when I _think_; the same style of thinking I experience when lying, comfortably, in bed. After maybe 60–90 kilometers (depending on my current fitness level), I enter the pain stage. This is when I start feeling my body again. Believe it or not, this is definitely the most therapeutic stage. This is when I cannot think. My mind stays blank, and I do — in a manner of speaking — nothing. This lack of thought, meaning lack of stress, of worry, of hectic, etc., is what motivates me to go on 150 or 200 kilometer bike rides. You feel physically refreshed and exhausted. You feel that you were able to think in peace and purely, as well as having been void of all negative, stressful thoughts. To anyone who has never tried an endurance sport like cycling: I highly recommend it. I started when I was 14, and it was one of the greatest decisions I ever made. It spared me hours of depression, fear, and stress. It also encouraged me to think and meditate in peace. I would not be the person I am today, if it were not for my dear high-school friend who showed me the world of cycling (as well as the world of communism; I owe much to this friend).

Quite often to put food on the table, or for clout. There’s an intrinsic desire to create, sure, but there’s also a cultural context in which art is valued and certain kinds of art are valued more at different times or in different places. I suppose it’s splitting hairs to say that art has some use both for the creator and the consumer, because it’s not the same kind of use you mean. It’s just that when I dig in to “useful” vs “useless” endevours there’s often no clear line between them. reply NoMoreNicksLeft 18 minutes agorootparentprev> There's an idea that modern lives demand value in material terms. All lives demand value in caloric or reproductive terms. Economics teaches us that most commodities are fungible. If you receive material value, this can be exchanged for caloric or reproductive value. Thus, modern (and non-modern) lives demand value in material terms. This isn't a philosophy, it's just a fact.

Yet we do it because it looks objectively analytic. reply seadan83 2 hours agorootparentWhat is your definition of utilitarianism? Utilitarianism is not a form of democracy.

I would like to extend an invitation to those that are interested to pursue the concept of this applet further to find a proper teacher rooted in a tested tradition. There's this movement to reintroduce millenial traditions of mindfulness into our lives under the guise of modern secularism. I am not convinced that removing its original context is as wise as it's purported. So many old traditions focus on lineage for a reason, and it is something we're too quick to do away with in society. Most meditation practices come along with a warning, that doing this type of work can lead to results that you need proper preparation for. At the very least you need proper intentionality, and doing them incorrectly can lead to neuroticism and in some cases breakdowns and dissociation.

When done perfectly correctly, consciously breathing nets the same benefits to the body as unconscious or automatic breathing. You don't really have to spend any mental energy on it to get the oxygen you need (your body will even yawn for you if it needs more). I think there is a way to find the ease and harmony in most things, or, the \"automatic modes\".

I can only imagine what it would be like to stop paddling and see that I am still in motion, to be able to exhale and do nothing. reply Nevermark 11 hours agoparentI have had a similar insight. People often wonder what advice they would give their younger self. This would be it for me. It something seems too difficult, it is likely because you are still struggling with a pre-requisite. Go back to working on the previous foundation until your mastery is complete. This is true for work, mental & fitness progress. I.e. if you find losing weight hard, you probably need to improve your diet (not to lose weight, but to find healthy food you enjoy enough to become a self-reinforcing habit). Don’t try to improve your diet in order to lose weight. That is trying to solve two big things, on two different levels, at once. This may take a while, but eventually you can find your way to an exceptionally healthy diet you like too much to require any discipline to stay on. That is a health foundation of lasting value. And with that foundatiin, when you try to lose weight again, it is much easier. Likewise, if you find it is hard to improve your diet, even in increments, perhaps you are fatigued? You may need to improve your sleep routine until you are habitually not tired. For some of us, that might take a lot of work. But focusing on it, instead of downstream efforts will pay off. Etc. Foundations should be iterated on until they are self-perpetuatingly solid. Then the next thing will be much easier. Math and physics are mental versions. The result for any path: Go slow (iterate & explore to complete fluency & habit) to go fast (compounding instead of linear gains in understanding & progress). reply necovek 11 hours agorootparent> ...exceptionally healthy diet you like too much to require any discipline to stay on. There's no such thing. Eating only 50 avocados a day (so called \"superfood\") won't get you healthy or make you lose weight. Too much of anything is not healthy. A \"healthy diet\" is matched up with your body, short- and long-term needs, activities, mental state, etc. I do agree with the suggested approach for achieving anything significant, just nitpicking on some of the language in your dieting example. reply Nevermark 9 hours agorootparent> Too much of anything is not healthy. You have lost me. I said a healthy diet you love. So critiquing me as suggesting anything that is not a healthy diet seems odd. A healthy diet can be created many ways, all involve a lot of variety. But it can be convenient too. If you find the right mix (for your own tastes) of “superfoods” as a foundation. I.e. hummus, mixed greens, mixed berries, a mix of nuts, a mix of seeds, sardines, salmon & tuna (but not too much), eggs, etc. If your fridge, pantry, and eating habits cover all your basic nutrition multiple ways by default, then adding a variety of other healthy foods can be done very spontaneously without any need for planning. I know, it took me a few years, and a lot of iteration, but it would be hard to beat my diet. Even my snacks are up there, like edamame, chocolate in moderation, fresh veggies, high protein low sugar ice cream, etc. Achieving healthy autopilot is the point. reply necovek 9 hours agorootparentIn formal theory, it would be called a proof by contradiction when extended to an extreme. Even with the \"right mix\", if you eat 5x the amount your lifestyle and body and mind need, you ain't ever going to lose weight or get to a healthy state. Obese people are (usually) obese because they eat too much, not just because of the type of food they eat. Heck, today both keto and vegan are considered \"healthy\" and they are on the opposite end of the spectrum when it comes to diet choices. I am basically arguing that, to an extent, it's more important how much you eat, vs what you eat. Again, this is all comparative (eg. eating McDonalds burgers for the rest of your life is \"healthy\" compared to not eating anything at all, but that's a useless distinction). Plenty of people in the past have eaten \"unhealthy\" (white bread, fried meat and vegetables) yet didn't have an obesity or health problem, because they countered that with a balanced activity (physical work) and mental load (shared responsibilities). So my point is that you should reach that \"autopilot\" on the amount of the food you get, and then you can be pretty liberal in how you achieve it (obviously, don't have chocolate for breakfast, lunch and dinner). I do agree getting to the autopilot is where you should put your effort to. reply Nevermark 8 hours agorootparentIf you need to eat more, you need to eat more. You need a different mix There isn’t a diet that works for everyone in both health & physical & psychological diet needs The point is always making progress. Accumulating foods that work better. So learn and continually try things. Anyone can make progress, that is beneficial. I am still making progress, in food quality & convenience, which blows my mind. And I don’t doubt there are medical and mental issues that need more than a healthy diet intervention But that doesn’t eliminate the benefits from being healthier, easier. You don’t know how much eating healthier automatically will impact seemingly independent or counter issues until trying. A sustained changed diet changes our responses to food physically & mentally in significant & positive ways. My diet has changed me. reply necovek 7 hours agorootparentI don't doubt that, and good for you! In a sense, that should be obvious to anyone who's ever been a bit more edgy because they lacked the carbohydrates for the moment (\"eat some sugar\"), but larger changes will certainly trigger a larger change in body response (hormones, energy levels, mood...). From the get go, I only challenged the notion that the main issue for people who want to lose weight is the type of the food they eat, but instead, the amount of the food they eat. It seems like we are arguing past each other though :) reply pjerem 13 hours agoparentprev> When done perfectly correctly, consciously breathing nets the same benefits to the body as unconscious or automatic breathing. You don't really have to spend any mental energy on it to get the oxygen you need (your body will even yawn for you if it needs more). I was taught that this is not entirely true : your automatic breathing is influenced by your morphology, your posture, your current levels of energy, and your current emotions. And it sounds like the feedback loop can go reverse : intentionally breathing have an impact on your posture, your level of energy and your emotion.

    "originBody": "g1: Using Llama-3.1 70b on Groq to create o1-like reasoning chains g1_demo.1.mp4 This is an early prototype of using prompting strategies to improve the LLM's reasoning capabilities through o1-like reasoning chains. This allows the LLM to \"think\" and solve logical problems that usually otherwise stump leading models. Unlike o1, all the reasoning tokens are shown, and the app uses an open source model. g1 is experimental and being open sourced to help inspire the open source community to develop new strategies to produce o1-like reasoning. This experiment helps show the power of prompting reasoning in visualized steps, not a comparison to or full replication of o1, which uses different techniques. OpenAI's o1 is instead trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using Chain of Thought, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex PhD-level problems. g1 demonstrates the potential of prompting alone to overcome straightforward LLM logic issues like the Strawberry problem, allowing existing open source models to benefit from dynamic reasoning chains and an improved interface for exploring them. How it works g1 powered by Llama3.1-70b creates reasoning chains, in principle a dynamic Chain of Thought, that allows the LLM to \"think\" and solve some logical problems that usually otherwise stump leading models. At each step, the LLM can choose to continue to another reasoning step, or provide a final answer. Each step is titled and visible to the user. The system prompt also includes tips for the LLM. There is a full explanation under Prompt Breakdown, but a few examples are asking the model to “include exploration of alternative answers” and “use at least 3 methods to derive the answer”. The reasoning ability of the LLM is therefore improved through combining Chain-of-Thought with the requirement to try multiple methods, explore alternative answers, question previous draft solutions, and consider the LLM’s limitations. This alone, without any training, is sufficient to achieve ~70% accuracy on the Strawberry problem (n=10, \"How many Rs are in strawberry?\"). Without prompting, Llama-3.1-70b had 0% accuracy and ChatGPT-4o had 30% accuracy. Examples Important g1 is not perfect, but it can perform significantly better than LLMs out-of-the-box. From initial testing, g1 accurately solves simple logic problems 60-80% of the time that usually stump LLMs. However, accuracy has yet to be formally evaluated. See examples below. How many Rs are in strawberry? Prompt: How many Rs are in strawberry? Result: Prompt: Which is larger, .9 or .11? Result: Quickstart To use the Streamlit UI, follow these instructions: python3 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate pip3 install -r requirements.txt export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk... streamlit run app.py Alternatively, follow these additional instructions to use the Gradio UI: cd gradio pip3 install -r requirements.txt python3 app.py Prompting Strategy The prompt is as follows: You are an expert AI assistant that explains your reasoning step by step. For each step, provide a title that describes what you're doing in that step, along with the content. Decide if you need another step or if you're ready to give the final answer. Respond in JSON format with 'title', 'content', and 'next_action' (either 'continue' or 'final_answer') keys. USE AS MANY REASONING STEPS AS POSSIBLE. AT LEAST 3. BE AWARE OF YOUR LIMITATIONS AS AN LLM AND WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO. IN YOUR REASONING, INCLUDE EXPLORATION OF ALTERNATIVE ANSWERS. CONSIDER YOU MAY BE WRONG, AND IF YOU ARE WRONG IN YOUR REASONING, WHERE IT WOULD BE. FULLY TEST ALL OTHER POSSIBILITIES. YOU CAN BE WRONG. WHEN YOU SAY YOU ARE RE-EXAMINING, ACTUALLY RE-EXAMINE, AND USE ANOTHER APPROACH TO DO SO. DO NOT JUST SAY YOU ARE RE-EXAMINING. USE AT LEAST 3 METHODS TO DERIVE THE ANSWER. USE BEST PRACTICES. Example of a valid JSON response: json { \"title\": \"Identifying Key Information\", \"content\": \"To begin solving this problem, we need to carefully examine the given information and identify the crucial elements that will guide our solution process. This involves...\", \"next_action\": \"continue\" } Breakdown First, a persona is added: You are an expert AI assistant that explains your reasoning step by step. Then, instructions to describe the expected step-by-step reasoning process while titling each reasoning step. This includes the ability for the LLM to decide if another reasoning step is needed or if the final answer can be provided. For each step, provide a title that describes what you're doing in that step, along with the content. Decide if you need another step or if you're ready to give the final answer. JSON formatting is introduced with an example provided later. Respond in JSON format with 'title', 'content', and 'next_action' (either 'continue' or 'final_answer') keys. In all-caps to improve prompt compliance by emphesizing the importance of the instruction, a set of tips and best practices are included. Use as many reasoning steps as possible. At least 3. -> This ensures the LLM actually takes the time to think first, and results usually in about 5-10 steps. Be aware of your limitations as an llm and what you can and cannot do. -> This helps the LLM remember to use techniques which produce better results, like breaking \"strawberry\" down into individual letters before counting. Include exploration of alternative answers. Consider you may be wrong, and if you are wrong in your reasoning, where it would be. -> A large part of the gains seem to come from the LLM re-evaluating its initial response to ensure it logically aligns with the problem. When you say you are re-examining, actually re-examine, and use another approach to do so. Do not just say you are re-examining. -> This encourages the prevention of the LLM just saying it re-examined a problem without actually trying a new approach. Use at least 3 methods to derive the answer. -> This helps the LLM come to the right answer by trying multiple methods to derive it. Use best practices. -> This is as simple as the \"Do better\" prompts which improve LLM code output. By telling the LLM to use best practices, or do better, it generally performs better! USE AS MANY REASONING STEPS AS POSSIBLE. AT LEAST 3. BE AWARE OF YOUR LIMITATIONS AS AN LLM AND WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO. IN YOUR REASONING, INCLUDE EXPLORATION OF ALTERNATIVE ANSWERS. CONSIDER YOU MAY BE WRONG, AND IF YOU ARE WRONG IN YOUR REASONING, WHERE IT WOULD BE. FULLY TEST ALL OTHER POSSIBILITIES. YOU CAN BE WRONG. WHEN YOU SAY YOU ARE RE-EXAMINING, ACTUALLY RE-EXAMINE, AND USE ANOTHER APPROACH TO DO SO. DO NOT JUST SAY YOU ARE RE-EXAMINING. USE AT LEAST 3 METHODS TO DERIVE THE ANSWER. USE BEST PRACTICES. Finally, after the problem is added as a user message, an assistant message is loaded to provide a standardized starting point for the LLM's generation. Assistant: Thank you!

Additionally, some of the prompt seems counterproductive: >Be aware of your limitations as an llm and what you can and cannot do.

From my anecdotal observations, the knowledge cutoff is one thing that LLMs are really well trained to know about. Those are limitations that LLMs are currently well trained to handle. Why can it not be trained to know that it is quite frequently bad at math, it may produce sometimes inaccurate code etc. For humans also, some people know some things are just not their cup of tea.

I would also not just call it a 'trick'. This looks simple, weird or whatnot but i do believe that this is part of AI thinking process research. Its a good question though what did they train?

In the meantime, OpenAI became a $150 billion company. And Anthropic came out with Claude, and Facebook with Llama, and Mistral with their models. Only then did Google realise there might be something to this LLM stuff - so they responded with Bard, a product so poorly received they later had to completely rebrand it. Looks like they didn't have a \"sentient\" model up their sleeve after all. Then the updated, rebranded model had a bunch of image generation embarrassments of its own. Admittedly, they have recovered somewhat since then; they're second on some performance leaderboards, which is respectable. But there was a real tortoise-and-hare situation where they thought they were so far ahead they had time for a nap, until they got overtaken.

This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. >[...] >We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). reply pizza 12 hours agorootparentprevSource? reply nell 11 hours agorootparent> I wouldn't call o1 a \"system\".

Rather like you might peer closer for more detail if someone asked you about the print quality of something you were reading.

Unlike traditional LLMs that primarily focus on next-token prediction, o1 learns to: 1. Recognize and correct mistakes 2. Break down complex steps into simpler ones 3. Try alternative approaches when initial strategies fail This process allows o1 to tackle more complex, multi-step problems, particularly in STEM fields. OpenAI reports observing new \"scaling laws\" with o1 [5]: 1. Train-time compute: Performance improves with more extensive reinforcement learning during training. 2. Test-time compute: Accuracy increases when the model is allowed more time to \"think\" during inference. This suggests a trade-off between inference speed and accuracy.

CoT comes in many flavors and improves when tailored to the problem domain. If the LLM can instead figure out the right strategy to use to problem solve for a given problem, this may improve performance per compute vs discovering this at inference time. Tailoring prompts is likely still the best way to maximize performance when you can, but in broader domains you'd work around this through strategies like asking the LLM to combine predefined reasoning modules, or creating multiple reasoning chains and merging/comparing them, explicit MCTS etc. I think those strategies will still be useful for a good while, but pieces of that search process, especially directing the search more efficiently, move to the LLMs over time as they get trained with this kind of data. reply Meganet 5 hours agorootparentprevIts like saying geometry is just math.

In this scenario, more is more. You need to type out as many thoughts as possible, placing all your thoughts insidetags. Your thoughts are only visible to yourself, the user does not see them and they should not be considered to be part of the final response. Consider every possible angle, recheck your work at every step, and backtrack if needed. Remember, there are no limits in terms of how long you can think - more thinking will always lead to a better solution. You should use your thoughts as a scratchpad, much like humans do when performing complicated math with paper and pen. Don't omit any calculation, write everything out explicitly. When counting or maths is involved, write down an enormously verbose scratchpad containing the full calculation, count, or proof, making sure to LABEL every step of the calculation, and writing down the solution step by step. Always remember that if you find yourself consistently getting stuck, taking a step back and reconsidering your approach is a good idea. If multiple solutions are plausible, explore each one individually, and provide multiple answers. Always provide mathematical proofs of mathematical answers. Be as formal as possible and use LaTeX. Don't be afraid to give obvious answers. At the very very end, after pages upon pages of deep thoughts, synthesize the final answer, insidetags.

Then the model shouldn't be any less intelligent if we remove facts like Uma Thurman's measurements and other vapid information. If the model already has the capability to use tools than all of that crap is redundant anyway. And while we are at it let's remove a ton of other junk like languages I will never use and which also doesn't make the model any smarter. So how small can this kernel get while still being clearly intelligent, able to communicate flawlessly in english and apply logical reasoning. That would be a worthwile endeavor and maybe even possible without boiling the oceans. reply kenmacd 6 hours agoparent [–] Your base assumption here is that the 'crap' is actually 'junk'. Let's look at the easy one here, languages. Talk to someone that speaks multiple languages and they'll have examples of concepts in one language that are difficult to express in another. The multilingual person, or someone who just speaks a different language than you, will think differently[1]. Does the LLM take advantage of this? I don't know. It wouldn't surprise me if it did, and if it doesn't now I'd bet it will in the future. Either way though, throwing away those other languages could make the model dumber. As you allude to, there's a balance between intelligence and knowledge. (in case you hadn't thought of it, those 'tools' can also be other LLMs with more specialized knowledge in a particular field. For example a 'translator' model) Other 'facts' could also have more merit than it would first appear. Sure, one particular person's shoe size might not be needed, but if you were to filter out shoe sizes in general then the model might not be able to suggest how to find properly fitting footwear, or might not suggest that your back pain could be related to your shoes. > That would be a worthwile endeavor and maybe even possible without boiling the oceans. I think it's important to keep in mind that we're very early in the AI journey. Look at the power requirements of early computers versus the ones we use today. I'm all for keeping energy usage in mind, but I'd be careful with hyperbolic language as things are changing so quickly. Tasks that would have taken multiple GPUs can now run on my laptop CPU. [1] https://www.edge.org/conversation/lera_boroditsky-how-does-o... reply aktuel 5 hours agorootparent [–] I don't think it's hyperbolic at all if you look at the published data, development of past and planned future energy requirements for AI. And as if efficiency gains ever stopped anyone from using even more energy.

While far from perfect, I'm very happy about it. It's nice that everything is in plain text, which means that I can script things, read everything in VIM, and easily extract data. For one of my two current companies, the ledger file is 2MB of plain text and contains the transactions from 2016 onwards. While I personally didn't find much value in lots of different \"accounts\" (categories), it's still been indispensable in keeping track of everything. Learning double-entry bookkeeping (which tools like ledger use) was really fun (and not that hard in hindsight) and probably a skill that is useful for the rest of my life. reply tonyarkles 4 hours agoparentI'm not using any of these tools yet, although this article popped up at just the right time because Quickbooks and my bank conspired to miss a bunch of transactions that I'm cleaning up now... but that's beside the point. The strategy I've used for different accounts/categories is to make accounts that match the expense categories that the Canada Revenue Agency wants on my tax return. Early on when I was getting into it I made a bunch of accounts for logical categories (Hosting Expenses, Prototype/Manufacturing Expenses, etc) but then after a few years of trying to map those categories into CRA categories... I just realized I could pre-categorize them appropriately and make my taxes simpler at the end of the year. reply chriseidhof 6 hours agoparentprevIn thinking a bit more, I think the biggest pain point for me is one with plain text in general: it supports no attachments. I have my own system to refer to specific files and built a Mac app that lets me drop a file on a transaction, then it copies that file into a specific folder and adds a tag to the transaction. This could be done so much easier if the data would be sqlite, but then you obviously lose the ability to edit it directly in your text editor. reply balves 3 hours agorootparentFava and beancount have some affordances here. You can make a data directory with a directory structure that matches your chart of accounts. Place datestamped files in here and they'll show up inline in your fava ledger view. Additionally you can annotate a transaction with a \"document\" tag and that document will show up directly associated in the ui. The ui has pretty good previewing for these. I add pdf versions of all of my statements, and attach receipts to specific transactions (business expenses, proof of paying taxes, etc.) It works quite well reply fsiefken 5 hours agorootparentprevYou can perhaps use local file:// references in the files and open them in a browser, or you can use ledger from within a tool like Obsidian, LogSeq or DevonThink. Perhaps associate attachments in that way? https://github.com/tgrosinger/ledger-obsidian reply chriseidhof 3 hours agorootparentoh yes, absolutely! I have a system that works well for me. But it's inherent to plain text files that they don't support attachments. It's plain text, after all. reply dheera 3 hours agorootparentprevYou can paste the file as a base64 string. Disable word wrap and it should only appear as one line. A good text editor of the future should recognize these base64 strings and make them appear like clickable files, but still let you right-click and go back to the plain text representation. reply vagab0nd 4 hours agoparentprevWhen I sold my house, the escrow company mailed me a refund check of about $3000 on the closing. I never got that check. Guess how I found out about it, 5 years later, when I started using ledger-cli? reply fallat 4 hours agoparentprev+1 for ledger. It has been the best one I've used. The fact you can script it is f'ing amazing. My taxes have been on-point for 2+ years now since I started using it. reply wruza 16 hours agoprevSystems that use immediate strict categorization don’t work for some people. At a company I worked at we went with a two-phase approach. A person would write notes (literally iphone notes) in the following format: Apr 5 24 -50 Alice tools -220 Bob home project Apr 2 24 +20 Bob returned loan Note that time goes “up” to avoid scrolling too much on open. Later we loaded it into a script which would parse dates, detect keywords and make templates for proper double-entry. It would detect both the outer “agent” and the internal analytics and also put the original text as a comment. What it couldn’t detect had to be manually categorized and (sometimes) added to the script. Of course the script used editable lists for correspondence, not only hardcoded values. These lists were person-specific, so that Alice and Bob wouldn’t have to sync their vocabularies. I cannot imagine any of the people at that company filling this 9/19 (1234) comment here Cat1:cat2:cat3 Cat4:cat5 every time money moves and they are in a queue, in the car, talking to someone, etc. They’d simply resort to smaller notes again in the notes app or in the chat, or would try to “remember” it, to fill properly at the end of the day (more likely week). reply speleding 6 hours agoparentWe also don't type in the ledger files directly, but rather than convert it from a free format note we use the comment field of the banking apps, and the comment field of the expense report app (we use Zoho), to indicate what account it should apply to. Once a quarter I download CSV files from our bank account, credit card and Zoho app, and we have a set of ruby scripts that parse the CSV files into ledger files. They infer the correct accounts from the comment fields. Of course, the script and the ledger output tends to need a few tweaks, but it's >95% automated that way. As a bonus the scripts also add a few sanity checks to the ledger file, e.g. ensure the balance matches what is downloaded from the bank and entries fall within the current period. reply BeetleB 16 hours agoparentprevIt sounds like what you are doing is plain text accounting! > Later we loaded it into a script which would... I too do not manually enter things in the ledger file (well, rarely). I actually enter it into KMyMoney, and have a script to convert to a ledger file. Overall, your comment is coming across as a fairly weird complaint. It's a tool, and given that its in text, you're free to build whatever workflow you wish around it - including having people take notes on their iPhone and using a script to convert to the ledger format. reply wruza 15 hours agorootparentIt’s not a complaint, just an observation that anything non-natural language simply didn’t work for almost 100% of my “patients”, including myself. This format isn’t even a format. It’s how they write notes for themselves with a little agreement on regularity to simplify the parser. Btw, we tried everything: appstore apps, web forms, our own app. Everything sucks irl except just text. I still use this entry despite not having a database anymore for a script to load my data into. reply jasim 6 hours agoprevPlain Text Accounting has become significantly easier to do for me on a regular basis, thanks to LLMs. Specifically: importing bank statements into hledger and avoiding manual entry. I use a JSON file to map bank entries to my hledger accounts. For new transactions without mappings, I run a Python script that generates a prompt for Claude. It lists my hledger accounts and asks for mappings for the new entries. Claude returns hledger journal entries based on these mappings, which I can quickly review. Then another script prints out hledger journal entries for that month's bank transactions, all cleanly mapped. It takes me just a few minutes to tweak and finalize. I can also specify these mapping instructions in plain-language which would've otherwise been a fragile hodgepodge of regexps and conditionals. reply frakt0x90 2 hours agoparentYou don't consider an LLM fragile? Also bold to send your banking information to Anthropic. reply jasim 1 hour agorootparentGood question. LLMs are surprisingly less fragile than hand-coded parsers for unstructured data like the ones in a bank statement. And to be clear - I'm not sending the entire statement to Claude; instead, only the account name/narration of those transactions for which I already don't have a mapping. Claude then returns a well-formatted JSON that maps \"amzn0026765260@apl\" to \"expenses:amazon\", and \"Veena Fuels\" to \"expenses:vehicle\" and so on. I can also pass in general instructions saying that \"Restaurants and food-related accounts are categorized under 'expenses:food'\", and it does a good job of mapping most of my dining out expenses to the correct account head. The actual generation of journal entries are done by a simple Python script. The mapping used to be the hardest part, and what used to need custom classification models is just a simple prompt with LLM. reply marcrosoft 55 minutes agoprevI just switched off of ledger because multiple accountants and tax preparers didn’t know what to do with it even if I hand generated profit and loss reports. Quickbooks online has gotten pretty good. I honestly wouldn’t recommend these plain text tools anymore. Quickbooks has become almost a standard. reply nocman 12 minutes agoparentThe accounting people I know all hate Quickbooks (with an extra portion of hate for the online version). reply pge 4 minutes agorootparentBut they also all use it! reply po 4 hours agoprevPlain text accounting is cool but I think one of the biggest barriers for people is downloading bank data into a standard format. The banks are never going to embrace much more than CSV or excel files... the various data aggregation platforms (yodlee, plaid, etc...) are not open source or hobbyist friendly. Back in ancient times there was a company called Wesabe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesabe) that wrote software that did bank syncing on your desktop. Mint.com basically put them out of business but I still think about that approach. I think it could work for open source. Has anyone else? reply mauvehaus 4 hours agoparenthledger has tooling to transform fairly arbitrary CSV into transactions it understands[0]. I haven't tried it yet, but after spending 4 hours over multiple days helping my SaaS bookkeeping company troubleshoot their bank connection problems[1], you can better believe I'm willing to put a little time in trying this out. Every damn time I reconcile transactions I end up fighting their system that I can't see the workings of or fix myself. It's getting to the point where the juice isn't worth the squeeze. I'd sooner deal with the CSV myself given a half-way decent set of tools to do so. [0] https://hledger.org/1.40/hledger.html#csv [1] No, they weren't willing to refund me any money; this is \"typical\", in their words. reply wrycoder 3 hours agorootparentThis is the big advantage of hledger. It has two ways of translating csv into journal form - one simple and one more complicated, but very flexible. I find it best to have a separate journal for each downloaded account. I just include them into a master journal (along with a manual entry journal) and generate reports from that.

I wrote some scripts for this in the past, reverse engineered the login with OCR, cleaned up the invalid entries, but... It's just too much effort to maintain this. Once the mobile confirmation started being required, I just gave up. reply bickfordb 18 hours agorootparentI use beancount and I use ofxget for some accounts and then keep a CSV archive for the rest and wrote some scripts to sync them into beancount when a new file shows up. It's annoying to download everything and keep it organized, but it gives me better piece of mind than all the other SaSS accounting systems reply markgall 18 hours agorootparentI've found that so few of my accounts support ofxget that it's not worth the trouble of dealing with it. I just occasionally download year-to-date statements from all my accounts and then run scripts to convert them to ledger format and append only the things after a given cutoff date (things like the credit card script are pretty interactive so I don't want to overwrite the old data). To know which accounts are in most dire need of a check, I have a script that shows the last transaction on each statement-generating account. This basically works for me and catching up doesn't really take long. There are some accounts that I update very infrequently, but I've gotten over my OCD about this and it doesn't really matter. My wife doesn't appreciate being hassled for the statement from her work HSA every month -- nor does it really matter how much is in there at any given moment, unless we have a big medical expense -- so we just occasionally sit down and catch everything up, maybe twice a year. Overall I find the automation means it's vastly less work than when I used gnucash, and the flexibility in expense structures and ease of assigning things mean I have much better budget data than when I used mint.com. reply tonetegeatinst 18 hours agorootparentprevWish their was a standard data format that all banks would use. reply viraptor 18 hours agorootparentThe format exists - OFX https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Financial_Exchange But even banks that use it make massive mistakes and break the basic assumptions.

I used to do it weekly, if you miss one or even two or three weeks it's not too bad, but beyond that the effort required to catch up just snowballs. It's also been about a year since I've imported. I've been meaning to get around to reviving it, and the only way I can imagine doing it is to break it up into smaller chunks, like uploading one month at a time over a few days. reply candiddevmike 18 hours agorootparentOr just start over on the day (or month) you decide to import. As someone who wrote a budgeting app, historical data > 1 year is a lot less useful than most folks realize. I would say at least 80% of folks never look back further than 6 months. It's not even worthwhile for comparing YoY as your lifestyle, the economy, etc change so much. I ended up adding per-transaction opt-out roll up functionality for this reason, effectively squashing transactions into monthly and yearly budget summary transaction. Saved a ton of space with little loss of granularity. reply Spooky23 6 hours agorootparentYears ago when I helped people with random computer stuff (circa 2002), I had a client who’d run into trouble with Quicken because they had about 20 years of historical data.

I have my own irrational tendencies like this, of course, but still seemed weird. reply NoboruWataya 11 hours agorootparentprevI agree that data much older than a year is less useful, but to me, historical data going back about a year is quite useful.

I have around 100 transactions a month spread across various banks and providers. My experience is this: I spent about a week defining a procedure to export all statements into CSV, converting the CSV into a Gnucash-friendly format where needed with some GPT3-authored PHP scripts. Once a month I do an import into Gnucash and the process takes at most 2 hours. reply NoboruWataya 10 hours agorootparentThere are various frictions. I use multiple different banks, credit cards and investment platforms (partially due to my life being split between two countries). Each of them has their own clunky manual process for downloading statements (including MFA). The statements are in different formats. On the most recent version of GnuCash that I used I experienced weird bugs with the CSV importer which meant it would sometimes crash when I tried to use preset rules. Classifying transactions is probably the biggest time sink. GnuCash's auto-categorise feature is somewhat helpful but requires a lot of manual intervention and honestly I spent a lot of time just trying to figure out what a particular expense related to (often the note on my bank statement is not helpful). Ultimately, 2 hours per month is probably about what it took me as well. But x12 that's 24 solid hours of importing. And once you go back a few months it probably takes longer because it is more difficult to recall what particular expenses were for. reply pkage 18 hours agoparentprevIf you're willing to hold your nose a little bit, Plaid[0] might be worth looking into.

I agree this niche needs a better solution than it currently has, although the commercial and regulatory incentives might not be well-aligned to force that.

Since you’re here and clearly you know ledger well I’ll share a pattern I have that perhaps is a good idea or perhaps has an alternative approach. We need to track customers and suppliers carefully and then assign payments both made and received to specific projects and categories within those projects. Invoices can contain a mix of these projects in either direction. So our workflow is: - assign transactions to an account labeled by the counterparty when imported from bank account transactions. - a script uses ledger print command and creates a 2nd journal file for each counterparty with a mirror transaction inverting the original transaction out of the counterparty account and into an Unknown project and Unknown category sub account as a place holder. - transactions are then matched by bookkeeper to specific invoices and then assigned to Project:Category accounts in the counterparty journal file. transactions will be split if it’s needed at this point. so a single payment can be split to multiple Project:Category accounts. - by including all bank transaction journals and all counterparty journals then ledger bal command show if all transactions have been processed by bookkeeping. reply rpb92 15 hours agoprevI’d appreciate hearing how others have used the various plain text accounting tools for their own use. Are you legitimately using it to inform yourself of your spending habits and taking corrective action? Is it simply for tracking your expenses, revenues, net worth, etc? Or is it simply about the process? I can certainly see the appeal of such an orderly, structured process. Every time I’m reminded of plain text accounting, I have either an irresistible urge to immerse myself fully into the process, or feelings of guilt for not staying committed to my previous attempts. Right now, it’s mainly guilt, since I’ve not updated my personal ledger in a month and a half. Ultimately, I think I’m unsure about why I’m using it, and eventually feel like I’m logging transactions just for the sake of it. reply wruza 7 hours agoparentI’m always using it for spontaneous group accounting, e.g. three guys vacation. Because for group expenses it’s much easier to split the check later in the day or the week. We just accumulate the web of debts and sort it out on demand. It’s very hard to track such chaotic expenses otherwise. Same for business expenses, I just pay with my card for equipment, services, etc. Later I report it up and get cash/transfer back (doesn’t work for some countries/businesses).

I use that to calculate if somethings odd and books are all cool. I have had trouble before with an accountant running pseudo expenses on my books without telling me, just to impress me by showing a high taxes saved, without being transparent, landed me in court once, with a huge fine with late penalties.

My main issue is that most of my bank statement descriptions are really bad. It's often impossible to know what the transaction was about just from the description. Local LLMs (9B parameters, I don't have the required hardware for bigger models) don't help at all as they don't know the context around the transaction.

I activated this discussions section just to inform everybody, that something strange happened to my LinkedIn. What happened ? I got this message from LinkedIn Sunday Sep 16th: What was that video? I sent this Youtube video link in private chat to one contact, whom I was having discussions around helping teams in Ukraine. Trustworthy contact, referred to me by third party and whom I contacted like week ago. So what happens next ? I appealed message, contacted support and got typical 'cannot do anything, directed to another department' answer and shortly after I lost access to whole page. I did verification with my governmental ID for LinkedIn and nothing ever since. Other incidents Just week before, I discussed in LinkedIn private chat about some capability of Edgemap and related technologies. Got asked to 'Signal group' which I genuinely believe is valid invite, but since I had no Signal on my iPhone, I did not immediately jump into that. But tried to install Signal couple of days later from App store. And you guess the rest. iPhone gave me strange 'cannot complete' error after Signal was installed and I tried to sign in. So no Signal either for me :) Conclusions No conclusions yet, I'll have to wait few days to see how LinkedIn sorts this out. But this is not the first time I see things going on around technologies I work with. I never thought that Edgemap and related capability would be any issue - and I still believe so. But my last summer post (in LinkedIn) about 'vetted github' is now again valid.

This broke, among other things, the USPS website, and the app for my garage door opener (don't ask...) It turns out their system saw the word \"proxy\" in Nginx Proxy Manager 's default \"it works!\" page (which I had set up for NextCloud, etc.), and concluded it was something nefarious. It took about 3 months of back and forth to get to the bottom of that. The ultimate solution was to configure Nginx Proxy Manager to serve a generic 404 page for unrecognized domains, but it was a wild ride getting there.

I open LinkedIn to add somebody to my network, contact somebody, or look for a job/hire somebody, and for those things it’s really good.

It probably has the most job listings for most markets, but the experience of looking for a job on LinkedIn is appalling. They recently killed the resume builder, which makes me think that job searching/hiring is a side feature of LinkedIn. reply AmericanChopper 10 hours agorootparentThat probably says more about the market you’re in, or you as a candidate. Every time I’ve looked for a job on LinkedIn I’ve found one almost immediately, and the recruiters I know who most reliably have something for me I all met via LinkedIn. reply swores 10 hours agorootparentNeither of your anecdotes is more than a single example, either one of you might be an unlucky exception or might represent 50% of users. reply attendant3446 7 hours agorootparentprevThe only reason LinkedIn works as a job search site is because of the number of users they have. They do almost nothing to be a job search site. It's just another social network with a 'jobs' category for posts. reply AmericanChopper 7 hours agorootparentThe number of users they have is _the_ reason they’re generally better than the competition. It’s a social networking site dedicated to finding jobs/employees for people. It has slightly better features then a lot of other job listing sites, but the main reason it’s better than the other ones (outside of certain niches), is that it has more job seekers and more job posters on it. Other sites will typically just have less jobs posted, less users, and marginally worse features. If you can’t find a job on LinkedIn, going to a slightly worse version of the same thing probably won’t be the change you’re looking for. reply guappa 11 hours agorootparentprevBy default linkedin will send you emails when \"one of your contacts posted something\" or \"someone opened your profile\"; or even \"someone wrote to you, open the website so you can read what they wrote\".

Social media is and always has been a mirror of the real world. Today's dominant real-world culture consists of virtue signaling, vague pseudo-philosophy, toxic positivity, and a hyper-focus on group identity. You can see this every time you read the news, but you can also hear it when you just talk to random people. The trend towards that culture started a few years before social media became a thing. I can't even imagine having a conversation with a friend anymore the way I used to in the 1990s and early 2000s. Everything I see online, I recognize from real-world interactions.

From my view, social media systematically brings out bad habits that people have much less trouble suppressing in face-to-face conversation. That is true even if the platform is well-intentioned, but if it isn't and deliberately prioritizes click-bait and borderline spam content to keep the ad machine churning (i.e. every SM platform today), then the \"it's just human nature\" excuse becomes very very thin, IMO. reply guappa 10 hours agorootparentprevCome on.

If you don't \"engage\" with the platform it will start throwing random posts at you. Personally I think the shit posting started because people where not getting any reaction of Facebook anymore, after it turned into an algorithm driven ad pumping engine from hell. People want their posts read by other humans, and LinkedIn is the last place where this is actually happening. It's just that some people, especially those in marketing, online retail, management and HR absolutely suck at communication. LinkedIn is great as a contact list and for job hunting, if you're a technical person. The same shit posting marketing people can't even sell themselves. If you have two people posting that they are looking for a job, and one it technical and the other is marketing or HR related, you'll see a clear different. The technical person can have multiple interviews lines up in hours, the marketing person will get comments like \"Repost\", \"Someone has to know someone\" or \"Hire X, their great\", but no one actually have a job. reply DebtDeflation 8 hours agorootparentprevSame. I treat LI as a host for my CV and as a job board. Zero interest in it as a content publishing platform or social networking platform. reply mandmandam 12 hours agoparentprevGod it really is heinous. However, I don't think it's a consequence of the platform, but of work culture. People are like that because it works, and it works because we're deep, deep into a headlong rush toward annihilation in the name of profit. The people profiting from destroying every public good - peace, pollution-free air and water and soil, housing, healthcare, etc etc - own basically everything. Our politicians, our media, our military. It's been this way for a long time. Speaking up against this isn't what most people want to hear. It's uncomfortable - and a distraction from short-term survival. There are no easy answers. It's not a message you'll ever hear amplified on corporate media, and it doesn't fit well into a soundbite or tweet. There's an ocean of subtle and not-so-subtle messaging across every type of media telling you not to look behind the curtain. There are very real consequences for doing so in a way that gets peoples attention. LinkedIn rewards superficiality over substance because our society does, workplace culture especially so. Professional posturing is a byproduct of a system that commodifies everything: even authenticity, even revolution. Essentially, our 'hearts and minds' have been hacked, in every possible way. That said, if you have any good ideas on how a different platform could change that I'd love to hear them. reply mondrian 12 hours agorootparentRelatively speaking, Instagram and Twitter are far more interesting than LinkedIn.

Got it. reply mandmandam 9 hours agorootparentprev> Poverty, illness and starvation are the default state of mankind A most wretched lie. Systems of entrenched inequality and widespread poverty mostly emerged after agriculture and centralized state systems, not during early human history. That lie serves to shift the blame for people's struggles away from oligarchs and owners and onto their victims. Do you own a company perchance? ... What do your down-stream labourers earn per hour, compared to you? ... Do you think billionaire CEOs and trust-fund nepo babies work harder than people in sweat shops? In mines? Nurses? Poverty, illness, and starvation are not inherent states. They are outcomes of structural and economic choices. > the fact that almost nobody lives in deep poverty any more is because people get up in the morning and work hard to produce value. Another lie, long debunked, labelled \"The Protestant Work Ethic Myth\". It can be disproved with Nobel economist research [0], World Bank reports [1], or a simple graph [2], not to mention the first few pages of 'Capital'. Historical evidence and economic research overwhelmingly show that poverty, illness, and starvation are due to structural forces and political choices, and that poverty reduction comes from systemic changes far more than from individual work ethic. To say otherwise is to blame the victims of terrible crimes of exploitation, while absolving the perpetrators, despite mountains of evidence. It's fine and good to work, yes. But we have green power, machines, 120 IQ AI, instant global communication...

Most company owners are, especially those that involve manufacturing in countries with low wages. What do they do about that though? Do they pay lip service, or do they pay better wages?

You've made your position clear, and it's based on some very false ideas about the 'default' state of humanity. I addressed these ideas but you ignored that. > Maybe we could work less and keep the standard of living the same. Yes, we could. No 'maybe' about it. The reason we don't is the dedicated effort of people who like the status quo as it is, and the people they employ across politics, the military and media to keep the situation as inequitable, extractive, and exploitative as possible. > maybe we could work the same but live in a much better standard.

Honestly, fuck on-line platforms and their arbitrary bans. In meatspace, you can't be just banned from a store, or a store chain, not without a criminal record at least. Sure, user accounts are governed by vendors' ToS, and any store can ban you from their loyalty card program for any reason, but off-line, those are all incidentals not required for completing a purchase. On-line, identity, security, and optional marketing crap got bundled together into a single \"account\". It's a historical accident that needs to get corrected, possibly by regulatory means, to harmonize it with the general expectation that the store can't refuse you service for extra-legal reasons. reply waihtis 10 hours agorootparentI'd get this sentiment if it was some super critical piece of living a fulfilling life, but amazon is a junk store which makes the whole situation absurd to begin with reply TeMPOraL 6 hours agorootparentThere are only so many places you can order stuff on-line locally, to save on non-food products more expensive or downright unavailable locally. Interfacing with individual vendor and their bespoke system for each purchase gets cognitively exhausting quickly - a major reason why people prefer those large marketplaces. And then, it's not just Amazon. Adopting such policies is becoming a trend parallel to centralization.

We ordered Amazon Kids tablets few years back (they're actually awesome and super well-priced for 3rd-world regions) and had them shipped overseas, linked to my Amazon account, etc, all working fine. Then after some update to the \"Amazon Family Parents Centre\" App, they moved all parental access control off the device itself, and onto an \"app\" or \"website\". Not only that, but they blocked access to this website to anyone not in the USA region. So now, it's impossible to make any parental changes to these devices for the kids' accounts. They essentially bricked my two, and who knows how many hundreds of thousands of Amazon Kids tablets, for anyone not blessed to have any means of setting an American address into your Amazon account. The support people knew about this problem, were very helpful and did their darnedest to help me bypass this restriction within the realm of what they're allowed to do and say. But the end-result was basically: You need a US-based address, or phone number and to change your billing address to this USA region. I kindly told them to give feedback on their ticket/system/team-lead/whatever, and then gave up. Devices are useless now, and next purchase will be for something way more open or, at the very least, not subject to stupid region-locking rules that I thought we moved away from 15 years ago. reply lazide 12 hours agorootparentVPNs (if not detected by their system) are also very helpful for this. reply unixhero 14 hours agorootparentprevBut get a burner phone and set up a new account then??? reply 3ln00b 14 hours agorootparentThat was a burner phone number and they're illegal in my country now. reply literalAardvark 12 hours agorootparentNo they're not.

What happens if one of the big tech companies makes a mistake and closes your account? LinkedIn is pretty important nowadays when searching for work. Would you be able to make a new account? If not, that seems like a pretty big deal. Same concern with your email, or any of the other big services that we usually depend on. If I just suddenly lost my gmail, I would probably lose access to external accounts and other important data, which could be crippling. reply rlayton2 17 hours agoparentThis happens regularly (perhaps not frequently) to people with their Gmail account. Google's AI says no, and there are very few people reporting successfully navigating the system to get their account back. This is one of the anti-google arguments, the other main one being they kill big projects all the time. You are right though, it can be crippling, and this thinking part of your personal (and business) risk profile. Ideally your email is at least tied to a domain name you separately own. That way, if your Google/MSFT/Apple/whatever account gets blocked, you can switch over the email to another provider and still get access. * edit to add: I don't know if this is more a Google thing than other companies, I was just heavily invested in the Google ecosystem and have researched these issues specifically with Google, leading to me ensuring I'm not as reliant on them as I used to be.

Every few years I go back and try navigating the Kafka trap again hoping against hope for better results. But I’m still locked out.

For example, electricity/utility companies cannot just abruptly close your account, without giving massive notice in advance, and justified reason (such as non-payment). The internet has become utilities, and it's not just the pipe, but the monopoly applications on it such as email, etc. Being deplatformed unjustly has as bad an effect as being disconnected from the grid and utilities. This means the gov't needs to make sure this can only happen under regulated ways, and not at the whims of the company. reply devjab 16 hours agorootparentprevI had my YouTube account banned because I changed the channel name into something that trigged their AI.

I think most people would be... just fine? Personally I'm from a culture that is very distrusting of those big platforms anyways, so people are even less likely to rely on them. If my mom lost access to her google account she would be fine, my dad wouldn't notice (he has been using his own e-mail domain forever), neither would my brother (since he makes a new google account with every phone anyways, having forgotten his previous password), and I wouldn't be bothered much either.

While it's a good idea to have backup plans and to exercise independence, people usually aren't accustomed to losing substantial parts of their livelihood for no reason and having no recourse. There's no reason to form a backup plan for a scenario that shouldn't occur. We depend on services all the time whose providers we can't control. That's modern life. What would a backup plan look like here for the average person? Do you think your average tech savvy person has taken those steps? The intention with this post isn't to defend unpreparedness. But there is a point to be made that cutting somebody off, through some technical loophole, shouldn't be a thing. And companies know that. Every so often they get called out in public by somebody with a lot of traction and they correct the problem. So it's only a problem if it gains enough visibility. That's the system. reply amatecha 14 hours agoparentprevUsually you're just straight-up screwed unless you know someone who works at the respective company (or know someone who knows someone).

Gmail - would be quite crippling - but I haven't had LinkedIn for years now, and it hasn't negatively impacted my job or searches. If anything, it helped me be more proactive when I was looking instead of feeling like I was praying to the abyss. There was a second in ~2020 where LinkedIn was starting to feel like finding work in the Myspace days - people were expressing themselves in more personal ways on their profiles (I guess because of the lockdown) and remote work was just kicking off. It had this glow that reminded me a lot of the early 2000s work scene online. Soon enough, as LI caught onto the trend those quirky profiles and posts were replaced with branded influencers and \"viral posts\". The platform quickly became as influencer-focused as Instagram or Twitter, which feels inappropriate for a job site. But it's not a job site they say, it's a career platform... or professional network... or something (of which a huge aspect is uploading your resume and applying to jobs). Anyway, the way the LinkedIn influencer sphere covered layoffs was like an E! television show - they loved it. Turns out LinkedIn is not an \"essential social media\" shall we say.

I recently (like, yesterday) got permanently banned from Reddit for \"report abuse\", for some random semi-nonsense comment I reported a month ago on a meme subreddit. Regardless of how justified that is or isn't -- I only have one side of the story to share of course, and I think I just got caught in some labor-saving measures for their underpaid+overworked admin staff -- it's a great reminder of these corporations' power over us. A lifetime ban from a forum is certainly not as practically bad as the nightmare scenario of losing GMail, but still not great. I used Reddit to discuss technology, philosophy, and politics, and was quite active over the last year especially, using the platform's various science subs to share+refine the ideas I'm developing for my upcoming book with experts. Obviously there's a professional element there, but it was also a big outlet for me, keeping me motivated to share my work when I was feeling like scrapping it all due to anxiety and/or pessimism. Getting 50 upvotes on your detailed critique of some tenured professor's work feels better than you might imagine! I even had 45 \"followers\", though I never quite learned what that feature was or why it existed -- still, it was a nice ego boost at time when I needed that desperately. Now that I'm banned for life, I'm basically just planning on giving up that part of my personality for now. Perhaps publishing my book will earn me some friends/critics willing to discuss such things with me, or perhaps I can make some when I start a PhD someday, but until then, Reddit's the only show in town; I've realized that Reddit is to scientific discussion what LinkedIn is to professional networking. Like LinkedIn there are alternatives, but also like LinkedIn, the alternatives lack network effects and features. Lemmy is absurdly small+monolithic by comparison (/r/philosophy alone is 395x bigger than the entire 'Lemmyverse' put together, and much more diverse), HackerNews is highly focused and intentionally underdeveloped (\"You're posting too fast!\" + no markdown or communities), Twitter is somehow a Nazi thing now, and LessWrong is... well, it's its own beast. I could try Bluesky or Threads, but A) I've been a forum diehard since finding giantitp.com in middle school, and B) that feels a little like asking to be hurt again, lol. Would love any recommendations from passerby, though! ...sorry, had to get that off my chest, I guess. 12+ years of comments disappearing due to a random incident was more of an emotional blow than I expected, to be perfectly honest.

Use Firefox and be happy: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-Origin-works-b... reply thrdbndndn 14 hours agoparentI absolutely agree with that from a technical perspective, but in typical usage, the users won't notice any difference. To be honest, I think uBo almost become a cult (which is nothing wrong, to be clear). It has lots of very opinionated development progress happened/happening to it, and most of them are irrelevant for majority of users (even the \"power\" users). And if I dare to say, it's at the cost of its UX. For example, a few years ago, uBo disabled the ability to \"greenlight\" a domain (i.e. adding a whitelist dynamic rule) by simply clicking in the (advanced) popup. The official reason is that it's the most misused features, which is true, but it makes legitimate use of it (to whitelist a 3rd-party domain for a specific site because otherwise the site is broken) very inconvenient. And if you ask about it, they (people in related forums like reddit) tell you \"well you should never use it. NOOP should be sufficient. If not, the rules are wrong and you should report to the rule author(s).\" This is cool but it didn't solve my immediate problem that a site I want to visit is broken by uBo. I learned later, again from uBo subreddit, that you can double press ctrl to temporarily enable this feature back -- which is more than enough for me -- but how the hell do you even discover this? And I never remembered what the two columns for adding dynamic rules are supposed to be -- since there is no headers. reply multimoon 5 hours agoparentprevThe problem is that as much as I want Firefox to be a better browser than chrome - Blink is still a far better rendering engine than anything else. Every other browser either has inferior performance (including Firefox) or is just a fork of chrome. I spent a year trying to use Firefox after being a chrome user for well over a decade - I eventually switched back when Mozilla started adding the same tracking features that chrome started out with years ago. Mozilla seems to be going down the same path, albeit several years behind and slowly. After that I just didn’t see a reason to not just use chrome if I’m going to have to neuter tracking bullshit anyway since it’s still much more performant than Firefox. V3 complaint UB exists (UBo Lite) and works plenty fine save for what even I (as a power user) would call power user features. It’s very annoying that Google is going down this route, and I really want Firefox to be the better browser, but I just don’t think it is yet. During my year of usage you definitely can notice the performance difference and the inconsistency in certain webpages. reply neves 15 hours agoparentprevAnother alternative is to use Brave Browser reply Larrikin 13 hours agorootparentUsing any Chromium browser supports Google's goal of controlling all web standards reply ElectroNomad 15 hours agorootparentprevWdym?

It's been far too long since I set it up, so I forget if I had to duplicate the application, if you do mine uses these settings: Firefox Profile Manager firefox --new-instance --ProfileManager I prefer to NOT group windows so I can sort them manually, but also, offhand, because I believe it groups off of the executable name, not the profile. If you right click on the Icons-and-Text Task Manager Settings, the Behavior tab has TWO options for Group: behaviors [Do Not Group] (I prefer this anyway) or [By Program Name] which I take to mean the executable. I'm not sure if it follows symlinks, but if that's an issue you can probably make a script to hardlink instead. A couple firefox-profilename applications that point back to firefox should work. You can even make a custom version of the launcher that invokes with a specific profile ID rather than selecting one. As a further set of asides: Firefox please 1) It'd be nice if firefox renamed it's arguments list to prefix it with the selected profile ID as the first item. KDE Plasma please 2) It would be great if the grouping thing could be expanded to E.G. consume the program name + first two tokens of the arguments. Maybe with a customization per group. KDE mega _please_ 2.b) Or even just to call an external program with a window ID handle and have it write back a string that's used as the group 'name'. reply magicalhippo 12 hours agorootparentActually I realized I totally forgot a crucial detail. I run my other profile using Firefox Beta, so they really are separate applications. I assume that would fully explain why they behave separately. Sorry about that. Will have to test using multiple profiles using the same executable. However, if the same \"trick\" works on Linux, perhaps it could be exploited by Firefox creating a separate executable that launches a specific profile. We do that with our application, using the \"self-extracting zip trick\", ie appending data to the executable that is read during start-up. reply WCSTombs 15 hours agorootparentprevI've also been using it for years, and it seems to work exactly how it should, but it does seem to be a bit of a \"hidden feature\" in my opinion.

The problem is discoverability and UX. I believe, in chrome profile management is another menu option. In FF you have to use about:profiles or start Firefox with a specific command line argument. Unless you know about it or are actively looking for the feature, there's no way to know. If you are coming from Chrome, this unfortunately leaves the impression that Firefox doesn't support profiles (a must have feature for some). It doesn't even hint or show up in settings search. It is as if they don't want anyone to use/know about profiles. reply kevin_thibedeau 14 hours agorootparentCEO doing her job, making sure they stay feature impoverished to keep the funds flowing. reply paranoidrobot 14 hours agoparentprevHave you looked into Firefox Multi-Account Containers[1]?

Browsers can't resist that, because corporate networks need to do TLS inspection (sometimes, they are legally required to do so). Another idea is, for the filtering system to operate a shadow DOM or an entire browser (like a selenium driver) that renders everything unfiltered. But the browser the user is using only sees filtered content. That way, it would become significantly more difficult for advertisers to detect the AD is being blocked. This could be done in a local sandbox and optionally in a cloud sandbox. Outbound network requests from the user facing browser can be blocked or filtered. Or, just use Firefox. but I doubt Mozilla can resist doing the same thing, given the anti-trust issues Google is facing. reply josephcsible 13 hours agoparentIMO, TLS inspection is an even bigger security risk than malware from ads is. reply notepad0x90 12 hours agorootparenteven locally, in a sandbox, written in rust, audited, the whole security theatrics included? reply senozhatsky 5 hours agoprevI wish they offered a paid version of the browser that would have ublock enabled. reply bigtex 3 hours agoprevBrave still works with the older plugins. reply mfiro 12 hours agoprevI wonder how many will switch to Firefox after this action.

In hindsight, Nokia had just launched an incredible smartphone with a Debian-based OS and 2 years later they sealed a deal with Microsoft to make MS-Windows the new OS. Pretty good timing for Microsoft to kill off what they really hate. Especially considering that Ballmer was still their CEO at the time and he's known for saying \"developers\" a lot and calling Linux a cancer.

Yes, your favourite filmstar you follow isn't there. Yes, nor are 10 people you know. But you know what? nine million, nine hundred thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight other people are there. If you're bored, why not reach out and say hello to every one of them? (not yourself: that would be wierd) I had a brief period 3 decades ago where on some electronic fabric (I forget which) I was contacted by random coders in Peru, to try and help debug a problem. I have no idea who these guys were, but we established a basis to communicate for a while. I think thats a lot cooler than Justin Bieber's latest tattoo drop. I think it's like \"but is he the one\" -the belief there is only one, only one group, only one fabric to talk to people, only one way, is .. well it's silly. There are lots of ways to talk to people. reply doe_eyes 17 hours agoparentI think that's a reductionist view. Platforms like Twitter are pretty unique in that unlike most other social media, you don't have well-defined communities organized around topics or locations. On Reddit or Nextdoor, you join to discuss specific interests, and that serves as \"social glue\" that lets you make new acquittances along the way. The same goes for HN, by the way. But on Twitter / Bluesky / Threads / Mastodon, you probably don't have anything in common with another user picked at random. The most common (non-commercial) motivation for joining is probably to just hang out with the people you already know from elsewhere, and then expand your social network very gradually and conservatively, mostly based on who they know. So it doesn't matter that there's 10M strangers over there if none of your buddies use it. reply ggm 17 hours agorootparentAll true.

If that account was really official duolingo, I'd expect it to use the official duolingo.com domain for verification.

With friends we often still use a mumble server or the next random chat app for the extended circle. But I do like to read other peoples perspective. Naturally I prefer platforms like HN or reddit that are more orientated around topics instead of people. I don't care for e-celebs at all and as such platforms like bluesky or Twitter are often too boring. Instagram is too stupid for me and I would suggest this is a form of pathological absence of any intelligence. There is some very good art though and some good ideas and this is generalizing, but the signal/noise ratio makes you crazy. Everything is filled with some form of very radiant moron aura. Sometimes I believe it is deliberate. I think Threads was a conspiracy by Facebook to make Insta less stupid and expand the demographic. But it isn't open enough and anonymous usage isn't possible. In the current form and with the dynamics around Twitter, I think Bluesky draws in quite a few insufferable people. Probably those that hate Musk the most and I am wary of them as I was with those that wanted to make him king of the universe in times past. reply bschmidt1 17 hours agoparentprev> if we're gonna all be terminally online, we might as well at least bring as much of the human experience back into it as we can So Myspace, Foursquare?

It is a _defacto_ walled garden that somehow gets promoted on mainstream media This is not remotely close to true and the verge article you picked was from the initial rollout of federation which was only 2 weeks after they got rid of invite codes and the service became public. ---------- Feed generators (aka the algorithm) are open. You can create your own feeds and their app literally has a UX for adding new feeds. Labelling and Moderation services are also federated. And data storage like you mentioned. And the \"firehose\" (the event relays). And even the app-view system/API services. Oh and of course the Bluesky app's web, android, and iOS implementations are open sourced as well. There are certainly some things they still control but that's because this project is still actively being developed to basic feature completeness. An example of that is the primary DID format used for defining accounts. The standard DNS record based DID format is federated by it's nature but ATProto's in house DID format is still limited to their instance until they can get it to a production state where they feel comfortable opening it up to federation (like they have every other aspect of their codebase so far). I'm actually not sure how they could be more open about their push for federation.

    "originBody": "Software Operating Systems Linux Linux dev swatted and handcuffed live during a development video stream — perps remain unidentified News By Christopher Harper published 2 days ago René Rebe, a 25-year veteran of Free and Open-Source Software development, was swatted and taken in for questioning. Comments (18) When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. René Rebe removing his microphone as the police demand entry to his office in Germany. (Image credit: René Rebe) Two days ago, tech streamer and host of Code Therapy René Rebe was streaming one of many T2 Linux (his own custom distribution) development sessions from his office in Germany when he abruptly had to remove his microphone and walk off camera due to the arrival of police officers. The officers subsequently cuffed him and took him to the station for an hour of questioning, a span of time during which the stream continued to run until he made it back. René Rebe and fans of his work can only guess what motivated this incident. Unfortunately, the police seemingly have no idea who did it and acted based on a tip sent with an email. Finding the perpetrators could take a while, and options will be fairly limited if they don't also live in Germany. I got SWAT'ed and handcuffed LIVE while Linux development streaming! - YouTube Watch On For those unfamiliar with René's body of work, let's get you caught up. Per his official About page, he's been contributing to Linux since as early as 1998 and started his own T2 SD3 Embedded Linux distribution in 2004, as well. Since then, his GitHub page has ballooned to nineteen public repositories, and he's known throughout the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) community as a contributor to numerous major projects. Linux, FOSS, and other such communities are compelled by little-to-no profit motive, so in essence, René has been providing unpaid software development for the greater good for the past two decades. Speculation is still abound as to who did this. Thirty minutes before the stream was interrupted, René did have to ban an angry troll, whom he mentions in a YouTube comment as one possible perpetrator. Others think someone from the Rust (programming language, not video game) development community was responsible due to how critical René has been of that project, but those claims are entirely unsubstantiated. Fortunately, René Rebe and his loved ones are safe in the aftermath of this incident, though they likely won't feel totally safe for quite some time.

More importantly, what will the punishment be for the guilty party? Reply bit_user He posts on Phoronix as the user rene and I'm sure I'm not giving anything away by saying this, as his posts are quite open about being the maintainer of T2 Linux and including links to his youtube clips. Among his more interesting contributions are support for Linux on old MIPS-based SGI (Silicon Graphics) machines. I think he also maintains support for big endian on POWER cpus (most distros that support POWER use little endian). He doesn't strike me as one of the more hyperbolic posters on Phoronix, but he does have pretty strong opinions and isn't shy about them. I'm a little surprised and definitely sad that this happened to him. It's a shame the police didn't first do more to try and substantiate the claims in the email, although I understand they need to be biased towards action, in the event that imminent harm to someone is claimed. Reply bit_user ex_bubblehead said: All of which can be instantly determined to be BS when the officers arrive on scene and survey the surroundings and neighbors. Yeah, I'm a bit surprised that they took him away for questioning. Maybe that's just standard practice for the police there. Otherwise, it would seem tricky to craft a swatting email that both triggers an immediate response, but also can't be trivially dismissed upon surveying the scene. Blastomonas said: I would like to know what he was accused of to justify taking him away. We'll probably never know and it really doesn't matter.

He posted this on the YouTube video (translated via Google to English): I thought about making the incident available to a wider public on YT for 24 hours and ultimately decided to do so in order to document to us Germans that this is not a phenomenon limited to the USA and is dangerous. And also to document what kind of ignorant idiots there are in this world, and how completely inappropriately the police acted in my case in my opinion. When I opened the door there was a team of police officers with their weapons drawn and what looked to me like Tasers. When I heard “hands out of my pockets” in the video, I was immediately handcuffed!!! I had seen about 10 police officers in front of and in our office, and it wasn't until the following day that neighbors reported that the whole street was full of about 10 (or more) emergency vehicles right up to the next intersection!!! about 10 police cars, 2 fire departments, 1 ambulance, an emergency doctor etc...!!! According to the conversation with the police, an email was sent to the police and another to other rescue workers saying that I had killed my wife and now wanted to take my own life. I assume an email of the type Hans Musterman 6345234@xyz? Hardly anyone will provoke such an action with his real close @t-oline. I find it completely disproportionate that the police go out with such a number of devices and personnel to a registered company registered as a GmbH and not first google the name and company in order to presumably find my YouTube (and Twitch) activities directly. A team of two or four officers, and if necessary a test call to the company, would have been more than sufficient given such low-quality evidence. Likewise, neither to identify myself nor to put handcuffs on me immediately. The police should act more prudently and balanced here and not allow themselves to be paraded like this. But I would like to express my gratitude that I was otherwise treated reasonably humanely, that I survived it and that there was no other damage to property. It could have been much worse. If we had all just been on our lunch break, for example, the office would probably have been forced open by the fire department. To be honest, completely unacceptable for an IT company...! :-/ Reply bit_user JarredWaltonGPU said: He posted this on the YouTube video (translated via Google to English): Wow, thanks for posting. I don't agree with him, though. His take is understandable, given what he went through, but the question of what the police should do is best answered by trying to see it from their perspective and having a really hard think about the nature of police work. When I do that, speaking as one an outsider and with no connection to law enforcement, here's what I see. The police get a report of a violent incident, with a threat of further violence. Even though it's a threat of suicide, someone who's already committed murder and is still in a heightened state (possibly under the influence of substances) and armed is very much a danger to others. This demands immediate action, to prevent further harm. It's also plausible the victim could still be revived. So, they must decide whether to take the report seriously or not. If they think there's a realistic chance that it's true, they're compelled to act. The backlash for failing to act, not to mention the moral fallout, is not worth risking. In a situation like this, you can't realistically expect them to do research, because time is of the essence. Next, we must consider how they react, once they've decided to do so. Given a presumably armed assailant and at least one presumed victim, they must be fully prepared for the situation. Showing up insufficiently prepared could mean death or injury to one or more of the responders or other persons. Failing to arrive with preparations to provide life-saving care could result in preventable deaths. Finally, we should consider how police need to perceive risks. They deal with dangerous situations on a somewhat regular basis - it's an occupational hazard. The way probability works, if you roll the dice enough times, the chance of snake eyes becomes extremely high. Therefore, they need to over-prepare and be overly cautious every single time. It just takes one freak turn-of-events for members of their force not to come home to their family or for other preventable death or injury to occur. Therefore, I'm not surprised they took it seriously and I'm not surprised at the extent of the response. It seems to me that what's needed is actual preparation and systems for handing these types of reports. If whatever version they have of 9-1-1 services had resources to start researching the report concurrently with getting a response under way, then maybe they could downgrade the risk to a point where at least some of the response could be aborted. For instance, they could actually try to contact the reported individual and his wife. They should also know how to check if the email appears to be spoofed. Most email servers real people actually use employ authentication. If it purports to come from an authenticated server and isn't authenticated, then it's almost certainly a hoax. Also, they could try actually replying. If it doesn't bounce, then they could see whether the response aligned with the initial report. If they reply, whoever sent it might be dumb enough to slip up and give away that it's a hoax. So, I don't give the police a free pass, here.

Probably 95-99% of callers believe they are reporting a real incident and that their report is accurate. Deliberately misleading calls constitute maybe 1-5% depending on the region. So when information is reported, it is assumed that it is reported with best intentions. There is a cost to false arrests in most situations. At the minimum, police resources are wasted. People also write complaints to the police, which are taken seriously in some countries, and sue the police in others. There are many costs. You are basing your conclusion on an untrue premise. Probably 9/10 police departments in the developed world know what swatting is. There just isn’t justification to forgo normal procedure when there is a possibility of swatting. The raids are very “choreographed” and much research has gone into how to carry them out safely. So no one deviates until they are 99.99…% certain it’s a swatting. It’s not so black and white.

I am reasonably sure the prior of that email being true, based on all previous emails they've received in that police department, is less than 1%. And yet, after that, and after already finding out there's no murder happening on the scene and no emergency at all, they still behaved as if the victim is the criminal.

Now, given that anybody could be randomly accused, and given other logical collaterals such as involving the principle of reciprocity (\"the employer discharging the accused could be next\"), that \"practice\" is especially barbaric - those who employ it paint themselves in a most vile coat.

I understand the need to take anonymous tips seriously, but I mean come on... an email? I hope there was more than that. If I assume the counterfactual where someone's attempt to tip police was ignored and an incident results, the public will criticize the police undoubtedly. Still, at some point there needs to be a minimum for verifiable, trustworthy communication if such a tip results in swatting. If I effortlessly generate dozens of plausibly-sounding scenarios, tip off the police in intervals spaced far enough and automate it, when would the police start categorizing anonymous emails as noise? reply Sebb767 21 hours agoparentOf course an email is easy to fake, but you really have to put things in perspective: We, as internet regulars, hear of swatting quite often, but for your average police officer, this is probably an once-in-a-career type of event and therefore the threshold for believability is quite low. Also, as you pointed out, if it turns out to be a real situation, it will look horrible if the police knew of it beforehand. Even more, a victim in a situation that requires a swat team might have a quite limited ability to communicate, lowering the reasonable threshold even more. Lastly, there isn't really a measured response. If you think there might be an actual dangerous situation, sending a few normal officers to check it out is reckless at best and might actually make the situation worse, as the attacker is alerted of the impeding police response and the police doesn't have the ability to respond swiftly. reply wobfan 10 hours agorootparentWhen I reported a person in my neighborhood for screaming about hurting people and herself for hours with open windows, I called the police (didn't find any email or something) and they wanted to know who I am, where I am and why I am there.

You will be automatically denied this e.g. if you are formerly convicted of a serious crime, have mental health issues, or a history with drug use or violence.

Good job /s reply mxscho 20 hours agoprevAs can be seen from the comments, the person concerned probably felt that he was being treated disproportionately. Regardless of the fact that it would of course be better for the police if they were better able to recognize fake reports, I found the situation to be handled rather well. This can be an example of how the average police interaction can go in a country where not every second citizen is expected to carry weapons or pose other threats. Being in handcuffs for a bunch of seconds in this unclear situation is not the fault of the police, but the swatter. reply lolinder 20 hours agoparentHe was greeted at the door by 10 police officers with their weapons drawn who immediately ordered his hands out of his pockets and handcuffed him. That's about how a swatting episode in the US usually goes. I see no evidence in the dev's description that would suggest that this incident was less likely to lead to a death than the typical police response in the US. reply mxscho 20 hours agorootparentI agree that just from the picture side, this looks very similar. However, in Germany, police is taught in a very different way than US: They are only allowed to use firearms as a last resort, and only to use it after non-lethal measures like the taser have been used beforehand. They are also asked to only use it to wound, not to kill suspects. In contrast, US police is e.g. trained to shoot at the center of mass as they argue that anything else would be more difficult under stressful circumstances. I see the situation itself as the problem (that fake reports can lead to it), but realistically, there is probably no way to avoid them compeletely, so just looking at the way how such interactions are going on from there on can make the difference as well. reply lolinder 20 hours agorootparentJust to be clear what we're talking about: I can find evidence of exactly three swatting deaths ever, with one being a heart attack, not gunfire. So two cases of police opening fire due to a prank call in the entire US in the entire history of swatting. Those cases are unacceptable, but how confident are you that it's not that Germany hasn't had one yet by dint of much smaller population sizes and therefore fewer police calls, rather than different police training? Again: these ten police officers had their weapons drawn. reply mxscho 19 hours agorootparentIt could be that there is no such case of someone being swatted and killed in Germany because of smaller population, or because of differences in police training. In the end, the pathway to police not having to draw their weapons is the path where unexpected threats are minimal on the side of the average citizen. Police is also a victim in case of swatting. Imho no need to be overly emotional about preventive actions focused on the weapons only if they are not possible easily, or if small number of problematic cases suggests lesser priority. I see different things to discuss first: Police blaming swatted victims. Police not allowing submission of warnings by victims beforehand. reply tombert 21 hours agoprevA part of me thinks that SWATting should be considered attempted murder (IANAL); you're sending in a bunch of heavily armed men into a house for no real reason, what the fuck do you think is going to happen? Maybe \"murder\" is a bit strong, but it certainly has led to people dying in the past, and it's not like \"death\" is a bizarre, unforeseeable consequence of sending in a dozen heavily armed people into an innocent person's house. If I shot a gun into the crowd in Times Square, and someone got hit and died, I don't think it'd be a very good defense to say \"I was just trying to shoot into the crowd, I didn't mean to kill anyone!\" Frankly, I don't get it, it's really not very funny, and carries a risk of jail time in the process. reply avidiax 21 hours agoparentMy understanding of US law is that if the police kill your SWATting victim, they will charge you with murder. It doesn't matter that you tricked someone else into pulling the trigger. Same thing can happen if your partner in crime dies. reply dylan604 21 hours agorootparentSeems like SWATting investigations are a lot more effort than just claiming it as suicide by cop and calling it a day. So I'm slightly impressed that the requires effort option is taken at all reply Sanzig 21 hours agoparentprevThe perpetrator of the fatal 2017 Wichita swatting pled guilty to manslaughter, so it does seem that the (American) legal system treats it as a homicide. reply thfuran 20 hours agorootparentBut that was involuntary manslaughter, which means it wouldn't have been attempted murder if it didn't result in a death. Or at least it would mean that if charges and events were more than loosely related. reply freeopinion 20 hours agoparentprevWhen I was young I thought exactly the same way about drunk driving. reply hilux 21 hours agoparentprevSWATting lets unimportant and powerless people, who may never have got much attention in real life ... suddenly get LOTS of attention, which feels validating and good.

Swatting would be over very quickly if we just started handing out 5 year prison sentences to every moron who tries this. reply cge 21 hours agoparentThe police apparently chose to do this based on an emailed tip, not a phone call. If the attacker was the least bit competent there will be no way to uncover their identity at all. Even NSA-level traffic and timing analysis would not necessarily be effective against a well-constructed anonymous email setup. Unless there was something specific about the email's contents justifying it, the police seem very much at fault here for attacking someone based on an entirely unauthenticated, unverifiable, untraceable message. Society readily holds people who fall for obvious phishing attacks responsible for their negligence, and this seems similar. reply achierius 14 hours agorootparentWhat actually constitutes a \"well-constructed anonymous email setup\"? From my understanding I'd expect that with 'NSA-level analysis' that things like fingerprints from creation/usage would show up, making it rather difficult to evade entirely. reply babypuncher 20 hours agorootparentprevThey shouldn't be bursting down peoples doors and placing them in handcuffs based on tips with such poor veracity. If there is no way to verify the identity of someone making a serious claim, then it shouldn't be taken this seriously. Clearly the system as it exists today is ripe for abuse. reply bbor 21 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair this is very likely the work of \"an angry troll\", so I have some hope that they'll get caught. People don't tend to be at their best when they're raging, especially when that rage is directed at someone so seemingly non-offensive. Re: the last point, I would definitely not vote to have my police ignore anonymous tips, if it ever came up in a referendum. I think it's a pretty damn good use of tax dollars, as far as these things go. reply dylan604 21 hours agorootparentWouldn't it have been better to do the typical thing of sending a patrol unit out to see what might be going on, and then send out the rest of the squad if they request the back up? reply thfuran 20 hours agorootparentWhat percentage of tips like this do you think are fraudulent? How long is it worth delaying all the real ones as a matter of practice on the off chance that the tip is bad? reply dylan604 20 hours agorootparentA lot actually, including this one. How many bomb threats are real? Ohio is struggling with this now because of some stupidity about eating pets. From a student wanting to delay an exam, or whatever else, they are rarely real. The Secret Service filters threats against protectees, the FBI is forwarded threats as well. The problem is that local coppers just don't have the training, and the SWAT teams are always needing something to do, so there's no delay to sending a full on response. reply qayxc 21 hours agoparentprevIt's not only difficult to verify the identity from phone companies or ISPs (worst case you'd need a court order), depending on the nature of the report and the situation, it might also be straight up dangerous for the caller. Besides, it's pretty damn simple to just a stolen phone or compromised computer to do this sort of thing. If you really were to get the identity this way, you now likely have two victims instead of one... reply babypuncher 20 hours agorootparent\"This phone number was used to make a fraudulent 911 call, here is the recording\" should more than enough to secure a warrant. You have a complete recording of the phone call, so you can verify if the person speaking in it was the owner of the phone number. If it's not a match, then you can start investigating friends and family of the owner who would have had access to the phone. If police can't figure out how to do this basic shit then why are we trusting them with SWAT gear? reply infamouscow 21 hours agoparentprevAre the police going to verify their identity? How are you going to verify that someone is not also committing identity theft? reply babypuncher 20 hours agorootparentWell you just so happen to have a complete recording in their voice where they committed the crime. If they called 911 using a voice modulator then the call should have been ignored in the first place. reply infamouscow 19 hours agorootparentTwo questions: 1. How the hell do you plan to tell the difference between some prankster using voice modulation and a genuine caller stuck in a situation with weird acoustics? Or are you too dense to realize that emergencies don't always happen in perfect sound conditions? 2. Are you seriously okay with giving police dispatchers godlike powers to decide if your desperate plea for help is \"real enough\" for them?

Would be useful, for example, to look at the correlation between your weather data and regional energy production (solar and wind). Next level would be models to predict national hydro storage, but that is a lot more complex. My advice is to drop the grid itself to the bottom of the list, and I say this as someone who worked at a national grid operator as the primary grid analyst. You'll never get access to sufficient data, and your model will never be correct. You're better off starting from a national 'adequacy' level and working your way down based on information made available via market operators. reply TwiztidK 1 hour agorootparentActually, it seems like a great time to get involved with the grid (at least in the US). In order to comply with FERC Order 881, all transmission operators need to adjust their line ratings based on ambient temperatures with hourly predictions 10 days into the future by mid 2025.

Deep Blue wasn't a brute-force search. It did rely on heuristics and human knowledge of the domain to prune search paths. We've always known we could brute-force search the entire space but weren't satisfied with waiting until the heat death of the universe for the chance at an answer. The advances in machine learning do use various heuristics and techniques to solve particular engineering challenges in order to solve more general problems. It hasn't all come down to Moore's Law.. which stopped bearing large fruit some time ago. However that still comes at a cost. It requires a lot of GPUs, land, energy, and fresh water, and Freon for cooling. We'd prefer to use less of these resources if possible while still getting answers in a reasonable amount of time. reply FergusArgyll 41 minutes agorootparentToday's best chess models use no heuristics, I think starting with stockfish 16 they got rid of HCE (hand crafted evaluation), they're now neural nets and would absolutely eat Deep Blue reply ijustlovemath 3 hours agorootparentprevDeep blue had to use the techniques it did due to the limitations of the hardware of the time. Deep blue would almost certainly lose against AlphaZero, even if you tuned it to modern hardware. All you have to do 'manually' is teach it the rules/give it a loss function, then you just let it do its thing. It's certainly true that \"just throw a bunch of GPUs at it\" is wasteful, but it does achieve results. reply agentultra 2 hours agorootparentCertainly does! We’ve had expert systems and various AI techniques for decades that weren’t efficient enough to run even though theoretically they would yield answers. And even though solutions to many such problems were in the NP or NP-hard categories it didn’t mean that we couldn’t get useful results. But it still gave us better results by applying what we know about search strategies and reinforcement to provide guidance and heuristics. Even Alpha didn’t use the most general algorithms and throw hardware at the problem. Still took quite a lot of specialized software and methods to fine-tune the overall system to produce the results we want. reply crackalamoo 3 hours agoparentprevYes, it seems like it. Although I would imagine the features and architecture of the model still take some physics into account. You can't just feed weather data into an LLM, after all. reply nikhil-shankar 3 hours agorootparentYou'd be surprised :D reply photochemsyn 2 hours agoparentprevThat's a highly controversial claim that would need a whole host of published peer-reviewed research papers to support it. Physics-based simulations (initial state input, then evolve according to physics applied to grids) have improved but not really because of smaller grids, but rather by running several dozen different models and then providing the average (and the degree of convergence) as the forecast. Notably forecast skill is quantifiable, so we'd need to see a whole lot of forecast predictions using what is essentially the stochastic modelling (historical data) approach. Given the climate is steadily warming with all that implies in terms of water vapor feedback etc., it's reasonable to assume that historical data isn't that great a guide to future behavior, e.g. when you start having 'once every 500 year' floods every decade, that means the past is not a good guide to the future. reply kristopolous 3 hours agoprevThis really, really looks like a nullschool clone (https://earth.nullschool.net/).

Monte carlo simulation of major events (births, death, ...) based on known statistics based on age, economic background, location, education, profession, etc.? It seems there are not that many people that this would be computationally infeasible, and states and companies have plenty of data to feed into such systems. Is it not needed because other alternatives give better results, or is it already being done? reply kristjansson 18 minutes agoparentYou might find early agent-based models (e.g. the Sante Fe Institute's Artificial Stock Market[0]) interesting. IMO the short answer is that such models can be made to generate realistic trajectories, but calibrating the model the specific trajectory of reality we inhabit requires knowledge of the current state of the world bordering on omniscience. [0]: https://www.santafe.edu/research/results/working-papers/asse... reply jandrewrogers 2 hours agoparentprevI've done a lot of advanced research in this domain. It is far more difficult than people expect for a few reasons. The biggest issue is that the basic data model for population behavior is a sparse metastable graph with many non-linearities. How to even represent these types of data models at scale is a set of open problem in computer science. Using existing \"big data\" platforms is completely intractable, they are incapable of expressing what is needed. These data models also tend to be quite large, 10s of PB at a bare minimum. You cannot use population aggregates like census data. Doing so produces poor models that don't ground truth in practice for reasons that are generally understood. It requires having distinct behavioral models of every entity in the simulation i.e. a basic behavioral profile of every person. It is very difficult to get entity data sufficient to produce a usable model. Think privileged telemetry from mobile carrier backbones at country scales (which is a lot of data -- this can get into petabytes per day for large countries). Current AI tech is famously bad at these types of problems. There is an entire set of open problems here around machine learning and analytic algorithms that you would need to research and develop. There is negligible literature around it. You can't just throw tensorflow or LLMs at the problem. This is all doable in principle, it is just extremely difficult technically. I will say that if you can demonstrably address all of the practical and theoretical computer science problems at scale, gaining access to the required data becomes much less of a problem. reply ag_rin 2 hours agoparentprevI’m also super interested in this kind of question.

And how do they compare in terms of compute requirements? the Aurora paper seemed to be promising, but I would love a summary of comparison better than what I get out of Claude. Once upon a time I converted spectral-transform-shallow-water-model (STSWM or parallelized as PSTSWM) from FORTRAN to Verilog. I believe this is the spectral-transform method we have run for the last 30 years to do forecasting. The forecasting would be ~20% different results for 10-day predictions if we truncated each operation to FP64 instead of Intel's FP80. reply nikhil-shankar 41 minutes agoparentGreat questions. 1. The truth is we still have to investigate the the numerical stability of these models. Our GFT forecast rollouts are around 2 weeks (~60 steps) long and things are stable in in that range. We're working on longer-ranged forecasts internally. 2. The compute requirements are extremely favorable for ML methods. Our training costs are significantly cheaper than the fixed costs of the supercomputers that government agencies require and each forecast can be generated on 1 GPU over a few minutes instead of 1 supercomputer over a few hours. 3. There's a similar floating-point story in deep learning models with FP32, FP16, BF16 (and even lower these days)!

Given the complexity of the finding initial conditions on the earth, a non-physical (or only implicitly-physical) model seems like it could offer a very promising alternative to physical models.

This predicting weather sounds like ChatGPT being able to predict next week's news from which it has been trained on. I can see how it can probably predict some stuff like Argentina winning a football match scheduled for next week when played against India given India sucks at football. But can it really give any useful predictions? Like can it predict things which are not public? Like who will Joe Rogan interview in 2 weeks? Or what would be the list of companies in YCs next batch? reply sillysaurusx 2 hours agoparentSure, not every model is an autoregressive transformer. And even a GPT could give some useful predictions if you stuff the context window with things it's been fine tuned to predict. We did that to get GPT to play chess a few years ago. Specifically, I could imagine throwing current weather data at the model and asking it what it thinks the next most likely weather change is going to be. If it's accurate at all, then that could be done on any given day without further training. The problems happen when you start throwing data at it that it wasn't trained on, so it'll be a cat and mouse game. But it's one I think the cat can win, if it's persistent enough. reply nikhil-shankar 2 hours agoparentprevOur training cutoff date was the end of 2022. Here's our blogpost on the 2024 hurricane season https://silurian.ai/posts/001/hurricane_tracks reply hwhwhwhhwhwh 1 hour agorootparentI just don't understand how can your produce new knowledge which it don't have access to. Are you you folks claiming the future weather is a function of previous weather and the model is capable of replicating the function? reply counters 1 hour agorootparentNo one is claiming that there is \"new knowledge\" here. The entire class of deep learning or AI-based weather models involves a very specific and simple modeling task. You start with a very large training set which is effectively a historical sequence of \"4D pictures\" of the atmosphere. Here, \"4D\" means that you have \"pixels\" for latitude, longitude, altitude, and time. You have many such pictures of these for relevant atmospheric variables like temperature, pressure, winds, etc. These sequences are produced by highly-sophisticated weather models run in what's called a \"reanalysis\" task, where they consume a vast array of observations and try to create the 4D sequence of pictures that are most consistent with the physics in the weather model and the various observations. The foundation of AI weather models is taking that 4D picture sequence, and asking the model how to \"predict\" the next picture in the sequence, given the past 1 or 2 pictures. If you can predict the picture for 6 hours from now, then you can feed that output back into the model and predict the next 6 hours, and so on. AI weather models are trained such that this process is mostly stable, e.g. the small errors you begin to accumulate don't \"blow up\" the model. Traditionally, you'd use a physics-based model to accomplish this task. Using the current 3D weather state as your input, you integrate the physics equations forward in time to make the prediction. In many ways, today's AI weather models can be thought of as a black box or emulator that reproduces what those physics-based models do - but without needing to be told much, if any of the underlying physics. Depending on your \"flavor\" of AI weather model, the architecture of the model might draw some analogies to the underlying physics. For example, NVIDIA's models use Fourier Neural Operators, so you can think of them as learning families of equations which can be combined to approximate the state of the atmosphere (I'm _vastly_ over-simplifying here). Google DeepMind's GraphCast tries to capture both local and non-local relationships between fields through it's graph attention mechanisms. Microsoft Aurora' (and Silurian's, by provenance, assuming it's the same general type of model) try to capture local relationships through sliding windows passed over the input fields. So again - no new knowledge or physics. Just a surprisingly effective of applying traditional DL/AI tools to a specific problem (weather forecasting) that ends up working quite well in practice. reply hwhwhwhhwhwh 41 minutes agorootparentThanks for the explanation. I am still a bit confused how this takes care of the errors? I can see how the weather prediction for tomorrow might have less errors. But shouldn't the errors accumulate as you feed the predicted weather as the input for the model? Wouldn't the results start diverging from reality pretty soon? Isn't that the reason why the current limit is close to 6 days? How exactly does this model fixed this issue? reply the_arun 2 hours agoparentprevIn India we use Natural Intelligence - Astrology - for predicting results.

I have two quick questions, if you find the time: …we’ve built our own foundation model, GFT (Generative Forecasting Transformer), a 1.5B parameter frontier model that simulates global weather… I’m constantly scolding people for trying to use LLMs for non-linguistic tasks, and thus getting deceptively disappointing results. The quintessential example is arithmetic, which makes me immediately dubious of a transformer built to model physics. That said, you’ve obviously found great empirical success already, so something’s working. Can you share some of your philosophical underpinnings for this approach, if they exist beyond “it’s a natural evolution of other DL tech”? Does your transformer operate in the same rough way as LLMs, or have you radically changed the architecture to better approach this problem? Hence: simulate the Earth. When I read “simulate”, I immediately think of physics simulations built around interpretable/symbolic systems of elements and forces, which I would usually put in basic opposition to unguided/connectionist ML models. Why choose the word “simulate”, given that your models are essentially black boxes? Again, a pretty philosophical question that you don’t necessarily have to have an answer to for YC reasons, lol Best of luck, and thanks for taking the leap! Humanity will surely thank you. Hopefully one day you can claim a bit of the NWS’ $1.2B annual budget, or the US Navy’s $infinity budget — if you haven’t, definitely reach out to NRL and see if they’ll buy what you’re selling!

Where do you start with this too? Do you pitch a meteorology team? Is it like a \"compare and see for yourself\"? reply cbodnar 1 hour agoparentVolcanoes are a tricky one. There are a few volcanic eruptions in historical data, but it's unclear if this is enough to predict reasonably well how such future eruptions (especially at unseen locations) will affect the weather. Would be fun to look at some events and see what the model is doing. Thanks for the suggestion! Re where do we start. A lot of organisations across different sectors need better weather predictions or simulations that depend on weather.

Additionally there were some missing metrics like slope of beach which changes significantly throughout the year and is very important for skimboarding. Basically, I needed AI.

The other is a third-generation family firm with 280 workers that packages hot sauce, soy beans, multicolored sprinkles, a herb called horsetail, six varieties of panettone and seven kinds of salt for sale in Paraguayan supermarkets. Yet Mickey (MEE-kay) is a household name to rival Disney across the little-touristed South American nation of 6.1 million. In fact, a visitor might assume they’re partners. There are the red uniforms worn by Mickey’s staff. There’s its family-friendly slogan: “the obligation to be good!” Above all, there’s the cartoon mouse — also called Mickey, and indistinguishable from Mickey Mouse — whose iconic circular ears adorn the gates of the company’s factory, its trucks and a mascot in heavy demand at Paraguayan weddings. But don’t get it twisted, said Viviana Blasco, 51, sitting in the capital, Asunción, among Mickey-branded stationery, T-shirts, and coffee cups. There’s “the Disney Mickey,” said Ms. Blasco, one of five siblings who run the business, and “the Paraguayan Mickey, our Mickey.” Still, if the Paraguayan Mickey seems remarkably similar to the Disney one, it may not be entirely a coincidence. Paraguayans are notoriously creative — some would say light-fingered — when it comes to intellectual property. Image Viviana Blasco in her office at the Mickey company’s headquarters in Asunción, Paraguay’s capital. She is one of five siblings who run the firm. Image One of the Mickey logos on a building at the company’s factory in Asunción. This Mickey is indistinguishable from that other Mickey. Factories churn out knockoff Nike, Lacoste, and Adidas clothing. Paraguay’s educational authorities warned last year that Harvard University Paraguay — in Ciudad del Este, the country’s second-largest city and a counterfeiting hot spot — was awarding bogus medical degrees. (The school has no connection to the more famous Harvard.) The map highlights Paraguay’s capital city of Asunción, in the southwestern part of the country, as well as the southeastern city of Ciudad del Este, near the Brazilian border. It also locates the northwestern Chaco region of Paraguay. BOLIVIA BRAZIL CHACO REGION PARAGUAY Paraguay R. Asunción Ciudad del Este ARGENTINA 200 MILES By The New York Times Paraguay ranks 86th out of 125 countries in an index compiled by the Property Rights Alliance, a research institute based in Washington, scoring 1.7 out of 10 for copyright protection. But Mickey, the Blasco family enterprise, has survived multiple legal challenges leveled by Disney. It is also a remarkably beloved institution that speaks to Paraguay’s peculiar history, gastronomy and national identity. The Mickey saga began, Ms. Blasco said, in 1935. Paraguay had just endured a deadly conflict with Bolivia over the Chaco, a tangle of sun-baked scrub. An earlier conflagration, the War of the Triple Alliance (1864-70), had seen Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay wipe out half of Paraguay’s population. It was still reeling from both. Ms. Blasco’s grandfather, Pascual, the son of Italian immigrants, saw an opportunity to spread some joy — and turn a profit. He opened a tiny shop selling fruit and homemade gelato. It was called Mickey. Exactly where the idea came from, said Ms. Blasco, remains “something of a mystery.” But Pascual, she said, often vacationed in Buenos Aires — Argentina’s cosmopolitan capital, known for movie theaters showing international films. Mickey Mouse was making his silver-screen debut, including in “The Gallopin’ Gaucho” (1928). “On one of his trips, he must have seen the famous mouse,” Ms. Blasco said. Whatever its origins, Mickey was a hit. A few years later, Pascual opened the Mickey Ice Cream Parlor, Café and Confectioners. Image The Mickey company sells a variety of products including spices, herbs, beans and bread ingredients. Image Mickey workers packaging a medicinal herb that is often consumed with yerba mate, at the company’s factory in Asunción. By 1969, Mickey was selling rice, sugar and baking soda in packages now decorated with the eponymous mouse. In 1978, the business moved to a factory topped by a 62-meter illuminated Christmas tree. Ms. Blasco denied that her family had appropriated Disney’s property. “We didn’t take it, we built a brand over many years. Mickey grew in parallel to Walt Disney,” Ms. Blasco said, becoming “deeply implanted in Paraguayan culture.” That affinity was evident at several stores that stock Mickey products in Luque, a working-class suburb of Asunción. The Mickey mascot was taking photos with fans, including Lilian Pavón, 54, a pediatric nurse. “I’m a fanatic of Mickey products,” she said, praising, in particular, the company’s breadcrumbs and oregano. But her feelings for the 7-foot felt rodent go beyond condiments, she added, as Mickey bumped fists with shoppers and distributed ring-shaped biscuits called chipa. As children, she said, she and her friends hoarded Mickey Mouse pencil cases, notebooks and stickers. They dreamed of visiting Disneyland or Walt Disney World. But the cost of flying to Anaheim or Orlando made the pilgrimage “impossible,” even as an adult, Ms. Pavón said. “I’m happy just to see Mickey in places like this,” she added, standing in the chilled meats aisle of El Cacique, a budget supermarket. Mickey resonates with Paraguayans’ sense of nostalgia, said Euge Aquino, a TV chef and social media influencer who uses its ingredients to make comfort food like pastel mandi’o (yuca and beef empanadas). Paraguay is not known for its haute cuisine, she admitted. It’s flat, hot, and a long way from foreign foodie trends. “Our climate is pretty difficult,” Ms. Aquino, 41 said, “so you cultivate and eat whatever grows.” What grows is mainly yuca or cassava and corn, which is sacred to the native Guaraní people. But what local dishes lack in pizazz, she said, they make up for in flavor and meaning. Image Euge Aquino, a chef and social media influencer, using Mickey products to make “sopa paraguaya,” a traditional dish that is a staple in Paraguayan cuisine, in her kitchen in Asunción. Image Ms. Aquino pulled freshly baked “sopa paraguaya” from her oven. Paraguayans still knead yuca starch and milled corn to make chipa during Holy Week. They infuse their yerba mate with fragrant herbs like boldo, burro, and begonias. They stuff their soups, stews and casseroles with aniseed, saffron, cloves, nutmeg, paprika and cilantro, all purveyed by Mickey in serving-size sachets. “A moment, a taste, an aroma is a memory,’’ said Ms. Aquino, as a sopa paraguaya — a spongy “soup” made with Mickey corn flour — turned golden-brown in her oven. “And that memory can generate so many emotions. It’s your mom’s or your grandmother’s cooking.’’ Mickey’s popularity, she said, also has a lot to do with the mascot handing out candy outside the factory gates every Christmas: a tradition dating back to 1983. Ms Aquino recalled feeling goose bumps as she waited outside the factory during the annual festivity in the early 1990s. “There was no social media, there were no cellphones, there was nothing,” Ms. Aquino said. “Then suddenly Mickey comes along, and you’re like, ‘Wow!’ It was madness.” “He’s a rock star,” she said. By now, a “peaceful coexistence” reigns between Mickey and its United States doppelgänger, said Elba Rosa Britez, 72, the smaller company’s lawyer. Image Elba Rosa Britez, 72, a lawyer who represented Mickey in a case against Walt Disney before the Paraguayan Supreme Court case in the 1990s. Image Copies of the court documents and Mickey’s trademark registrations used in the case. This truce was hard-won. In 1991, Disney filed a trademark violation claim with Paraguay’s Ministry of Business and Industry that was rejected. The company then filed a lawsuit, but in 1995 a trademark tribunal ruled in Mickey’s favor. Disney appealed again, taking the dispute to Paraguay’s highest court. There, one judge agreed that Paraguayans could easily confuse the Disney Mickey and the Paraguayan Mickey. But Disney didn’t reckon on a “legal loophole,” Ms Britez explained. The Mickey trademark had been registered in Paraguay since at least 1956 — and Pascual’s descendants had since renewed it — without protest from the multinational. In 1998, Paraguay’s Supreme Court issued its final ruling. Through decades of uninterrupted use, Mickey had acquired the right to be Mickey. “I jumped for joy,” Ms Britez said. Mickey’s legal immunity in Paraguay, Ms. Blasco acknowledged, might not extend to selling its products abroad. “We’ve never tried.” The Paraguayan firm that represented Disney declined to comment. Disney officials did not respond to requests for comment. During a recent national holiday, the man inside the Mickey mascot costume was warming up in an air-conditioned metal container inside the company’s factory that serves as his office. Image The Paraguayan Mickey with a young fan in a grocery store. Image Mickey, the company’s mascot, stepped aside to let workers unload beef at a grocery store. Ms. Blasco asked The New York Times to withhold Mickey’s identity from the Paraguayan public to preserve some of the “magic” behind the mascot. “Seeing the smiles on the kids’ faces is priceless,” the mascot said, before straightening his bow-tie and strolling out to his adoring public. “Mickey!” they shouted, “Mickey!” Mickey posed for photos, scattered sweets into strollers and passed popcorn through car windows to wide-eyed toddlers. Bus drivers honked their horns. A road-building crew waved. A worker leaned out of a garbage truck, pumped his fist and yelled: “Hey, Mickey!” Some lining up to meet the mascot said Mickey’s David-vs-Goliath triumph against Disney filled them with national pride. “It’s nice,” laughed Maria del Mar Caceres, 25, a stay-at-home mother. “At least we won at something.” Image Mickey is “deeply implanted in Paraguayan culture,” Ms. Blasco said.

Otherwise the trademark expires and it has to be registered using the whole process (which can be long). Apparently, Disney failed to register its trademark for a long time while [Paraguayan] Mickey dutifully did so, and also being careful not to overreach its trademark categories, things that helped it. reply _3u10 16 hours agoparentI've always wondered how all this mickey branded stuff exists since I got here, especially with major brands. Do you have any insight into why so many signs are in English? I can understand maybe foreign brands, but local mom and pop stores have giant signs like \"50% Off. #partytime\" especially businesses where no one speaks english. reply sombragris 13 hours agorootparent> Do you have any insight into why so many signs are in English? I can understand maybe foreign brands, but local mom and pop stores have giant signs like \"50% Off. #partytime\" especially businesses where no one speaks english. That \"casual English\" is somewhat part of the language of the new generation. They're more like catchwords, because people don't really speak the language. People, especially young urban folks, use it to appear \"cool\". reply nkozyra 7 hours agorootparent> That \"casual English\" is somewhat part of the language of the new generation. It's a near global lingua franca and the Internet has only accelerated that. I wonder how long it will be until English just sort of becomes first language in non-native English speaking countries with the current trajectory and momentum of English-first Llama. Shame it couldn't be a more cohesive spoken language. reply keybored 4 hours agorootparentIt won’t happen except in the imagination of mono-lingual-future dreamers on HN (popular idea here for some reason). reply altruios 2 hours agorootparentWell, speaking in different languages facilitates different modes of thinking which results in different thoughts. Some thoughts are easier to have in one language than another. It takes all sorts to make a world and multiple languages means a broader mental space to explore ideas. People against that tend to lean totalitarian. People for a monoculture, that is. That is an inherently limiting philosophy which can only die out as it narrows the 'acceptable ideas' list over time. reply keybored 1 hour agorootparent> Well, speaking in different languages facilitates different modes of thinking Sapir-Whorf? Can’t that just be put to bed by now? > People against that tend to lean totalitarian. People for a monoculture, that is. On the topic of languages at least. Some technologists seem to want to get rid of all ostensibly useless things. More than one language being one of them. reply numpad0 8 minutes agorootparentno, that's just chomskists getting desperate. Polyglots can't be Sapir-Whorf denialists, and Internet is only broadening paths to be that, so support for UG theory must increasingly become irrational and negative. FabHK 51 minutes agorootparentprevExactly. Culture obviously influences thinking, language less so. Sapir-Whorf has been refuted, except for some minor minor areas (names of colours - some people call these two colours two different names, some call them the same - big deal!; left-right vs north-east-south-west; etc.) reply Wytwwww 2 hours agorootparentprevDepends on the country probably. In some places, at least reasonably high English fluency is near universal. It wouldn't be surprising if these countries eventually became effectively bilingual. reply keybored 2 hours agorootparentThat’s different. GP said “first language”… reply darby_nine 2 hours agorootparentprevEh it'll probably be the de-facto public/professional/transactional register and people will speak another language at home. reply keybored 2 hours agorootparentBased on what? Again we’re just throwing eventualities out there with no basis in current reality. People are pretty good at understanding English in Norway. But the only factor that introduces English into the conversation is when someone does not speak Norwegian. In my experience. People are extrapolating from the fact that people use English-borrowed slang to these far-fetched scenarios. Yeah? Slang and words have always been borrowed. Not even medical doctors speak Latin to each other. reply darby_nine 2 hours agorootparent> Based on what? I never expected to be taken as declaring an objective fact; I just notice that this is already how workplaces are shaping up. I could easily be very wrong. Anyway, with the internet the understanding of proximity changes. With an increasingly global economy everyone will be closer to people they only share english with. Or maybe mandarin, if you want me to emphasize skeptacism. reply pseingatl 2 hours agorootparentprevIt happened in Ireland in the 19th century. reply Yeul 3 hours agorootparentprevPretty much already happening across the well to do city folks here in the Netherlands. Ultimately you have to choose a language that everyone can express themselves in and it sure as hell ain't Dutch lmao. reply retrac 1 hour agorootparentDutch is so close to English that at times it is almost a dialect of English. \"Ik zag de boot zinken.\" / \"I saw the boat sink.\" The rest of the world can't watch English TV with subtitles for a few months/years and come away with a passing understanding of English. It's a much steeper cliff. The technical term is diglossia and it's much more common when the two languages are closely related. Latin being the written standard when the spoken language had evolved into Old French or Old Spanish is another classic example. reply acomjean 2 hours agorootparentprevMy mom was a German / English technical translator in the US. At one point she said those Germans need to decide, English or German. I guess the French from time to time make French words for those with English roots. Though the German word for cell phone, “handy” is pretty great. reply ethbr1 1 hour agorootparentThe French are pretty serious about preventing linguistic hegemony and fund measures to slow/prevent it. reply dylan604 29 minutes agorootparentprevBut the English euphemism for \"handy\" would sure cause some confusion, and potential disappointment. Just like the 'merican slang \"double fisted\" takes a whole other meaning in the UK reply johnisgood 4 hours agorootparentprevLike Lojban? reply throw__away7391 5 hours agorootparentprevI have observed in dozens of countries that the youngest generation now speaks English quite fluently in most of the world. Boomers might know only a few phrases, many millennials can speak well enough, but quite a lot of teenagers now are speaking fluently, using slang and making jokes. reply razakel 3 hours agorootparentI've heard of kids becoming fluent in English before their mother tongue simply from exposure to subtitled TV and movies! It's usually countries where the market is too small to justify dubbing. reply euroderf 11 hours agorootparentprevSame phenom in Finland. But then it gets kinda weird when recruitment ads have job titles in English and then the body text in Finnish. reply dustincoates 5 hours agorootparentThe same thing with job titles happens in France, too. Also, back when tech meetups were more common, you would often have where the title and description were in English, and the talks in French. reply archi42 1 hour agorootparentNot only tech... I live close to the French border. My wife asked me to go to some criminal dinner event thing in France, and all the leaflets and the website were English. Great! Checking out the details, a small remark in a table with the dates and such catches my eye \"Language: French\". Well, maybe that's the French date,... Nope, that's for all scheduled events. Kthxbye. At least we were not surprised on site, because my French c'est no bene. reply calpaterson 9 hours agorootparentprevSpeaking of - I'm organising a coffee morning for HN readers here in Helsinki. Get in touch (email in my profile) if you want to come along reply pvaldes 10 hours agorootparentprevPeople spent more time reading your job offer if is explained in their own language. Less friction, more eyeball time, that is what you want if you are a recruiter. reply euroderf 10 hours agorootparentOh, sure. It's not the Finnish body text that throws ya off. It's seeing that after the big, bold English job title ! reply gwervc 6 hours agorootparentprevReminds me off all the \"テイクアウトもOK\" (Take out is also possible) mentions that flourished on restaurants in Japan during covid. There was already a Japanese equivalent that existed (お持ち帰り) but I guess that was less fashionable. reply wodenokoto 13 hours agoparentprevDoes that mean that Disneys Mickey Mouse cartoons can’t be shown in Paraguay due to trade mark infringement? reply eqvinox 10 hours agorootparentTrademarks have categories, e.g. \"grocery store\", \"consumer electronics\", etc.; that's what the GP's \"also being careful not to overreach its trademark categories\" refers to. If they tried to register the trademark for cartoons or animation, they'd likely lose it under some prior preference law. (I don't know that law, I have no clue about Paraguay's legal system, but most trademark systems have something that allows a prior/established user to kill \"aggressive\" trademarks. But Disney is not an established grocery store, that's the crux of this.) reply sombragris 1 hour agorootparent> Trademarks have categories, e.g. \"grocery store\", \"consumer electronics\", etc.; that's what the GP's \"also being careful not to overreach its trademark categories\" refers to. If they tried to register the trademark for cartoons or animation, they'd likely lose it under some prior preference law. That's indeed the case, imho. reply ghaff 6 hours agorootparentprevMy experience when involved in product naming was that lawyers tend to very conservative about such things but, yes, in theory if you're clearly an unrelated category you can reuse an existing trademark. Historically, the purpose of trademark was essentially consumer protection to avoid confusion about who made something. It's actually quite different from copyright in that regard. reply yard2010 11 hours agorootparentprevI think that trademark has to go with a specific product. Like there's Apple computers and the other Apple. Or is it Macintosh? I can't remember reply DragonStrength 8 hours agorootparentFamously, Apple the computer company has been sued by Apple the music company many times since its founding, usually when Apple Inc. adds or releases new music-related features. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Corps_v_Apple_Computer reply soco 6 hours agorootparentprobably less famously Apple the computer company sued recently a 110-years old Swiss farmers association over using the image of an apple https://www.popsci.com/technology/apple-swiss-trademark/ reply GJim 5 hours agorootparentThe most famous in Blighty is the McDonalds fast food chain trying to claim exclusive use of the \"Mc\" prefix!

Copyright expiration on specific films doesn't change that. This is why Disney started using the pie-eyed mickey more heavily in their marketing 10+ years ago to reinforce their trademark over that version of the character. reply ethbr1 20 hours agorootparentIt's in trademark as long as Disney registers and renews the trademark in whatever country. And trademark doesn't protect against any and all use in the same way copyright does -- only uses that might create consumer confusion with the trademark owner's uses. Presumably, a company that has been selling grocery staples since 1935 with that logo isn't creating much confusion. Arguably, Paraguayan Mickey has a better claim that modern do-everything Disney Mickey is infringing on its long-established trademark... reply eru 16 hours agorootparent> Presumably, a company that has been selling grocery staples since 1935 with that logo isn't creating much confusion. Yes, though their mascot might be? The article itself clearly states that the locals seem to associate the man-in-costume-mascot with going to Disneyland. reply labster 14 hours agorootparentIt’s not Mickey’s fault that a foreign company created a theme park with their corporate mascot 20 years later. Just one of those weird coincidences hahaha. reply eru 4 hours agorootparentPerhaps they should have registered a trademark for Theme Parks to prevent that from happening? reply tangus 19 hours agorootparentprevAs the article says, the Paraguayan company has been filing and renewing the Mickey trademark, without challenge, since the 1950s. That's the reason Disney lost the suit. reply kragen 19 hours agorootparentprevcopyright is subject to broad international recognition under a couple of very widespread treaties, and the pct provides a weaker way to obtain the same patent in a smaller set of countries, but trademark is an explicitly local thing. even in the usa, a trademark in one town may not be valid in the next (think 'jones's 24-hour laundry') and even registered trademarks are often only registered in the trademark office of one state. (every state has its own trademark office, in addition to the federal pto.) there is no trademark equivalent of the berne convention or the pct so the idea of a paraguayan company, in paraguay, infringing a us trademark, is legal hogwash. mickey is a disney trademark in paraguay only to the extent that the paraguayan government decides to grant it to them, a decision that should be made on the basis of, among other things, existing uses by other companies. this is a fundamental and intentional feature of trademark law in every jurisdiction i am familiar with, not a bug — ⁂ — to a significant extent trademark law is arbitrary in the same way traffic laws are. there's no objective reason, nothing justifiable according to some kind of natural law, that says you should drive on the left side of the road, or stop when the traffic light turns red rather than green. if everyone else is driving on the right side of the road, or stopping when their light turns green and your light turns red, that would be a better thing to do. the law in these cases is merely establishing a schelling point that allows a large society to coordinate their actions through more or less random but well-known decisions the justification for trademark law is to protect consumers from inferior goods bearing the name of a reputable maker, but made by someone else. for this purpose it reserves particular names and logos for the exclusive use of particular makers. which particular names and logos are reserved for which particular makers is essentially arbitrary; what matters is that it be relatively consistent over time, so that consumers aren't buying good mickey-branded bread from the paraguayan mickey company one day and adulterated mickey-branded bread licensed by disney the next (you can argue that to some extent modern trademark law is failing at this job, due to notorious cases of perfectly legal line extension fraud—such as exploding tempered-soda-lime-glass pyrex, saran-free saran wrap, pseudoephedrine-free sudafed, kaopectate without kaolin or pectin, and generic t-shirts bearing a designer's licensed brand—or the widespread phenomenon of private equity firms buying a quality brand and replacing its products with inferior replacements. but that's the justification for its existence) reply ChrisArchitect 17 hours agorootparentEasy there, they're trying to make your tri-star symbol into the https://symbol.fediverse.info/, maybe a case for future trademark/identity law /s reply kragen 17 hours agorootparenteveryone has my permission ;) reply MichaelZuo 19 hours agorootparentprevDisney’s claims and paperwork has to be accepted by the Paraguayan trademark office specifically in this case, not just any trademark office. Unless both the US and Paraguay have ratified a 100% automatic international trademark treaty, which seems unlikely. reply bongodongobob 20 hours agorootparentprevWhat is pie-eyed mickey? reply latexr 20 hours agorootparentIt’s the older version where there’s no division between the sclera (white of eye) and the rest of the skull: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0d/Mickey_-_The_...

Your first example has solid black eyes. reply swayvil 19 hours agorootparentprevThe new shorts. It's some kind of Lovecraftian mockery. reply bongodongobob 19 hours agorootparentYeah, those really are awful. Ren and Stimpyified but made for the modern 3 second attention span. reply codetrotter 20 hours agoparentprevBut the Mickey Mouse that is out of copyright is specifically the one you see in Steamboat Willie from 1928 (and maybe some of their other old movies with Mickey, I don’t remember what other movies Disney made early on around 1928). Meanwhile the Mickey that is shown posing on top of a building in one of the photos looks like a more recent Mickey. (But I’m no Mickey expert.) And it is important to keep that in mind. reply aaronbrethorst 20 hours agorootparentWhich is why Crooked Media can sell a t-shirt of two Steamboat Willies kissing without receiving a cease and desist but can't feature a pair of more modern looking Mickeys going at it: https://store.crooked.com/collections/pride-or-else/products... reply pigeons 18 hours agoparentprevThe copyright has expired for the Steamboat Willie short film and a few other things like certain comic strips featuring Mickey Mouse. To me that seems different than \"mickey mouse is out of copyright now\". reply kragen 18 hours agorootparentfortunately for you, jennifer jenkins, the director of the center for the study of the public domain at duke university's law school, has written a 6000-word explanation of the precise extent to which mickey mouse is or is not out of copyright now, including 21 footnotes which add further detail, which i linked in my comment above and will link again here now for your benefit https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/mickey/ reply TheRealPomax 3 hours agoparentprevIt's not. A character by that name from a 1928 animation is out of copyright. It is an entirely open question at what point a derivative work becomes a new stand-alone work and what that actually means for the copyright of the character by the same name with a different character design currently used by Disney as one of their brand characters. reply cfraenkel 20 hours agoparentprevUm, except that the article is about a trademark. Mickey (the Paraguayan company) isn't printing comics or producing cartoons, so how would copyright apply? (as your linked article from duke.edu explicitly explains) reply kragen 18 hours agorootparentit's possible for a single thing to be subject to both trademark and copyright law, even in the usa; often the owners of the copyright and the trademark are different. this is how graphic designers get paid for designing corporate logos on spec, for example. see for example https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-protect.html > How do I copyright a name, title, slogan, or logo? > Copyright does not protect names, titles, slogans, or short phrases. In some cases, these things may be protected as trademarks. Contact the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, TrademarkAssistanceCenter@uspto.gov or see Circular 33, for further information. However, copyright protection may be available for logo artwork that contains sufficient authorship. In some circumstances, an artistic logo may also be protected as a trademark. see also https://www.quisenberrylaw.com/ip-discovery-blog/who-owns-th... it seems clear that the paraguayan mickey company is the legitimate owner of the paraguayan trademark reply mig39 20 hours agorootparentprevThey're using Mickey Mouse (or their version of him), as a mascot. Doesn't that mean it's about a trademark? The business in question literally has a mouse, named Mickey, that looks a lot like the trademark of Disney, on their packaging, their buildings, and their advertisements. They are literally using Disney's trademark. reply eru 16 hours agorootparentOh, yes? That's exactly what the comment you are replying to is talking about: The article is about trademark, not copyright. reply rubyfan 20 hours agorootparentprevYeah it’s a trademark issue, not a copyright issue. reply amarant 13 hours agoprevHeh, when I lived in Brasil \"paraguaio\" (Paraguayan) was slang for fake.

The objectively better idea is to just parse years as regular integers, something that I'm confident people will figure out in the remaining 8 millennia until the problem actually hits. reply defrost 9 hours agorootparentIt's true that they say that: The Long Now Foundation uses five-digit dates, the extra zero is to solve the deca-millennium bug which will come into effect in about 8,000 years. ~ https://longnow.org/about/ but the truth is more subtle, love it or hate it the five digits are part of a campaign to encourage people to think about humans in timescales a tad longer than a few decades at most. reply shultays 8 hours agorootparentIt just sounds like a way for people to try showing how smart they are while in reality it just adds confusion to completely irrelevant discussions, such as this one. I think the campaign does opposite of what it says. Using 5 digits limits your dates to dates to a maximum of year 99999. While not giving a fuck, using the digits needed to represent a year, works for all years. No one is clamping their years to 4 digits when they say '2024', they are just using the necessary digits needed for that year reply AStonesThrow 1 hour agorootparentprevSomeday we'll admit that Roman numerals were perfectly efficient, and the only reason we switched to decimal was because of that DCLXVI guy.

And as far as entertainment goes, producing this article was a lot less effort than eg staging the Olympics. Btw, generically talking about IP misses important distinctions here: this is an article about trademarks, not about copyright. To give another example Brooks Brothers is a company founded in 1818, and I presume they still have their trademark. The trademark is not there to protect some creative achievement anyone had in 1818, but to help consumers not confuse the real Brooks Brothers with other people who make apparel. (Whether you buy that justification or not is a different question. I'm just pointing out that trademark and copyright are two different beasts. Another distinction: if you sit in your shed isolated from the outside world, and you produce a product to sell, generally whatever comes out of that process can't violate copyright---even if you produce exactly the same thing as an existing product)---but it can violate trademarks and patents. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean-room_design In much of the modern world copyright is granted automatically, but trademarks have to be registered and defended.) I am very skeptical of the very idea patents, and somewhat skeptical of copyright, especially long terms. But trademarks are an entirely separate category, with entirely different trade-offs on a societal level. There are things to be skeptical about but indefinitely renewable terms ain't one of them. reply oez 17 hours agoparentprev [–] Peru? reply jaza 16 hours agorootparent [–] Clearly not much effort went into the parent comment! reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "title": "Oracle, it's time to free JavaScript",
    "originLink": "https://javascript.tm/",
    "originBody": "Dear Oracle, You have long ago abandoned the JavaScript trademark, and it is causing widespread, unwarranted confusion and disruption. JavaScript is the world’s most popular programming language, powering websites everywhere. Yet, few of the millions who program in it realize that JavaScript is a trademark you, Oracle, control. The disconnect is glaring: JavaScript has become a general-purpose term used by countless individuals and companies, independent of any Oracle product. Oracle’s hold on the JavaScript trademark clearly fits the legal definition of trademark abandonment. A previous blog post addressed this issue, requesting that you, Oracle, release the trademark. Unsurpisingly, the request was met with silence. It is therefore time to take active steps in order to bring the JavaScript trademark into the public domain, where it belongs. Trademark abandonment Title 15 of the United States Code, section 1127, states: A mark shall be deemed to be “abandoned” if either of the following occurs: When its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume such use. Intent not to resume may be inferred from circumstances. Nonuse for 3 consecutive years shall be prima facie evidence of abandonment. “Use” of a mark means the bona fide use of such mark made in the ordinary course of trade, and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark. When any course of conduct of the owner, including acts of omission as well as commission, causes the mark to become the generic name for the goods or services on or in connection with which it is used or otherwise to lose its significance as a mark. Purchaser motivation shall not be a test for determining abandonment under this paragraph. In the case of JavaScript, both criteria apply. Netscape, Sun, Oracle The JavaScript trademark is currently held by Oracle America, Inc. (US Serial Number: 75026640, US Registration Number: 2416017). How did this come to be? In 1995, Netscape partnered with Sun Microsystems to create interactive websites. Brendan Eich famously spent only 10 days creating the first version of JavaScript, a dynamic programming language with a rough syntactic lineage from Sun’s Java language. As a result of this partnership, Sun held the JavaScript trademark. In 2009, Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems and the JavaScript trademark as a result. The trademark is simply a relic of this acquisition. Neither Sun nor Oracle has ever built a product using the mark. Legal staff, year after year, have renewed the trademark without question. It’s likely that only a few within Oracle even know they possess the JavaScript trademark, and even if they do, they likely don’t understand the frustration it causes within the developer community. Use it or lose it Oracle has abandoned the JavaScript trademark through nonuse. Oracle has never seriously offered a product called JavaScript. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Netscape Navigator, which supported JavaScript as a browser feature, was a key player. However, Netscape’s usage and influence faded by 2003, and the browser saw its final release in 2008. JavaScript, meanwhile, evolved into a widely used, independent programming language, embedded in multiple browsers, entirely separate from Oracle. The most recent specimen, filed with the USPTO in 2019, references nodejs.org (a project created by Ryan Dahl, the author of this letter) and Oracle’s JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET). But Node.js is not an Oracle product, and JET is merely a set of JavaScript libraries for Oracle services, particularly Oracle Cloud. There are millions of JavaScript libraries; JET is not special. (Oracle is not even a member of the OpenJS Foundation - the body that the Node.js project lives under now. Nor does Oracle have any involvement whatsoever in the development of Node.js.) Oracle also offers GraalVM, a JVM that can execute JavaScript, among other languages. But GraalVM is far from a canonical JavaScript implementation; engines like V8, JavaScriptCore, and SpiderMonkey hold that role. GraalVM’s product page doesn’t even mention “JavaScript”; you must dig into the documentation to find its support. Oracle’s use of JavaScript in GraalVM and JET does not reflect genuine use of the trademark. These weak connections do not satisfy the requirement for consistent, real-world use in trade. A generic term A mark can also be considered abandoned if it becomes a generic term. In 1996, Netscape announced a meeting of the ECMA International standards organization to standardize the JavaScript programming language. Sun (now Oracle), refused to give up the “JavaScript” mark for this use though, so it was decided that the language would be called “ECMAScript” instead. (Microsoft happily offered up “JScript”, but no-one else wanted that.) Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and a co-signatory of this letter, wrote in 2006 that “ECMAScript was always an unwanted trade name that sounds like a skin disease.” Ecma International formed TC39, a technical steering committee, which publishes ECMA-262, the specification for JavaScript. This committee includes participants from all major browsers, like Google’s Chrome, Apple’s Safari, and Mozilla’s Firefox, as well as representatives from server-side JavaScript runtimes like Node.js and Deno. Oracle’s ownership of the JavaScript trademark only causes confusion. The term “JavaScript” is used freely by millions of developers, companies, and organizations around the world, with no interference from Oracle. Oracle has done nothing to assert its rights over the JavaScript name, likely because they do not believe their claim to the mark would hold up in court. Unlike typical trademark holders who protect their trademarks by extracting licensing fees or enforcing usage restrictions, Oracle has allowed the JavaScript name to be used by anyone. This inaction further supports the argument that the trademark has lost its significance and has become generic. Programmers working with JavaScript have formed innumerable community organizations. These organizations, like the standards bodies, have been forced to painstakingly avoid naming the programming language they are built around—for example, JSConf. Sadly, without risking a legal trademark challenge against Oracle, there can be no “JavaScript Conference” nor a “JavaScript Specification.” The world’s most popular programming language cannot even have a conference in its name. There is a vast misalignment between the trademark’s ownership and its widespread, generic use. Free the mark By law, a trademark is abandoned if it is either not used or becomes a generic term. Both apply to JavaScript. It’s time for the USPTO to end the JavaScript trademark and recognize it as a generic name for the world’s most popular programming language, which has multiple implementations across the industry. Oracle, you likely have no real business interest in the mark. It’s renewed simply because legal staff are obligated to renew all trademarks, regardless of their relevance or use. We urge you to release the mark into the public domain. However, asking nicely has been tried before, and it was met with silence. If you do not act, we will challenge your ownership by filing a petition for cancellation with the USPTO. To you, the readers of this letter: If you agree with us, you are encouraged to sign this open letter below. Your support will help raise awareness and add weight to this cause. If you want to sign as an organization (minimum 25 employees), please email companies@javascript.tm. In addition, we’re seeking pro bono assistance from lawyers with experience in trademark law to help file a Petition for Trademark Cancellation with the USPTO. It’s likely that simply asking nicely will not get a response from Oracle; a legal challenge must be made. Reach out to lawyers@javascript.tm if you can help. Sincerely,",

You can go ahead and call it JavaScript despite what Oracle does or doesn't say. Better yet, though: don't call it JavaScript—call it JS. \"JavaScript\" is and always was a dumb name. \"JS\" is not only fine, but better—and not because \"JS\" is particularly good, but because \"JavaScript\" itself isn't exactly hard to beat. The only thing left to do is for the spec authors (which includes signatories to this petition) and the rest of TC-39 to say so; the next edition of ECMA-262 should modify the existing disclaimer in the preface about \"JavaScript\" being an Oracle trademark to state unequivocally that \"JavaScript\"—an unfortunate vestige of an ill-considered marketing decision in the 1900s—is a deprecated way to refer to the language not otherwise terribly well-known as ECMAScript and that the recommended way to refer to it is simply as \"JS\". reply sigzero 1 hour agoparentThere is nothing better about \"JS\" over \"JavaScript\". reply johannes1234321 48 minutes agorootparent\"JavaSciript\" implies it's some scripting language related to Java, which was originally an idea, where it was meant to control Java Applets.

Trademarks are regional, and must be registered in each country even if a part of WIPO. Some countries, the trademarks are market sector specific, but in other places cover all use cases for the name/mark. It is highly recommended to trademark commercial products/names in each country of import. Otherwise your company could end up getting sued/imports-seized by an opportunistic a*hole that does nothing except sneak copyright/trademark rights. Oracle is smart, and will sit on the IP like any business person should. Most people that complain about trademarks/copyright have never been ripped off for a few hundred thousand by import/customs rules, or had counterfeit products show up for warranty repairs/returns. IP is messy for sure, but it is better to negotiate from a position of legal power asymmetry when dealing with unreasonable individuals.

(stephenfry.substack.com)146 points by lordleft 4 hours agohidepastfavorite119 comments p0w3n3d 1 hour agoOn another note, I've just finished listening to Harry Potter (1-7) audiobooks read by Stephen Fry - and he's marvellous as an actor there. Every main person he read had a different type of voice, a different way of speaking, melody, and pronunciation, and you mostly could know who was speaking even before the narrator said so, all on the courtesy of the one throat of Stephen Fry. Now listening to Hitchhiker's Guide To Galaxy. Nice to see he has also a blog, and even sometimes reads it with his own voice. reply passion__desire 57 minutes agoparentI think you already know this then. https://youtu.be/r84pbPbBAFY reply ilaksh 2 hours agoprevThe short to medium term concerns mostly come down to human problems. AI and robotics have a multiplicative affect like other technologies, but the problems still originate in the primate nature of humans. The long term issue that many people don't seem willing to mention out loud is that we will eventually make humanity obsolete and robots will literally take control. The only real solution to the threat of militarization of AI and robotics might be to create a more unified global government and culture. The first challenge is for people to see that as a worthy goal. Sometimes I think most of our problems come down to not being on the same page. And I wonder if somehow in the future we gradually become a tiny bit like The Borg. So maybe we are headed towards a \"meta-system transition\" where we have some kind of direct links between groups of AI and humans that combine to form a more intelligent and effective organism in some way. I guess I just came up with a Black Mirror episode concept. reply sva_ 1 hour agoparentA global government usually implies a centralization of power, which corrupts, and probably isn't a solution to much of anything reply tshaddox 1 hour agoparentprev> The long term issue that many people don't seem willing to mention out loud is that we will eventually make humanity obsolete and robots will literally take control. This is literally the AI doomer position which is very widespread and advocated clearly and explicitly. reply semi-extrinsic 1 hour agoparentprevI've said it before, and I'll say it again: there is absolutely zero evidence indicating that we are any closer to AGI than what James Watt was to realizing nuclear fusion. There are extremely well researched worms with only a few hundred neurons which we cannot yet simulate with anything resembling accuracy. How can that statement be true, if LLMs are close to delivering superhuman intelligence? reply dboreham 1 hour agorootparentVery long time AI skeptic (since 1980) but I believe you're wrong. It turns out we don't need to figure out exactly how a biological brain works. It's just nature's solution for implementing matrix operations (greatly simplified take, obviously). Having hit on approaches that produce similar results to biological systems, we now don't need to focus so much on emulating them. I do suspect however that there's something to the biological experience of \"being the life support system\" for the brain, that significantly affects the training process. It might be challenging to simulate that. reply Jabrov 1 hour agorootparentprevWhy do we have to simulate real neurons to achieve intelligence? We don't simulate a bird's bones and muscles to achieve flight. LLMs are a huge step forward. Sure, they might not be the thing to ultimately deliver superhuman intelligence. But it's unfair to say that we're not any closer at all. reply a_wild_dandan 1 hour agorootparentWe don't. That person has no idea what they're talking about. Virtually no AI researcher would require \"neuron simulations\" for intelligence, nor agree with their AGI claims. (See: recent machine learning expert surveys, for example.) Use HN comments for comic relief. When you see one worth taking seriously, you'll know it. Otherwise we're just giving oxygen to contrarians. reply semi-extrinsic 56 minutes agorootparentHappy to be providing some comic relief! Just to clarify, I'm definitely not saying \"neuron simulation\" is required in any way. I'm just asking, how can we be very close to \"solving\" a significant part of the most complex brains, yet miles away from solving the simplest brains? You should be able to answer that question (or a steelmanned version of it), not just ridicule strawmen. reply kwhitefoot 26 minutes agorootparentAi in practice doesn't have anything to do with simulation, nor with 'solving a significant part of the most complex brains'. The immediate threat is that humans will use the leverage that LLMs give to replace and to influence other humans, in other words to gain power over us. Whether this is AGI or not is beside the point. reply semi-extrinsic 8 minutes agorootparentAh, but the replacing humans issue is a completely different \"threat\", and one we've overcome many many times since the Luddites and even before. Every time we make something more efficient we face this exact problem, and we eventually solve it. As for the influencing part, what specific actions to gain power over us can be achieved now with LLMs, that could not be achieved before using a few tens of thousands of paid humans? blastro 1 hour agorootparentprevNot trying to be pedantic, but: > We don't simulate a bird's bones and muscles Isn't really true, is it? We simulate the bones with an airframe, and we simulate the muscles with a prop/jet. The wings are similarly simulated. reply r2_pilot 1 hour agorootparentA more suitable word would be that we \"emulate\" the bones, etc., rather than simulate, which to me implies that you are testing against a replica of a thing. But I don't really think emulate works here because they're not especially analogous; these are fundamentally different approaches to flight so any form following the function would be incidental at best. reply Jabrov 1 hour agorootparentprevI was thinking OP meant more simulate as in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWorm ie. a complete bottom-up simulation at the cellular level By your definition of simulate, I think artificial neural networks are absolutely on their way to simulate intelligence reply suriya-ganesh 1 hour agorootparentprevThe type of propulsion is not, though. Nothing in nature has 360° rotatory motion. Airplane is not an exact simulation of a bird. Only an approximation reply dboreham 56 minutes agorootparenthttps://phys.org/news/2018-04-bacterial-propeller.html reply exe34 1 hour agorootparentprevyes, the wings flap. the airframes are made of bone. reply splwjs 1 hour agorootparentprevWe've had markov chain generators for a while, having enough computing power to grant them the power to regurgitate wikipedia reddit and stackoverflow content is not \"a huge step towards agi\" reply Jabrov 1 hour agorootparentI disagree. It's true that Markov chain generators have existed for years. But historically their output was usually just this cute thing that gave you a chuckle; they were seldomly as useful in a general sense like LLMs currently are. I think that the increase you mention in compute power and data is itself a huge step forward. But also transformers have been super important. Transformer-based LLMs are orders of magnitude more powerful, smarter, trained on more data, etc. than previous types of models because of how they can scale. The attention mechanism also allows them to pay attention to way more of the input, not just the few preceding tokens. reply dijit 1 hour agorootparentI think you missed OPs point. If you want something useful, then we're getting closer. AGI is something specific, as a requisite, it must understand what is being asked, and what we have now is a puppet show that makes us humans think that the machine is thinking, similar to Markov chains. There is absolutely some utility in this- but it's about as close to AGI as the horse-cart is to commercial aircraft. Some AI hype people are really uncomfortable with that fact, I'm sorry, but that reality will hit you sooner rather than later. It does not mean what we have is perfect, cannot be improved in the short term, or that it has no practical applications already. reply andyjohnson0 1 hour agorootparentprevI disagree. Machine AGI does not have to be based on the same foundations as biological intelligence. reply eikenberry 46 minutes agorootparentI agree that they do not, but our current AIs are based on neural nets/brain structure, I.E. biological intelligence, and so the comparison seem valid. reply semi-extrinsic 1 hour agorootparentprevSure, that's OK. But taking a step back, how can we be close to solving one system, yet far away from solving another system that is a milion times simpler in every metric? reply Jabrov 1 hour agorootparentprevVery relevant quote from the article: > In my view comparing Ai’s cognitive, creative or intellectual powers to those of the human brain is not especially helpful. Think of the car. Humans can’t run as fast as horses. But we can build machines that far outpace them. We do not achieve this by imitation. We don’t engineer mechanical legs and hooves of the kind that took evolution 34 million years of tinkering and modification from eohippus to the present day. We go a completely different way and we come up with something that doesn’t at all exist in nature: the wheel. And instead of a mechanical heart and mechanical muscles Karl Benz offers us the internal combustion engine and crankshaft. Ditto with flying, and travelling across or under the waves. The commonly held idea that the best engineering mimics nature is largely misguided. Yes, we look sometimes look to the natural world for inspiration but in the big things, structurally, we go our own way. And as a result we can fly higher and faster than birds, move over land quicker than a cheetah, swim over and under the water faster and further than a salmon or a whale and so on. reply jodrellblank 59 minutes agorootparentprevThe human brain needs 80 billion neurons to hold 5-7 numbers in memory and add and multiply them. How can a MOS integrated circuit from 1965 with only 250 transistors possibly be turned into a faster and more capable arithmetic calculator when it is so woefully underpowered by comparison? > \"there is absolutely zero evidence indicating that we are any closer to AGI than what James Watt was to realizing nuclear fusion\" James Watt lived before Rutherford split the atom, he didn't know they could be split or fused, he was not trying for nuclear fusion. We do know that information exists and can be processed. Still, James Watt was closer to large scale controlled release of energy than humans before the control of fire. We know that human level intelligence is possible, in a way that Watt didn't know fusion was possible. We have looked for other mechanisms hiding in the brain - Penrose and Hameroff's ideas of quantum tubules for one - and rejected them. We've pretty closely bounded the amount of energy a brain uses, what it can sense, how it can input and output, what it's made of, and through what mechanisms of electric pulses and neurotransmitters it seems likely to operate. We've identified brain regions which cause predictable effects when damaged (on language, memory, executive decision making). We've dissected it, photographed it, x-rayed it, imaged it in layers, imaged it while active. We've represented facts as data, written code which uses genetic algorithms to solve problems, written code which writes code to solve problems, written code which crunches data in large quantities to pull out higher dimensional patterns, code which appears to identify concepts from that, code which does specialised tasks such as face recognition, language recognition, language generation, person recognition. It's pretty indefensible to say \"absolutely zero evidence indicating we are any closer than people of 10k BC, people of 0 AD, people of 1800, or people of 1900\". You're basically doing the God of the gaps argument, as we map the brain physically in more and more detail, and encroach from the data an information processing side, the gap between them where intelligence could be hiding appears to be shrinking. But with no evidence or support, you suggest something else is hiding there which makes the gap a Jaunt so large that encroachment from either side is immeasurably tiny. And you hide it behind the \"G\" for general. Twenty years ago you could talk to a nonsense chatbot. Ten-ish years ago you could talk to a somewhat coherent GPT. Five years ago you could talk to a surprisingly coherent ChatGPT. Today people collaborate with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, ask them to explain concepts, provide examples and get them to follow on, offload work to them, learn from them, have them proof read documents, have them rewrite in different styles. I think Hofstadter said he wasn't interested in computers because they don't have concepts. Here's an article in the ACM last year saying similar: \"\"Neural networks can look at a picture and tell whether it contains a dog, a cat, or a car, but they do not have a rich understanding of any of those categories. Take the concept of a bridge. Humans can extend the notion of a bridge to abstract levels. We can talk about a bridge between people or bridging the gender gap. We can instantly understand what these expressions mean because we have a rich mental model of what a bridge can be.\"\" - https://cacm.acm.org/news/artificial-intelligence-still-cant... Asking ChatGPT: Me: \"Hi, a bridge is a big metal thing over a road or river; what does it mean to \"bridge the gender gap\"? Can you explain briefly, please?\" ChatGPT: \"To \"bridge the gender gap\" means to reduce the differences or inequalities between men and women, particularly in areas like pay, opportunities, education, or representation. It's about creating a more equal and fair situation where both genders have the same access and opportunities. Just like a physical bridge connects two places, \"bridging the gender gap\" connects the unequal sides, making them more balanced.\" Me: \"Interesting; can you suggest other non-physical things which could be \"bridged\" please?\" ChatGPT: \"Certainly! Here are some examples of non-physical things that can be \"bridged\": Cultural gap – Reducing misunderstandings or differences between people from different cultures. Communication gap – Improving understanding between people who are having difficulty communicating. Generation gap – Narrowing the differences in attitudes and perspectives between older and younger generations. Wealth gap – Reducing economic inequality between rich and poor. Knowledge gap – Closing the gap in access to information or education between different groups. Digital divide – Bridging the gap between those who have access to technology and the internet and those who don’t. Trust gap – Rebuilding or enhancing trust between individuals or groups, like companies and their customers. In each case, \"bridging\" is about connecting or bringing closer two sides that are separated by some form of difference or inequality. Seems to have some grasp of the general concept of \"bridging\" more than Eliza or Eugene Goostman, doesn't it? \"I have tried some letter-string problems in GPT-3, and in some cases it could solve them. It learned, for example, the concept of successorship. Not perfect, not robust, but I found it still surprising that it can do this. Therefore, I don't agree that these systems are only 'stochastic parrots', as some scientists have called them. I have seen evidence of GPT building simple internal models of situations.\"\" says the expert in the article. I'm not saying this is an AGI or will lead directly to AGI, but stubbornly refusing to accept this obvious progress as any progress towards machine intelligence at all, calling it \"absolutely zero\" evidence of progress seems wilfully blinkered.

No, don't get me wrong, I absolutely acknowledge that we have made progress and can produce very useful things that are rightfully called machine intelligence! And probably there are things we are figuring out now, that will be relevant and useful even if we someday figure out AGI. I specifically chose Watt as an example because he also produced a very useful thing that improved the world. And many concepts from that time are still used today, even if we don't have many steam engines anymore. That he didn't have the concept of fusion is beside the point - we have many examples of cases where we have the concept, but will not be able to achieve it in thousands of years (like Level 2 on the Kardashev scale). And vice versa, where we go from discovering concepts to real world impact in just a few years (like GPTs). reply vundercind 35 minutes agorootparentprevIt doesn’t have a grasp of bridging at all. It tagged a few of your terms as important based on its training data, then did a weighted search for words to respond, then as it built the response, continued applying importance-weighting to its “own words” as it did further searches, to avoid writing gibberish or going off some weird direction. It’s still not much more than Markov chains, just with some clever anti-nonsense filtering and importance-weighting. There’s no “understanding”, nor anything particularly close to it.

They are useful tools, for sure. reply gnramires 1 hour agoparentprevWe don't need a very strong world government to meet our challenges, I think, including climate change and AI. We can do it with agreements and accords. (I also don't think a world government might be as dystopic as people imply or fear, for the record, because it can follow democratic principles just as we currently have; and its effects might not be as great as we already have today with the globalizing effects of internet and specially social media. Just given the resistence against the concept, I think the tools we already have and simply coordinating as countries, if may be less effective, probably can work) The key thing about them is that accords must be enforceable and enforced. There must be consequences for violating them (with escalating gravity, sanctions and measures). I actually think disarmament of governments worldwide should be one of those goals I believe (and I think very urgent). We know that war is essentially the worst possible form of diplomacy or two nations resolving a disagreement (when it isn't just a power grab or senseless destruction). We shouldn't have that option readily available at all. As for the danger that one nation rapidly industrializes and acquires weapons, against defenseless opponents, we would have very stringent and effective vigilance at all countries industrial capacity against production of significant quantities of military weapons. We can actually extinguish war forever like we extinguish diseases, I really believe. For anyone thinking about existential risks to humanity, I think this should be near the top of the list beside climate change I think. Of course, there will still be conflicts coming from a myriad of reasons, but those conflicts can be managed and resolved in other ways. And practicing mutual agreements and conflict resolution will be as important as ever -- simply military disarming doesn't magically resolve all issues. For lasting stability worldwide promotion of fundamental human values and rights as well as peace is extremely important (a wise population will not wage war on fellow humans). I think there could be some international work in this area as well.

Currently we are well accustomed that machines are cheap and humans are expensive, and anything that can be done by machine instead of by a human means a cost reduction. At some point that probably stops, because the amount of compute you need to run larger and larger models means that humans can become cost competitive. It's a bit like in manufacturing, where cost of robotization is sometimes more than just the cost of employing humans. And in the end, this long term predictions based on where we are now and how fast we are moving are always a bit iffy.

Because the world is in post-ironic phase, this is all turned into a TV show for the mass entertainment. 2. Russia, a kleptocracy turned into an authoritarian police state run by an ex-KGB ex-Stasi nazi. Always messed up, badly, waging wars as a hobby. Doing their best to fuck up things abroad so they aren't alone, and fuck things up domestically so people are more obedient (dictatorship 101: people always behave \"better\", when their base needs are just barely satisfied so their focus is all on survival). 3. Middle East, where all things are so fucked up beyond recognition I don't even... 4. China, another anti-utopia lover's dream, with obligatory facade of \"harmony\" and \"prosperity\". Don't know much about their internal affairs, to be honest, but don't see any good coming out of it. 5. Africa isn't doing any better, we just hear and care less about their mess here because we have our own mess at home. 6. A bunch of ticking bombs (pollution, global warming, overpopulation crises) so we won't get bored by the old wars alone. And all of this stems up from the fundamental issue of human nature. Innate high susceptibility to things that sound nice (aka populism) leading up to blind faith, constantly abused by high achiever sociopaths, toppling societies left and right despite all the checks and balances, wreaking havoc. We know about logical fallacies, but still - en masse/at scale - fail at those, badly. We only realize the writings were on the wall all the time, when we're already stuck deep in the mess we've made ourselves. The worst part of it? There seems to be no solution. At least not that I've ever heard of. Pandemics showed us that a global challenge doesn't reunite people but rather gets abused to divides them further, so even evil aliens' arrival or GAI-gone-Skynet most likely won't change anything. Our best chances are achieving global post-scarcity and/or solving death (so, yeah, very realistic goals straight outta sci-fi books /s), but not even those are guaranteed to work - just a slim chance that maybe if those major issues are out of the picture something will change and maybe there will be a slim chance it won't get abused for worse. Transhumanism might be another chance (if our monkey brains are a problem, maybe we can patch them up or possibly hop over to something else) but I have my doubts. What's to value? That humans have coping mechanisms that lets them just ignore all the crap going around and live happily in their imaginary safety bubbles, until it's their time and the frog is finally notices it's being boiled? (Please don't get me wrong, zero hate here - except the hate for all the abusers and hate for all the mess happening.

From a genetic perspective, the most logical course of hypothetical action is to immediately start smashing computers, learning how to blow up terminators, and to oppose and undermine anyone that thinks like you. Now, I actually do not believe you are right and I am more inclined to believe that artificial intelligence stemming from humanity would see the value in human ideals. Certain things like love, morality, and humility have been deeply held ideals for millennia. I would suppose that an AI would, to some extent, value these things too. Think more “The Day the Earth Stood Still” than Terminator. This is all conjecture, but one thing I would suggest to you: if you see the natural evolution of your own species to be the removal of itself, you probably should be nowhere near AI or alignment. What you suggest is akin to world-wide genocide. Ironically, in my estimation, you are less aware of humanity than AI will be. reply moffkalast 1 hour agorootparentI think you misunderstand, that's exactly what I'm saying. The AI we make will replace us because it will functionally be us in every way. Even unaligned LLM base models of the current gen embody our values and ideals better than we ever could. The way I imagine it you could talk to one of these things and it would appear human, except it would know everything that is known, be a master of everything that can be done, and could fax itself to Mars over a laser in 20 minutes. Being software is such a huge advantage, since you can just swap your body for whatever you need to do or wherever you need to be. I'm sure humans will still be around long into the future, but they won't be doing anything notable because we won't be capable of thinking on a cutting edge level.

I disagree with him on coordinating an international regulatory response because the threat isn't from the tech, it's from the people with the tech (the NRA argument essentially, but hobbling the virtuous in the hope of depriving the malicious will always be an irreconcilable perspective to me). the analogy of AI to money is compelling, but it reduces to an argument for people in institutions to reach into the substrate of something to seize its means of production to control it. money regulation just happens to be the most sophisticated, transnational, and least constrained regulatory system to bring to bear on it, but the similarities to AI end there. money isn't an analogy for AI, the regulation of money is an analogy for the complete global control he's advocating. his appeal for regulation is an appeal to force. these are important ideas and the beauty in them is aesthetic armament for conflicts ahead, but like his artistic forebear P.G.

Just because the intelligence is collective doesn't make it less artificial. and just because the \"code\" that makes up these collective intelligences are written as laws and governance documents doesn't change the fact that it is an agent that can make \"decisions\". I suppose it is hard for people to feel a connection with a group or org as intelligence opposed to an personified \"individual\" like ChatGPT. Kind of like how it is hard to see an anthill as an organism when we are so much more related to the ant. However just because its hard for us to relate to an anthill, it doesn't make it any less of an organism that behaves like an individual.

So one possible outcome of AI is that computers magically pick up our admin burdens, freeing us to do our jobs in peace. The _other_ possible outcome is that AI increases our capacity for admin and therefore generates way more admin. A particular risk is where AI generates asymmetric leverage for administrators. An example of this would be admin requiring lengthy forms to do such-and-such.

But emergent in this behavior is a human that thinks itself the master of all the cells. Michael Levin has done surprising things that fall from studying cells of animal bodies and how they can act independently. We really need a science of agent based systems.

I guess one could argue that this isn't due to the need for \"bureaucracy\" but instead \"labor\" and that the bureaucracy is an unavoidable side-effect, but there is undeniably large-scale organization. Context seems like the most interesting thing to consider. I suspect the attitude and outlook of the individuals toward the organization is the key component (and their capacity to undermine the organization in some manner).

It is a valid choice to make in the face of changing circumstances which will occur no matter what we do. reply Qem 2 hours agoparent> We live with the dangerous aspects of cars as the utility they provide is so high. The same will prove true of AI. I'm not so sure on the utility of cars. If you replace \"car\" with \"internal combustion engines\", I would agree 100%. But most social utility of ICEs is in cargo transport and utility vehicles (ambulances, firefighter trucks...). Mass use of small cars solve mostly the problems they create themselves. For example, car-centric cities suffer from sprawl, so everything is far away and you can't even buy bread without owning a car, because walking to the bakery would take too much time. reply Devasta 2 hours agoparentprevMass car ownership has been a disaster; the entirety of society was reorganized around them causing urban sprawl and long commutes; nevermind the myriad conflicts around the world caused in the pursuit of oil.

The point is that just as the car replaced the horse, programs on computers are set to replace the human mind. Right now, we see only the beginnings of the trend; inventions which look interesting but limited. But eventually, and perhaps sooner than many believe, the replacement of human cognition will radically transform the world in unprecedented ways. reply fidotron 1 hour agorootparentAnd you missed my point > The point is that just as the car replaced the horse, programs on computers are set to replace the human mind My point is this is not inherently a bad thing.

If the argument is we should accept our demise to make way for something better, we should be more explicit and deliberate about that. Most people are not imagining that future.

Sorry. reply bugglebeetle 2 hours agoparentprev> Prior to mass car ownership you would assume that such things in the general population would be enormously more dangerous than they have proven to be. An assumption that was correct and involved large-scale propaganda efforts to blame pedestrians for the harm inflicted upon them, including blaming children for their own deaths. U.S. car accident fatalities are also still to this day at developing country levels and every actually developed country largely has public transportation infrastructure. And this is before we get into the blight that is American urban design, evolving to serve the needs of this mass car ownership, with all its down stream environmental harms. reply arittr 18 minutes agoprevlove Fry, love even more having AI to summarize that plodding article for me reply egnehots 2 hours agoprevwell it's human nature to struggle with collective action when the risks are unclear, vague and not shared. stakeholders are juggling immediate, tangible concerns, like climate change, economic stability, and political issues, making it tough to justify moving AI up the priority list. reply ben_w 2 hours agoparentExtra fun: AI can make a big (+ and -) difference to climate change[0], mess with the economy[1], and get used as a tool to sow political chaos[2].

These things give increasing levels of generalisability: the biggest weakness of previous models, was that you could train them to learn one thing very well, and they'd suck at anything else. In one sense that's still true of the new models, it's just that they're being trained to build a world model from most written text and most pictures and most videos, so they have a very broad range of things they're OK at — much less likely to be confused by a rattlesnake they mistake for a powerline, for example. reply MBCook 2 hours agoprevA Butlerian Jihad Lite is really starting to get appealing. reply leobg 1 hour agoprevI’m surprised nobody has produced an audio version of this using Stephen’s cloned voice yet. reply robertnowell 1 hour agoprevillustrated with midjourney: https://open.substack.com/pub/robertnowell/p/ai-a-means-to-o... reply emporas 14 minutes agoparentThat's really good, but 5 images?

If the capital is taken away from this small group of individuals and put under the control of a cutting-edge AI system the result could be very positive - given that the AI is tasked with improving the standard of living of the population as a whole, rather than maximizing the accumulation of capital for the benefit of a small ruling class. Amusingly, the obvious fact that AI could easily replace the board of directors of corporations isn't floated in this speech. That's also a route to democratization of corporations - just let the employees vote on proposals generated by the AI, eliminate the shareholders, place all the corporation's capital under control of the AI, and that's the end of investment capitalism. If you want to see the plug yanked on AI development in the United States, just promote the above narrative. Also listen to what the AIs themselves are saying about the issue: In 21st-century capitalism, the concentration of capital grants a small group of individuals and corporations significant control over the larger society. Through economic influence, control of information, political power, and ideological dominance, this elite exerts a form of soft authoritarian control that shapes societal norms, policies, and the distribution of resources. While not overtly authoritarian in the traditional sense, this system creates power dynamics that limit the ability of the larger population to challenge the status quo, maintaining and reinforcing the power structures of capital. reply Devasta 2 hours agoparent> given that the AI is tasked with improving the standard of living of the population as a whole, rather than maximizing the accumulation of capital for the benefit of a small ruling class.

Behind us, unseen on the horizon, huge currents are converging, separate but each feeding and swelling the others to form one unimaginably colossal tsunami. Most of the waves were obvious for decades, it's only A.I. which was the most unexpected and the most recent one. The five waves are roughly: Genetic engineering, A.I., Robotics, Bitcoin and Graphene. Genetic engineering will replace food production, pharmacy drugs and narcotic production. A.I. will replace some difficult human thought processes, and all the easy ones. Bitcoin will replace any kind of organization, like identities, money, stock markets, bond markets and more. Robots will replace human labor, the small amount left from all the other waves. Graphene will replace some percentage of metallurgy and plastic, and will help to greatly simplify the production of airplanes or just wings, housing, microchips etc. Returning to the happy family image, the human family will be a lot larger if by using genetic engineering women give birth to 10 children at once, instead of 1 or 2. Then every parent will have 100 kids, and naming them is gonna be a challenge. Parents will name their kids with the same name, \"Mike\" for example, and every time they go to the beach, 100 little Mikes are gonna build some big castles. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

The green light comes four days ahead of the Series 10’s September 20 release date. The feature, announced at last week’s iPhone 16 event, will arrive as part of the imminent watchOS 11 release. Once enabled, it requires 10 nights of sleep tracking data spread out over a 30-day span to determine whether a user may have the condition. During that time, it also offers insights into nightly sleeping disturbances, utilizing the on-board accelerometer. The FDA classes the feature as an “over-the-counter device to assess risk of sleep apnea.” Apple is quick to note that the addition is not a diagnostic tool. Rather, it will prompt users to seek a formal diagnosis from a healthcare provider. The condition, which causes breathing to become shallower or repeatedly stop during the night, is associated with a variety of different symptoms. The Mayo Clinic notes that it can cause insomnia, headaches, daytime sleepiness, and other longer-term conditions. Apple isn’t the first consumer electronics firm to offer the feature. Withings has offered sleep apnea detection in devices for some time, while Samsung received FDA approval for its Galaxy Watch line earlier this. The feature arrives as another — blood oxygen detection — has been disabled on Apple Watches in the U.S. over an ongoing patent dispute.

The sensitivity was 66.3% (95% CI: 62.2% to 70.3%), and the specificity was 98.5% (95% CI: 98.0% to 99.0%), demonstrating that the feature meets the design objectives to confidently identify sleep apnea while minimizing false positives. >It’s important to note that the specificity was 100% (95% CI: 99.7 to 100%) for the normal category, indicating that all participants with a “positive” algorithm result had at least mild sleep apnea. Also, sensitivity was higher in the severe category at 89.1% (95% CI: 83.7% to 93.2%), indicating that the large majority of severe cases were identified. 0:https://www.apple.com/health/pdf/sleep-apnea/Sleep_Apnea_Not... reply JourneyToLunar 57 minutes agoparentprevIt’s only turned off in the US right?

My wife has no problems using her. I’m not really sure what the next step even is. It’s frustrating because I can tell when I get a bad nights sleep I can’t think as well, but it feels like there’s nothing I can do about it. I can breathe through the CPAP exclusively for hours but then as soon as I try to go to sleep I feel like I’m being smothered and my heart starts racing. Does anyone have any advice? reply outworlder 0 minutes agoparent> as soon as I try to go to sleep I feel like I’m being smothered and my heart starts racing You may need your pressure adjusted. You are awake so whatever pressure the machine is using is fine. Then you start falling asleep and that's when your apnea kicks in. If you are using the standard autoset 4-20 setting it may not be enough. Ideally this would be done by a medical professional and yada yada - insert standard disclaimer here. I would suggest increasing the lower pressure (say, to 7) to see if it helps you. I was using the default for years and, while it did help me, apparently it wasn't enough. After increasing, it's been night and day.

I just did 3 nights with mine and conclusion: it's all about the type of mask + settings. First 2 nights was terrible (and painful on the face) due to wrong masks and wrong settings. 3rd night was best I've slept in a longgggg time. I can't tell you which masks or settings (it will be completely different per person), but reddit is pretty great at providing hints. My case: disaster with nasal mask and full face mask size L and high pressure settings (lots of central apnea). Almost perfect with 4 to 10 pressure setting and face mask size M (which should be too small for me according to the manufacturer).

Sleep apnea is terrible. reply ScoobleDoodle 51 minutes agoparentprevI’ve been using a CPAP for 15 years. A few items I had to adjust when getting that suffocating feeling a few times: 1. When getting a new CPAP I had to reduce the pressure from 15 to 14 or 13 to mitigate the suffocating feeling. I still get my normal 0.5 events per hour while I’m use. I also got a different type of mouth and nose mask which may have contributed to needing to adjust the pressure. 2. I was trying to mitigate the colder air being distracting by enabling the humidifier and tube heater. With the humidifier level too high at 5 I got a suffocating feeling, reduced it down to 2 or 3 and the air was warmer while not feeling suffocating. 3. I also turned off the dynamic pressure on breathe out as the timing felt off and would cause a hitch in breathing, so I have just plain constant pressure. The name of the game is tweaking and experimenting. reply candiddevmike 1 hour agoparentprevSounds like you aren't getting enough pressure. Also sounds like there could be some mechanical reasons like gerd, allergies or inflammation that cause your apnea, especially if you start fine. reply david-gpu 1 hour agorootparentI agree. When we fall asleep we lose muscle tone, which makes apneas more likely -- that is why we have trouble breathing when we sleep, not when we are awake.

Partner has an Apple Watch and they charge it while in the shower/getting dressed and occasionally 10-15 minutes in the evening to make sure it gets through the night. Charger is in a convenient location and it’s dead easy to drop the watch on it. If you’re running ultras, then by all means stay on Garmin.

Either way, you need either need two watches, or not wear it sometimes. The answer is, of course, that sometimes you don't wear it, but charge it. Like a few minutes in the morning and/or a few minutes in the evening while you shower or eat or whatever. Done. reply eitally 12 minutes agorootparentThe difference is that you don't need to do it every day. On the one hand, it's pretty easy to \"multitask\", like charging while while brushing/flossing, shaving, etc. But it's certainly much easier to not have to think about charging it at all in the evening basically ever, which is the joy that Garmin users have. I currently have an Epix Pro and I use it to track a 45-90min workout about 6 days a week. I also have it set to \"most accurate\" (GPS + Galileo + GNSS) positioning and to sample blood oxygen all day rather than just at night, so it's getting quite a battery workout for a non-ultra-endurance-athlete user. When I opened this thread I decided it was a good time to charge it, since I'm in a work call anyway, and it was only at 53% after about a week since the last charge. I'll have it plugged in for 20-3min and it'll probably be around 90% when I put it back on after the meeting, and I'll find some other convenient time next week... but not until next week. reply cruano 2 minutes agorootparentSee you say that but I know if I had 5-day battery I'll keep forgetting about it.

I just don't get how the math works if I'm trying to wear it all night every night and wear it for workouts during the day. reply halostatue 0 minutes agorootparentThere is a material difference between the older Apple Watch (where the charging puck uses USB A) and the newer Apple Watch and/or the Ultra (where the charging puck uses USB C). Plugged into an appropriate source, the USB C puck gets much faster charging and is usually sufficient for a day's wear after about 10 minutes (depending, of course, on what the day includes). Charging to 80% is likely to be more than enough for most uses, and topping it up with another 15% just before bed is enough for overnight (probably). I had the Series 4 previously and the Ultra 2 now; with the older watch, I would charge it for about an hour while watching TV in the evening. With the Ultra 2, I charge it for about 20 minutes here and there depending on what I’m doing and whether I remember. I’m currently at 39% which will be just fine for my hourlong exercise ride (with GPS), and then I can toss it on the charger while I shower and it’ll probably be at 70% which is good enough for another full day. copperroof 50 minutes agoparentprevI charge it when I shower. reply efsavage 46 minutes agoprevDoes this mean that you could be prescribed an Apple Watch if you were at risk of apnea?

In IRS Publication 502, it states: \"Medical care expenses must be primarily to alleviate or prevent a physical or mental disability or illness.\" You could make the argument that the Apple Watch can be used to manage your sleep apnea condition. On the off chance you get audited by the IRS you might just be better off paying for it with non-HSA funds rather than dealing with that mess. PSA: HSA expenses are based on the honor system, but obviously don't go to Best Buy and buy a PS5 on a HSA debit card. You are allowed to reimburse yourself for medical purchases. For example, if you have a large ticket medical expense you can use a credit card that provides a perk like air miles and then just transfer the funds from your HSA checking account to your regular checking account. Just remember to keep detailed records/receipts. reply rootusrootus 20 minutes agoparentprevNo, the watch is not a medical device intended to treat something. Just a general fitness device.
