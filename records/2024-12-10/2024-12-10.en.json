    "originBody": "Who is Luigi Mangione, CEO shooting suspect? Instagram A profile is emerging of the 26-year-old man charged with murder over last week's fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare's chief executive, Brian Thompson, in New York City. Police announced on Monday they had arrested Luigi Mangione after he was recognised at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. The Baltimore, Maryland, native was found in possession of a so-called ghost gun, a largely untraceable firearm, and a three-page handwritten document that indicated \"motivation and mindset\", officials said. Who is Luigi Mangione? Mr Mangione was born and raised in Maryland and has ties to San Francisco, California, according to New York Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny. He has no prior arrests in New York and his last previous address was in Honolulu, Hawaii, police said. He is from a prominent Baltimore family, and attended a private, all-boys high school in Baltimore, called the Gilman School, according to school officials. Mr Mangione was named as the valedictorian, which is usually the student with the highest academic achievements in a class. In a statement, the school called the situation \"deeply distressing\". A former classmate, Freddie Leatherbury, told the Associated Press news agency that Mr Mangione came from a wealthy family, even by that private school's standards. \"Quite honestly, he had everything going for him,\" Mr Leatherbury said. Speaking to the BBC's US partner, CBS News, another classmate described themselves anonymously as a close friend of Mr Mangione - saying the shooting suspect \"didn't have any enemies\" and was a \"valedictorian for a reason\". Luigi Mangione charged with murdering healthcare CEO in New York Watch: Luigi Mangione arrives at Pennsylvania courthouse Mr Mangione went on to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a bachelor's and master's degree in computer science, according to the school, and founded a video game development club. A friend who attended the Ivy League college at the same time as Mr Mangione described him as a \"super normal\" and \"smart person\". Mr Mangione was employed as a data engineer for TrueCar, a digital retailing website for new and used cars, according to his social media profiles. A company spokesman told the BBC he had not worked there since 2023. According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr Mangione previously worked as a programming intern for Firaxis, a video game developer. He also spent time in a co-living surfing community in Hawaii called Surfbreak. Sarah Nehemiah, who knew him then, told CBS he left due to his back injury which had worsened from surfing and hiking. PA Department of Corrections Police released this mugshot of Mr Mangione after he was charged with murder Watch: NY shooting suspect 'is no hero', says Pennsylvania governor What leads do police have about possible motive? The three-page, handwritten document found on him suggested a motive, according to investigators. The pages expressed \"ill will\" towards corporate America, they said. A senior law enforcement official told the New York Times it said: \"These parasites had it coming\" and \"I do apologise for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done\". Investigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Mr Thompson's murder. Critics of healthcare insurers call these the \"three Ds of insurance\" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients. Friends have told US media he had surgery on his back. The background image on an X account believed to belong to Mangione shows an x-ray of a spine with hardware in it. However, it is unclear how much his own experience of the healthcare system shaped his views. A person matching his name and photo had an account on Goodreads, a user-generated book review site, where he read two books about back pain in 2022, one of them called Crooked: Outwitting the Back Pain Industry. He also gave four stars to a text called Industrial Society and Its Future by Theodore Kaczynski – also known as the Unabomber manifesto. Starting in 1978, Kaczynski carried out a bombing campaign that killed three people and injured dozens of others, until he was arrested in 1996. In his review, Mr Mangione acknowledged Kaczynski was a violent individual who killed innocent people but the book should not be dismissed as the manifesto of a lunatic, rather the work of an extreme political revolutionary. His social media profiles also suggest that he had fallen out of touch with family and friends in recent months. In a post on X from October, someone tagged an account believed to be Mr Mangione's and wrote: \"Hey, are you ok? Nobody has heard from you in months, and apparently your family is looking for you.\" Obtained by CBS News This is the gun found with Luigi Mangione when he was found in Pennsylvania. What do we know about his family? Mr Mangione comes from a prominent family in the Baltimore area who are known for businesses including country clubs, nursing homes and a radio station according to local media. The suspect's paternal grandparents, Nicholas and Mary Mangione, were real estate developers who purchased the Turf Valley Country Club in 1978 and Hayfields Country Club in Hunt Valley in 1986. Shortly after the suspect was charged, Republican state lawmaker Nino Mangione - believed to be Mr Mangione's cousin - released a statement saying the family was \"shocked and devastated\". \"We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved\", the statement read, signing off as \"The Mangione Family\".

    "commentBody": "What we know about CEO shooting suspect (bbc.com)606 points by 1vuio0pswjnm7 21 hours agohidepastfavorite1675 comments xyst 11 hours agoA couple of theories: - person clearly had meticulously planned the execution of the hit and exfiltration. Even leaving red herrings on his way out of the city (backpack full of Monopoly money). Yet clumsily keeps _all_ of the evidence that would implicate himself in this murder. Not to mention he is wandering about in public while a multi-state manhunt is underway with the full weight of alphabet soup agencies, and state and local LEOs? To me, this suggests it was part of his plan to get caught. There was no escape to a non-extradition country. The “shaking” mentioned while talking with police could just be a massive surge of adrenaline as he sees his plan unfold before his eyes. Then use the live streamed and televised court to spread his message. Then live out the rest of his life as a political figure as the media continue to analyze this persons life and motivations. Just like Ted. - Or the internet, media really over-estimated this persons competence. It was really just dumb luck that he even escaped NYC. At that point, he was just improvising after leaving NYC. His arrogance to keep the evidence as some sick mementos or trophies ultimately did him in. Likely try to plead insanity with the manifesto. Probably fail to do so, then eventually get convicted on all charges and end up in a supermax penitentiary for life. reply nostrademons 4 hours agoparentThis looks like a case of \"suicide by revolution\". Various media reports (including this one) suggest that he had a back injury in 2023, has not worked since 2023, started losing touch with friends in 2023, has been reading books about back injuries and chronic pain, etc. If you've ever known someone dealing with chronic pain, it can easily make you decide that you're better off dead than continuing to live. Likely he's been seeking medical treatment for his injury, his insurer is United Health, they've done nothing but \"delay, deny, defend\", he's already decided that he's better off dead, and he might as well take the CEO of the health insurer with him. reply ceejayoz 3 hours agorootparentWhen I heard about the Monopoly money I wondered if it matched up with the amount of a specific denied claim. reply xyst 29 minutes agorootparentprevI can understand the symbolism here between the backpack of game money then. I haven’t gotten all the details, but something like this makes sense. It was a personal vendetta from a person out of desperation/frustration. I guess as more details come out we will know reply cedws 3 hours agorootparentprevBut he’s not dead, he’s going to prison. Does he plan to commit suicide behind bars? He’ll probably be on tighter watch than Epstein - that’s what happens when you mess with the ruling class. reply ceejayoz 3 hours agorootparentLife in prison is just a delayed death sentence. reply s1artibartfast 2 hours agorootparentA \"delayed death sentence\" is awful if you if you have chronic pain and are seeking suicide by revolution. I dont think the two are equivalent reply ceejayoz 2 hours agorootparentDeath by suicide is entirely attainable in prison, if desired. reply s1artibartfast 2 hours agorootparentso what? that still doesn't mean that life in prison is the same as suicide. reply ceejayoz 2 hours agorootparentCorrect. I'm asserting life in prison and a death sentence are functionally identical. (In the US.) Both can be ended via suicide, if the inmate so chooses. reply ARandomerDude 2 hours agorootparentprevLife outside prison is also a delayed death sentence. reply ceejayoz 2 hours agorootparentThe difference between life-in-prison and a death sentence is pretty minimal, given the length of time it takes in the US to get through the death row process. Decades, typically. Many are never actually executed. In either case, you are expected to die in a jail cell after many, many years of incarceration. The difference between those two and a non-imprisoned life is... significant. reply tshaddox 1 hour agorootparentprevBut not as bad of a sentence, since you're not in prison. reply alsetmusic 2 hours agorootparentprevHe could have planned to have a shootout and suicide-by-cop but that didn't happen. I was genuinely surprised that they took him alive. reply Libcat99 2 hours agorootparentprevWhere he'll get treatment on the taxpayer dime? reply LinuxBender 42 minutes agorootparentFor what it's worth there have been a number of cases of elderly patients holding up a bank for $1 and then sitting in the waiting area to be arrested with the stated goal to get medical treatment. I have no idea how many of them actually end up in jail or get the treatment they desired. reply User23 3 hours agorootparentprevI wouldn't be shocked if he walks. There is something crazy in the air and I could see a jury nullification happening here. It only takes one. Where are you going to find a jury where nobody on it has the same grudge for more or less the same reasons? reply nostrademons 3 hours agorootparentMaybe, or the country collapses before he goes to trial. I'm reminded of the trial of John Brown. For those who aren't history buffs, John Brown led a raid on the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, VA in October 1859, hoping to steal weapons to arm the slaves and fuel a slave revolt. He was caught and executed in December 1859. The country collapsed into civil war 17 months later, at Lincoln's inauguration. Historians wryly note that John Brown was executed for doing, on a small scale, the same thing that Lincoln did on a large scale 2 years later. reply giardini 1 hour agorootparentnostrademons says >\"Maybe, or the country collapses before he goes to trial.\" Where are you going to find a jury where nobody on it has the same grudge for more or less the same reasons? Jurors are screened for bias, likely questions from the prosecutors will include, \"Have you ever been denied a medical insurance claim?\" Those who answer yes will definitely not make the jury. Lots of people can answer with a \"no\" quite truthfully, myself included. (Note also that I am not making a comment on whether or not I approve of how juries are selected, this is simply how it works.) reply capybaraStorm 19 minutes agorootparentThe best question is \"do you think wealthy CEOs disproportionately evade justice.\" One of the more sympathetic views towards the murderer is that there was no legal avenue to pursue the CEO for mass fraud under which the plaintiffs would get a fair shake. Vigilantism is more welcome by the public when it appears to be the only recourse. reply dragonwriter 48 minutes agorootparentprev> “Have you ever been denied a medical insurance claim?” Those who answer yes will definitely not make the jury. That’s not a sufficient basis for a dismissal for cause, most people who have ever had insurance would answer “Yes” to that question, and prosecutors don’t have an infinite number of peremptory challenges. So, they probably won’t dismiss on the basis of that answer alone, but do some followup if the answer is “Yes”. reply zippothrowaway 1 hour agorootparentprevCounterpoint: I don't know anyone who could answer \"no\" truthfully. Maybe it's because I am in an older age group? You're right there are lots of people who can answer \"no\". However, it's also possible that such a cohort is not a true jury of peers, and remember that juries skew older. It's possible that screening everyone out who answers \"yes\" would not be allowed by the judge for this reason. Then, the prosecution would only have a small number of \"no reason\" exclusions. reply dragonwriter 40 minutes agorootparent> Counterpoint: I don’t know anyone who could answer “no” truthfully. People who have never personally been insured would answer “no” truthfully, people who have been insured but only consumed in-network, fairly routine services might be able to answer “No” truthfully (though hiccups even with that leading to initial denials are not uncommon), and people under 26 who have only been on their parents insurance and have been shielded from the details of insurance interactions would be able to answer “No” often without intentional misrepresentation. > However, it’s also possible that such a cohort is not a true jury of peers, “Jury of peers” is a line from Magna Carta referring to barons’ right to have their guilt or innocence determined by other barons and does not appear in the US Constitution. The limitation on excluding jurors in the US system is that the unlimited number of exclusions for cause that attorneys for either side may request are determined by the judge on the basis of whether the potential juror has sufficient evidence of bias that would make them incapable of rendering a fair verdict, and other exclusions (peremptory challenges) are sharply limited in number, not some assessment of whether the net result is “a true jury of peers”. reply dragonwriter 50 minutes agorootparentprev> Where are you going to find a jury where nobody on it has the same grudge for more or less the same reasons? By having a filtering process before the jury is empanelled to identify that. reply diggan 3 hours agorootparentprev> I wouldn't be shocked if he walks. Just for curiosities sake, who did you think would win the latest US presidential election? I feel like many (most?) people on the internet are kind of disconnected from people's everyday life outside of the internet. I'm guessing that most of the average folks (people outside the internet zeitgeist) never even heard about this assassination, even less cares about the assassin going free if they did. reply ecshafer 3 hours agorootparentI guessed correctly on the last 6 elections personally. I was at a party over the weekend. I asked a room of 30 people what they thought of the assassin and the overwhelming consensus was hero, they wouldn't say anything if they saw him, and if they were on the jury they would acquit. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a replay of OJ Simpson where one of the jurors gave OJ a power fist as he walked out for the verdict. It only takes 1 person to get onto the jury and acquit. Americans love a robin hood. reply diggan 3 hours agorootparent> the overwhelming consensus was hero I'm guessing that makes it pretty clear that it wasn't really a mixed of \"real Americans\" as almost nothing is so black & white, especially if you compare people who live very different lives. But, I could be wrong, it has happened before and it's bound to happen again at some point :) reply ryandrake 2 hours agorootparentI had the same experience talking to others around here. I guess they aren't \"real Americans\" either. Or, maybe this is an unusually black & white event. reply arkh 2 hours agorootparent> Or, maybe this is an unusually black & white event. I'd say the HN public is the bubble there. Lot of aspiring CEO who take the \"don't care with rules if you can get away with it\" message to heart so they feel like they have more in common with the victim than with the perpetrator of this murder. While I would not be surprised if it is the reverse for 90% of the USA population. reply ryandrake 1 hour agorootparentHN is literally the only place (online or in the real world) I've seen anyone defending this CEO and trying to drum up sympathy for him. You're absolutely right: It's likely that we are the weird bubble outside of everyone else. reply datatrashfire 1 hour agorootparentprevHad a similar experience. All our guests at a dinner party were hoping he would escape. reply sigmar 2 hours agorootparentprev>internet are kind of disconnected from people's everyday life outside of the internet. Are insurance companies more liked among internet users or less liked among internet users (than the population at large)? I presume that internet users tend to be wealthier (due to more free/leisure time, better browsing technology) and less angry with their insurance than non-users, but could be wrong. reply echoangle 1 hour agorootparentprev> ... I could see a jury nullification happening here. It only takes one. Does a hung jury not just lead to a retrial? reply dragonwriter 51 minutes agorootparent> Does a hung jury not just lead to a retrial? A hung jury leads to a mistrial. After a mistrial, the prosecution has the option of trying the case again, but it gets harder (you’ve got more time from the events, a more-tainted jury pool, etc.) Also, if there are multiple charges, and the jury reaches a not guilty verdict on any charges, that may impact the ability to refile other charges, or make it harder to try them if they can be refiled, because any fact that the jury necessarily rejected in an acquittal is finally decided by that acquittal. reply gosub100 2 hours agorootparentprevThey will ensure the selection of the absolute dumbest and most docile jurors possible to prevent this outcome. reply listless 2 hours agorootparentprevThat’s what happens when you commit a crime. It doesn’t matter who you kill or who you are when you do it. If the CEO had killed this guy in the same manner, he’d be facing the same consequences. reply Wytwwww 46 minutes agorootparentI'd be surprised if they NYPD and the FBI spent anything even remotely close to e.g. 10% of what they did in this cases to investigate any random average murder. If he just shot someone randomly in a poorer neighbourhood he likely would still be free. reply ceejayoz 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is generally true for something like gunning down someone in the street.

It's quite possible that the family patriarch held the purse strings and deemed that health insurance was the line for their financial support. I'm in a similar situation with a family member and we are spending around 4-5k/month in a variety of non-allopathic strategies for this family member's health care. However, the family patriarch has drawn the line where his financial support is in providing housing, so the 4-5k is picked up by other family members. reply ashleyn 1 hour agorootparentYou can be a literal millionaire and bled dry by mounting health insurance claim denials.

There are no free speech rights in court. Defendants can't just argue whatever they want. Judges have wide latitude to prohibit certain defenses and generally ban both the prosecution and defense from mentioning legally irrelevant points. Self defense is clearly codified under NY state law and this case doesn't even come close to meeting that standard. reply throw_a_grenade 4 hours agorootparentprevHow exactly do you propose to prove something (planting evidence) didn't happen? Maybe I have too low expectation about USA interface between law enforcement and judiciary, but here in Poland there were many high-profile cases of misconduct of public prosecutors that colluded with the police. The only \"proven\" cases were about purposefuly destroying evidence: breaking CDs that held incriminating recordings, wiping weapons to remove fingerprints, agreeing to single version of testimony etc. They used procedural quirks to prevent defence from challenging those \"mishaps\" (like in one high-profile case with broken CD, they argued defence-held copy cannot be submitted, because of continuous custody requirements). Cases with planted evidence were always he-said-she-said, because when police writes a search report where they said you had something, then you have no way to challenge that. May I add, fraud around those arrest/search reports (however they're called it English) is rampant. It starts with simple things, like notifying the subject about right to attorney. They just tick a box that you declined to summon attorney, and you have no way to challenge that, other than refusing to sign the paper, act of which carries no value. reply semiquaver 3 hours agorootparentHe was arrested at a McDonalds.

They're not generally used to high profile anything. reply Cumpiler69 8 hours agorootparentprevMaybe because he wanted to get caught? Or at least expected it and knew there was no way he'd get away with it. reply hnbad 9 hours agorootparentprevIt seems far more likely to be a case of incompetence. Law enforcement actually has an extremely low rate of \"solving\" cases, especially if you exclude all the \"solved\" cases where the suspect is caught on scene or that end in a plea bargain (i.e. did not have to establish sufficient evidence in the first place). Ever since he got \"caught\" (if you can call someone literally telling the police where he is \"the police catching him\"), all I've been hearing about is how the police wants to use DNA evidence and bullet \"fingerpints\" (i.e. attempting to demonstrate that a bullet was not only fired from a given type of gun but a specific singular gun of that type) and other CSI woo to now tie the actual crime to him. They might actually be lucky and produce matches in this case as they have the actual suspect and murder weapon (assuming this wasn't an extremely unlikely 5D chess move of using a body double fall guy and/or different gun) but both of these types of evidence are extremely unreliable and rarely help actually finding the suspect even if they make for good television when they work. As I understand it the police even walked back on the mayor's initial claim about \"having a name\" to \"having a list of names\" - not to mention that you don't call in the FBI when you already have good leads yourself (if only for optics/political reasons). He seems to have been mentally unstable for a while before engaging in this killing and the fact he wrote a manifesto strongly suggests he had an intention of being caught or at least considered it highly likely. The monopoly money bag wasn't necessarily a \"red herring\" as everyone I heard talk about it interpreted it as intending to send a message, which seems to agree with the apparent contents of his manifesto (based on what news reports have cited from it). The water bottle the police now wants to use for DNA evidence may have been deliberately left there for this purpose, too. Based on what I've heard of his manifesto, he may have intended to kill other people too but have realized the difficulty involved given that his very public first killing likely spooked the other people on his list. I think it's more likely he didn't fully plan out an entire sequence of killings or didn't account for these complications and essentially gave up, settling on being caught sooner rather than later. People generally don't write manifestos when they don't also want to take credit for their actions. reply kiba 7 hours agorootparentPeople can have contradictory motives. People in real life aren't driven by carefully considered system of beliefs. Only in fiction are people required to make sense.

That's enough evidence for a normal jury of normal people to convict. The cops don't really need to add any DNA or CSI woo, juries are capable of exercising common sense. Only way there's reasonable doubt here is if the guy's carrying the first place trophy for the CEO shooter lookalike contest. reply lazide 8 hours agorootparentprevThey don’t even need to actually tie him to the killing to put him in jail for a long time - possession of an illegal suppressor is a slam dunk here, and that’s major jail time. reply InfiniteLoup 5 hours agorootparentWould this also apply if he were no longer in possession of the suppressor?

The typical mass shooting on that list consists of 2-4 people shot over the course of an otherwise normal crime (usually a crime for profit gone off the rails or the drug industry DIYing dispute resolution) wheres the colloquial definition of \"mass shooting\" is more along the lines of a crazy suicidal person killing as many others as they can.

The remainder is primarily gang violence. Shooting of non-gang affiliated people is extremely rare, and noteworthy because of this rarity. Murder-suicides are also rare, about 1% of suicides.

Of the numbers I've seen, in total gun related dealths are evenly split between suicide and homicide.

The percent is much higher for women, but women are a minority of gun homicide victims overall. seanw444 2 hours agorootparentprevTrue, let me revise. The majority of \"shootings\" are suicides, which can be carried out in all manner of ways. The second largest contributors are gangs and organized crime. The smallest, by far, is what people actually picture in their mind when they hear \"mass shooting\". reply potato3732842 2 hours agorootparentprevBecause it's mostly business dispute resolution and it dominates the stats if you include it. It's not like you can ask the courts to use state violence on the guy that shorted you come coke or to kick that other gang's dealer off your turf because he's already been warned once. Illegal industry has to DIY it. To include it would be like compiling a list of extortion and including government fines and civil judgements. It dominates the stats so much that if you include it and evaluate it you're not actually looking at the thing you want to be looking at, you're measuring by proxy the size of something else.

That’s what stops it, not fear of consequences. reply cal85 3 hours agorootparentWe all agree most normal people have an aversion to killing. You're saying that having an aversion to killing stops people killing, which is a tautology. And then you say it's not about consequences. What's your explanation then? It seems intuitive to me that the awareness of consequences plays a central role in preventing anger from turning into violence, every day, everywhere. Have you never seen a fight/argument on the street suddenly diffuse when a cop appears? Or eg, a guy drunk at a bar, starting to raise his voice in anger at someone, only to simmer down when he sees the bartender walking over because he doesn't want to be kicked out? Awareness of consequences is a necessary precondition for people to course-correct. That's an essential feature of people: we are able to notice when we're on course toward a bad outcome (whether that's harm to oneself, or harm to someone/something we care about, or any undesirable situation), and so take responsibility for our actions in advance so we can change course. Without that we'd be amoral creatures. This is what makes us moral beings – that we can take responsibility for the outcomes of our actions. This is a good thing. It's what makes us people, and it's the basis of having a civilisation that is mostly peaceful. reply GuB-42 48 minutes agorootparentThere is a difference between a bar fight and killing someone with intent. A bar fight is a fight for dominance, like you see in animals, the outcome is rarely fatal as the point is just to establish who is stronger and who should submit. We have an aversion to killing that goes further than the fear of consequences. It can be seen in the military, where soldiers naturally don't want to kill their enemies, even when they have incentives to do so. To be effective, soldiers have to be desensitized to killing through their training. Enemies are dehumanized, they train on human shaped targets, etc... And even with all that training, after a few years of active service, many start questioning their life choices. It is common for military pilots, who enlist for the love of flying, until they realize what they are really doing, i.e. killing people. When that happens, it is time to retire to a noncombatant job. Punishing crime is not useless, but I think saying that consequences are the cause of aversion for killing is backwards. We have a natural aversion for killing, especially when we are in a prosperous situation like we (the first world) are now in. And that's why we take murder so seriously. And speaking of murder, our natural aversion for killing shows when we see how we treat the death penalty nowadays. The death penalty is (generally) for the worst people humanity has to offer, their killing have been approved by the highest authority, and there is still opposition. We even have rituals to offload the responsibility of killing from the executioners. For example by having a random person in a firing squad fire a blank round. reply wat10000 3 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not a tautology. The aversion to killing is an inherent psychological thing. Some things are just fundamental to a person’s psychology. Some people have such a strong aversion to spiders that they can’t go near one, even when they know for certain that it’s harmless and there would be no consequences. And psychologically healthy people have that sort of aversion to killing another person. It’s inherent programming. How often do fights end without police intervention? How many times do people get angry and decide not to escalate it to the point of murder even when they could get away with it? People do sometimes end up in situations where they could get away with killing. They rarely take advantage. You’re probably familiar with _The Lord of the Flies_. We need order and authority, otherwise we’ll descend into savagery, right? Except this scenario has actually happened, and in real life the boys worked together peacefully to survive until help came. When you mention “a bad outcome” you include harm to someone we care about. The vast majority of people consider a person’s death to be a bad outcome even if they don’t care about that person in particular. I think you’re conflating two very separate ideas here. There’s the idea of the natural consequences of an action, and then there’s the idea of consequences imposed by some authority. The original comment I replied to was talking entirely about the latter. Here you discuss both but you treat them the same. But someone who refrains from killing because they don’t like the consequence of someone being dead is very different from someone who refrains from killing because they don’t want to go to prison. There are really three different things here: 1) people don’t kill because of the legal or physical consequences to themselves 2) people don’t kill because they don’t like the outcome of a dead person 3) people don’t kill because they fundamentally don’t want to. There are examples of all 3. The vast majority of people aren’t in category 1. I think they’re almost all in 3, but there’s no practical difference between 2 and 3. reply ceejayoz 2 hours agorootparent> You’re probably familiar with _The Lord of the Flies_.

If I said I have an aversion to the taste of steak, would you require additional information to why I don't eat steak? Or, to put it in your terms, eating steak causes a negative internal state for me and doesn't require any external consequence to make me avoid it. >It seems intuitive to me that the awareness of consequences plays a central role in preventing anger from turning into violence There's a problem with relying on \"intuitive\" understandings in some cases, especially when there is contradictory evidence. I think the term for your stance is \"deterrence theory/effect.\" In this case, I believe there are plenty of studies that show harsher consequences do not reduce crimes rates (or at least have marginal effects).

There are very clear dynamics here where being more knowledgeable makes the discussions irrelevant. There are generally two ways of doing hard things. Either you are knowledgeable enough to be aware of the challenges and work around, or overcome, them. Or you are unaware, or shameless, enough to do it anyway. The later is much easier than the former. (Then you also have those who believe they could do something but never does because they can't). (Also not entirely mutually exclusive). Sometimes this is a feature of education, but most of the time it is just a feature of ignorance. Being educated doesn't also prevent you from being ignorant. It is very much expected that most willing to do something hard are smart enough to do it, but not smart enough to do it well. Unless it's been made easier, but then it is no longer as hard. It is also perception. Knowing both software and hardware would make you a technologist, or when talking about hardware someone who knows hardware but also knows software. Not knowing hardware but talking about it would more likely make you perceived as someone who knows software.

I mean, a debate can be had if bans are the correct tool, but there is a massive trend in hospitality in general (both restaurants and lodging) to de-personalize the entire experience, to take the human service out of the loop and make it invisible where it still needs to take place: - hotel booking? no travel agents, no phone calls, anyone can just do that themselves with bookingdotcom and other aggregator service. - hotel on-site service? no check-in at the reception, you go to a terminal, enter your booking id, get a keycard and that's it. when you check out, you close the door, dispose of the key card, and you haven't seen or interacted with any human during the entirety of your stay. - food ordering? you sit alone at home, scroll through a list of restaurants that might not even exist (\"ghost kitchens\"), a computer orders a human to make the food, said anonymous person (and maybe some colleagues) makes your food, another anonymous person gets ordered by a computer to deliver it to your doorstep, and if you specify a non-contact delivery you didn't have to interact with a single human for anything. And I think it won't take long for the cooks to be replaced by machines as well, delivery robots are already a thing. - on site food eating: you don't order at a server any more, you order at a terminal, a tablet or even your own phone, the computer dispatches cooks and servers, some even don't have human servers any more but only robots or running-sushi-style conveyor belts, and in the end you pay at a machine.

Yes, the US beats Canada for example on wait time in a lot of cases, however, as a Canadian I can walk into a ER and not have a co-pay. I had my appendix out a few years ago, I walked into the ER at 2PM, had the surgery done by midnight, and was able to be discharged by 9AM the next day. The only cost was my parking, because I drove myself over. Meanwhile, I've also had friends in the US who were clearly quite ill, and made the conscious decision to not go to the ER because it would have cost them hundreds of dollars. It's all a balance, but I'm happier with my single pay system, because for the most part, health decisions aren't at the whim of my bank balance being too low. I personally wouldn't be as disappointed in the US system, if the reason someone can get a surgery immediately didn't balance out with something like UnitedHealthcare's 32% rejection rate, because someone wanted a $10MM / yr salary or a $40MM yacht. reply harimau777 4 hours agorootparentprevFrom what I understand, wait time can certainly be an issue with single payer healthcare.

If my procedure goes long because of a complication, I'd still prefer they not wake me up mid-procedure for a credit card and signature. reply ChadNauseam 1 hour agorootparentNaturally they would not wake you up mid-procedure for payment, nor ask you for payment later. What anthem wanted to do was put a cap on the number of billable hours per procedure, and have anesthesiologists accept payment based on that cap as \"payment in full\", meaning they would not expect additional payment for the extra time they spent after a procedure went long, either from the patient or the insurerer. This would have resulted in anesthesiologists making less money (as well as having less opportunity for fraud), which is why they didn't like it. But it was presented in popular media as if the insurance company was trying to shift the cost of overlong procedures onto the patient, rather than onto the anesthesiologists. Thankfully there was a public outcry and the anesthesiologists won, well-deservedly so considering they must be barely scraping by on a median income of $470,000/year. reply Ajedi32 2 hours agorootparentprevWhen you remove profit from the equation, you also remove the incentive to increase supply.

I am in my 40s, I make pretty good money. My life is good. My mom died last year. The medical system and her medicare \"advantage\" plan killed her. She had a stroke. However, within a day, she was up and walking around with assistance. However, the hospital was understaffed so two things happened. She fell going to the bathroom AND after that happened, they did not get her moving enough and she got a huge bed sore. The huge bed sore would not have happened if her medicare advantage plan hadn't denied denied denied having her moved to get physical, occupation, and speech theray. If she had just good ole medicare, they would have approved it the day of request (it was requested the day after the stroke, I was warned that her plan was going to deny because they always do where medicare always approves). Instead, she rotted in an understaffed wing of the hospital for a week while I fought to get shit approved. After getting approval to be moved, she was making slow slow progress due to the bed sore. It is hard when your body needs to recover and you have a huge wound on your back. Once again her medicare \"advantage\" plan denied giving her more time in therapy. Guess what? Medicare would have just approved. Her advantage plan said the \"community\" could care for her and she could just get better over time. Do you know what that means? They wanted me to quit working and care for my mom 24/7. That is what they meant by community care. I am an only child with no other family except my wife and kids. The hospital social worker was great and refused to discharge my mom because she knew I couldn't physically move my mom around or give her the care she required. That started a month battle where her insurance was refusing to pay anymore hospital bills, refused to get her more therapy, and essentially killed my mom. If the social worker had allowed my mom to be discharged, I would have been fucked. She slowly got worse and died. The american medical system with its private \"advantage\" plans took what would have been a recoverable bad health incident and allowed it to kill my mom for greed. BTW, after a month of fighting, emails to the insurance board of directors and CEO, I got more therapy approved for my mom but it was too late by then. She died a few days later.

But that's reversed for this hypothetical loan issuer - they want to make the payout as fast as possible in order to earn as much interest as possible as quickly as possible.

UNH’s entire net income in 2023 was $22.3B, and their market cap is more than 5x the next biggest managed care organization (MCO). The other MCOs all had net income less than $8B (CVS/Elevance/Cigna/Humana/etc). There is no way a business earned a profit of $18B just from Medicare and it not being visible on their net income figures.

The company I bank with, or the generically-named sub-contracted company that the bank only partnered with so they didn't have to be held liable for potential breach of PCI and various laws?

A fraud report to a domain registrar is categorically not something one does to address a \"specific page\", whether it's done by a partner or by them. reply jitl 16 hours agorootparentIt’s very typical to report to a site’s host or provider on a specific page under the DMCA. The way this works is that the host will ask you to take down the page, and if you don’t, the host needs to take action or they become liable. This is conceptually covered as “DMCA safe harbor”, and the rules around it protect service providers from liability of their clients actions. AWS has a well-oiled machine for these kinds of complaints, but some registrars are located in corners of the earth and getting a line of communication to them is challenging. Notion’s worst outage to date happened because of a breakdown of forwarding complaints between a complainant, our DNS NIC in Somalia (.so), and the middlemen between us and Somalia - NameCheap, then some company in Germany who dropped the ball. Source: - I worked on UB Berkeley’s systems for handling takedown notices for infringing clients (students running BitTorrent in their dorms), we got lots of lectures on our legal duties as employees of CA state institutions - I worked how we protect Notion from liability & damage from misbehaving clients to ensure we never had another outage that threatened our main app domain reply numeri 15 hours agorootparentThe big issue here is that they didn't issue a DMCA request, they reported them for fraud. reply jitl 14 hours agorootparentIt usually all goes through the same kinds of process pipeline. Complain about URL to provider, provider sends complaint to you, you remedy complaint, then notify provider. In this case it seems provider totally dropped the ball. It’s a bad look for the agency etc but also I would terminate relationship with the provider who can’t be trusted to be a functioning part of the system, and when you migrate to a new provider make sure you know every link in the chain and have a relationship or trust the link to escalate for you. reply mort96 9 hours agorootparentWhy do you keep ignoring the fact that the report was for fraud and phishing? Sending a DMCA complaint or a copyright or trademark complaint to the registrar might've made sense for the reasons you outline here, but that's not what the complaint was. Why are you so insistent on running defense for them? reply jitl 2 hours agorootparentI’m sharing my perspective and experience from working on both the provider side and the website side in the hopes it helps any HN readers building something. Some things you cannot control - people sending takedowns, provider fuckups.

However, that has no relevance to what I've said or what this discussion is about, which is that Funko's actions (or that of their \"brand protection partner\") doesn't align with the stated goal of taking down the specific page. reply dghlsakjg 17 hours agorootparentprevA partner that they hired, yes? If I hire an agent, and authorize them to go around acting on my behalf doing all sorts of shitty things in my name, I don't get to say: \"sorry it wasn't me, it was the guy I hired to do things in my name\".

If you give someone legal authorization to act as your agent, you can't pretend that they aren't your agent when they act like your agent. Funko might have beef with their agent, but that is between them and the agent. They still have to deal with the fact that they gave someone permission to do legal things on their behalf, and the someone acting on behalf of Funko caused damage to itch.io. If a McDonalds employee serves me coffee that scalds me, I go after McDonald's, not the guy who McDonald's hired. reply SpicyLemonZest 16 hours agorootparentFunko says in the statement that they're dealing with it. They've reached out to itch.io to understand who's doing what, which isn't clear at this point. For example, the company itch.io previously identified as responsible for the domain being taken down has publicly stated - perhaps honestly, perhaps falsely - that they requested a takedown of only the one infringing URL. (https://x.com/BrandShieldltd/status/1866200019335794763) reply wolrah 16 hours agorootparent> For example, the company itch.io previously identified as responsible for the domain being taken down has publicly stated - perhaps honestly, perhaps falsely - that they requested a takedown of only the one infringing URL. (https://x.com/BrandShieldltd/status/1866200019335794763) They submitted a takedown to the domain registrar. That means they requested a takedown of the whole domain, because the registrar has absolutely zero ability to operate on a URL level of granularity. They can only take down the entire domain. There are three possibilities here: 1. BrandShield submitted a takedown to the domain registrar knowing exactly what that meant, and is now lying about it, demonstrating that they should not be put in a position of power. 2. BrandShield submitted a takedown to the domain registrar not understanding what that meant, demonstrating a total lack of knowledge and/or level of incompetence that means they should not be put in a position of power. 3. BrandShield did not submit the takedown to the domain registrar at all, some other vendor did, and somehow no one has pointed that out yet. Obviously #3 is unlikely given their public statements, so let's just say at this point there is absolutely no reason to give BrandShield any benefit of the doubt and their clients should be encouraged to find a vendor that isn't either lying or incompetent. reply SpicyLemonZest 15 hours agorootparentThere's little reason to give BrandShield the benefit of the doubt, but there's plenty of reason for Funko to pause and collect all the right information before making specific statements about what happened. Remember that there's some specific set of nontechnical people running comms at Funko, and they've probably never heard of a domain registrar before today. At a minimum they have to gather the stories they're hearing from both BrandShield and itch.io, identify who at Funko has the technical background to judge between the two, and convince that person to take time away from her normal responsibilities to evaluate some weird drama she doesn't care about. reply wolrah 15 hours agorootparentThat's why I wasn't talking about Funko at all. Don't get me wrong, I find Funko's products to be overpriced trash that I don't understand why it fills up stores anywhere vaguely related to any kind of fandom, and I wish they would disappear, but that's neither here nor there. BrandShield on the other hand I believe at this point we can reasonably have the pitchforks out for them and any other companies of their kind. Companies that exist to issue takedown requests, ironically, need to be taken down. Destroy them all. The world is a worse place for their existence. reply soulofmischief 15 hours agorootparentprevWhen the system is riddled with holes, inefficiencies and micro-bureaucracies, and dealing with them it handled by outsourcing, it's incredibly easy to pass the buck around for all involved parties, in an effective game of Keep Away until any moderately frustrated invdividual simply gives up. reply Loughla 17 hours agorootparentprevOr someone who knows how to Google names and called this lady just to be a prick.

Namely what a politician promises to achieve and how they intent to achieve it. This can cause the actual result of policies to be wildly different from the claimed intended outcome. We’ve seen plenty of examples of this in the past, e.g. claim that you want to make sure everyone will be better off by lowering taxes for the rich (trickle down economics), which of course had the exact opposite effect. This can be completely malicious, i.e. claim that your proposed policy will have outcome X while knowing it will have outcome Y. It can also be due to flawed ideology, i.e. your policy is based on your idea how the world should work instead of how it actually does work. Or it can be sheer incompetence. What I would like to see is a system where the goal and the method of achieving it are separated from each other: a democratic technocracy. In this system politicians would only set the intended outcomes, and their relative priorities (in cases where policies would affect different intended outcomes in opposite directions). Then, government workers would decide the policies that would result in the desired outcomes (based on science, evidence based methods, etc.) They would be normal unelected workers subject to performance reviews (did their policies result in the intended outcome) and positions should be completely merit-based. That way politicians have to be honest about what they want to achieve, people have a clearer idea what they are actually voting for and there is a system in place that will try to achieve those outcomes based on what actually works. reply whoopdedo 16 hours agorootparentprev> because you know you literally did nothing to deserve it.

This is a basic dictum. It stands for bald fact, which makes a better starting point in seeking understanding than the familiar attributions of good intention, prejudices about expectations, moral judgment, or sheer ignorance of circumstances. - Stafford Beer If a system prioritizes copyright claims from the largest firms as casus belli against independent creators, and there are no attempts to reform such system and no recourse for independent creators, than we can only conclude such criminal negligence as intention, formalized within the priorities encoded within such a system. I just saw this a few days ago with Youtube channel Esoterica, which had a 10-second public domain recording of Chopin which was falsely flagged as copyright infringement. Dr. James Justin Sledge of Esoterica, despite having fair use of the clip, ended up commissioning an artist with an original recording (complete with unique changes to the public domain work) to avoid any confusion, but still got a takedown from UMG's copyright AI. As with any law, if public domain fair use isn't enforced, and to contest it is prohibitively expensive (as legal battles are often wars of attrition), then the public domain is useless, and major firms such as UMG can just function as feudal lords demanding the proceeds of any tenant peasant's work.

    "originBody": "Tree Calculus captures the essence of computation add 58 42 100 One operator. Trivial semantics. Turing complete. Intensional. Democratizing Functions Democratizing Metatheory Intensional Tree Calculus can perform program analysis without quotation: The ability to reflect on programs is built right into the reduction rules. This means that anything from type checking to compilation and optimization can happen from within programs and without additional external tools (🚀demo, 🚀fusion demo). In particular, this supports arbitrary type systems and truly gradual typing or verification: Static vs dynamic checks are one and the same function call, just at different points in time (🚀demo). Furthermore, intensionality allows compiling and deploying programs (or elaborate combinations like tier splitting) right from the program itself. This makes for all-powerful REPLs; translated to Python, imagine using nothing but a Jupyter Notebook for an entire product lifecycle, from prototyping to productionization. Powerful Tree Calculus is Turing-complete and intensional (🚀demo). Combined with its trivial abstract syntax, it becomes easy to serialize any value, including programs (🚀demo). But furthermore, there is in fact no distinction between a program and its encoding. Such distinctions complicate descriptions and formal proofs of the Halting Problem, whereas with Tree Calculus as the substrate, Halting Problem formulations become more straightforward (🚀demo). Despite its simplicity, Tree Calculus is not a Turing tarpit. Data encodings and algorithms are asymptotically optimal. In practice: Typical functions to manipliate lists (map, filter, concat, fold, …) are binary trees with a few hundred nodes (🚀demo). The compiler used in all demos is also written in Tree Calculus, not particularly optimized, yet quite efficient. Concise The abstract syntax of Tree Calculus is trivial: Values are unlabeled binary trees. The reduction rules act on trees of higher degree, until they are binary. (Bonus for readers familiar with λ-calculus: Recursive functions have normal form/are values in Tree Calculus.) The definition is compact, precise and imports no other “well known” definitions or standards, such as JSON, UTF8, two’s complement integers, IEEE floats or their respective arithmetic operations, which have tricky corner cases. However, arbitrary concepts like that can be bootstrapped in Tree Calculus swiftly and explicitly (🚀demo). This makes Tree Calculus a great language for modeling and formal specifications, but also very suitable for education: There are no incumbent towers of abstraction, but they can be introduced and modeled incrementally. Portable The syntax and semantics of Tree Calculus are minimal and self-contained, relying on no platform-specific concepts or abstractions. As a result, it is trivial to write interpreters on any platform or in any programming language (🚀demo). Such interpreters are effectively safe by construction, since the reduction rules are simple (resulting in little code) and pure (no inherent access to the environment or resources). The ability to bootstrap the full power of Tree Calculus anywhere makes it an excellent configuration as code language in a heterogeneous system. Developers could write Tree Calculus programs that generate, say, JSON, and use an interpreter (that is tiny compared to a JSON parser) to materialize the configuration anywhere (🚀demo). This article describes how Meta uses Python for a similar purpose. Contact: treecalculus@johannesbader.com",

This is a positive thing, not a normative value. But we, together, also shape how words are used. Just because someone uses a word doesn’t mean we have to like it or accept the context. We certainly don’t have to blindly repeat it. We all put this into practice. We choose to reinforce patterns we find useful. And ignore ones we don’t. We don’t need to disempower ourselves by acting like we have no power over language. As for me, I would rather democratize mean something meaningful. So when someone uses it for self-interested purposes, I try to call it out. I’m not a stickler for no reason. It is because I care — the world is still only marginally and fleetingly democratic. I don’t want marketing speak to ooze into yet another domain. Instead, I want such efforts to cause eye-rolls and backpressure. But, yes, I will grant the printing press “democratized” books. And the Internet “democratized” information. These kinds of societal breakthrough are worthy of the word.

I mean, it's an abstract mathematical concept. When you find a 30% discount sticker on an item in a store and compute in your head what the resulting price is going to be, you're arguably applying a function. Also, to say that this makes functions available to all people, and to immediately follow that with text such as \"The reduction rules act on trees of higher degree, until they are binary\" suggests that well, actually, this is only for PL gurus, not all people (and that's totally fine IMO, just don't use the word \"democratizing\") reply falcor84 9 hours agorootparentI get your point, but would disagree that being able to apply a function is the same as understanding functions.

The target audience I had in mind was certainly developers (like me), not \"all people\". And the wording was indeed inspired by PL talks and blog posts I consumed over the years. Here is a (slightly provocative) thought: We developers were promised \"first class functions\" with functional programming languages. And it's true, you can pass them around like any other value! Cool. But first: What about inspecting those values? I can \"look inside of\" a number or string or array any day. But functions, I can only call. Huh, so an intensional view (not that anyone thinks that out loud) for all kinds of values, except functions. Yes sure, many languages do allow you do dig into functions. But it is all not the same as or as powerful as supporting it right down at the logic level! TC is also not first to do that. But IMO the most compact and practical calculus/language to do so, yet. Second, a practical example: We had \"first class functions\" for decades now. But where is our main stream config language (JSON etc) that has first class support for them? Of course the answer is: Because it remains tricky. In industry I've seen all sorts of work arounds, usually involving strings that get compiled/interpreted on the fly. Which usually means some amount of scary security, and no static guarantees whatsoever. With TC, a parser/runtime for arbitrary (but pure) functions is a few dozens lines of code. And thanks to being intensional, one can imagine type checking those functions at the time of loading the config, not only when executing! Concrete demo/blog post for exactly this is in the works. So anyways, I do belive this enables truly fundamental shifts, hence \"democratizing\". reply Tainnor 5 hours agorootparentWhy don't you put a short version of this explanation on your main website instead of a vague \"democratising functions\"?

Is there like a... for dummies version? reply ryandv 11 hours agoparentIt's a stripped down model of computation like the SKI calculus [0] or its cousin the lambda calculus, which are formal systems with precise rules for mechanically evaluating or reducing expressions. It differs from the SKI calculus in that it can reflect on its own program structure, especially in ways the SKI calculus cannot - deciding if two programs are equal, for instance [1]. Further, unlike the lambda calculus, reducing a program with the reduction rules given [2] eventually converges upon a stable \"normal form\" of the program, which is expressed in irreducible terms, instead of leading to possibly infinite chains of reduction [3]. This allows for reflection without needing to \"quote\" or serialize the program into a stable data structure or other representation to sidestep the possibility of infinite reduction. This is similar to the notion of homoiconicity as in Lisp. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus [1] https://github.com/barry-jay-personal/tree-calculus/blob/mas...

How is that possible if the reduction rules define a Turing complete language? reply ryandv 8 hours agorootparentIt would appear that programs in even SKI calculus and other combinatory logics can reduce to base combinators in finitely many steps, but when those combinators are applied to arguments, then the possibility of non-termination arises [0]: Combinatory logic [9,12] is very close to λ-calculus, and widely considered to be equivalent to it [8], but there are important differences. In particular, by modifying the usual account of recursion, i.e. by modifying the usual account of fixpoint functions, it is possible to ensure that all programs are represented by stable combinators, i.e. combinators that are irreducible or in normal form. Only when applied to arguments does non-termination become possible. That is, we may define a program to be a combinator in normal form. As such it is both an executable, since applications of it will trigger evaluation, and also a syntax tree, i.e. a binary tree of applications, with leaves labelled by the primitive combinators, say S and K. [0] https://sci-hub.se/https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1016/j.tcs.... reply chriswarbo 1 hour agorootparentThis thread is perhaps phrased confusingly. If I understand correctly, the claim is only that any program (including recursive ones) can be expressed in a finite normal form, which may of course diverge when \"run\" (applied to an argument). The same is true for basically every language though, e.g. consider the following Python: omega = lambda x: x(x) omega(omega)(42) The expression `omega(omega)` diverges, but only because we've applied it to an argument. The function `omega` itself is in an irreducible normal form, namely `lambda x: x(x)`. On the other hand, consider the function call with argument `42`: in that case, the function is `omega(omega)`, which is not in a normal form, and in fact diverges. In a system like SK, and presumably this tree calculus, we can form a similar expression, where the \"function part\" (i.e. left sub-tree) diverges with no normal form. That's unavoidable, due to the halting problem. I think the claim is that we never need to write such expressions, since there's always an alternative which behaves the same but whose \"function part\" has a normal form. As a (slightly) more practical example, consider some code like: adjust = (lambda x: x + 1) if increase else (lambda x: x - 1) The function `adjust` is not in a normal form, since it depends on the value of `increase` (when truthy, `adjust` will increment; when falsy it'll decrement). Yet most programmers would probably avoid that, in favour of this: adjust = lambda x: x + 1 if increase else x - 1 Both implementations of `adjust` will behave the same, but the second is in a normal form. reply lolinder 13 hours agoparentprevIt's a very funny way to structure the main landing page—it takes cues from trendy programming language and framework websites (single word headings that feel slightly buzzwordy, animated code samples, etc), but then the text body is in quite overwhelmingly dense and lengthy academic language, but then it doesn't actually provide enough details in the academic language to really understand what is going on.

Tree Calculus is a calculus/logic, see Specification page or the book by Barry Jay (linked on that page) for way way better and detailed verbose explanations. It only defines what I chose to call \"t\" on the website, Barry uses \"Δ\" in his book and papers. So without anything else, we'd have to talk about programs in terms of \"(t t) t ...\" or binary trees, which gets unwieldy quickly. The first natural step, for practical purposes, is to allow definitions \"foo = ...\", then some syntactic sugar for lists, functions, etc. Ooops and now we have a \"language\". If you open the \"Playground\" page there's a summary of what exactly is TC and what is syntactic sugar (and really nothing more!) on top of it. I like to think that the line is so blurry precisely because TC needs nothing but a bit of syntactic sugar to feel like a usable PL haha. reply lolinder 5 hours agorootparentRight, it's a programming language the way the lambda calculus or pi calculus or whatever are programming languages—I did understand that much! I love the idea of having a website like this to introduce people to one of the less popular calculi, and the playground is a great touch. It might be helpful to have an introductory paragraph that explains exactly what the tree calculus is, starting from what a \"calculus\" is—your target audience seems to be people who aren't otherwise going to go out of their way to read Barry's papers, which means you can't assume as much background as you currently do. As a reference, I'm a casual PL nerd who actually has read academic papers related to some of the less well-known calculi with an eye towards implementing them, so I'm on the more informed end of the spectrum of your target audience. Have you considered making this site open source? No pressure if not, but if so I'd be happy to contribute to polishing up the landing page. I'm very interested in learning more about this anyway, and I'm more than willing to help! reply scrubs 2 hours agorootparentprevAgreed! reply Skeime 10 hours agoparentprevI will also try to give some explanation: The specification says that the syntax of expressions in this thing is `E ::= tE E`. This is a bit confusing, because it might lead you to believe that all expressions just look like `t t t t t t t`. In reality, you are supposed to keep the implied bracketing, so expressions really look like `(t t) (t ((t t) (t t)))` (note that at the top level and in each parenthesis, there always exactly two subexpressions). Essentially, the space character becomes a binary operator (similar to how we often write multiplication with no symbol). The expressions are a bit heavy on parentheses, so we say that this binary operator is left associative. This means that an expression `a b c` should be interpreted as `(a b) c`, an expression `a b c d` should be interpreted as `((a b) c) d`, and so on. If you think about it, this means that you can always get rid of an opening parenthesis at the left edge of an expression, i.e. we can assume that an expression always start without one. With this out of the way, we can now understand where the trees come from: As there is only one terminal symbol, `t`, after removing unnecessary parentheses, every expression will always start with `t`, which is followed by a number of other expressions. To draw this as a tree, draw a node representing the initial `t`, and a sub-tree for each of the follow-up expressions (by applying the same procedure to them). In this view, the semantic rules at the top of the specification page now tell you how to \"simplify\" a tree whenever there is a node with three or more sub-trees, or alternatively, how to reduce an expression that is a `t` followed by three or more sub-expressions. (In the syntax view, you replace the `t` and the first three expressions following it by whats on the right of the arrow. In the tree view, you replace the node and its first three children by some other sub-tree, then you attach the remaining children to the root of the new sub-tree.) reply Exuma 4 hours agorootparentGreat extra detail - thanks reply tkgally 13 hours agoparentprevA defining sentence at the top of the page, something like “Tree Calculus is a [noun phrase] for [summary of purpose],” would be helpful. Wikipedia articles typically begin with such sentences: “Lambda calculus (also written as λ-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.” “In mathematics, matrix calculus is a specialized notation for doing multivariable calculus, especially over spaces of matrices.” “The felicific calculus is an algorithm formulated by utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) for calculating the degree or amount of pleasure that a specific action is likely to induce.” reply justinpombrio 12 hours agoparentprevQuick summary: It's a programming language whose programs (and whose values) are unlabeled trees. An unlabeled tree is a tree-shaped data structure whose nodes hold no data. The children of a node are ordered, though. The \"Tree Calculus\" defines a set of rules by which you can \"evaluate\" an unlabeled tree to get another unlabeled tree. If you apply these rules repeatedly, either you'll get into an infinite loop, or you'll get a tree that the rules say doesn't change anymore. The rules are designed so that the rules don't effect binary trees, so if you evaluate a binary tree you'll get the same tree back out and the computation is \"done\". These rules are written as a small-step semantics (a standard way to write down evaluation rules in PL) in the \"specifications\" page. They claim that: - The evaluation rules for trees are Turing Complete, meaning that you can express any computation, e.g. any JS program, using the Tree Calculus. More precisely, the claim is that there's a straightforward way to convert any (say) JS Program into a tree, and any tree into a JS value, and now you can use tree evaluation to run a JS program by doing (i) convert the JS program into a tree, (ii) evaluate the tree to get another tree, and finally (iii) convert the tree into a JS value, which is the correct output of the JS program. To prove this you wouldn't actually use JS as the language, you'd use something simpler that we already know is Turing complete like the lambda calculus, but it's the same idea. Though glancing at the page they might have actually done this for JS. - The evaluation is asymptotically optimal, meaning that for any programming language P (like JS), there's a conversion f(prog) from programs in P to Tree Calculus trees and constants a and b such that running_time(f(prog))The lambda calculus is simpler, more well known, and more useful (it's a model of functions, instead of some made up rules about trees). Lambda calculus is actually quite tricky; e.g. I've implemented it many times over the decades, both for fun and for serious applications, and have still never properly implemented capture-avoiding substitution (I've tried, but usually give up and reach for an existing implementation). Also, notice that the tree calculus reduction rules are confluent, disjoint and branch on their left subtrees (similar to SK calculus). Hence they are also a \"model of functions\" like lambda calculus; or, alternatively, lambda calculus is also \"some made up rules about [expression] trees\". reply lolinder 4 hours agorootparentprev> If you find this sort of thing interesting, though, I'd recommend learning the lambda calculus instead. The lambda calculus is simpler, more well known, and more useful (it's a model of functions, instead of some made up rules about trees). I was with you all the way up until here. The lambda calculus is only more useful because it's become the basis for a lot of existing programming languages. Its made up rules are no more fundamental than the made-up rules of any other calculus, tree calculus included. They just seem more fundamental because they form the basis of most functional programming today. I'm also unconvinced that the lambda calculus itself is meaningfully simpler. It typically has three syntactic components and two reduction operations, compared to one syntactic component and five reduction operations—that gives the lambda calculus a very small edge in moving parts, but it's very small. The only way in which I could agree with you is that learning the lambda calculus first is going to be easier because there's so much more material on it. But that's not because the fundamental properties of the lambda calculus, it's because Church came first. reply justinpombrio 1 hour agorootparent> The lambda calculus is only more useful because it's become the basis for a lot of existing programming languages. But there's a reason for that. Functions make a good basis for programming languages. It's not the only good basis! Concatenative combinators make a good basis too: see Factor and Joy. If you take the lambda calculus and add numbers and a few operations on them, it's easy to program in it. Likewise for the concatenative calculus. But not so for NAND gates or SK combinators. You certainly can do anything you want with them, but doing so feels more like solving a logic puzzle than programming. I am likewise skeptical about the tree calculus. reply lolinder 8 minutes agorootparentI'm skeptical that we'd feel that way if Church didn't come first.

So if it's just an unlabeled tree (nodes hold no data) then the only information is the child order / count, correct? So part of it is somehow mapping some high level information to combination of nodes and children, and back (after some manipulation), correct? Or am I misunderstanding everything? reply olydis 6 hours agorootparentCorrect. I think of it this way: The reduction rules prescribe an encoding for functions, but don't describe it for other (traditional) data. But there are very canonical choices of course, which the demos on the website follow: * false := t and true := t t * Pairs are t first_elem second_elem * Lists could be encoded as (t first_elem (t second_elem (t third_elem ...))) with empty list being t * Natural numbers as lists of booleans (LSB first) * Strings as lists of natural numbers (unicode code points) These choices will affect what the functions that operate on data look like, concretely. reply cat5e 14 hours agoparentprevStraight up dude.

You can trivially serialize any lisp function (I'm not a lisp fan). The point of the tree calculus appears to be that it doesn't require the intermediate step of \"pickling\" or, as the author calls it, \"quoting\" the program to produce a data structure or other representation of the program [0]: Previous accounts of self-interpretation had to work with programs that were not normal forms, that were unstable. Stability was imposed by first quoting the program to produce a data structure, by putting on some make-up. In tree calculus, the programs are already data structures, so that no pre-processing is required; both of the self-evaluators above act on the program and its input directly. In short, tree calculus supports honest reflection without make-up. It sounds similar to the notion of homoiconicity as in Lisp, but probably more precisely or even strongly stated. > Plenty of programming languages with both macros and first class function objects (those that can be passed around and thus have data representations). A language may have first class function objects, but its actual structure may be opaque and not open to reflection or manipulation (beyond of course just munging the source code as plaintext). You can maybe create a function literal, pass the function around and to higher-order functions, but you can't inspect or modify its internal structure, or decide program equality (based on either exact structure, or one program reducing to another according to the reduction rules of the calculus). Lastly the tree calculus would also appear to differ from the lambda calculus in that programs are stable and won't reduce infinitely, instead converging on some normal form of irreducible terms.

What he implemented IS quotation, despite his objections. reply ryandv 10 hours agorootparentMore precisely, the distinction would seem to be that programs in the tree calculus can analyze themselves with reference only to the reduction rules of the calculus, not needing to reach for some meta-language or theory outside the calculus that works on source code or some AST representation of the program [0]: Reflective programs are programs that can act on themselves to query their own struc- ture. The querying is important: that the identity function can be applied to itself does not make it reflective. A simple example is the size function defined in Chapter 5. When applied to itself, the result is (the tree of) the number 508 [...] Self-evaluation in a calculus provides good evidence for the ability to perform program analysis and optimisation within the calculus itself. Traditionally, self-interpreters were allowed to act on the syntax tree of a program, i.e. its quotation. [...] When quotation lies outside of the formal calculus then interpretation is separated from computation proper, so that some sort of staging is required.

In each of the four-element reductions in the definition, put parentheses around the first three to see what is applying to what. Also I think the right-hand sides are under-parenthesised. So: (t (t) a) b -> a (1) (t (t a) b) c -> (a c) (b c) (2) (t (t a b) c) t -> a (3a) (t (t a b) c) (t u) -> b u (3b) (t (t a b) c) (t u v) -> (c u) v (3c) Relatedly, the table is missing some cases because (I think) the authors see them as \"obviously\" falling out from the associativity of the written syntax, but I think it's helpful to add: t a -> (t a) (0a) (t a) b -> (t a b) (0b) Now you can look at an expression with the syntax E E and more cleanly apply these semantic reductions to them. - So wtf is all this doing? In the same way that working out the lambda calculus is frequently about bundling a lambda to \"choose\" between two options, this tree calculus is built to \"choose\" between three options based on whether it's presented with a node that is a leaf, a \"stem\" (one child), or a \"fork\" (two children). This is the core of rules 3a, 3b, 3c. If the \"function\" being applied is a fork whose left child is a fork, we think of the left-left grandchild as A, the left-right grandchild as B, and the right child as C; and if applied to a leaf, we use A, if applied to a stem we apply B to the stem's sole child, and if applied to a fork we apply C to the fork's two children. That three-way \"choosing\" is going to be how the system builds up the rest of the things you can do with it. reply tomsmeding 10 hours agoparentThank you, this should have been on the front page. That makes this a fun calculus, I guess, but isn't necessarily any more amenable to inversion (hard), serialisation (easy), or compilation (easy-ish) that something like SKI or lambda calculus already is. reply olydis 6 hours agorootparentCorrect! The huge value add of TC is that it is also intensional, which SKI or LC are not. This is a property one is not commonly confronted with (which is a shame), but means that all the things you say (and more) can be defined right in TC. The crucial thing to see is that, while I can surely write a (say) program analysis for C in C, the analysis will have to work on a quoted version of programs! For instance a string, or AST. In TC, thanks to being intensional, you can do this directly. Concretely, say you had a function \"add\", in one line you can call \"add 123 234\", in the next line you can all \"type_check add yadayada\" to check its type. Or to serialize it. Or to compile it into x86. To be very clear, there are other calculi and even programming languages that are intensional, TC is not first. But it is the most compact formulation, having just one combinator. And IMO the most practical, as I try to prove with the various demos on the website. E.g. I'd recommend looking at https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-fusion which demos stream fusion. All demos are 100% self contained, in line 1 nothing but \"t\" is defined, and in less than 200 lines we have both a working program optimization and a little demo of it! reply maxbond 14 hours agoprevReminds me of Modal. https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/modal https://wryl.tech/projects/modal.html reply ranma_42 10 hours agoprevThe idea might be nice but the syntax is so easy to mess up for humans that in the spec itself the author gets the translation of `not true` wrong (maybe a copy-paste from `not false`?).

You can build one easily from combinatory logic by using only one universal combinator, which will be implied at the leafs of the tree.

But people are not really processing the information presented, eg, there's confusion about whether or not a page with code examples is describing a programming language. I think the presentation is effective but intimidating? There's something about it that causes people to tune out? But if you actually pay it some attention, it's pretty clear. I'm a bit baffled, the presentation looks good to me, and I know these commenters aren't dumb, so I just don't understand what went wrong here. reply adastra22 11 hours agorootparentThe text on the website linked to is entirely vacant and content-free. It doesn’t actually describe what the language is or how it works. reply mrkeen 4 hours agorootparentYou're expecting to see some forest of information which isn't there, because it's such a little language. At the top of https://treecalcul.us/specification/ you have 5 rules. Your (valid) program will match one of the left-hand-sides. To execute your program, turn whichever LHS your program is into its corresponding RHS. Keep doing that until you can't, and you'll be left with your final answer. It also provides 2 reference interpreters (OCaml and JS) on the same page. Each interpreter is just a single recursive function 'apply' (which does what I described in the above paragraph). Note the 'match a with' section in the OCaml version. That's essentially the 5 rules from the top translated to OCaml. (I'm not sure why they're slightly different but there's probably a good reason). The JS interpreter is harder to read (\"length\"? \"push\"? \"pop\"? these aren't in the spec above). My guess is that a machine-friendly translation was needed so that JS wouldn't die from recursing too deeply. I clicked on 'runjs.app' link, looked at the examples at the bottom, and added my own. apply(_not, apply(_not, _true)); and sure enough it yielded [ [] ] which is what it calls '_true': const _true = [[]]; reply maxbond 11 hours agorootparentprevThere's a lot of precise, technical language, including a specification - that seems very contentful and specific to me.

Wow, thanks for the reactions and many good suggestions! I thought I'd add a bit of context here. As has correctly been pointed out, Tree Calculus was developed by Barry Jay! The \"Specification\" page links to his book. And a preview of his PEPM 2025 paper (hi chewxy!) can now be found here: https://github.com/barry-jay-personal/typed_tree_calculus/bl... Compared to how long Barry has been professionally researching this, I entered the picture yesterday and joined the effort to help. Potential mistakes on the website are mine, not Barry's, but I do firmly believe in some of the \"ambitious\" wording there. Blog posts and more concrete demos or details to come! Just for the curious, here is my angle in all this: I happened to (hobbyist!) research tiny, yet practical, languages for over a decade (see e.g. https://lambada.pages.dev/). In that work I started noticing that the Iota combinator (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iota_and_Jot) is not a combinator in the most traditional sense: It is usually defined as behaving like \"\\x x S K\", but like, how can we just refer to a lambda in the definition of a logic? One could write reduction rules such as \"Iota Iota x -> x\", but now Iota appears on the left hand side, in argument position! Doesn't that allow reflecting on arguments? Horror! I just started realizing that, while SK is perfectly Turing complete and sane, forcing down the number of combinators from 2 to 1 magically forces some amount of intensionality! Curious, isn't it? And that's when I came across Barry's work and book! A calculus that embraces intensionality. So I reached out to see if I can help. How can I be most useful? Barry has been figuring out theory, professionally, before I could think. So I felt like helping spread the word, maybe to a less academic developer crowd, would be a more effective way to contribute. I spent my entire career building developer tools, so I have some ideas what could be useful and what might be necessary to convince various kinds of developers. That's how the website came to be, and it is very much a work in progress. We sync regularly, for instance Barry had excellent ideas for demos and I suggested slightly tweaked reduction rules at some point (not more powerful in theory, just more convenient in practice), see \"triage calculus\" in typed_program_analysis.pdf reply SkidanovAlex 2 hours agoparentWould help a lot if somewhere at the very top it explained what tree calculus is (may be extend the animation of the addition example to first show what the t is) It took me a while on the website to understand what it was all about.

Paper Arxiv Code Demo TL;DR: A native 3D generative model built on a unified Structured Latent representation and Rectified Flow Transformers, enabling versatile and high-quality 3D asset creation. We introduce a novel 3D generation method for versatile and high-quality 3D asset creation. The cornerstone is a unified Structured LATent (SLAT) representation which allows decoding to different output formats, such as Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, and meshes. This is achieved by integrating a sparsely-populated 3D grid with dense multiview visual features extracted from a powerful vision foundation model, comprehensively capturing both structural (geometry) and textural (appearance) information while maintaining flexibility during decoding. We employ rectified flow transformers tailored for SLAT as our 3D generation models and train models with up to 2 billion parameters on a large 3D asset dataset of 500K diverse objects. Our model generates high-quality results with text or image conditions, significantly surpassing existing methods, including recent ones at similar scales. We showcase flexible output format selection and local 3D editing capabilities which were not offered by previous models. Code, model, and data will be released. NOTE: The appearance and geometry shown in this page are rendered from 3D Gaussians and meshes, respectively. GLB files are extracted by baking appearance from 3D Gaussians to meshes.

TRELLIS logo View GLB Methodology We introduce Structured LATents (SLAT), a unified 3D latent representation for high-quality, versatile 3D generation. SLAT marries sparse structures with powerful visual representations. It defines local latents on active voxels intersecting the object's surface. The local latents are encoded by fusing and processing image features from densely rendered views of the 3D asset, while attaches them onto active voxels. These features, derived from powerful pretrained vision encoders, capture detailed geometric and visual characteristics, complementing the coarse structure provided by the active voxels. Different decoders can then be applied to map SLAT to diverse 3D representations of high quality. Building on SLAT, we train a family of large 3D generation models, dubbed TRELLIS, with text prompts or images as conditions. A two stage pipeline is applied which first generates the sparse structure of SLAT, followed by generating the latent vectors for non-empty cells. We employ rectified flow transformers as our backbone models and adapt them properly to handle the sparsity in SLAT. We train Trellis with up to 2 billion parameters on a large dataset of carefully-collected 3D assets. TRELLIS can create high-quality 3D assets with detailed geometry and vivid texture, significantly surpassing previous methods. Moreover, it can easily generate 3D assets with different output formats to meet diverse downstream requirements.

Because these look so good, like every soul-less super-high quality shovel-ware asset ever made. I'm not putting it down, it truly is an amazing achievement, and it feels like it marks the end of hand-made assets. I don't even feel bad for the artists, I just feel bad for myself, because I want things made by people, for the inherent property that they were made by people. This is the same reason I don't care for procedurally generated games, I want to walk worlds that arose in the minds of others, not just worlds, if I wanted a procedually generated world that just exist for no reason in particular, I'd walk outside.. I don't want content, I don't just want stuff to sift through, I want pieces of art, made by my peers with their own visions, ideas, values, insights and personalities.

I don't care if your passion is some other field of game creation, go do that, and have someone who enjoys level design do the levels, if you can't, well, then I guess you'll have to just accept that I might not want your game, and that's okay too, for both of us, you don't have to make something _I_ in particular like, and I don't have to accept your criteria for what I like. I want, as an inherent property of the stuff I consume, a few things whose merits can be argued endlessly about, but I'm not arguing about their merit, my opinion, my criteria for selection is inherent property itself. I'm not arguing whether there are any difference, I'm not arguing one is better than the other, I'm not arguing why one should be chosen over the other, I'm simply stating that among my selection criteria is that particular property of origin. It in itself, alone, nothing about it, just it. I want movies recorded on actual film, not movies that look like it, inherent property not its merit. I want books written by human minds, not books that \"you can't prove was not\". I want paintings painted by pencils held in human hands, guided by human hearts and minds, regardless of whether I am looking at a photograph of that painting, the property of it's origin is important to me, not its merits of lack thereof. So yeah, you can attack the merits of doing things one way or another all day long, but you don't get to say what I can an can not chose as my selection criteria. reply pythonaut_16 2 hours agorootparentDo you find it soulless when painters don’t mix their own paints or weave and stretch their own canvases? Is it soulless when a sculptor doesn’t source their own clay and marble directly from the earth? Or when a musician uses an instrument made by someone else, or a composer uses digital sounds recorded by someone else? There are many different forms of artistic expression and many rely on relatively mechanical and “soulless” work being done for us by someone or something else. Tools like this can open up new and creative world building options to people who previously didn’t have access to 3D models. It increases the opportunities for creative expression rather than diminishing them. reply Kiro 5 hours agorootparentprevRelax, no one's policing your opinions. You're not under attack. reply qwertox 10 hours agoparentprev> if I wanted a procedually generated world that just exist for no reason in particular, I'd walk outside.. I don't know why, but this comment reminded me of an experience I had a few years ago, when I started exercising outdoors. I rarely went outside prior to that and stayed in a relatively dark room. One day I looked at the sky and thought: Wow, these clouds do look like the ones in video games, thinking of Horizon and Assassins Creed. This just pertaining the comment about the \"procedurally generated\" outside world. While looking at the assets I also felt a bit of sadness. I was looking at the \"Two-story brick house with red roof and fence.\" and was then thinking about how it reminded me of the three.js animation/keyframes example [0]. I asked myself if we will lose something very valuable. The three.js example was hand-crafted by persons, a real intention behind every choice made, while with Trellis it's just \"poof, there it is\", an amalgamation of all work found in the internet and possibly in games. Some value will be lost through AI, but this makes handcrafted content even more valuable. The question is, if we will really value this enough for it to be sustainable for the artists. [0] https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_keyframes reply kurokikaze 9 hours agoparentprevIt's a really good prototyping tool for those who cannot do 3D assets. Like visual scripting opened up the game development/modding for those not really familiar with the prigramming (Unreal Blueprints for example). So yeah, I'm okay with models I can throw into my prototypes without learning Blender/Maya/whatever. Sure, it may look uneven and strange but at least it's content. reply elif 6 hours agoparentprevWhat if 2,000 people from your community collaborated on an art piece that spoke to their own personal experience? The artistic message would be disjointed, muddy, but indisputably an unmitigated human expression. So you put an artistic director in charge of curating and unifying the collective work. Still a human expression. This is what AI represents, and what the prompt writer represents. The data in LLM is undeniably human. Everything it \"knows\" is an extension of and exclusively composed of real human data. The prompt writer has a choice how much of his own human input to prioritize, and how much raw humanity to allow spontaneously. reply BenoitP 6 hours agoparentprev> if I wanted a procedually generated world that just exist for no reason in particular, I'd walk outside..

The next step is to generate models with higher quality mesh topology that allows animation and editing without breaking the mesh. I've done a lot of retopologizing and if I (or AI) were to rig these models as-is there would be all kinds of shading and deformation issues. Even without animating they are glaringly triangulated up close. But I suspect really high quality 3D asset generation is just around the corner because all you'd have to do is join up the approach seen here with AI quad re-meshing based on estimated direction fields and feature detection, which is also getting scarily good. reply taikon 18 hours agorootparentAnywhere you'd recommend a hobbyist can learn more about remeshing or feature detection? reply Kaijo 59 minutes agorootparentThis is a technical paper, but it has a quite conversational abstract and introduction that is easy enough to follow if you have some experience with mesh modelling: https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/media/papers/337/learnin... reply xi_design 8 hours agorootparentprevhttps://blog.yarsalabs.com/blender-topology-guide/ https://cgcookie.com/posts/guide-to-clean-topology reply woctordho 8 hours agorootparentprevAt this point maybe meshes are not the best representation for animation and editing.

But yes, symmetrical models with simpler meshes and better UV maps would definitely be needed to make it work as I'm imagining it reply horsawlarway 5 hours agorootparentMixamo is pretty close to this (Auto-rigging tool from Adobe). https://www.mixamo.com/#/ It's limited to mostly human shapes, but I've personally used it in combination with the 3d-pack in comfyUI to generate 3d models and rig them, starting from a text prompt. Trellis looks like a more capable model generation tool than TripoSR and marching cubes, which is what I was doing in Comfy: https://github.com/flowtyone/ComfyUI-Flowty-TripoSR - It worked but models ended up having a slightly \"melted wax\" appearance. This type of flow is definitely already here for low quality assets (think mobile games). I'm excited to go play around with Trellis, looks like a significant bump up in quality. reply airstrike 4 hours agorootparentSuper cool stuff! Thanks for sharing.

It may not be tractable to train a network to rig and animate meshes, as well as setting up an entire scene to be a \"digital twin\" of random videos, bit I imagine such a set up would have finer-grained control over the created video while keeping everything else in it the unchanged reply movedx 20 hours agoparentprevI'm interested to see how this affects 3D artists in game development studios.

I can see a future where these are replaced by AI and the main job of the in-house artists is to fix problems with the generated output. reply 8n4vidtmkvmk 15 hours agorootparentprevI hope they use it to create a bigger variety of assets. In lots of large games you start to notice where they've reused assets that could have used some more variation. reply pfisch 20 hours agorootparentprevLast time I looked at these the lighting was in the textures, also the meshes were asymmetrical and insane. Not usable by a game dev studio. reply bilbo0s 20 hours agorootparentThese models will get better. And in answer to the previous question, of course they will get rid of artists. They will keep just enough to do the work necessary with the help of generative models, and let go of the rest. The rest of the artists are not dumb, and they have a lot of talent. I'm sure many of them will use the same models to come up with their own games. How this whole thing will play out is anyone's guess. Long term, I'm hoping for new types of jobs to come into being.

Unless you already know what it looks like, any single view from any particular angle is quite hard even for a human to extrapolate from. If it wasn't in its dataset then I can forgive it that, particularly because the angular nature of it means that it could easily be tripped up into thinking it's not looking at an aircraft at all.

Unless we're strictly talking about static meshes (such as for scenery), building out the rigging/animation for garbage topologies is going to be absolute hell. 2. Your performance POV was for ONE mesh, but if your quad/triangle count is 10x higher than it needs to be, how well is it going to scale particularly on low-end gaming platforms? 3.

    "originBody": "Save Music, Save the Archive! Over 500 musicians are speaking out to demand that major labels drop a lawsuit aimed to destroy the Internet Archive—and for their industry to take concrete actions to realign their actions with the interests of working artists. Sign their open letter now to show your support. Take action as a musician Take action as a music fan or Internet Archive supporter Musicians for Fairness & Preservation Open Letter It’s time for the music industry to support the artistic legacies and futures of working musicians—not shareholder profits. We, the undersigned musicians, wholeheartedly oppose major record labels’ unjust lawsuit targeting the Internet Archive, a crucial non profit cultural institution. We don’t believe that the Internet Archive should be destroyed in our name. The biggest players of our industry clearly need better ideas for supporting us, the artists, and in this letter we are offering them. By 2031, music industry revenues will exceed 100 billion dollars, yet the average musician is struggling to survive. We’re priced out of touring by LiveNation’s abusive monopolies, and screwed over on royalties as big labels profit from Spotify’s unfair streaming revenue model. Music is demonetized and censored by DSPs, sued off the Internet Archive by major labels, and physical archives have gone up in flames because of corporate profiteering. It’s no surprise that mental health is a crisis among musicians—we’re sick with worry wondering if anything will be left of our life’s work. The music industry is not struggling anymore. Only musicians are. We demand a course-correction now, focused on the legacies and futures of working musicians. We call on all record labels, streaming platforms, ticketing outlets, and venues to immediately align on the following goals: 1. Protect our diverse music legacy. The music industry has a moral imperative to keep its history archived, but we can’t trust it to do so. Old records are falling to pieces, and without proper digital preservation, they’ll be gone for good. The masters of big money-making recordings are going up in flames, and lesser-known musicians are even more vulnerable to erasure. Incredible music and culture is getting lost forever, even though we have the technology to preserve it. Thanks to the nonprofit Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, almost half a million MTV News articles were spared permanent deletion. But when their Great 78 Project rescued over 400,000 recordings, major labels responded with a lawsuit against the Internet Archive for research library streams of old vinyl records. Going back to the opening of the library in 2006, the suit seeks $621,300,000 in damages. In Spotify bucks, $621,300,000 is 261 billion streams—wildly higher than the “millions” of research library streams alleged in the lawsuit. When songs streamed 10 million times would only pay out $23,800, we have to wonder how much our music is really worth. Artists and labels alike should partner with valuable cultural stewards like the Internet Archive—not sue them. It’s time to support nonprofit music preservation to ensure that our music and our stories aren’t lost to history. 2. Invest in living, working musicians–not back catalogs or monopolies. In 2022, music rights was a 40 billion dollar business. But a disproportionate cut of those billions are made by private equity exploiting the back catalogs of legacy musicians, many of whom are no longer living. Working artists took home as little as 12% of music industry revenue, even before COVID decimated touring. Meanwhile CEOs hire lawyers, publicists, and lobbyists to convince the public that music is essentially worthless. At the same time, we’re shut out of sharing in today’s historic highs in live concert revenue. Musicians, including big-name artists like Lorde and Animal Collective, shouldn’t lose money self-funding tours that cost 40% more post-pandemic. This exploitation comes at the hands of monopolies double-dipping into both ticketing and venue income, and gravely harms the workers and independent live music spaces that also comprise the touring ecosystem. Venues and ticketing retailers must set a precedent to ensure that artists get a fairer deal, including keeping 100% of merchandise sales, as suggested by the Featured Artist Coalition & United Musicians and Allied Workers’ #MyMerch campaign. We need transparent ticketing practices that prioritize income for artists and clarity for fans, so that live music work can actually make artists a living. 3. Make streaming services pay fair compensation. The music industry must put musicians before big tech. Lobbyist organizations should redirect their power into making the government appropriately tax streaming platforms to fund artists, rather than side with monopolistic corporate players. Recently, representatives Rashida Tlaib and Jamaal Bowman introduced the Living Wage for Musicians Act in partnership with United Musicians and Allied Workers to fight for fair pay in streaming. 30,000 working musicians and counting also signed onto UMAW’s #JusticeatSpotify campaign, demanding similar goals of fair compensation from DSPs. Artists have clearly voiced concern that the numbers aren’t adding up in our favor. Major labels must put forth a public plan with a concrete timeline to end their vertical investment in platforms like Spotify, whose CEO Daniel Ek profits more in one year than Taylor Swift has in her lifetime. The music we make today is valuable, and it’s time for the industry to treat it that way and invest in working musicians by paying fair royalties for streams. We demand that the music industry stop treating the history and future of musicians as expendable. Thanks to many self-organized groups and collectives, music workers are better organized now than at any other point in history. The inequity that permeates the lives of working artists, in all media, will end. Through the collective power of artists and those that love our work, we will build a sustainable future where our wellbeing and dignity come first. The music industry cannot survive without musicians. The only way it can continue is with immediate and sustained action to protect artists’ futures, and the long-term preservation of their works. We implore our labels, our agents, our publishers, and our venues to stand with us in demanding fairness for the artists on which this industry is built.

This is an invaluable public service for millions of music fans and a boon to American history and culture. [1] https://relisten.net reply krick 7 hours agoparentLook, don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of copyright violation. But every time something like this pops up my instant reaction is that Internet Archive are inflicting this on themselves. They are aiming to provide storage service for legally recorded concerts? Great. This should be a separate project, partnered and advertised, but formally unrelated to IA \"backup the internet\" thing. They are aiming to be a huge online library that allows you to \"legally\" borrow books? Great, let it be another separate project.

Credibility doesn’t fall from the sky… it has to actually be earned by someone or groups of someones. Usually in the course of their decisions and activities.

It is preventing great music from being made or at least released publicly. I understand that some musicians get nice royalties and this is their full-time thing, but most of us get close to nothing from streaming and barely break even from record sales.

However, they can't earn a living off of free or charity-paid-for music. While I'm sure there's a way to make money off of rights-free music (I mean you can still publish your albums, get on Spotify, do concerts etc), it's going to be similar to open source software - you can't compete with free. reply WalterBright 14 hours agoprevSomething I don't think anyone has thought of. The conventional idea is a band makes a CD of their songs, mastered to perfection, stamps out CDs and streams, and that's it. The exact same audio, let's call it the \"radio edit\". I hear the song on the radio, it's exactly the same. I can tell when a performer is lip syncing, because no singer sings a song the same way twice, and I know the radio edit. It's burned in my brain. But, I discovered that when real bands, like Fleetwood Mac, play a concert, they play their old standards, but in a different way every time. I bought their concert CDs, because hearing different versions of the same song makes it fresh and fun again. So my idea is, why don't bands produce a dozen or so \"radio edits\" of their better songs? I bet they'd increase sales, especially to people like me. I suppose they think they are doing that with the \"remastered\" edits, but those all stink. Sing it again, Sam! reply prmoustache 12 hours agoparentFirst you are wrong from the very start. Although the original source is usually the same many cases the radio-edit was not the same audio as the album version. It was usually much shorter. There is a reason it was called radio edit. > So my idea is, why don't bands produce a dozen or so \"radio edits\" of their better songs? I bet they'd increase sales, especially to people like me. In no particular order: - because concert recordings already achieve this purpose. - because time in the studio is costly, and you are not touring or composing while you are doing it. - because every single person will have her favorite studio version, the same way they may have their favorite concert radio and most would not buy n versions of the same song and would dislike the slightly modified one. Some have already produced n version, uncensored and censored versions. Usually you like the one you heard first the most. - Producing many different SKUs does not magically equal to making significantly more sales and can reduce revenues if stock of the less popular ones do not sell. reply hatsix 11 hours agorootparentAlso, if they're not the same recording, they're not the same album, which means that the popularity of any individual album is split. Contracts get better the better an album does on the charts, but if you release the same album three times, you're competing against yourself. reply WalterBright 11 hours agorootparentRelease the variations under the same SKU.

I hope the copies and archives continue to live on on data hoarders' systems. reply carlosjobim 6 hours agorootparentprevAll your arguments fall by the fact that even great artists record and put out a large amount of sub-par and even bad songs. reply analog31 5 hours agorootparentOddly enough your user name points to a great artist whose songs were mostly great -- at least the ones I know about. reply carlosjobim 5 hours agorootparentI didn't even think about that when writing the comment. But even the great Jobim had some duds. More importantly, I think the career of Jobim proves the original user's point. He was without any challengers the best composer of the 20th century, and he released different versions of many of his songs. Something which was not uncommon in the past. So why don't modern stars for example invite another popular singer to sing their song and release such a version? reply WalterBright 11 hours agorootparentprev> First you are wrong from the very start.

Slight variations does not imply that either is better than the other. reply kristianbrigman 5 hours agorootparent> When they do 20 takes and pick the \"best\", there's always a second \"best\". It's not like you're starting over. For modern pop music... as i understand it, the 'best' is a compilation of the 20 takes. There isn't necessarily a 'second best' take to choose. You could comp the takes differently, but i don't know anyone in any field who likes intentionally doing a job less than what they think is the 'best'. reply 8bitsrule 12 hours agoparentprevFrom the 'Save the Archive' site: \"But when their Great 78 Project rescued over 400,000 recordings, major labels responded with a lawsuit against the Internet Archive for research library streams of old vinyl records.... Artists and labels alike should partner with valuable cultural stewards like the Internet Archive—not sue them. It’s time to support nonprofit music preservation to ensure that our music and our stories aren’t lost to history.\" Most of the hundreds of old 78 labels (Brunswick, Federal, Odeon, Okeh, to name a few) [0] are long gone, as are their masters (if any) and their artists. IA recovered those recordings from existing copies made long, long ago... preserving a cultural heritage directly from collections of music available -only- on 78s.

[0] http://78discography.com/ reply orev 14 hours agoparentprev(Warning: gross simplification ahead) Because they don’t make (practically) any money on CD sales, streaming, or radio plays, the record labels do. That one performance is recorded, and they get paid for that performance and the record label owns it. Any time that recording is played, it’s seen as a marketing to sell the album. The artist makes their money through each live performance, so it makes sense for them to change things up so concert goers have an incentive to see something new. reply Supernaut 10 hours agorootparent> they don’t make (practically) any money on CD sales No, not any more, because Napster and the other IP-theft networks that followed in its wake destroyed that revenue model, both for the musicians and the record companies. But before that, many popular musicians made very large fortunes purely from record sales. So much so that some of them, most famously the Beatles, were able to give up live performance altogether. Also, I would suggest that what draws typical audiences to live performance is not the hope of hearing the lead guitarist bust out hot new variations on his solos. What they enjoy is the communal experience and the thrill of seeing famous people in the flesh. reply Tokkemon 14 hours agoparentprevMay I introduce you to literally all of Classical and Jazz Music?

They do though; more and more I'm seeing artists publish alternative edits, remasters, live versions, demos, songs-that-didn't-make-it, basically more of their back catalog onto streaming platforms. These \"rare\" tracks aren't going to sell albums so the investment to publish a new album won't be worth it, but uploading more stuff to streaming platforms is relatively cheap and easy in comparison.

A while back, Scorpions decided to re-record all their hits and release them on an album. The result was so close in production and performance that Apple Music went ahead and swapped the new version in place of the original. You'd dial up Rock You Like a Hurricane, and it'd play this thing that sounded just like the version you had burned into your head, but subtly different. It was like watching a car chase scene in a straight-to-Netflix movie where they thought they could get away with doing the whole thing in CGI. Straight down the middle of Uncanny Valley, to the point where you can't enjoy the song at all, and just spend your 4 minutes cataloging the tiny differences that don't live up to the Real Thing. Those hit songs all captured Magic in some way that just can't be recreated. Plenty have tried what you're talking about (Great White did the same trick, redoing their early stuff with their new singer), but all it does is create bland copies that don't live up to the original. They actually make you wonder why you liked the original in the first place, since (in GW's case) the replacement is just a cookie-cutter blues rock song that anybody could have done. It's hard to believe until you hear it, since yeah, it seems like a good idea. reply brudgers 12 hours agorootparentBands do what you described the Scorpions doing so the band will own the master.

There are seldom actually multiple takes -- those cost money. There is usually one publishable take. When you've got that one in the can, you move on to the next song. But naturally I can't speak for major acts like Fleetwood Mac. Historically, bands varied a lot in terms of how much editing they wanted to do. Many hits were recorded in one take by hired studio musicians. reply mdp2021 11 hours agoparentprev> let's call it the Call it the \"studio version\".

I wonder how much the artists of popular short-video music earn though, given the samplers of their songs can get tens of millions of views / listens. reply skrebbel 9 hours agoparentprevTaylor Swift did exactly this, though for different reasons. reply vunderba 14 hours agoparentprevI agree that something like this would help bring back the authenticity to music, it would almost be like the equivalent of how DVDs have director commentary, outtakes, etc. reply Cthulhu_ 4 hours agorootparentSome albums are published (also on streaming) with a commentary track, or a podcast series and making-of video series alongside it by the musician. Or n=1, I know Devin Townsend has taken to doing it. Ultimately they're all promotion for their albums and concerts, of course, but they're great for their \"personal branding\" as well. reply WalterBright 14 hours agorootparentprevThe movie business does things like \"directors cut\", \"restored cut\", etc. I'm sure it would be expensive to have more alternate cuts of the same scene. But when a studio does 20 takes of a song to get the perfect version, it would be cheap to release a bunch of them. Have you ever seen a TV commercial played to death, to the point where you hate the commercial, the product, and the company behind it? I bet that would be less of a problem if the same commercial had several different takes, and then mix them up when broadcasting them. (Yes, I know some are deliberately different, and yes, it helps.) Even a version now and then where they flub their lines, or trip over something, etc. Wouldn't it be more fun if Star Wars had two versions, one where Han shoots first, one where Greedo does, and you never knew which one you'd see when going to the theater? There are still a couple flubs in the released version, like when Luke yells \"Carrie\", there could be different reels released at the same time. The fans would then be impelled to keep going to the theater hoping to see all the different versions. reply mlyle 14 hours agorootparentNew masters and new takes absolutely show up. But only on the most successful songs, and mostly only after some time. And, of course, there's always the unplugged variants and the performance CDs. reply WalterBright 13 hours agorootparentRight, and they're done to juice the declining sales of the original. My idea was to release slightly different versions at the same time. Have two albums, identical cover, identical catalog number, same songlist, just the songs are different takes, maybe a different arrangement. The fans will be impelled to keep buying the album until they get both. reply __MatrixMan__ 14 hours agoparentprevI would have a great time selecting the edit which best fits the mood of the playlist I'm making. reply WalterBright 14 hours agorootparentI also like the imperfections in the live versions.

I had that exact same thought today when listening to Snarky Puppy’s re-release of We Like It Here. I have become so familiar with the original release that all of the differences in the remixes sound like mistakes, and the alternative takes sound like the musician forgot to read the music. Yes, I realise they’re improvised. Which is the point. Because they only published one canonical improvisation (until now) my conception of their music was made rigid in a way that probably wasn’t intended by the artists. (It also makes me appreciate the work that Giles Martin did on The Beatles’ remixes, that any deviation would be seen as heresy, and yet he’s managed to avoid any substantive controversy.) reply WalterBright 13 hours agorootparentI happen to like the Herb Alpert remixes of the Beatles' songs even better than the originals. reply eleveriven 9 hours agorootparentThat’s a great example of how a fresh take can sometimes resonate even more than the original reply simondotau 13 hours agorootparentprevMaybe in the future, recordings could have an AI component to them, such that every time you play it, you get a subtly different performance. Some artists may choose to lean in the technology more than others, with one extreme being soloists and improvisations published in the form of a bespoke model, trained on the entire history of jazz and refined by the artist to suit their tastes and the particular piece of music. reply eleveriven 10 hours agoparentprevI wonder if the real obstacle here is the music industry’s obsession with efficiency reply bsder 13 hours agoparentprev> So my idea is, why don't bands produce a dozen or so \"radio edits\" of their better songs?

In music an artist makes an album and then people buy it, at which point they have it and if the artist wants more money they have to make more albums.

Sorry, what? We're talking about streaming platforms here that have contracts with record labels that have contracts with musicians. If those contracts aren't paying musicians enough, why is the solution to impose a new tax on streaming platforms specifically to pay musicians? From the page they link to: > The Living Wage for Musicians Act would tax providers’ non-subscription revenues and add a small fee to the price of music streaming subscriptions. DSPs like Spotify offering interactive music streaming services would pass their taxed revenues and royalties to a non-profit collection and distribution fund, that would in turn pay artists in proportion to their monthly streams. Isn't this what these contracts are supposed to already be doing? If the numbers aren't making sense then the contract needs to renegotiated. If musicians don't have enough power to renegotiate then the government can and should address that. But why would the solution be to use the taxation power to do the job that royalties are already supposed to be doing? This feels like a classic case of addressing the symptoms (musicians aren't making enough money) while failing to address the actual problem (musicians have no power to negotiate for what they want). reply x-complexity 9 hours agoparentTo solve this issue, copyright needs to be permanently tied to the person who made the work, and can never be transferred.

They do treat it that way. They use the economies of scale and their skill at exploitation to steal it without paying a fair amount for it. By \"fair\", I mean an amount that would be paid if the industry were collectively owned by musicians. But the key here is that in global capitalism, an amount of money is not proportional to the value you bring to others any more. Instead, it is proportional to how effective you are at growing the existing power structure itself, which is an emergent phenomenon of global, high tech capitalism. Studios are akin to large corporations who extract raw materials for cheap from economically-poor countries. They exploit and short change the people who live there for enormous profits. Extracting \"raw materials\" as music is much the same phenomenon. Therefore, in order to truly solve this problem, large corporations such as music industries must be taken down, and not negotiated with. So, my advice to musicians is not to negotiate, but to create and sell your music directly. Start a Patreon and take orders yourself. reply csallen 14 hours agoparentI get your point, but I think this is overly cynical. The fact of the matter is that simply creating a product/service (or in this case, a song) is valuable, sure, but is typically only of limited value. Millions of people sing and write songs every year that nobody listens to or pays for. That fact predates evil executives and greedy companies. In fact, it's been the case for the entirety of mankind's history. The ability to take a song, popularize it enough for consumers to want more of it, package it in a way that consumers will pay for it, and distribute it widely enough that a large number of consumers will pay for it, is very difficult. And very valuable. It's the difference between the 0.01% of music that makes money and the 99.99% of music that doesn't. Of course the people who are skilled at doing that are going to be able to demand and extract large fees. This is true in every industry, not just art/music/etc. For example, lots of people make software and games. But improving it to the point of wide desirability, packaging it up, marketing it, and selling it on a marketplace where it successfully out-competes with other software and games is very difficult. The difference is that in most industries, the creators of the products themselves have taken on the responsibility for packaging, marketing, and selling their creations. Artists have largely outsourced this work to others. You may argue that they've been collectively hoodwinked, and I would partially agree. But it's also true that some of the richest and most powerful businesspeople of our generation are successful musicians (Taylor Swift, Jay-Z, Rihanna, Dr. Dre, Madonna, Beyonce, Paul McCartney, Lady Gaga, Drake, etc.) reply cwillu 14 hours agorootparent“ Then they take your money and, based on the Billboard charts, decide that statistically all of this money goes to Taylor Swift, regardless of what song you were actually playing. (They don't ask us what songs were actually played, and we couldn't really tell them if they did.) Unbelievably, ASCAP's slogan is \"We Create Music\". They do not create music, they create lawsuits. The only service they offer is, \"You pay me whatever I ask, or I sue you\". They provide the same service as in that Sopranos episode where Patsy and Burt try to extort a Starbucks. It's just a shakedown. It's just some wiseguy saying to you, \"Here's your cigarette machine, there's going to be $500 a week in it, capisce?\" […] You might wonder how they get to that number. Is it all just arbitrary capriciousness? Yes: BMI: They take your official fire department capacity and multiply it by the number of days you are open per week, and by some dollar amount. Actual attendance does not factor in. That dollar amount is higher if you ever charge admission, higher still if you have DJs, and even higher if you have live music! That's right, they charge you more when bands are playing their own songs. Oh, and of course there's the Footloose tax: it's even higher if you allow dancing. Or if you have a jukebox. (A jukebox!) ASCAP: I don't remember and I can't figure it out, but I think it is roughly the same nonsense that BMI does. SESAC: This one is based on capacity times days open per week, then multiplied by vibes. Also does not take attendance into account. GMR: This one is based on gross revenue times 0.15%. So if you play the same song at an event with a $10 ticket, and at one with a $30 ticket, sometimes that song is worth three times as much. […] Over in one corner: the entire streaming industry, paying nothing. And over in the other corner: small rooms like mine, providing that which is in actuality the only way for many bands to make any money at all, that is, by giving them a stage to play on in support of their t-shirt sales business.

There is always the option to move to the woods, live in a small cabin or group of likeminded people, and keep to yourself. There is always the option to listen to the music you want.

Others who are doing just fine following their own preferences and don't particularly need you to limit their options to conform to your preferences. Meaning is purpose, purpose is reason, reason is intention, and intention is by definition an artifact of the mind. The only one who can reduce your meaning is you. If the fact that music spreads far and wide to many people whose taste doesn't match you reduces your meaning, then that's because you choose to reduce your own meaning. reply vouaobrasil 8 hours agorootparentCapitalists shape society beyond what they want too.

But the latter is definitely reserved for top tier artists. Ultimately it's a tough industry. The fact of the matter is technology has made it vastly easier for more people to become musicians and distribute their music. The result is way more competition, which has turned music into a commodity. More competition = lower prices, that's just how it works, unfortunately. Some artists succeed at making a living, but most don't. But the fact of the matter is that this is how it's always been. There wasn't a golden era of the past where millions of musicians were making a comfortable living. Even when artists got paid more-per-sale (because consumers were willing to pay more for physical copies of media), there were far fewer people able to become artists in the first place. reply dangus 13 hours agorootparentprevBut you also have to admit that the concept of business leverage means that a lot of the people who aren't creating the value can steal the fruits of the labor of those who do create the value. It's not like every radio station, record label, and performance venue is owned by a wide array of competing companies in a free market. In reality it's a small handful of owners who will only put you in the spotlight if you accept unfair contracts. Check out how a lot of K-Pop contracts are structured.

But even if they don't enforce at full effect (and given Web Archive has been successfully used to provide evidence against UMG and Sony multiple times now, they have a pretty strong incentive to get it burned down), a sizable portion of the 400,000 recordings are from disks that quite literally broke down after capture.

Many people had contributed their efforts to the Redis project for free - both in terms of code but also in advocacy, writing tutorials, publishing example code etc - and when they did that it was under the understanding that project would remain under the same open source license. It honestly felt like a betrayal of trust. 2. From a purely selfish point of view, my favourite thing about open source licenses is that they let me know exactly what I'm allowed to do and build on that software without having to consult a license. Licenses like the new Redis one leave me potentially needing to get my own legal advice depending on what I'm building on the software. I don't want to spend my time, energy or money on that stuff! I do also see these kinds of license trends as harmful to open source generally. It used to be that you could pick an open source project and build a business on it and expect that the project would stay available to you under those well understood terms. That's not the case any more - not just because of Redis, there are a number of other high-profile license rug-pulling projects. I'm sad about that. (And yes, I do understand and dislike the trend of businesses building on open source without contributing back. There are no clearly correct answers here.) reply antirez 43 minutes agoparent\"Many people had contributed their efforts to the Redis project for free - both in terms of code but also in advocacy, writing tutorials, publishing example code etc\" I can understand that, but the thing about the BSD license is that such value never gets lost. People are able to fork, and after a fork for the original project to still lead will be require to put something more on the table. Inside Redis it was tried very hard to don't change license. For years it was some kind of \"dogma\", something one could not even speak about. Then after all the kind of attempts, and following the experiences of MongoDB and others, finally this choice was made. (Disclaimer: I saw the switch as an outsider, so my information is not complete about the final decisions -- I for sure know how this was always considered to avoid if other setups were possible). However now I see that there is the case for giving the community something in exchange to the license change: a lot of good things in the core, a very good attitude towards the community, and so forth. reply simonw 22 minutes agorootparentI'm embarrassed to admit that I hadn't fully taken into account that those contributions do at least remain under the BSD license and hence stay open under those original terms. Thanks for reminding me of that. reply antirez 8 minutes agorootparentIt's not an error at all, Simon! Because different setups in the past lead exactly to the scenario that you depicted. Examples: projects that requested signed copyright transfer for each patch (even GNU projects required this). But also what is more insidious is that very complex projects, while sometimes BSD or similarly licensed, were made completely proprietary (and not under the MongoDB / Redis circumstances, but just to turn proprietary for other reasons) but they were so complex internally that basically you can't do anything with the code, without paying like... 50 engineers to study it for six months. So it is an actual danger, but not in the case of BSD + projects that have an acceptable barrier to entry to be understood, fixed, modified, ... reply benatkin 39 minutes agorootparentprevIn a sense valkey is the main line and redis is now the fork. Valkey is about the same except losing the trademark. It’s similar to Hudson and Jenkins. It’s not so clear cut with OpenSearch. reply antirez 31 minutes agorootparentIMHO the \"real\" Redis is not about licensing, but about design (as long as the license is acceptable, as I think it is in both cases). We will see. reply benatkin 17 minutes agorootparentThat’s a nice way of looking at it. It’s quite an influential project. I’m just now thinking of taking more direct inspiration from it for a micro-library for webassembly. I wish you success in Redis Labs and thanks for Redis. In my other comment I said I never considered using Redis under the new license, but I didn’t say that I never would consider it, and I think I would if I found myself on a project that needs a key value database with enterprise support or more bells and whistles. I think it has its place, and to me it is an awful lot like postgres and EnterpriseDB, especially if Redis Labs gives its blessing, directly or tacitly, to adding this new vector type to valkey. reply sroussey 32 minutes agorootparentprevWhat’s valkey? reply simonw 24 minutes agorootparentIt's the Redis fork with the most resources and the most backing.

The uncertainty is what makes it scary, I'd also like a lot more clarity. reply antirez 42 minutes agorootparentThe good thing about this is that since the companies are copyright holder of the code, if this creates issues, the licenses can be rewritten and modified in order to be as sharp as possible in the use cases they want to avoid (which is... two/three users in the world :D). reply zokier 18 minutes agorootparentthe issues of sspl have been frequently and loudly been brought up previously, and nothing has happened. just to reiterate, this section is ridiculously expansive: > “Service Source Code” means the Corresponding Source for the Program or the modified version, and the Corresponding Source for all programs that you use to make the Program or modified version available as a service, including, without limitation, management software, user interfaces, application program interfaces, automation software, monitoring software, backup software, storage software and hosting software, all such that a user could run an instance of the service using the Service Source Code you make available. it is practically impossible for anyone to comply with that, to provide source code for every single program (without limitation) that they happen to use anywhere. of course none of the major sspl-using vendors are even pretending to themselves to follow these rules. sspl would be much better license if it just simply forbids providing services, instead of hiding behind this thin veneer of fake copyleft. > You can even still sell Redis as a service if you want, as long as you release all the orchestration systems under the same license (something that nobody would likely do, but this shows the copyleft approach of the license). note that this is not right, the \"copyleft\" is not limited to orchestration systems, it covers all programs that you use reply jcgrillo 38 minutes agorootparentprevThis is a great point, it'll probably take the better part of the next decade for all this to shake out.

It's very hard, especially since when writing fiction, and the kind of fiction I wanted to write, there are a lot of things you doubt about yourself: is my style as good as I wish?

The audience of programs are CPU cores that have a well defined set of behaviors. An i7 isn't going to one day decide it doesn't like the SHL instruction or offended by having to perform too many MOVs. The human by comparison is more taxing to write for as your brain is the compiler and checker for the instructions of your language. You write, proof read, correct, proof read again, correct more, delete, re-write, etc. I get why AI tools for writing are in high demand.

My understanding is that it's 100% about the license. That's certainly why I'll reach for valkey instead of redis next time I need it. That's also what I've heard from everyone else in a similar position. What else would the community split be about? reply antirez 17 minutes agoparentFor somebody, like you and many others, it was very important to retain an OSI license. But I feel that in general given that the new license is IMHO good for almost every user, from the POV of what they can do with the code, and that the cloud situation was quite self evident, I believe that with better communication, and immediate developments/merges in the core, to counter balance the license switch, many people would understand the license matter. We will not win back you as a user, and I respect that. But many, many users that see openness, good features and documentation, the github repository at the center of everything: I believe they will appreciate this, and can decide that Redis is good for them. reply benatkin 1 hour agoprevI appreciate redis, but believe me when I say, I never considered using redis under anything but its original license, and I am just as grateful for valkey as I am for redis. It is very easy to move and I will keep moving anytime there is a license switch-up like this. I prefer a fork rather than an alternative, but if a good fork hadn't emerged, I would have moved to something different with its own technical advantages and drawbacks. reply nine_k 15 minutes agoparentWhat parts of the new licence are particularly critical for this decision? Just curious. reply PeterZaitsev 4 minutes agoprevHehehe, Reading between the lines. Redis is Hurting, Valkey is making a real difference at pulling the customers away. Elastic and OpenSearch were in similar situation, so Elastic went on to change license back to (more restrictive) Open Source License. Redis went different route by bringing Redis founder back. I wonder if they go back on their license change next or do they think Redis founder endorsing license change, despite his previous promises of Redis being Open Source forever is enough ? Time will tell. reply vessenes 1 hour agoprevLove this, welcome back Salvatore -- hopefully it's fulfilling and fun. You authoring some new vector primitives seem to indicate to me you might be back in your sweet spot. Getting a 100x engineer back to making new things is great for the world. Some thoughts on vectors and embeddings and etc; there was a spate of companies that launched RAG-related \"new\" databases a couple of years ago, and obviously we have plugins to major databases now. I appreciate the idea that some low level tools, properly tuned, will be maximally useful. There was a lottt of overhead playing with those vector dbs, and often in testing I would just want to throw up like 10,000 embeddings and do some things with them; I didn't want to have to choose a pytorch variant in a docker image to do so. Anyway. It makes me wonder what else would be useful to have on the AI support side. I'll look forward to playing around with the module. reply rcarmo 2 hours agoprevWell, I see this as great news. I've been tinkering with vector search myself and really don't like the APIs, query structures, even the embedding steps required. Anything that makes it simpler (and faster) is most welcome. I do hope Salvatore keeps doing emulators for MCUs, though :) reply antirez 1 hour agoparentThank you Rui, my target is: API that can be learned and used under 120 seconds. I don't think more of this is needed, for the basic usage. Then there could be other stuff, but it must be incremental. Easy things must be easy. reply rcarmo 1 hour agorootparentWell, the VSIM example I got inside of 10 seconds, so at least for now you're on track :) reply antirez 1 hour agorootparentTLDR API: VADD key [VALUES| FP32 ] element VSIM key [VALUES ...FP32 ...ELE ...] [COUNT ] [EPSION ] VCARD key (number of elements) VDIM key (dimension of the vectors) VDEL keyAnd so forth. However there are nice things you can enable, if you want. For instance VADD has the [REDUCE] option that implements random projection in order to reduce the dimensionality of your embeddings. Less memory, and it is faster. And so forth. Will work on it during xmas, it's quite fun. It implements on-insertion normalization and int8 quantization. The algorithm to insert nodes inside the HNSW attempts to never leave isolated nodes and to get good quality links and so forth.

Maybe you'd load up relevant embeddings for a particular user while they're interacting with their dataset, to make their responses quicker? You've already spent the effort on hydrating their data out of persistence though. I guess step one is likely being a more trusted alternative to the in-memory vector solutions like HNSW, Faiss, and a potentially faster engine than pg_vector. I've always seen Redis as an augmentation, but maybe in this role it can take the helm? reply simonw 26 minutes agorootparentIt's exactly that. Redis is an in-memory data structure server that you can outsource index-style operations to. Vector similarity is a type of index search. I think it's an exact fit for Redis. reply some1else 7 minutes agorootparentCool. Redis in front of Postgres always brought peace-of-mind that will likely be welcome for the vector data use-case.

Is there a need to re-join the old company? reply antirez 1 hour agoparentThat's a good question. The problem is that: I would end doing something in the vector search space probably, or other stuff that are tangent to AI. I can do the same but in public, as examples of hacking with this stuff, to share with the community. In the process I can add a solid vector indexing capability to Redis. It looks like a nice way to continue hacking. reply brabel 1 hour agoparentprevFrom the blog post, looks like he contemplated that (I'm sure that while playing around with code, he would've thought of that) but ended up going in another direction. You can disagree, but you've got to respect his decision to try and do what is best for him, and what he believes is best for Redis. reply ofiryanai 1 hour agoprevVery exciting! I sympathise with the Redis \"lego\" way. But don't you think that hybrid search ha meaningful use cases? E.g searches that combines BM25 or piplned search in more sophisticated way than simple filter + knn / hnsw then filter? Or maybe its more for a search engine than a cache reply antirez 1 hour agoparentI think that hybrid is useful in many contexts, but that providing hybrid as a bundle with other filtering techniques, API-side, is not necessarily the best way. Just a trivial example, you want to filter by documents year for similarity. With Redis vector indexes you didn't even care about hybrid, you create different keys for different years. This is the usual Redis tradeoff, it's very similar to the past but applied to a novel field. However I don't deny that in the future maybe, if elements of vector sets happen to be JSON documents (maybe just with the attributes you want to filter with, and a document ID), it may be useful to have VSIM options to filter by such scalars. reply ksec 1 hour agoprevWelcome Back. Antirez! ( Surprised This blog post is submitted just 2 min after it was posted ) I am wondering if Valkey has moved so far off from Redis the codebase couldn't be merged again? I am reading the top contributor to ValKey are now from Tencent Cloud, Google, Amazon and Ericsson. Could someone help with me with SSPL, is it essentially AGPL v3 except instead of releasing the source code only you have to release the whole system that is able to run the services you are currently operating on top of ? Just wondering these things from the sideline. As I am still on the memcached camp. reply antirez 1 hour agoparentHi ksec! Thanks. ValKey and Redis are not so different codebases so far, but I have the feeling they will diverge more and more. I hope that at least at protocol level they will stay compatible, to be able to use the same clients. I doubt the projects can be rejoined, because the backers have different goals. Amazon / Google / Alibaba / ... wants to keep using it without any revenue sharing, and Redis instead does not want Redis to be sold SAAS style since the cloud three-poly makes it very hard to penetrate the market without any agreement. I'm not a business person but this is how I see the current matter. reply world2vec 1 hour agoprevIs Claude really that much better than ChatGPT?

I bet you'll discover that Claude AI can help you a great deal more. If that will be the case, you gained a much better AI assistant. Otherwise it's just 20 bucks... For me the difference is huge. reply pknerd 1 hour agorootparentI have used Claude(Free) for coding and architecture-related questions and found it pretty solid but I found chatGPT a generalist LLM that is good at many things. Is Claude the same? Or you found Claude better for coding related tasks? reply devjab 58 minutes agoparentprevWe use both, in my anecdotal experience it depends on what you use them for. The engineering teams which build solar plants use them as “an extra set of eyes” for increased quality control, and they chose ChatGPT. It discovered something to do with cable sizes and efficiency which ended up saving/making a lot of money. I’m sorry I can’t be more precise than that, but I know they had a much better result rate with ChatGPT. For my team which is software development, we favour Claude. It’s obviously rather anecdotal but it has been much better at Go than ChatGPT. For other languages like Python I don’t think there is any real difference. If you feed them both the same prompt they’ll often give you an extremely similar output, and neither will consistently be better than the other. So I think it’s mainly to work with the one which works for you. I’ve seen some of our more junior developers first use Claude and then ChatGPT to refine their output, or the reverse. reply porridgeraisin 1 hour agoparentprevI think both are really capable. However anecdotally, I notice myself doing way less of the \"annoyed, cancel response, extend prompt instructions, regenerate\" cycles with Claude as compared to chatgpt. Also, I am not sure if it has my writing style preferences saved somewhere, but Claude uses the terse style I prefer to read explanations in, without me needing to mention it. ChatGPT can do it too but it needs to be prompted lest it do the whole \"repeat question, bullet points, summary\" ceremony. ChatGPT gets really annoying when you have do the \"slightly more detailed, slightly more terse, there we go\" ceremony as well. For similar reasons, I prefer it for code. One place where ChatGPT absolutely takes the cake though is mathematical proofs heavy with symbols. Nothing else comes close in my experience. It's also better at latex typesetting (seems to be more fluent with common packages like amsmath). reply electroly 50 minutes agoparentprevI was in the same boat. I gave Claude a try, just to see what I was missing, and I ended up never returning to ChatGPT except to generate pictures (which Claude can't do). Give it a try for a month. It's worth a shot. They have improvements beyond just generally being smarter. For instance, Claude can _edit_ a prior code block rather than just emitting a new one. It can build React components and show them to you, rather than just giving you the code. reply alex-moon 31 minutes agoprevHonestly working as a back-end Web dev is kind of a dream job just because you have these stack apps that are super fast, super stable and do exactly what they say they do.

Comparing your nonfree license to the AGPL might seem like an argument in favor of the open-ness of your license, but in reality it is a condemnation. It is insane to think that you should be able to dictate what happens to software that other people run on their own computers that you have given away as free software.

It requires some patience but after getting used to it, the experience is surprisingly pleasant especially if you're familiar with terminal-based tools. My environment consists of: - Galaxy S24 Ultra - Termius: I think it is the best terminal emulator and SSH client on Android. The sad thing is that the paid version is a bit too expensive. ($10 per month, no permanent option) - tmux: Mobile connections are brittle so it is a must. - Vim: Allows me to navigate the code freely without using arrow keys, which is really useful on the touch keyboard. Not that of a big deal, but the thing that I think is more pleasant on the phone than on the PC is that I can use my fingerprint to log in to the remote server. The fingerprint is stored in the TPM so it is safe. It feels magical! Edit: The biggest pain point for me was the limited width of the smartphone screen. It is a bit hard to skim over the code quickly because most lines are severely cut. Text wrapping helps this but personally I hate text wrapping. Keeping landscape mode is not an option because the code area is completely hidden when the touch keyboard is displayed. That's why foldable phones are great for coding, as they have a wider screen. My previous phone was Galaxy Fold and it was a wonderful coding machine. reply glidergun 7 hours agoparentTry pairing tmux with mosh, it's how I've been working for years whenever I'm forced to admin through a brittle straw. Mosh combats lag pretty well and doesn't care if your connection drops intermittently. https://mosh.org/ reply barosl 6 hours agorootparentI tried Mosh but it didn't fit my taste. It tries to \"predict\" the state of the screen before being acknowledged by the server, but sometimes the prediction is wrong and Mosh reverts the cursor movement and redraws the affected area of the terminal. For example, when I'm using split windows in Vim or tmux, Mosh allows typed characters to overflow beyond the separator, briefly, until being told \"no\" by the server. Personally I find this behavior very disturbing. Enduring higher lags was more bearable to me. reply glidergun 6 hours agorootparentI can see how that's off-putting, but I've learned to ignore the occasional cosmetic hiccup and just trust that it will sync up correctly.

I've been burned by that before.

Also a lot of those clients had none or very restricted internet access, so it is really hard to get debugging tools.

Once you get used to it it's easy to 'know' by muscle memory when the desired word is the second or third choice, so you end up typing with basically the same number of keystrokes as qwerty but with only 10 keys. Then again maybe this is only possible with the superpower of childhood cognition. I recently witnessed a friends 9yo playing with a 1940s typewriter I'd restored. Having basically never used a full sized keyboard before, within about 2 minutes she'd familiarized herself with the qwerty layout, figured out how to turn the shift lock on and off, deduced the correct key action to bounce the hammers off the platten without them clashing, and figured out how to change colours.

As others have noted, plenty of us have developed on computers where the display had merely 25 lines and 80 columns of characters, or less, and no Internet connection at all. Not intermittent connection, complete absence of connection. Exchanging data meant physically carrying disks, which contained as little as 360 kilobytes (or less). That developer's phone is probably thousands of times more powerful than what we had back then, and has the luxury of a nearly permanent network connection to a huge amount of even more powerful computers. The only real limitation, other than arbitrary operating system restrictions, is the very small screen size and tiny keyboard size.

I'm not saying being a doctor is perfect, it certainly varies. But I feel it's more future proof than SWE. Also it's easy to code as a hobby. Perhaps even more fun than doing it professionally. Another point, in some developed countries, having access to healthcare can be increasingly difficult.

    "originBody": "Debanking (and Debunking?) Patrick McKenzie (patio11) • Dec 9th, 2024 Recently, noted VC Marc Andreessen kicked off a discussion about debanking, in a podcast with his co-founder Ben Horowitz (begins at 7:42) and in an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast. The venture firm they founded, a16z, also published a brief on this topic. The central thrust, quoting a16z’s brief (ellipsis in original): “Debanking can therefore be used as a tool or weapon systemically wielded by specific political actors / agencies against private individuals or industries without due process. Imagine if the government decided who could or couldn’t get electricity merely because of their politics, or some arbitrary reason… without having to explain, notify, or offer recourse. That’s what’s happening with debanking.” If you are new here, you are presently reading a column which routinely covers compliance-oriented topics at the intersection of the financial system and technology companies. This topic is pretty central to my beat, and I have some relevant personal knowledge. “It’s not a conspiracy theory if people really are out to get you.” sums up part of my reaction to this, but only part. There exists some amount of conflation between what private actors are doing, what state actors have de facto or de jure commanded that they do, and which particular state and political actors have their fingers on the keyboard. These create a complex system; the threads are not entirely divorced from each other. A few disclaimers: I previously worked for Stripe, and am currently an advisor there. Stripe is not a bank, but many regulated financial institutions have similar considerations. I’m not speaking for them. Stripe does not necessarily endorse things I say in my own spaces. The recent debanking discourse focuses (and overfocuses; see below) on crypto. I am (somewhat notoriously) a crypto skeptic. Arguments aren’t soldiers; the truth is the truth. The truth sometimes favors crypto advocates in this discussion, and where it does, I will cite sources extensively. Where it doesn’t, I will mostly cite sources extensively. The debanking discussion arises from an explicitly political project. Moreover, questions of public policy are frequently political in a democracy. The ballot box is the ultimate check on government abuse of power. While I have no project here, and try to be non-partisan in professional spaces, to ease the fears of crypto fans: I’m definitely not a secret Warrenite. Closing bank accounts “Debanking” describes a cluster of behaviors. The most salient one is involuntarily closing a customer’s bank account, often a long-established one, optionally without presenting a reason. Because “debanking” is an advocacy term, that often gets conflated with declining to open an account for a person or a business. These two things are very different in their impact on the person/firm and in our moral intuitions. It’s the difference between getting divorced and being turned down for a date. Advocates often invoke a user-centric perspective of debanking, focusing on the impact on individuals/firms. Then, they conflate it with regulators’ decisions regarding bank supervision, in ways which are facially not about direct user impact. We will return to bank supervision later. Industry doesn’t call it “debanking.” This is partly for the usual corporate euphemism reasons. This is partly because industry does not always share assumptions of how the world should work with advocates, and is concerned that “debanking” smuggles in those assumptions. So when one discusses this with colleagues, one might use words like offboarding, derisking, closing the accounts of a customer, etc. There is often an implication, and much rarer a reality, that the debanking decision is not one of a single financial institution. Sufficiently correlated “independent” decisions by financial institutions could deprive a firm or individual of access to banking services. We will explore some coordination mechanisms, which are overstated, and some correlation mechanisms, which are poorly understood. We’re hearing about debanking because it sometimes affects socially established wealthy entrepreneurs and their companies. Some people it happened to are densely networked and also affiliated with talented communicators that have (in the parlance of our times) a platform. It is important to say from the jump that this is not the typical profile. A huge majority of all people who find their accounts involuntarily closed will have been let go for credit risk or operational cost reasons. Overdraft your account repeatedly and look unlikely to be able to pay the fee for this service? Expect to lose that account, and probably all other accounts at that institution. Do you know anyone with a parent advanced in years, who is dealing with challenges of aging, perhaps has gotten scammed a time or three, and might occasionally lash out at customer service employees? Debanking is more relevant to their interests than they might currently appreciate. Decisions to debank an individual will often debank their controlled entities, and vice versa. Debanking will also not infrequently swiftly cascade to accounts in the same household, regardless of title (non-specialists can round this to “name on the account”; industry can’t). Banks institutionally consider those accounts in the same household to be highly likely to be under common control, regardless of what paperwork, account holders, or politically influential subcultures believe. This is an area in which the mores of the banking industry are much closer to the traditional middle class than to coastal elites. Sometimes, though, one gets one’s accounts closed because one has activities which are outside a bank’s risk tolerance or contrary to their compliance posture. This was cited to me both times I was debanked. Two debanking anecdotes explained Once upon a time, I had a U.S. checking account. One day, the bank called me, and asked me why I was averaging two incoming ACH transfers a day. I told them that I ran a sole proprietorship selling software over the Internet. The ACH transfers were from from my two payment providers, which paid me out my sales (less fees) once per business day. The bank thanked me for my explanation and told me they thought the business sounded legitimate. Then they said I had 30 days to move the business’ funds flow to a different bank, or they would close all my accounts. “Banksplain that offboarding?” Typical retail consumer checking accounts are, on the spectrum of the full menu of banking services, extremely low-risk, not a focus of bank examiner time, and institutionally preferred by both banks and regulators because of core financial access concerns. Accordingly, the amount and degree of monitoring a bank invests in the consumer checking line of business will be relatively low, in line with a risk analysis it performed. Its regulator has read that analysis and decision, and expressed no objection to it. This particular bank did not, at the time, have a small business practice within its personal banking division. Very many banks do, but this particular bank did not. And thus this bank had not built out the higher degree of policies and procedures that would support small business banking. A surprising example of a small business that demands drastically more thought than you would think is discussed in detail below. The bank, on learning I had a sole proprietorship banked with them, considered that behavior innocent but not supportable, not because it didn't like my business but because it knew it had no built out infrastructure to support any business. At the second institution, I once checked my U.S.-organized individual retirement account from a Japanese IP address. I had done that many times, but I did it one last time, too. This caused a short phone call, where the bank’s affiliate confirmed that I indeed lived in Japan, then informed me the account would be immediately restricted and then closed. I would need to make arrangements to request my shares be transferred to a new (U.S.) brokerage account, or authorize them to sell and mail me a check. “Banksplain that offboarding?” This was likely downstream of a procedure implemented to ensure that the institution’s affiliated securities firm did not act outside the scope of its broker-dealer licenses, which (the institution was aware) did not include any with Japanese regulators. When these events happened, it was very annoying. I did not contemporaneously understand why they were happening. They required me to take time away from life, my day job, and business to make more phone calls, learn more things about the financial industry, and ultimately open new accounts. That is the typical end to a debanking story. “And then, I opened a new account.” Immigrant communities keep lists of which banks most want their business. So does the community of people who run small software businesses online. And so, while immigrants and small software companies deal with substantially more banking friction than the typical American working for Google or a university does, they are both very bankable. Consider crypto entrepreneurs who have received an offer of investment of several million dollars. One might be able to hold the ideas in one mind simultaneously that a) there is some diversity of life experiences in that group but b) on average though, they are very socially advantaged, when considered on most of the usual axes. Despite those substantial advantages, it has been persuasively alleged that their companies and the entrepreneurs themselves routinely suffer debanking. I also understand this to be true, in large part downstream of one risk factor that they hit more than almost all legal businesses of comparable scale and sophistication. There have been times and places where this challenge made crypto firms almost unbankable to the extent banks knew what they were doing. And it directly drives decisions against crypto founders and employees. Debanking specifically for AML risk I’ve written extensively about KYC and AML and will not recap all of it here. Banks have a panoply of obligations under regulation. One of those is that they have to write AML policies, including policies which identify high-risk activities. Then they have to follow those policies. You can overpromise but you cannot underdeliver; after you’ve told a regulator you will do X, not doing X can result in fines and other punishments, even if the regulator did not tell you to do (specifically) X. Before we reach crypto, consider AML risk and its consequences among money services businesses. Running a money services business (MSB) is virtually universally called out as a high-risk activity by banks’ internal AML policies. Explaining why would require explaining the entire history and object of AML. Please just take as writ for the moment: all banks have a list, those lists rhyme with some variation, and MSBs are on all the lists. Some banks have built out so-called enhanced due diligence (EDD) programs under which they will bank MSBs. Many banks have not; if a business banking at one identifies itself as an MSB, or if their ongoing monitoring of transactions suggests one is probably an MSB (for example, if there are ACH pulls from Western Union for tens of thousands of dollars, which will suggest to an analyst that the business is probably a Western Union agent transaction above the de minimis threshold), the bank intends that business to get a letter. Whether they successfully execute on the letter, and the decision the letter announces, varies, but in terms of intent, they intend to consistently reach the decision given similar facts. That letter will, in all likelihood, not be candid as to what is happening or why. It may not cite that the customer is an MSB. It may not cite why the bank believes that. It will not recount the bank’s internal AML policies which identify being an MSB as a high-risk activity, though it might say four or five templated words about risk. It will not explain the bank’s strategic decision to not invest in a compliant EDD program that would allow it to service MSBs. No, the letter will say that the bank is closing the customer's accounts. It may describe this as a \"business decision\", using those two words, of the bank. It will often say that this decision is final. The decision is probably not actually final. That is an opening negotiating position, like “We don’t negotiate salaries.” If you don’t argue the point, it has achieved its objective. The grain of truth within it is “We probabilistically think that talking with the typical recipient of this letter is negative expected value.” Why doesn’t the bank want to talk with the typical recipient about it? Because the typical MSB is a bodega with a sideline in alternative financial services. You might think that it is absurd that the government would concern itself with MSBs that are clearly the sideline of the local bodega. Without reaching the question of whether this priority is absurd, I invite you to peruse the Financial Crime Enforcement Network’s Enforcement Actions For Failure To Register As A Money Services Business. These are a small sample of real enforcement actions. That sample was chosen by FINCEN and I think reasonable people understand it was not chosen by FINCEN with a goal of embarrassing FINCEN or the entire AML regime that ensures FINCEN employees will have a job tomorrow. I will take the liberty of fictionalizing names here, to give you the flavor of real people with real businesses that FINCEN both a) prosecuted and b) posted trophies of pour encourager les autres : Bob Smith d/b/a Bob’s Fast Gas. Taro’s Snack Shop, Inc. Cheap Phonez 4 U, Inc. Ben Goldberg d/b/a Kosher Foods. FINCEN has posted the full text of each settlement, frequently including a restatement of their alleged violations. In many of those documents (not all of them!), if one credits FINCEN’s narrative as Gospel truth, one will believe: yeah, this is absolutely a bodega. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has jammed up the guy behind the counter because he failed to have a written AML/KYC policy and because when he traveled overseas the person he hired to mind the store was not trained in AML. Having won the case, they fined him $10,000. Given that, a fair-minded reader immediately assumes the bodega is probably not actually a front for the Colombian drug cartels, Hamas, or a foreign intelligence operation. With this well-evidenced understanding of FINCEN’s… quixotic interest in the crime of selling money orders and also laundry detergent and delicious sandwiches, you can understand why a bank, attentive to FINCEN’s desires here, is doing something that strikes many people as insane. It has employed teams of people whose job is to make sure it sifts the rogue bodegas from the garden-variety bodegas before FINCEN asks “Why did you move money for a rogue bodega!? How many times do we have to tell you people! BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR ROGUE BODEGAS.” Running EDD processes and ongoing monitoring is expensive. Banking a bodega isn’t very lucrative. And thus most banks won’t bank a bodega that is also an MSB, despite them having no particular malice against bodegas or the people who run them. This won’t change if the bodega owner calls to them to protest that he is a legitimate businessman, that this debanking is un-American, or that he feels like they are discriminating against him for being an immigrant. That’s a conversation the bank has had a thousand times and never want to have again… with a bodega owner. Some MSBs are fintechs. They have teams of people who are extremely aware of financial regulation. Those professionals intentionally chose a bank which was capable of banking at least some MSBs. They then had a laborious bespoke conversation about risk tolerance and mutually agreed-upon compliance procedures. More than zero fintechs have been debanked over the years, but they probably don’t first learn about it from a paper letter. Their team of people who do bank things all day would have heard from the team of people that do fintech things all day, likely beginning many moons ago. And if they got the letter, they would understand generally why they got the letter, and not be so oblivious as to trust the literal text of the letter. Class is an interconnected set of culture, scripted behaviors, and the advantages and disadvantages that attach to them. The culture that is the American professional-managerial class has a relationship with truth which occasionally confounds outsiders to it. An American PMC member, particularly one with a professional specialization in banking, understands an offboarding letter to be a ritual object rather than something meant to be taken literally. Many regular people who get the offboarding letter are confused and upset. Most people who get this letter are insufficiently expert in the financial system to understand what is going on. Many of them are (perhaps sensibly) enraged that the bank seems reluctant to offer answers. If they successfully pry answers out of the bank, the answers sound like nonsense or change constantly. Here, advocates often say that banks lack fundamental humanity, regard for their customers, or simple competence. I’d tell them that is neither here nor there, but the challenges described in Seeing like a Bank drive far more of this than malice, apathy, or incompetence as such. It is a systems issue. But AML-driven offboarding has one particular spectral signature which is worse than normal debanking, which will always be a confusing, unpleasant experience for most customers. Some of these customers are getting the letter because the bank looked into their account after a transaction was flagged as suspicious. This generally happens because an automated system twinged on it. Most of the so-called “alerts” are false positives, but banks are required to have and follow a procedure to triage them. That procedure is typically “Send a tweet-length summary of the alert to an analyst and have them eyeball things.” Every bank needs at least one person triaging alerts; the largest banks have thousands. What if the analyst, on the basis of their training, experience, and data available from the alert system and from the account history they can access, decides that a transaction has… more than nothing irregular about it? Then they compose a specially formatted memo. That memo is called a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). The bank files it with FINCEN, via a computer talking to a computer after the analyst pushes some buttons. Then the analyst goes back to triaging incoming alerts. Busting bodegas is a sideline for FINCEN; receiving SARs is their main job. A SAR is not a conviction of a crime. It isn’t even an accusation of a crime. It is an interoffice memo documenting an irregularity, about 2-3 pages long. Banks file about 4 million per year. (There are some non-bank businesses also obliged to file them, but nobody is presently complaining about decasinoing, so ignore that detail. Banks are the central filers of SARs.) For flavor: about 10% are in the bucket Transaction With No Apparent Economic, Business, or Lawful Purpose. FINCEN has ~300 employees and so cannot possibly read any significant portion of these memos. They mostly just maintain the system which puts them in a database which is searchable by many law enforcement agencies. The overwhelming majority are write-once read-never. Banks are extremely aware that most SARs are low signal, and that a good customer might wander into getting one filed on them. But there are thresholds and risk tolerance levels. And SARs will sometimes, fairly mechanically, cause banks to decide that they probably don’t want to be holding a hot potato. It’s risky, plausibly, and expensive, certainly. At many institutions, for retail accounts, the institution will have serious questions about whether it wants to continue working with you on the second SAR. It will probably not spend that much time thinking deeply about the answer. So can the bank simply explain to the customer that staff time preparing SARs is expensive and that routinely banking customers who turn out to be real money launderers is a great way to end up with billion dollar fines? No, they cannot. The typical individual named in a SAR is low-sophistication and cannot meaningfully participate in a discussion with a Compliance officer, because they’re very probably at the social margins. Do you have a favorite axis of disadvantage? Immigrant, no financial background, limited English ability, small business owner, socioeconomic class, etc? The axis has non-zero relevance to one’s probability of getting a SAR filed on oneself due to innocent behavior. Very many people who have SARs filed on them are disadvantaged on several axes simultaneously. No, the bank cannot explain why SARs triggered a debanking, because disclosing the existence of a SAR is illegal. 12 CFR 21.11(k) Yes, it is the law in the United States that a private non-court, in possession of a memo written by a non-intelligence analyst, cannot describe the nature of the non-accusation the memo makes. Nor can it confirm or deny the existence of the memo. This is not a James Bond film. This is not a farce about the security state. This is not a right-wing conspiracy. This is very much the law. If you work at a regulated financial institution, in the U.S. or any allied country, you will be read into SAR (and broader AML) confidentiality within days of joining. You will be instructed to comply with it, very diligently. If you do not, your employer may suffer consequences. You personally are subject to private sanction by your employer (up to and including termination) and also the potential for criminal prosecution. If your trainer speaks with a British accent, they will phrase the offense as “tipping off.” It’s not just illegal to disclose a SAR to the customer. It is extremely discouraged, by Compliance, to allow there to be an information flow within the bank itself that would allow most employees who interact directly with customers, like call center reps or their branch banker, to learn the existence of SAR. This is out of the concern that they would provide a customer with a responsive answer to the question “Why are you closing my account?!” And so this is one case where in Seeing like a Bank the institution intentionally blinds itself. Very soon after making the decision to close your account the bank does not know specifically why it chose to close your account. This strikes many people as Kafkaesque. (Me, too!) It is the long-standing practice of banking in the U.S. and allied countries. It is downstream of laws passed by duly elected representatives. It was not capriciously developed as a political tool in the last few years. (We’ll get to those.) Crypto-investing VCs are not low-sophistication operators of the corner bodega. They are extremely aware that crypto is on the high-risk list at many institutions. They would prefer this were not so. Their preferences regarding the high-risk list at, say, portfolio fintech companies are sophisticated and nuanced. For example, they will (accurately!) say that the high-risk list authored by a company socially close to them did not arise in a vacuum. Certain entries were foisted upon them by financial partners. Their financial partners will, over drinks at the bar, very quietly, say that they can relate to occasionally feeling powerless. And, though many will find this dumbfounding, their regulators will frequently say the same thing. Occasionally. About some entries. We shall return to the mechanisms. Debankings of founders as opposed to firms Plausibly some crypto founders are low-sophistication about the finance industry in their early days as founders. This is not a judgement about one's character. Nobody is born knowing everything, and very few people will have a serious and informed encounter with this topic ever, not in school, not at work, not in being a generally well-read individual, unless and until it is professionally relevant to them. Perhaps a founder might ask a friend: “I run a legitimate business which happens to be in crypto and suddenly found my personal accounts closed. Why did this happen? I did nothing wrong.” Playing the odds? The bank thinks there is an unacceptable risk that you will use your personal accounts to launder money on behalf of the business (and/or its customers, etc). The bank has insufficient controls to give them an appropriate level of certainty as to whether you’re doing this or not. They are disinclined to find out the hard way, so they invite you to find another bank. Why do they think you might launder on behalf of the business? In part because of the extensive history of crypto companies laundering funds through the accounts of their founders and employees, specifically, and the banking industry’s highly-evidenced belief that businesses and their owners routinely commingle funds, generally. Tether maintained access to the banking system by, among other mechanisms, having their executives establish accounts in their own names, stashing funds in the name of a lawyer, and using their non-executive employees as money mules. SBF had many talents but one of the main ones was money laundering. A major mechanism for that was loaning money (mostly customer assets and mostly sham loans) to employees then representing to banks (and others) that the employee was making an independent transaction not affiliated with FTX/Alameda/etc. One would have to be very new or very incurious to be interested in crypto companies and be unaware of this history. Banks were rarely incorporated yesterday, and certain varieties of incuriosity-with-benefits are extremely frowned upon. Presumption of innocence by commercial providers But there is something to the critique, by advocates, that rampant lawlessness within crypto for a decade and a half shouldn’t cause an institution to stereotype an innocent crypto founder. Advocates want debanking to only follow an investigation uncovering a) strong evidence there exists b) a particular articulable risk which c) society actually cares about. Part of it is philosophical: they believe they are entitled to something like individualized attention and a presumption of innocence. This assumption is deeply embedded in our legal system. We do not have this assumption embedded in our banking system. It would be laughable for credit accounts: “I have never defaulted on a loan from you, and therefore, you must give me the benefit of the doubt, and issue this loan.” No intellectually serious person expects that from banks. No, we construct probabilistic models about who is likely to repay based on observable factors, less some factors which society has disallowed us from using under the law. If we deem you insufficiently likely to repay the loan, even if you are still very likely to repay the loan, you don’t get the loan. Finance is not high school; 92% is not an A- anymore. We don’t have to wait for you to default, or have any individualized suspicion about you, or conduct a years-long fact-finding process. One is prohibited in discrimination in lending on basis of, for example, race. Why? The American people feel quite strongly that they want this to be true, and so their representatives passed a series of laws. Those laws are well-established and uncontroversial. You also, as young data scientists quickly learn, can’t use customer zip codes, no matter how probative they are. This is because they have a very high risk of being an effective proxy for race. (Aside: this is why California used zip codes when it wanted to prioritize the delivery of lifesaving healthcare to patients of favored races, primarily for political reasons.) One is not prohibited from using someone’s occupation or ownership of a business as underwriting criteria. Those happen to be incredibly probative and, not incidentally, separate rules literally require that we ask. (AML rules require a bank opening an account with ongoing transaction capability to ask for what your source of funds will be, which will often include wages and/or business income, and banks then generally need to know “... OK, wages for what?”) Is there a built-out appeals process or higher authority with respect to being declined banking services? Don’t our moral intuitions require there to be one? Many people with “capitalist” in their job title will tell you that there is, indeed, a higher authority to complain to if a capital allocator rejects your pitch. It is Mr. Market. That capital allocator has competitors. Go pitch them. Are there projects that no capital allocator will fund? Absolutely. That’s an important part of why we pay allocators: they assist us in not frittering away resources society expects to fund e.g. teachers' retirements on non-productive uses. And so allocators will tell you: If you can’t find any allocator who will back you, despite your belief you have a good business plan, and your business plan requires capital to execute, you do not have a good business plan, and you should do something else with your life. I have yet to meet a venture capitalist who believes that passing on a pitch should be subject to review by a higher authority than their partnership. Many do not, as routine practice, tell entrepreneurs why they passed. Pure downside. Passing is not an invitation for the founder to work their persuasive magic on you. The meeting was the opportunity for that; the meeting is over. But banks are, certainly, not venture capitalists. There is an aspect to banks which is not exactly dissimilar in character to infrastructure providers. Utilities are frequently invoked as an example here. Why would we construct a society in which power companies needed to make underwriting decisions in supplying power?! (I think people surprised there may be surprised to do deep dives into e.g. negotiating power purchase agreements.) Banks, in addition to providing infrastructure, are also neck deep in capital allocation. Some bits of the bank might be more like one's conception of a power company, and some bits of the bank might be more like one's conception of a venture capitalist. And some bits might be confusing hybrids of two intuitions. It may surprise you that a simple vanilla deposit account is both infrastructure and also a capital allocation decision. For one thing, typical deposit accounts in the U.S. are actually credit products. It's baked in and can't be baked out without making them unfit for purpose. For another: Banking reputable, legal crypto businesses is a risky endeavor Sources of credit risk to the bank are substantially broader than simple non-repayment of funds borrowed. A financial institution can take a credit loss on banking a business without having what most non-specialists would consider a credit relationship. This is particularly true when banking financial service providers. Here’s a worked example: Suppose a crypto exchange blows up out of nowhere, in an absolutely freak accident that happens in about 20% of all exchange-years. The last financial institution banking them can end up holding the bag. Voyager Digital was a regulated institution that was publicly traded. It had adults at the helm, a Compliance department, some level of written risk processes, and legitimate backers, including well-known venture capitalists. Voyager blew up, because none of the above are sufficient to prevent you from blowing up. When they blew up, their bank (Metropolitan Commercial) received a slew of ACH reversals. Customers (often quite reasonably!) felt that they had sent in money to buy crypto, but they hadn’t received their crypto, which feels quite a bit like fraud, and so they complained to their (the customer’s) bank. Metropolitan characterizes that complaint as fraudulent behavior. There are certainly fraudulent accusations of fraud made to abuse cryptocurrency exchanges, by paying for crypto, claiming you didn’t get the crypto, and then getting your money back while you keep the crypto. However, the customers Metropolitan wanted permission to stiff perceive themselves as having no money and also no crypto. The customers had traded money for a claim against a bankruptcy estate. Crypto is a product with widespread adoption across the socioeconomic spectrum, I am told. Do you think a random person off the street would, on being asked \"Define a claim against a bankruptcy estate?\", have a really confident, automatic answer to that question? I think they would probably have a more confident answer to the question \"Have you ever tried to buy a claim against a bankruptcy estate?\" So what happens if one calls one's bank and says “I opened an app on my phone. I tried to buy something. I didn’t get it. Those bastards kept my money.” Very frequently, your bank’s customer service rep will type some brief notes into a web application then hit a button. The customer service rep is trained to sound helpful when this happens. Their skill with that... varies. They make, oh, $15 an hour and are not trained like a district court judge. They will conduct no real investigation nor careful balancing of facts and circumstances. They are likely entirely unaware of notorious bankruptcies in the crypto industry, which are an infintessimally small portion of all complaints that reach their telephone queue. Customer didn’t get something from an Internet merchant? Push the button, read the script to the customer, disconnect, immediately serve next caller. That button will, some steps later, mechanically cause Metropolitan to transfer back some money to Voyager’s now aggrieved customer, which (importantly) Voyager did not actually have to distribute, because it was in bankruptcy. Whose balance sheet did it come off of, then? Metropolitan’s. Their shareholders had just performed the sacred duty of equity: taking the credit loss so that depositors didn’t have to. If you are banking a quickly growing financial services firm which has large daily funds flows, and charging small per-transaction fees and/or earning net interest on deposits, the total amount of money at risk (within the chargeback or reversal window) as of time T can be vastly larger than the total revenue charged for services at all times 0 through T inclusive. A handwavy approximation for it: number of days in the relevant chargeback/dispute window times average daily transaction volume times dispute percentage. (This will be in the low to high tens of percent. It depends on many factors, including the sophistication of your customer base, whether well-informed guides to consumer rights in banking go viral within it, and similar.) And thus banks are very selective with respect to what financial services firms they bank. Because one blowing up, just one, can sink the entire related business line. Voyager and Metropolitan ended up asking the court to change the rules of the ACH protocol in their favor. Then banking technologists told the court that the ACH protocol was computer code maintained in a decentralized fashion and thus beyond the purview of any court. Wait, no, that sentence is from my unpublished cyberpunk novel and somehow made it into this essay by accident; please disregard. No serious person would say courts cannot interact with software or the people who write it. The court ordered a protocol upgrade. The court’s order was swiftly carried out, like many court orders, by responsible professionals employed by several firms. Metropolitan, of course, got sued over the whole Voyager fracas. A major aspect of the lawsuit: Voyager intimated to customers that they would be covered by FDIC insurance and so their funds on deposit were safe. Voyager’s CEO has alleged that Metropolitan’s management suggested this selling point. Voyager’s marketing department published objectively false statements regarding FDIC coverage. “[FDIC coverage] means that in the rare event your USD funds are compromised due to the company or our banking partner’s failure, you are guaranteed a full reimbursement (up to $250,000).” Marketing departments frequently misunderstand fine distinctions here, which is why, at well-operated financial technology firms, Legal does not let marketing write one single word about FDIC insurance without their sign-off. The fateful two words above are “the company”: FDIC insurance does not and has never backstopped the obligations of non-insured clients of the banking system. It only backstops the obligations of insured financial institutions. (Had Metropolitan failed, Voyager’s customers may have had recourse to FDIC insurance, but Metropolitan did not fail.) And so the FDIC has not paid Voyager’s customers one thin dime, nor will it ever. It has neither obligation nor legal authority to do so. The FDIC is institutionally very opposed to fraudulently inducing customers to transact via claiming FDIC coverage. The FDIC is a banking regulator, among other things, and we’ll discuss them more in a moment. But they are, first and foremost, in charge of the deposit insurance fund. Crypto’s history of falsely promising that the FDIC will make customers whole for its own failures is one reason why the FDIC is institutionally wary of crypto. Metropolitan then ceased crypto banking. Several banks which had major or incipient crypto practices ceased crypto banking roughly contemporaneously. Was Metropolitan within its rights to do so? Ab-so-lutely. Was it within its power to not exit crypto banking? Some thumbs were placed on the scale, and Metropolitan acknowledges this, though they probably were not dispositive for Metropolitan specifically. Their incipient crypto business blew up in their face. Heads would likely have rolled in any event. Metropolitan characterized their decision as influenced by commercial and regulatory concerns, but long coming. Quote: Today’s announcement of our exit from the crypto-currency related asset vertical represents the culmination of a process that began [six years earlier] in 2017, when we decided to pivot away from crypto and not grow the business. Suppose you are an internal advocate for crypto at a mid-sized bank in the U.S. When you bring your proposals to management, one of the things that will cause a chilly reception is the regulatory environment, certainly. Another one is that management can read the newspaper. Other banks which got this pitch and greenlit it took huge losses, ate months of negative headlines, and will be under examiner’s microscopes for at least the next year. This happened over almost no revenue. Why should management say “Yes, as long as it is only the high-quality crypto companies, as long as you cross your Is and dot your Ts, this seems like a low-risk business to be in? Yeet me some Shiba, bro.” Anyhow, when a crypto founder couldn’t find a bank in 2011, one could be excused for blaming reflexive banker conservatism and low levels of technical understanding. Crypto has had a decade and a half to develop a track record to be judged on. Crypto is being judged on that track record. Some advocates consider this unfair. Sure, sure, there was some… cowboy behavior in the early days, but that’s just the price of innovation. The freaks and geeks are always on the cutting edge of technology, and well, you know, I suppose they might not always listen to lawyers. But the early days are basically over. We bring something completely new to the table. We are responsible professionals with a compliance-first mindset. We are thoroughly committed to working with partners in finance and government to assuage all concerns. We have impeccable pedigrees. We say all the right things, in all the right accents. We are capable of hiring lobbyists, making campaign contributions, and engaging in a considered media strategy, too! Some chill felt is caused by the long shadow of SBF Much has been written about Sam Bankman-Fried and his co-conspirators and enablers. That story remains extensively misunderstood and undercovered relative to its importance. SBF et al orchestrated a sequential privilege escalation attack on the system that is the United States of America, via consummate skill at understanding how power works, really works, in the United States. They rooted trusted institutions and used each additional domino’s weight against the next. A full recounting of the political strategy alone could easily fill a book. The forfeiture allegations fill 26 printed pages at 1-2 lines per targeted politician. The United States has also alleged that he tried to buy the Bahamas. SBF and most of the co-conspirators were focused on the Democratic side of the aisle. His cutout Ryan Salame was the bagman for the Republican side of the aisle. Salame’s own lawyers, in their sentencing memo (pg 11), in what is a unique legal strategy, disclaimed any good intent: “Whatever the topic, Ryan’s ultimate purpose for [meetings with government officials including including Senator Mitch McConnell and then-Congressman Kevin McCarthy, focused on pandemic preparedness] was eventually to influence cryptocurrency policy.” SBF was not charged for the bribing officials part of the crime tapestry, putatively due to treaty commitments to the Bahamas. C.f. the extradition treaty, Article 3. (I absolutely believe that that was a complication and disbelieve it was a hard constraint.) It was an element of plea deals by several co-conspirators, most of whom got lesser sentences for cooperating with the government. Salame was uncooperative and sentenced to 90 months. SBF’s parents appear unlikely to be charged. This is despite them being active and knowing participants in crime, including providing their son with extensive advice, in writing, on topics germane to their professional expertise. For example, his mother, a Stanford law professor and Democratic bundler, advised him to use his coworkers as straw donors to avoid compromising optics via mandatory disclosure laws. IANAStanfordLawProfessor, but that is plainly illegal. SBF was considered, for a time, the heir apparent to George Soros. He was the next generation’s well-monied Democratic standard bearer in Washington. One major reason why crypto has experienced what feels like performative outrage from Democrats since 2022 is that they are trying to demonstrate that crypto did not successfully buy them. Many in Washington, like many in crypto, have… selective memories of what meetings they took, transactions they entered, calls they made, and cookies they noshed on in 2020 and 2021. But to remove the beam in my own eye before casting out the mote in another’s: SBF struck me as whip-smart, extremely cynical, but sincere with respect to his motivations. I thought him likely one of the most competent operators in crypto. (Don’t assume that I meant that as high praise, please.) Also I understood him contemporaneously to be Tether’s bagman and told people, privately, “Don’t get too close; 5% chance he goes to prison.” In hindsight, I overrated the competence in several important domains, and totally missed the massive fraud. This was in no small part because of a strong sense of fellow-feeling. We have blind spots the size of Jupiter for people who remind us of ourselves and our closest friends. It’s hardwired into humanity, I think. Anyhow, Tether’s current most important bagman is Howard Lutnik, who may be stepping back from the position, as he’s currently leading Trump’s transition team and has his eyes on bigger prizes. Forget MicroStrategy’s high implied volatility. Lutnik convertible arb would be the trade of the century. Some crypto advocates believe it’s unfair to tar the industry with the SBF brush, for either industry internal reasons (“He was CeFi not true DeFi, and tried to force the rest of us along with it! Nuts to him!”) or political reasons (“Not my side of the aisle! Salami, you said? Never heard of him neither!”) Here we are again at the tension between a) democracies should practice careful consideration of individuals on their merits and reject collective punishment but b) the political system shouldn’t have the memory span of a squirrel. Operation Choke Point Once upon a time there was an impressively unprincipled set of decisions made. Like many such tales, it didn’t happen as one discrete event in a smoky backroom. It started small and then cascaded, was covered up, and then came to light. Then, it was roundly and justly castigated. There are certain incredibly non-salubrious businesses that make routine, intense use of banking rails and which simultaneously generate many customer complaints. Debt collectors are one such business. Full disclosure: I was an unpaid advocate for consumers with issues with debt collectors (and banks, FWIW) for many years, and have described debt collectors as “among the most odious hives of scum and villainy as exist in the United States.” I’m also grouping a few clusters of consumer credit bottom feeders under “debt collector” or we’d be here all day: payday lenders, so-called “credit repair” companies, and debt-adjacent telemarketing. Banking regulators, in response to customer complaints (which savvy customers, such as customers who listen to advocates like yours truly, will sometimes route through regulators because that achieves better outcomes than routing through CS), warned banks that debt collectors appeared to be at grossly disproportionate risk of ACH transfers that customers claimed were unauthorized. Customers claiming this are not always being candid. However, debt collectors do routinely abuse one’s common intuitions about how banking rails work as an intentional strategy. See the above piece for elaboration at length. Now, banks who bank debt collectors can math out how many of their ACH payments are complained about. One can make an argument that those banks might not have institutional knowledge that complaints about debt collectors are structurally anomalously high, for Seeing like a Bank reasons. One could further argue that a regulator can licitly tell a bank something they don’t know. That sounds reasonable and an appropriate use of a public servant’s time. Those banks that would open accounts for debt collectors (n.b. not all banks!) are OK with having that business. Debt collection, while not salubrious, is legal and regulated in the United States. Banks are not one-stop monitoring shops for all of their customers’ various obligations under the law. But working through legislatures and courts is slow and expensive. Why not simply deputize the banks? We already have them run private intelligence agencies! How much of a reach is it for them to also run private consumer protection bureaus? The Obama administration didn’t like debt collectors, for very similar reasons to why I don’t like debt collectors. And so they broadened the critique: the risk in banking bad guys was broader than the (known, accepted, controlled, and certainly not existential) risk of ACH reversals. Those customer complaints, those complaints could harm the bank’s standing in the community. That could result in e.g. a withdrawal of customer deposits. This would imperil the bank, for the usual reason. And if something could imperil banks, why, that should naturally cause the FDIC to make its opinions known. Get out of peril, by kicking debt collectors to the curb. But the FDIC had to be persuaded into that point of view, by a cadre of very talented people. The Department of Justice had a legal theory, which it was quite proud of. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) gives the DOJ a hunting license for any fraud (and many other crimes) which affects a federally insured financial institution. FIRREA was passed after the savings and loan crisis, to protect small financial institutions from peril and thereby avoid another crisis. Now your common sense understanding might be “Oh, Congress probably intended on cracking down on fraud targeting banks which, I don’t know, was big enough to imperil a small community institution? I could see a really large fraudulent bank loan imperiling a small bank. And checking the history books, there were some wildly fraudulent bank loans mixed up in the S&L crisis. OK, so we federalized prosecution of defrauding a bank like that? Sounds reasonable.” If you have that intuition, you are apparently not creative enough to have worked as a lawyer in the Obama admin DOJ. No, their thought was that if you provide rails which facilitate fraud, such as giving a fraudster a bank account, you are affecting a financial institution: yourself. And so, the DOJ can go after you, for self-harm. Note that you do not need to lose money, oh no, the DOJ can also go after you because the way you affected yourself was to cause your regulator to like you less. When you settle with the DOJ, it will extract an enforceable promise in writing that you will stop your campaign of self-harm, and also stop banking specifically enumerated industries, like payday loans. I realize that this sounds unlikely. The following is a direct quote (expanding acronyms) from the DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility, in the report (pg 16) where they exonerated DOJ lawyers. As more fully explained below, the [Consumer Protection Branch] has relied on the “self-affecting” theory, as well as additional theories of liability, in three cases arising from the Operation Choke Point initiative. Now when the DOJ or FDIC tells you, a bank, to do something, or strongly suggests that you do something, that usually isn’t the end of the argument. You can certainly haggle. You can even fight… to a degree. This is a multi-year iterated game with repeat players, each of whom has limited resources and very complicated preferences. Both sides are constantly picking their battles. There is give and take. When your counterparty is happy with you, your emails get returned faster, you get more of your asks, and you can report smooth sailing to your boss. Both banks and regulators are ultimately made up of people, with emotions, career paths, and annual performance reviews. Banks do not actually make a lot of money from servicing debt collectors. The culture that is banking looks at the culture that is debt collection and sees slimy people who are beneath it. And so the banks frequently obliged. Many of them, in their offboarding letters to debt collectors, were unusually candid relative to the standards of offboarding letters: it’s not you, and we apologize for this, but we’ve received regulatory guidance about your industry, and as a result our appetite to serve your industry no longer exists. As it turns out, the Obama administration had many diverse policy preferences. It wasn’t particularly in favor of guns, for example. Gun sellers don’t use banks in the way that debt collectors use banks. They do not routinely trick customers into the gun-for-money transaction. They don’t make particularly intense use of ACH pulls (confidence: 99%, on general industry knowledge) and don’t have particularly high dispute rates (confidence: 95%, same). But regulators, having discovered that “reputational risk” attached to anyone you didn’t like with nary a whisper of complaint, believed that banking gun sellers was high-risk. Haven’t you read the newspapers? School shootings. Do you want any of that sticking to you? You are imperiling your good name, and therefore the stability of your deposit base, and therefore your bank, and therefore the insurance fund, by accepting the business of gun sellers. In Congressional testimony, the FDIC said that it hadn’t ordered anyone to debank disfavored businesses. What we have done is we have tried to be very clear in putting out our guidance to say very publicly and clearly that as long as banks have appropriate risk mitigation measures in place, we are not going to prohibit or discourage them from doing business with anyone with whom they want to do business. One may be surprised that this individual might perceive themselves as telling the truth here. Because “Justify to me why the payday lenders are not on your high-risk list.” and then “Do you have a built-out EDD program for the deposit risk caused by payday lenders?” followed by “Then are you sure you should accept that business?” are consistent with this statement, individually and as a script. (Those are not quotes, but rather indicative summaries of stages in a conversation. I believe them to fairly characterize conversations that the record abundantly shows happened.) The FDIC Office of the Inspector General, in an investigatory report, attempted to shift all blame for Operation Choke Point to the DOJ. We found no evidence that the FDIC used the high-risk list to target financial institutions. However, references to specific merchant types in the summer 2011 edition of the FDIC’s Supervisory Insights Journal and in supervisory guidance created a perception among some bank executives that we spoke with that the FDIC discouraged institutions from conducting business with those merchants. This perception was most prevalent with respect to payday lenders When a regulator publishes position papers that it wants you to do something, and reiterates this in individualized supervisory guidance, that tends to create a perception in this author that the communicated policy direction was not YOLOed onto the Internet by a room full of monkeys banging keyboards randomly. As frequently happens, the individual officials who had instructed banks to debank the targeted industries ignored Stringer Bell’s dictum on taking notes on a criminal conspiracy. Emails sent within the FDIC and DOJ were routinely archived, and banks (of course) keep copies of correspondence from their regulators. Those emails said what they said, and what they said was pretty damning. For example, the Department of Justice’s internal Six Month Status Report On Operation Choke Point (excerpted in Congressional reporting) said: Finding substantial questions concerning the legality of the Internet payday lending business models and the loans underlying debits to consumers’ bank accounts, many banks have decided to stop processing transactions in support of Internet payday lenders. We consider this to be a significant accomplishment and positive change for consumers . . . Although we recognize the possibility that banks may have therefore decided to stop doing business with legitimate lenders, we do not believe that such decisions should alter our investigative plans. Not once, not twice, not a handful of times, not a loose confederation of rogue examiners. Three of six regional directors of the FDIC offices told the OIG that they understood Washington to want payday lending discouraged and two of them said there was an expectation to, in the words of the OIG, direct institutions that facilitated payday lending to “pursue an exit strategy.” Did that require top-down direction? You can, in fact, generate nationwide programs with local offices doing strikingly similar things without top-down direction. The combination of a monoculture plus a policy direction that lower-level staffers believe in is often sufficient to make it happen. We have extensive experience of this in tech and finance, as discussed later. Japanese has a beautiful world, sontaku, for the attitude and actions a diligent subordinate would take without his superior’s explicit instruction, believing them to anticipate his boss’ desires. Sontaku is a core skill in the American professional class. People possessing it are sometimes described as “motivated self-starters”, “high-agency”, “bold”, ”takes initiative”, ”acts like an owner”, etc. You are a very, very bad Compliance professional if you aren’t constantly sontaku-ing your regulator. You are also a bad Regional Director of the FDIC if you aren’t constantly sontaku-ing Washington. But Operation Choke Point, specifically, simply was official policy. If it wasn't, no entity as complicated as the United States can ever be described as having even once had an official policy. As the former Chairman of the FDIC wrote in a WSJ editorial: Internal Justice Department papers released by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee make it clear that Justice prefers coercing banks to drop customers through Operation Choke Point rather than prosecuting illegal or fraudulent businesses directly because it’s easier, faster and requires fewer resources. Operation Choke Point wasn’t just targeting debt collectors, gun sellers, and payday lenders. No, the FDIC’s bullet-pointed list was 30 entries long. They range from clearly abusive and illegal (scams) to “One could construct a narrative by which banking that industry is challenging” (pornography) to “a grab bag of things we dislike” (racism and… fireworks? Really?) Operation Choke Point, once it came to light, caused a media and Congressional furor, because it was arbitrary and lawless. (I am using that in the ordinary sense of an American who took civics, not in the specialized sense of a DOJ lawyer, who might bristle for being called “lawless” when they had three court cases and one 25 year old statute which are clearly explained in the memo as adding up to them being able to do everything they did.) The architects of Operation Choke Point steadfastly denied it was designed to do what it was manifestly designed to do. They denied it did what it manifestly did. The agencies were then pointedly accused of lack of candor with Congress. If you tell a Congressman he isn’t reading the WSJ right, but internally your bosses are high-fiving themselves over WSJ article, and they are high-fiving themselves because finally the WSJ is covering their important work accurately, Congress will not be pleased. Then they will show you a copy of your bosses’ emails, which they can subpoena, because they are Congress. (House Oversight Committee report, ibid, pg 10) Some scholarly literature is sympathetic to the regulators’ point of view. (More is not.) If you want a steelman, that’s the best one you’ll likely find. It acknowledges the DOJ’s efforts to interdict fraud by creatively interpreting FIRREA and targeting third-party payment processors and banks, accuses the financial industry of making a fuss over this for self-interested commercial reasons, performs a modified limited hangout of the high-risk list, and claims that the gun industry cynically glommed onto the news cycle for political reasons despite no actual enforcement specifically addressed against it. My point of view? I can read emails. They say what they say, even when acknowledging what they say would cost a public servant their job. I read the postmortems (including many years ago; this sort of thing was my hobby before it was my job). I view them as face-saving exercises written, in no small part, by civil servants mortified that their peers could lose jobs and pensions simply for implementing the Administration’s policy preferences using colorable authority. Sometimes, people have been known to lie in politics. Sometimes justice is not done. I know, try to weather the shock you must feel. Operation Choke Point was mostly forgotten, except by banking nerds. Until… So-called Choke Point 2.0 Nic Carter, a crypto VC and podcaster, who occasionally does very good work, has been steadfastly attempting to brand a constellation of regulatory activities regarding crypto as Choke Point 2.0. This branding is an attempt to delegitimize them by associating them with politically-motivated lawlessness. It has since become popular among crypto advocates. Unlike Operation Choke Point, which actually was a centrally directed operation with written project plans, status meetings, ongoing progress reports, and a code name decided by the participants (who, in hindsight, should have talked to their own Comms department and picked something that didn’t sound nefarious to describe their plans), Choke Point 2.0 stretches like taffy to attach to any recent regulatory activity crypto advocates don’t like. So we’ll have to review quite an involved history of very disparate issues to give advocates a fair hearing. Carters' work, which is extensive on this topic, exists in pieces like Did the government start a global financial crisis to destroy crypto? To answer the question in the title: no, it did not. We started a financial crisis which to-date is mercifully narrow as an underappreciated side effect of interest rate hikes to tame inflation. Silvergate: Crypto had a bank, doesn’t now, and misses the good days Crypto advocates have specific and general concerns about banking supervision at a small number of banks acutely relevant to their interests. They have tied these concerns to the debanking narrative. They do not evince attention to detail or familiarity with the procedural history of specific examples they invoke, though some have attempted some original reporting with respect to these issues. That is to their credit. As we’ve established, almost all banks consider crypto businesses to be high-risk, and avoid them. There was a small cadre of banks which had active crypto practices. Those banks purported, to the public and their regulators, to have the EDD required to bank them compliantly. This was incredibly operationally useful for crypto, for one very obvious reason (substantially every business needs a bank account) and one less obvious one. Crypto talks a great game about decentralization, but centralized systems are more efficient than decentralized systems. When riding banking rails, making transfers outside of regular banking hours (which have five twos of uptime) is difficult. This exposes firms to risk and acts as a constant cost of capital. Crypto trades 24/7. Crypto firms would like to settle crypto trades, particularly between stablecoins and the USD backing them, 24/7. Crypto’s solution to this was to all bank at the same bank, Silvergate, which I described (with some surprise, when they IPOed) as the First National Bank of Crypto. Silvergate had a particular product called the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN). SEN was both a) boring infrastructural plumbing and b) extremely important to the crypto industry. Oh boy, do crypto companies miss SEN. In sum, SEN would allow substantially 24/7 book transfers between Silvergate customers to shift USD balances between their bank accounts. This would let them constantly settle the USD leg of crypto trades between each other. This was particularly important for stablecoin issuers, like Circle, which issues USDC. Circle’s main custodial bank for USDC was SVB. Circle wanted to be able to issue marketmakers like DRW and Alameda Research hundreds of millions of USDC 24/7 at any hour on any day with no more than a few minutes of latency, or redeem USDC for greenbacks in a similar fashion. Now, a thing you will frequently see in fintech banking, and which is not itself at all inappropriate, is a fintech having multiple banks with a division of labor. One of those banks might agree to have a fintech’s customer-facing high-velocity low-EOD-balance transactional activity. And one of those banks might agree to have a fintech’s low-velocity high-EOD-balance deposits. These are very different business propositions for the banks! They imply different risks, different core competencies, and different revenue opportunities. If you are running businesses which both a) have high daily inflows and outflows and also b) want to keep billions of dollars in the regulated banking perimeter, you very much need partners comfortable with both halves. The argument you make, as a fintech, to the bank with your deposit business is that the other bank is also a competent, U.S.-regulated financial institution, with good AML and KYC controls (among others). Therefore, when your business makes one wire at the end of the day to settle up with its omnibus account at that bank, netting over several hundred thousand customer transactions, perhaps for several hundred million dollars, your bank should be comfortable, even if it has very little exact knowledge about what happened today. Probably the same story as yesterday, and tomorrow, and Compliance can sleep the sleep of the righteous, because their trusted peers have an appropriate degree of controls in place. The bank custodying the money mountain is thus certainly not aiding and abetting money laundering. It can rely on the second bank’s own surveillance and controls, in addition to the crypto firm’s compliance department. There will be many formal contractual promises and informal verbal or written assurances made about this. And this works and serious people can accept it but the factual probity of the high-velocity transactional bank is extremely load-bearing. Silvergate was not a competently run institution. SEN did not, in fact, have a robust controls environment. It, in fact (para 70), had functionally no transaction monitoring. Silvergate had bought a standard package that a lot of banks use for automated monitoring, but due a configuration issue, it was off for SEN transactions. Carter describes this state of affairs as follows: “Silvergate’s transaction monitoring system for SEN had gone through an upgrade and experienced an outage.” Silvergate was institutionally aware of the “outage” but unable to remediate it. I have an engineering degree, have founded five software companies, have worked in the tech industry, and in my entire career, I have never described an engineering investment I failed to make for fifteen months as an “outage.” After a day it is an outage, after a week it’s a human competence issue, but after a year it ferments into sparkling tech strategy. During that period, SEN transacted over a trillion dollars. Silvergate was not unaware that SEN had an up-and-to-the-right usage graph (congratulations!). They were just routinely ignorant of funds flows they were facilitating with their banking license, sized in the billions of dollars per day. We know this because of Silvergate’s contemporaneous internal communications, the technical reality of the artifacts they had purchased and implemented, and sworn statements in litigation and to regulators. It is beyond intellectually serious dispute. What of it, though? Is that just a harmless paperwork glitch? I'm glad you asked. Intrabank book transfers are historically low-risk for money laundering because they’re ineffective at accomplishing layering: the same Compliance department can see both legs. Moreover, the majority of them are between entities known to be under common control. The purpose of layering is to break the chain of surveillance; swapping between your left pocket and your right pocket in front of a Compliance officer doesn’t accomplish this. This assumption of low-risk was apparently, per Silvergate’s employees, baked very hard into ATMS-B, the new-and-improved monitoring suite Silvergate had implemented. However, SEN transactions, while implemented as intrabank book transfers, are in fact high-risk. The designed intent of SEN is to allow counterparties not under common control to settle one half of a transaction, at very high velocity. The other half generally occurs on a blockchain, unsurveilled by the bank. If you can’t see that half, and you can’t see your half, why, that sounds like you are swapping bank deposits for cash equivalents sized in the billions of dollars per day with no functional AML monitoring program in place. This is not just me saying it. Kathleen Fischer, Chief Risk Office of Silvergate, said internally, of the lack of SEN monitoring: “We have known of this issue and either we have established other controls to account for it or we haven’t, and we have to take our lumps.” Silvergate had not, in fact, established other controls. Carter claims that all clients of the bank had gone through rigorous KYC and onboarding processes. Silvergate may have consistently conducted KYC and onboarding processes, but one could forgive a skeptic for believing them to be pro forma. Silvergate onboarded several entities relating to Binance, a confessed criminal conspiracy which extensively engaged in money laundering. Binance and its management are Bond villains; they gleefully flouted the law and engaged in jurisdictional gamesmanship to avoid financial regulation, for years. Binance et al transacted $22 billion through Silvergate. Mandatory compliance training is such a drag, and sometimes we like to spice it up with fun games. Let's play Spot the Red Flags together. We have just received an account application from a Seychelles-domiciled corporation beneficially owned by a globally notorious billionaire. He disclaims any permanent address. The beneficial owner receives regular negative news coverage. He and his company have received multiple orders to cease business from peer nations. Those orders cite offering financial services without a license, suspicion of money laundering, willfully non-compliant posture, and extensive documented lies to regulators. The corporation has no operations or employees; it is strictly a shell. The planned funds flow is receiving inbound wire transfers, including international wire transfers, from counterparties which the bank will have only fragmentary third degree knowledge of. The corporation intends to immediately transfer those deposits to a third-party financial institution. This is to facilitate those counterparties’ purchase of pseudonymous bearer instruments, specifically, cash equivalents. The corporation anticipates billions of dollars of volume, in transaction sizes up to eight figures. Silvergate happily opened an account (pg 4) for Key Vision Development Limited, the above-described shell company, and allowed it to deposit and withdraw over $11 billion. Now, credit where credit is due, Silvergate did debank Key Vision Development Limited in 2021. The record doesn’t say why, but perceptive readers may be able to hazard a guess. But Binance’s main entities still enjoyed attentive service, or perhaps more to the point they enjoyed all the inattention they were getting with their service, until the bank folded. But the main rake Silvergate stepped on, repeatedly, was its relationship with FTX/Alameda and its executives. They were collectively the bank’s largest client and comprised tens of percent of its deposits. Silvergate’s monitoring of their usage was minimally grossly inadequate, as the bank and its executives admit. Carter quotes an unnamed Silvergate executive as saying the following, which is roughly consistent with their prior statements to the media and to regulators. Where we were not as buttoned up as we should have been was in regards to the FTX/Alameda clients. That was a function of the bank growing incredibly quickly[.] … Probably we could have figured out FTX was brokering deposits via Alameda. In retrospect I think we could have pieced this together and figured it out. But this is not a legal failure and we’re not required to catch everything. Our program passed legal muster. That’s something we could have done a better job of. But there was no intentional wrongdoing or cooperation with the bad guys. This is consistent with things they have said previously, but does not demand unlimited deference. Ryan Salame, a subject matter expert in laundering crypto money through the banking system (skills described by his lawyers, see pg 7 and onwards), tweeted that it beggars belief that Silvergate did not know that Alameda Research and North Dimension were in fact receiving FTX customer funds flow. Salame has repeatedly stated that Silvergate intentionally orchestrated that funds flow in concert with him. Even if it had not, Salame is just right: even if FTX concocted the scheme internally and even if Salame somehow managed to push all the buttons himself, Silvergate had to know. But suppose you credit neither Salame nor I with understanding how banks work, or you demand unquestioning deference to executives’ denials, perhaps because one believes that a bank executive would never ever lie. The picture most favorable to Silvergate is that, during multiple years of being monomaniacally focused on growth to the neglect of its responsibilities under the law, it routinely underperformed the competence bar required of regulated financial institutions in the United States. Silvergate voluntarily liquidated in the wake of the FTX implosion. Limited props for them here: they managed to do this in a mostly orderly fashion, as opposed to Signature, which had substantially less crypto exposure but blew up. (Signature had an analogous book transfer API product, called Signet. It is a smaller part of their story.) Carter has a number of complaints with regards to supervisory activities relating to Silvergate Bank. One of those is that he alleges the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency disallowed Silvergate from selling SEN. I find this allegation very plausible, if not specifically evidenced. Silvergate was operating a trillion dollar laundering machine which had drawn immediate demands for corrective action for an extended period, had not taken aggressive corrective action, and then had proximately caused enormous consumer harm in a way which was maximally embarrassing to many policy actors. When the bank’s Chief Risk Officer predicted incoming lumps, these were the sort of lumps she was predicting. Carter further alleges, and I think this is substantially original reporting (and good on him for it), that the FDIC and other banking regulators gave verbal guidance that banks should get crypto deposits below 15% to be “safe and sound.” If a banking regulator invokes those words, they are not making a suggestion. Carter complains that there is no statutory authority to pick this arbitrary number, that this threshold makes banking crypto functionally impossible, and that it is specifically chosen to kill targeted banks. Some regulators are disclosure regulators. The SEC comes to mind. Some regulators are prudential regulators. The ordinary operation of prudential regulators is to take broad statutory direction and transform it, sometimes via the rulemaking process and sometimes via more informal guidance (and, even the FDIC will tell you, “moral suasion”). This process yields both concrete asks and fuzzier spectral ranges subject to ongoing negotiation between regulators and the regulated. Does the FDIC have statutory authority to pick magic numbers? Yes, in the political system of the United States, it does, and it can cite that authority to you at length. The FAA has statutory authority to pick magic numbers for bolt torque. The FDA has statutory authority to pick magic numbers for permissible flow rates for ketchup. Are regulators overreaching here? Not obviously so! Look at the above description of Operation Choke Point and their theory of regulatory authority there. It requires magical thinking to connect banking a payday lender, reputational risk, a run on your bank, and endangering the deposit insurance fund. It very much does not require magical thinking to think that crypto deposits are flighty, correlated, and could cause a run! We were experiencing actual crypto-induced runs! A reasonable argument can be made that the problem with regulators was not abuse of discretion. It was needing to pay for past regulatory mistakes and/or missed opportunities with overcorrection following substantial consumer harm. Examiners (stunningly) missed that Silvergate’s new business model, which they had IPOed on the strength of, had materially changed from its days as a sleepy two-branch real estate bank! That reasonable argument has been alluded to… by the Federal Reserve! See Findings, pg 2. Does the 15% threshold make it generally impossible to bank crypto? Empirically not; other bank’s crypto practices are well beneath that threshold, which likely informed how it was chosen. Metropolitan, for example, had about 25% at the peak and then drew down to 6%. It fairly persuasively told stakeholders that it had done a good job of risk management. And, not incidentally, Metropolitan is still with us. And so regulators could very reasonably say: “OK! 6% is all-else-equal green, 14% is yellow, we don’t want you spiking to 25% anymore, 96% is deep #%*(#(ing don’t even think about it red.” And you could make this same observation about many banks with a crypto practice. Coinbase doesn’t keep customers' money in a mattress. Their main bank’s crypto exposure is… FORTRESS BALANCE SHEET. Carter further alleges or insinuates (it’s a bit unclear at times which he is going for) that Senator Warren and/or regulators colluded with short sellers to intentionally kill Silvergate, via sparking a liquidity crisis. He specifically cites a this letter by Warren et al, which includes the sentence “Should it need extra liquidity, your bank has access to taxpayer dollars through the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco.”. Carter argues that sentence was intentionally inserted to put pressure on FHLBSF to demand repayment of advances. That would force Silvergate to find liquidity at a time where that would be incredibly difficult. Silvergate, subsequent to that letter, did repay those advances, and said in a securities filing that this required them to accelerate securities sales, leading to rumors in the industry that this forced their hand on deciding to close. FHLBSF has squarely denied pressuring them to accelerate repayment. Short sellers made a killing on Silvergate, certainly. I absolutely believe that short sellers communicated with Senator Warren and regulators and additionally would credit that they did this strategically to bring pressure to bear against the bank. Evidence in favor: they say they did and bragged about it, while nailing Silvergate's hide to the wall. But the reason short sellers made billions shorting Silvergate is primarily because they were right and early about Silvergate. Marc Cohodes (a noted short who was deeply short Silvergate) and Ram Ahluwalia (a crypto investor with a very good understanding of bank regulation) had a debate about Silvergate prior to its collapse. I will not recount it for you on a line-by-line basis, but on listening to it at release, I felt “Cohodes is winning this by a mile, despite Ahluwalia being better calibrated on whether banking a single money launderer would indict a compliance program in the eyes of a regulator.” (I was at the time effectively constrained from trading in bank stocks, but I took professionally significant action after listening to that podcast.) I think one could make some criticisms of Cohodes, or of short sellers generally, but “They were fundamentally wrong more wrong than right about the short thesis, and needed government intervention to make it pay out” requires ignoring mountains of evidence. You are invited to look back, with full oracular hindsight, on what Cohodes said in that presentation. A heuristic I have long used, as a once-upon-a-time debater: if one side is impressively detail oriented, and randomly selected details are trivially sustained, and the other side doesn’t allege details but pounds the table a lot, bet on the first team. Or, if you want, you can bet on their former executives. Their former CTO (after being Chief Operations Officer), who is also the CEO’s son, has a Twitter account. You can find his side of the story on it. For a bank executive he is remarkably cavalier with characterizing the contents of communications from his regulators. For example, he writes “The Sunday after Thanksgiving in 2022, regulators went after 5 banks simultaneously[.] Up to that point the regulators were not objecting, Silvergate brought them along, and suddenly everything changed[.]” In fact, in April 2022, Silvergate had received a Matters Requiring Immediate Attention (MRIA) from the Federal Reserve specifically concerning the adequacy of its BSA/AML monitoring program. They received a similar MRIA in November, but by that time, they were cooked. See SEC complaint, para 80, substantially confirming representations made in a deposition by “Former Employee 5” (a Compliance official) in this lawsuit, which explicitly allege MRIAs. A MRIA, as distinct from a Matters Requiring Attention (MRA; a formalized supervisory directive which they expect you to pay substantial attention to in the ordinary course of business), is a drop-everything-and-fix-immediately command. The Federal Reserve has required language (pg 3) for when it communicates MRIAs. The Federal Reserve supervises many banks, at all levels of scale and sophistication. This includes small town community banks where board members are typically local real estate developers. To ensure that low-sophistication bank executives or board members do not miss the fact that an MRIA is both an order and a shot across the bows and should be understood as such, that language is: “The board of directors (or executive-level committee of the board) is required to immediately…” (bolded in original) The SEC has since charged Silvergate executives with misrepresenting the truth to investors about the depth of their liquidity problems in the immediate wake of the FTX collapse. Suppose one believes, arguendo, the protestations of Silvergate management that it had seen the implosion of their largest customer, and a ~70% outflow of deposits, and was still ready to keep chugging along. In that world, is the regulator saying (approximately) “We support banking legal industries, given an adequate controls environment. However, you must get your crypto deposit concentration to below 15%?” compatible with the continued existence of Silvergate specifically, after early November 2022? I agree here with Carter and crypto advocates: no meaningful concentration limit on crypto is compatible with the continued existence of Silvergate after early November 2022. Even a 50% concentration limit is impossible; 15% is worse. Simple math: for each dollar of deposits that you don’t bleed off, and you really can’t bleed off many post-run, you need to find someone willing to deposit about $5. Even if your sales pitch made angels weep to hear it, that is an impossibly tall order. Silvergate had no path to swiftly raising many billions of dollars of deposits from non-crypto depositors. Silvergate had attracted its existing deposits via what would most charitably be described as intense attention to the needs of the crypto industry. It had no advantage over any bank in the U.S. vis banking any other individual or industry, and it had many disadvantages. It was under a PR cloud, because facts about its behavior over the last few years were being reported. It was obviously wobbling as an enterprise. Most deposits are attracted by offering routine bank services (the sort that Silvergate had no edge on providing to non-crypto clients). This is referred to in industry as the “deposit franchise.” Banks have an immediate option to raise deposits in a hurry, forgoing years of sponsoring Little League teams, showing up for the annual town festival, and asking about your holiday plans over a coffee. You can skip the sweat-and-smiles business and proceed directly to paying through the nose, by attracting the custom of sophisticated financial professionals who place money at the banks bidding highest for it in the country. This is called deposit brokering. At any price Silvergate was capable of paying for deposits, there was a regional bank that would have matched or exceeded it, because (unlike Silvergate) many regional banks have a material first-party loan book (and ongoing origination apparatus) which they reasonably believed would continue to exist, and deposits are a funding source for that loan book (and apparatus). A deposit broker would reasonably model that hypothetical replacement bank as being a higher priority for receiving extraordinary backstopping if that ended up being necessary. This would play into their credit analysis of that replacement bank if the deposit broker was trying to place, for example, a $200 million certificate of deposit, almost all of which is uninsured (subject to bank credit risk) absent extraordinary government backstop. Crypto advocates are notably incurious about non-crypto banking and don’t seem to understand why non-crypto regional banks were being heavily shorted in late 2022 and early 2023. I believe that, for many crypto advocates, including some who are well-educated financial service professionals, including some whose portfolio include many financial services companies, this is not very cynically ignoring background unfavorable to their narrative. Rather, it is because they genuinely do not understand what a sudden hike in interest rates would do to the balance sheet of a bank, in the same way that many software engineers do not understand what a sudden interest rate hike will do to the value of their equity. I would credit the possibility that some crypto advocates do understand how bank balance sheets are affected by interest rates, and are choosing to not contradict their standard bearers in public. I am unconvinced that the concentration limit was the but-for cause of Silvergate’s demise, though I could be persuaded to that view. My default view is that if every government employee had been furloughed on Thanksgiving Silvergate would likely still have closed. Its regulators had utterly lost confidence in it, true, but its customers had also lost confidence in it, in no small part because a) they knew they had wired money to Silvergate and b) they knew they now didn’t have their money. That’s a bad set of facts for a long, happy banking relationship. I also think, and won’t ask advocates to acknowledge this, that a post-investigation Silvergate which managed to exist would be unable to offer the product that people were really buying. It was the Schelling point for everybody in crypto. That is why SEN worked. In no conceivable universe does Silvergate keep Binance as a client after it gets put under the microscope. A crypto Schelling point which Binance can’t touch is not a crypto Schelling point. Absent that Schelling point, if Silvergate was simply a bank that would let you park a $3 million seed round and cut paychecks while you worked on your solidity… that Silvergate is not a business. And it’s a bad time to not be a business while you’re sitting on a portfolio of MBS in late 2022 and early 2023. But suppose arguendo that the government intentionally precipitated conditions incompatible with Silvergate continuing to remain in business and also that this was the but-for cause of Silvergate’s demise. Is that a norms violation? Do we allow the government to close banks? If you’ve worked in the financial industry in any capacity, you went to mandatory Compliance training. Attendance is taken and you likely had a refresher annually. And there were smirks, and jokes. And your trainer said, very seriously, “Pay attention. This is important. If we eff this up, they can do anything to us, most likely large fines but up to and including closing this firm. You, personally, could go to jail.” Most people in finance heed this lesson. Every year, some don’t, and they learn why this training is mandatory. Should we allow government to close banks? Yes. Reasonable people can disagree as to the thresholds that extraordinary remedy should require and the procedural form it should take. If we were still on debate team, you might ask me for a concession “Government needs to specifically admit that Silvergate was intentionally closed” and I’d counter “Sure, will trade you: opposition needs to concede that Silvergate was actively aware including at the executive level that Alameda and North Dimension were intentionally receiving incoming FTX customer funds flows.” About fifteen minutes later, I think neither side is thrilled, both sides learned something they find edifying, and there probably exists mutual agreement that either Silvergate had to go. or in the alternative Absent extraordinary government support, Silvergate was doomed after the FTX fiasco. Complaints that Signature Bank did not need to be placed in receivership Carter believes Signature was targeted in an analogous fashion. In part this is in reliance on their board member Barney Frank, who maintained (in media interviews contemporaneous with the collapse, and after it) that Signature was solvent and had sufficient liquidity at the end of a week which had seen a bank run. Perhaps some have forgotten the context of that week. On March 8, Wednesday, Silvergate announced it was closing. On March 10th, Friday, SVB was placed into receivership, after the most explosive bank run in history. On March 10th, still that same Friday, Signature experienced a run of $18.6 billion of deposits in the space of hours. That context refreshed, let’s review where Signature believed its business was on March 11th and 12th, over that weekend. Signature experienced difficulties telling a plausible story involving numbers which added up (pg 35) that weekend. Quoting that postmortem: Signature needed to provide reliable and realistic data, particularly concerning immediately available liquidity and ongoing deposit withdrawals, to inform the analysis the Regulators and Signature needed to perform to understand the Bank’s liquidity position. Once Signature began providing any data on these key issues, the Regulators found the data was inconsistent and that it continuously changed in material ways. Signature execs, et al, were on a series of conference calls with regulators for an entire weekend. They began with regulators taking note of the bank run and candidly announcing the bank was in mortal peril. Signature proceeded, in the regulators’ view, to confabulate about liquidity sources, composition and quality of assets, and current withdrawal requests pending, through either malfeasance or spectacularly poorly timed technical incompetence. Regulators felt that, at this pivotal moment, Signature was dangerously disconnected with reality, like an executive describing the weekend as (this is a quote) “uneventful thus far.” It is a serious accusation to say Signature was confabulating. Banking regulators are (mostly) serious people. Quoting the postmortem again: For example, through Sunday afternoon, Signature represented to the Regulators that nearly $6 billion in liquidity from its commercial real estate portfolio would “Very Likely” be available to the Bank on Monday. The Regulators were aware, however, that it would take weeks for the FRBNY to review and value that portfolio. Was Signature aware that its commercial real estate portfolio could not possibly be good collateral on Monday? Manifestly so. A brief explanation for the benefit of readers unfamiliar with commercial real estate (CRE) banking: Signature’s plan was to pledge portions of its CRE loan portfolio to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York the Monday after the critical weekend. It thought that the Fed would credit them for the value of the portfolio less some haircut. Signature would then immediately wire what the Fed credited them to the customers demanding their deposits. Simple as. However, CRE loans are not fungible, easy-to-analyze assets like e.g. Treasury bills or even mortgage-backed securities. They’re complex, bespoke legal agreements, in the best of times. 2023 was not the best of times for the New York commercial real estate market, as anyone who reads the newspaper is aware, and so you can’t simply value those loans by copying outstanding balances into Excel then chugging a tiny bit of math. You’ve got to read the darn things, construct a model (which, if you were someone with skin in the game, would asymptotically approach re-underwriting those loans because New York CRE is that bad), come up with your impaired valuation, and then, haircut that. Signature Bank had a crypto sideline but its beating heart was the New York CRE market. This is a bank that breathed New York real estate. It beggars belief that they thought that portfolio would be Very Likely to be good collateral in merely wall-clock hours of work. You know what this reminds me of? This reminds me of one Sam Bankman-Fried who, on finding himself in what he believed to be a survivable liquidity crisis, began wildly writing indicative numbers down on napkins and/or Google Sheets. SBF still doesn’t understand why nobody believed him. Just look at the napkins! We are not required to believe your napkins, Signature, if they contain obvious untruths, or if the napkins evolve wildly in inconsistent ways over the course of a single meeting. The most critical question for Signature’s liquidity position was “How much money will customers wire out on Monday?” This is straightforward banking, which regulators pressed them to do all weekend: a) sum up how much money customers have asked for on Monday, in the hundreds of current pending wire requests b) project a worst case scenario for how that number will evolve, as more customers put in wire requests, before Monday morning. Here is the time series (taken from above report, pg 40) of those two questions being asked repeatedly in a 48 hour window. Observe how often, a few hours after Signature has made a (new, even-more-worst-than-previous) worst case scenario, the known wire requests have already exceeded that worst case scenario. Signature then communicated a new worst case scenario, which felicitously was only as far away from known wire requests as their previous worst case scenario had been, almost as if they were learning nothing from repeatedly being wrong. This played out multiple times. Signature believes it understood where it was that weekend. The above picture is almost proof positive that it did not. They also understood their experience of the weekend to be signaling how the worst was over. Quoting postmortem again (pg 6): Over the weekend, Signature’s estimates of pending deposit withdrawals increased, going from $2 billion on Saturday evening to $4 billion Sunday morning, and then to $7.4 billion to $7.9 billion by Sunday evening. These numbers represented known deposit withdrawals. Despite the run on Friday, March 10 and the negative news over the weekend, Signature insisted that additional withdrawals would be minimal on Monday. The Regulators assessed this projection as unrealistic and that the Bank needed to be prepared to handle another significant deposit run. (emphasis added) Signature believes it could have white knuckled through the hurricane and emerged victorious on Monday. Then it had projections by which it would suddenly, indeed miraculously, have sufficient liquidity on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. And then the hard work would start. It would bank the heck out of its remaining customers, start finding buyers for its valuable assets over the ensuing months, and somehow pull this off. Because it was solvent! Signature had critical liquidity issues, no real path to solving them, and lost the confidence of its regulators, during a bank run which was worsening by the hour. That is a recipe for receivership. No conspiracy is necessary to explain what happened. The rest of the postmortem is worth reading, too, and deeply wonky in the way that excites banking nerds. Where else can you read a scintillating discussion on what capital call loans are acceptable collateral at the Fed emergency window? Crypto likes novel crypto-using banking products In 2022, the FDIC sent out a wave of letters to banks. Prying these letters from the FDIC has been a bit of a project, requiring Coinbase and other interested parties to do quite a bit of arm wrestling. The letters which have been released, grudgingly, are heavily redacted. A brief commentary on transparency: democratic governance simultaneously requires substantial transparency and also requires the government to be able to have private conversations. Curtains of secrecy are frequently invoked cynically to cover abuses. For example, you could say “That protest is a foreign influence operation! I cannot disclose my basis for thinking that, for reasons of national security! You should therefore act as my proxy to suppress this protest!” (Uh, spoiler alert, we will return to this later.) In the culture that is banking supervision, however, privilege will frequently be asserted fairly maximally on routine supervisory communications with banks. This is because they are institutionally wary of causing risk to banks by signaling to the market or depositors that those banks have lost the confidence of regulators. Banking regulators are terrified of “self-fulfilling prophecies.” You need to be able to have candid conversations with regulated entities for the same reason coworkers need to be able to have candid conversations with each other. Privacy enhances candor, even when those conversations implicate third parties, even when third parties would really love to be a fly on the wall. And so I think there is a legitimate balancing act to be done here. But I’m sympathetic to crypto advocates who say (paraphrase) “This is backroom maneuvering to do something we don’t like. You won’t even admit the thing you are doing! And, confound you, after you are dragged kicking and screaming to admitting the thing, you’ll probably claim it is good! Like they did after Operation Choke Point!” Conversely, when the government is capable of publishing extensively researched position papers and extensively footnoted indictments, that should give you more confidence that it is less likely to be engaged in lawless, arbitrary behavior. Not limitless confidence, certainly, but it is evidence in a direction. Carter surmises that the expurgated supervisory letters are regarding NYDIG’s proposed product which would allow banks and credit unions to offer customers direct Bitcoin exposure. You can analogize this to the feature in Cash App which allows you to buy Bitcoin, without being able to transfer it, except it would happen in your banking app. I think Carter is very likely (90%+) correct with respect to identifying the subject of these letters. Much of the pack is dated shortly before the FDIC did, indeed, publish public guidance about banks directly offering crypto products. NYDIG was the firm with the most progress against the opportunity (source: general industry knowledge) that otherwise fits with what we can read of the letters. So: is this a stunning inversion of our democratic norms? No. Banking regulators get to weigh in on proposed banking products. That is the absolute core of the job. That will extremely routinely result in saying something which rounds, like many of the letters do, to “We are going to have a considered think about this and get back to you, but in the meanwhile, please don’t roll this out widely.” (The think was had; the results were published. Many crypto advocates do not like those results, and are asserting procedural irregularities because of that.) Does this meaningfully prohibit the crypto industry from offering retail users financial services? No. You can buy Bitcoin exposure in Cash App, Venmo, Robinhood, Coinbase, Fidelity, Interactive Brokers, any brokerage account capable of trading U.S. ETFs, and many more places besides. Crypto advocates cheerfully blast out press releases about how many ways are coming online every week to buy their tokens from them at very reasonable prices prior to lunar travel. Is there a facially plausible reason for attempting to institute a consistent policy among regulated banks, in a way there was not for Operation Choke Point? Again, a core concern for the FDIC is that unsophisticated custom",

That's pretty fundamental to any reasonable justice system. reply btown 3 hours agorootparentBut the SAR itself, from how it sounds in the OP, is not the trigger that makes a person/business unbankable across the entire banking system - only at that single bank. The OP article makes a reasonable point that administration officials can and do exert pressure on banks to withhold services to certain industries like debt collectors. And there indeed is a slippery slope there, and one that VCs with significant exposure to crypto are motivated to highlight. But “withholding evidence,” and the SAR secrecy specifically, doesn’t seem to be a mechanism by which that happens. I’m far more concerned with what might cause an individual to lose access to all banks than what might cause them to lose access to one. reply sneak 4 hours agorootparentprevYou have no right to a banking relationship, so there is no justice involved. It's not scary until everyone stops accepting cash. reply liontwist 4 hours agorootparentMaybe that was a true when a bank was a private business and you could reasonably live without it. Today they are effectively a branch of the government and your life would be seriously impaired. For example, where does your employer setup direct deposit? How do you apply for a mortgage and demonstrate assets? If society relies on technology then you need it to participate. Yes you can still breathe without access to transportation, but you can’t work in the economy. In 1940 car or bus access was a luxury because normal people got along fine without one. That’s why it’s misleading to say increasing car access is an better standard of living. It’s actually an increase in the cost to participate in life. So yes banking must be a right. Or alternatively we could strengthen cash rights (reduce technology) with legal protections to qualify for loans, etc. But that won’t happen. reply miohtama 4 hours agorootparentIn the EU, there is a right for a bank account.

It depends on the country, but in some places small businesses basically have to go begging around, hoping that some bank will take on the \"compliance risk\" of opening an account for them. reply sneak 1 hour agorootparentprevI disagree.

None of them are going to take a risk that invites audits from the big cheese to get your 20k in savings. The legal term to avoid here is “unilateral action” - don’t do what the other banks aren’t doing. The list of problematic people is even shared between them by the regulator.

I propose that value should be “lack of freedom of association” - eg I don’t think corporations should be allowed to stop doing business with, or refuse to do business with, anyone citizen, except after conviction in a court of law for behavior directly related to that business. 2. Government should not be able to use their secret monitoring to prevent anyone from doing anything. No lists, secret orders, etc. If government wants someone debanked, take it to court.

Why is it okay to do that for things like murder and other crimes but not for banks? reply mandevil 1 hour agorootparentSAR's can be discussed when criminal charges are filed. The most famous case I know of that stems from a publicly available SAR is former Speaker of the House Denny Hastert (R-Il) after his retirement from the House, when he was a lobbyist. He was being blackmailed by someone for his previous sexual assaults from his days as a high school teacher and wrestling coach three decades earlier, before he went into politics. He went to a bank to withdraw a bunch of cash to pay his blackmailer, and the bank started to fill out the form they do whenever you withdraw over $10,000 in cash (not a SAR, just a regular form). He saw the form being filled out, and decided he didn't want a paper trail with the government showing he was being blackmailed. So instead he stood in line hundreds of times at the bank, withdrawing $5,000 each time. This was why a SAR was filed, because he was clearly doing something called \"structuring\" which is setting up transactions deliberately to avoid those disclosure rules. After the FBI investigated, they decided that they couldn't get him for child sexual abuse, because it had been so long ago that the statue of limitations had expired. But they could get him for structuring, to which he plead guilty and served 15 months in jail. Besides the fact that knowing about when they are filed would tip off criminals, there is also the fact that oftentimes they are filed for perfectly innocuous reasons, and are never investigated and don't go anywhere. Not ideal to have publicly available \"this guy did something suspicious\" flags that have not been investigated further looming over you and haunting the rest of your life. Since SAR's are not shared with other financial institutions, they won't follow you the same way. reply RobotToaster 2 hours agoparentprevHow does that not violate the due process clause?

Then, any attempt to not tell the government is \"money laundering\". Of course, if you are the state, the powers of this tool are alluring.

Nobody really cares about people concealing the source of their income in the general case. There's no purpose for money laundering laws just for that purpose alone. The reason that money laundering laws exist is that one way to discover and prosecute crimes that people actually care about (human trafficking, drug dealing, various kinds of fraud, terrorism) is to \"follow the money\", and if criminals can successfully launder their money, it makes it easier to get away with their criminal activity. The second reason that it exists is that money laundering _itself_ is often a much easier crime to prosecute than the underlying offense is. What KYC and AML laws do, and are extremely successful at is _not_ preventing money laundering. That would actually be undesirable for prosecutors! What KYC and AML laws do is allow people to money launder while creating a wonderful paper trail for prosecutors to follow and build a case on when they take an interest in someone from crimes they actually do care about. Chances are if you are money laundering, you have at some point lied on a banking form, which is a prosecutable crime, and a lot easier to prosecute than drug dealing and other crimes are, sometimes. reply nyclounge 16 hours agoparentprev>Law enforcement should do their job and investigate crimes, rather than outsourcing this responsibility to financial institutions and effectively forcing them to be the \"judge, jury, and executioner.\" Think there have being big pressure from banks and financial institutions to centralize power.

It took an exhausting effort and connections with employees inside Stripe to escalate our case to get our case re-reviewed. Google Payments for the Play Store halted payment processing randomly and sent me a message demanding to get copies of my passport and other details. When I sent it, they said they'd respond in 72-96 hours and just came back saying they needed the same document again even after I sent it. This repeated several times. Every time I contacted them, they came back with an automated response saying that they'd look at my message. After I asked for escalation to an account specialist, the specialist said they'd get back to me in 96 hours. That situation also took escalations with friends at Google to get sorted out in the end, but not until we spent two weeks churning subscribers and losing revenue.

But the obvious follow up is what one pithy word should be used to describe this activity? The proffered terms (offboarding, derisking) are being suggested by the industry with an obvious political motive to minimise the significance of what they are doing. There is an ongoing war against the pornography industry that has been waged in part through payment processing. The entire thing is an intense mish-mash of poverty, wealth, politics, drama, technology and major social forces clashing with each other. It isn't appropriate to talk about that sort of action in bland terms. There is an attempt being made to sculpt society by leveraging the financial system. The implementation details of that isn't \"offboarding\" or \"derisking\" - it is much more in the spirit of a word like \"debanking\". I'm with the activists on this one.

I invited Marc Andreessen for a conversation on X (formerly Twitter), after the Joe Rogan interview. It is no surprise I didn’t receive a response when he’s one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in tech, and I’m certainly not even the richest person on my street. At its core, a bank’s business model is straightforward: you act as a caretaker for depositors’ money. Your primary obligation is always to ensure that depositors can withdraw their funds in full, whenever they need them, within the terms of the contract. Profitability is achieved by carefully managing risk—both in holding deposits and lending them out—while making sure that, at all costs, you can make every depositor whole. In practice, this means thoroughly understanding and mitigating risks. To do so means we identify every possible scenario, assess its likelihood and potential impact, plan how we’d mitigate the risk, and determine the residual exposure. Our regulators then review this work, probing relentlessly, testing our assumptions against extreme hypotheticals: floods knocking out our data center, hackers encrypting our backups, simultaneous runs on accounts associated with crypto exchanges—every remote yet plausible crisis is considered. We then refine and repeat this cycle until the regulators are satisfied we understand every angle of our risk profile. Every mitigation strategy we implement has a cost—whether it’s the liquidity we must set aside or the capital reserves we are required to hold. If the regulator believes any exposure is excessive, the bank must increase its capital buffers, making the business more resilient but also more capital-intensive. From a traditional perspective, stable term deposits or mortgages are ideal for banks. They’re long-term, predictable, and well-understood, with minimal servicing costs. In contrast, servicing the crypto industry poses unique challenges. While there can be mutual benefits, the costs and constraints imposed by regulatory and liquidity requirements often clash with the crypto sector’s expectations. Ultimately, it’s a cost/benefit analysis. Crypto-related accounts tend to require holding large liquidity buffers, limiting profitability. Banks must maintain extremely high-quality liquid assets because these crypto accounts can be called upon at any time, as they are generally setup as an on-ramp or off-ramp for the exchanges' customers. If a bank is required to hold 100% of those deposits in liquid form just to meet potential instant demand, the profitability of such relationships diminishes. Once you factor in operational overhead, compliance, and the capital required to ensure depositor safety, the margins shrink even more. Capital adequacy is another critical complication. The bank must have sufficient Tier 1 capital to cover all depositors in the event of a collapse. This includes provisioning for winding up the bank and ensuring depositors remain whole even if certain assets become illiquid. The instability and occasional outright fraud we’ve seen in the crypto domain (e.g., the FTX/SBF scandal) means that funds could vanish or become tied up. As a result, banks often need to raise even more capital or reduce shareholder dividends. This is costly, and that cost must be considered in pricing and strategic decisions. Finally, the operational and compliance costs associated with handling crypto transactions—from specialised staff to advanced monitoring systems—can be prohibitively high. The reality is that the associated liquidity, capital, and operational requirements often make it an expensive proposition with limited upside for the bank. At the end of the day, the bank must always ensure depositors are protected, and that priority imposes constraints that may not align with the crypto industry’s expectations. reply anonymoushn 9 hours agoparentI guess it is surprising that crypto service providers cannot come to an agreement with banks by just paying more money for the service or by implementing some rules for their users which would allow some portion of their bank deposits to be held in slightly less cash-like assets. reply loeg 4 minutes agorootparentI think one of Patrick's points is that the real cost to the bank for providing these services to crypto companies is more than the entire profits of the crypto companies.

The Stripes and Adyens of the world spend efforts in regulatory because they have to keep the bank happy, but they find those efforts just cost money, not harm the actual goals of the business. Many of the crypto services believe that no, there's no way they'll do what the bank tells them and still remain useful to their clients. They'd have to compete with the truly off-the-regulatory-world competitors, and probably lose a lot of business there.

(I think in fact that his position as stated is that debanking in general is bad unless it's against people he doesn't like, which is a position held by literally everybody.) Rather, it's an examination of why debanking exists in general and why \"bank everyone you're allowed to\" isn't the dominant strategy, what factors go into influencing politically-driven debanking, and whether or not the current argument made by cryptocurrency advocates that \"we are being debanked for political reasons\" is true or not. It concludes that while crypto is being debanked (or equivalently but less provocatively, banks are declining to create new relations with them), it's primarily because crypto has historically been bad for banks. This in turn has created a(n arguably political) culture among those who decide who shall be banked or debanked to not service their industry. In other words, crypto isn't being debanked because people morally disagree with them per se, but because crypto is simply extremely risky tl;dr of the tl;dr: the article is primarily about systems around debanking and only secondarily about whether or not crypto is being debanked (conclusion: it is and it's not necessarily for political reasons) reply ranger207 12 hours agoparentThe main problem with the article is that, while patio is a very knowledgeable and even insightful writer, he has an extremely indirect writing style. It almost feels like a math textbook that describes \"here's the properties of this mathematical construct; you can immediately see it has these properties\" without explaining the connection to the other mathematical constructs that give it these properties. In his defense though, his writing is a more gradual progression between \"here's a thing\" and \"here's the implications of the thing\" than a typical math textbook. But he still doesn't explicitly point out the connections, which means you have to expend a lot of brain power to hold enough things in your head at once to make those connections yourself, which is exhausting. Part of that is because the connections are social connections that are far less clear, defined, and observable than typical STEM systems, and he doesn't want to ever tell you or imply to you anything incorrect.

In one case, some blogger called a politician \"fat\", which caused the FBI equivalent to request the bank account history from the bloggers bank, which ultimately caused debanking. So in Germany it's used more Stasi like, meaning protection of the government. They changed the objective so that the scope of the domestic intelligence is no longer groups of people who want to overthrow the system, but also individuals that \"deligitimize the government and it's representatives\". That is, criticism about the Covid measures can put you on the radar of domestic intelligence.

It doesn't matter whether you are selling crypto, weed, porn or socks. This is done in France, and many other countries by the way. The bank has an obligation to service, as your life's obligations requires such a bank account.

You can live without loans but you can't leave without a debit bank account. As the parent points out there's indeed such a law in France but from personal experience I can tell that it doesn't prevent the bank from closing your account without an explanation (the explanation I was given off-record was my citizenship). The law merely forces the bank to open you an account which can later be closed. So definitely the right direction but IMO not far enough. reply aidenn0 43 minutes agorootparentGiven that about 10% of the US has no debit bank account and they aren't dying, that seems like an exaggeration.

No, I questioned the particular situation given my personal experience with the Ukrainian war for account holders in Europe, the existing banking regulation around the basic account. reply csomar 9 hours agorootparentprevNo citizenship is a major factor. For example, Syrians are a very red flag in many countries and many banks outright denies them service. If you are from North Korea, you'd be delusional to think that you can just show up at a \"western\" bank and walk out with a bank card. reply tptacek 12 hours agorootparentprevA debit bank account is a line of credit. It effectively is a loan. reply alexey-salmin 11 hours agorootparentYou're not participating in a good faith discussion. Yes, it is technically a line of credit but it's not the reason why you're being refused service. Overdraft risks for a personal account are small and can easily be accounted-for in the service fee or via insurance (which is the same in the end). The reason for account closure is the fear of anti-AML laws and sanctions that have nothing to do with loans. Banks in fact love offering small loans and it's not uncommon to have your account closed while having a pre-approved loan at the same time — these are different bank divisions in action. And in any case, turning personal debit accounts into credit accounts is not something that was asked for. I lived long enough to have used Visa Electron and Maestro cards that made most of overdraft scenarios impossible. It was the banking industry decision to get rid of them. reply tptacek 11 hours agorootparentThe entire article is about why that isn't true in the cases he's talking about. reply alexey-salmin 11 hours agorootparentWhat exactly isn't true? That compliance is the reason why accounts get closed? As far as I understood the article this is the main reason he gives. Loans or other objective reasons that can make the interaction with the client unprofitable are only drawn as (bad) analogies and not as the actual explanation. reply csomar 14 hours agorootparentprevSince the Fed is the provider of the liquidity and also sets the rules on what is a collateral and what is not, I say yes, the bank must loan you the money as long as you satisfy the conditions of the loan. The bank is roughly a re-seller of the Fed liquidity. They shouldn't be an arbiter of who gets to access that liquidity but rather an administrative entity that follows the rules. reply tptacek 13 hours agorootparentThat doesn't make sense. When your business account stiffs a bunch of customers who get their ACH transactions reversed, and you're insolvent, your bank has to pay off those transactions. It can't just go to the Fed and say \"give me money to cover for this insolvent business\". Your bank is not in fact literally just a front end for the Fed. reply efitz 8 hours agoprevThe article’s refusal to acknowledge that there might be viewpoint discrimination going on makes it feel like the author is trying to do a Jedi mind trick. reply nstj 6 hours agoprevWhy is the linked post so long? reply lmm 12 hours agoprevAs always, he moves the cup so flashily for so long that you forget that you never saw him put the ball under it in the first place. If you take it as read that Binance (the largest threat to his business interests) really are evil, then of course destroying any bank willing to serve them is perfectly justified. I also love the impersonal gloss over the actions of all the bank employees, as though all the Operation Choke Point crimes were carried out by machines directed by the politicians and regulators, and not humans making the choice to be Quislings. Look at the quote from Zuckerberg where he expresses regret for the poor choices he and his company made, and note the conspicuous absence of anyone doing the same from the banking/finance industry. Those of us who've been paying attention are not hearing about debanking for the first time now, we've been banging this drum for years. In a country with the US' asset forfeiture laws, denial of banking service is de facto denial of the human right to own property. The current situation in the US is shameful, and while part of that shame should fall on the politicians and regulators, much of it rightly falls on the banks themselves. (Nor is it that an alternative is impractical. The UK made it legally obligatory for banks to offer \"basic bank accounts\" to everyone in 2016, and the sky has not fallen). I have no love for the crypto people, but they're fighting for the right thing here (whether they're doing so out of good motives or bad) and I hope they succeed. reply pjc50 8 hours agoparent> The UK made it legally obligatory for banks to offer \"basic bank accounts\" to everyone in 2016, and the sky has not fallen). This did not avoid https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage_Coutts_bank_scand... However there's a vital layer of ambiguity in that story which made it more confusing for everyone involved: Coutts is a long standing \"private bank\" which makes a point of not serving everyone, only HNWIs, and Farage fell into both the \"not rich enough\" and \"too politically exposed\" categories. > The current situation in the US is shameful, and while part of that shame should fall on the politicians and regulators, much of it rightly falls on the banks themselves Like the lack of consumer protection and public safety in the US, at some point you have to accept that the public are also ultimately responsible through the ballot box. US financial control systems are driven firstly by the catch-all \"war on terror\", which since 9/11 has been used to justify any and all authoritarianism with public support, war on drugs ditto (despite state level legalization!), and thirdly evangelical support for Operation Choke Point. reply MonkeyClub 6 hours agorootparentThe Farage situation hardly applies as an example, if at all. From the linked Wikipedia page: > NatWest, the owner of Coutts, initially claimed that he failed to meet the Coutts eligibility criteria of holding £1,000,000 or more in his account, following the expiry of his mortgage. NatWest instead offered him an account with the retail side of the bank. So it's hardly a case of debanking a random Joe. It was only a higher-end account that was closed for not keeping the requirements for keeping it, and Farage was offered a normal account. reply ahakki 6 hours agorootparentFrom the same Wikipedia article: > It was later revealed that Farage's account was closed in part as Coutts felt that his beliefs and values did not align with theirs. In an internal dossier, Coutts wrote that he \"is at best seen as xenophobic and pandering to racists\" and considered a \"disingenuous grifter\". reply carlosjobim 5 hours agorootparentprevOops, you \"forgot\" the rest of the quote: \"After Farage went to the press about the closure, it was discovered that Coutts had closed Farage's account as they deemed him to be \"at best seen as xenophobic and pandering to racists\". Following media attention, the NatWest CEO, Dame Alison Rose, resigned.\" And of course, debanking is not used against any \"random Joe\", it is a weapon to make sure the random Joe stays nothing more than a random Joe and does not express his opinions or reaches for any political influence not sanctioned by the bankers. reply pessimizer 5 hours agorootparentprev> initially claimed reply dalemhurley 11 hours agoparentprevSo you are saying that a private company, i.e. the bank must service the crypto industry even though it is going to mean they will suffer massive losses in doing so? See my explanation of why it is an extremely costly venture for banks. reply lmm 9 hours agorootparentMy position is that banks (which are not \"private companies\" as normally understood, but heavily regulated entities whose status already involves a complex bundle of special rights and special obligations) should be obliged to provide basic banking to any legally operating individual or business, just as they are already obliged to offer various services that they probably would not if they had a free choice. If they are unable to figure out a way to provide basic banking without extending credit in the way patio11 describes then this will of course be extremely costly for them, but I suspect they would figure out a way to not have to extend credit rather quickly (hint: look at what banks in virtually any other country do) if they actually tried. If not - i.e. if the current price of banking is only sustainable when banks are permitted to arbitrarily refuse service - then I guess prices will have to rise to something similar to what they are in countries where banks already have those kind of service obligations. Again, that doesn't sound like such a terrible fate. reply SpicyLemonZest 4 hours agorootparentI completely agree when it comes to personal accounts, but the restrictions required to avoid extending credit make such accounts impractical for any realistic business purpose. You can’t, for example, allow the customer to write checks. reply dvdkon 1 hour agorootparentI know this debate is about the US banking system, but I feel the need to point out that in most of the EU, cheques basically aren't used, and business purchases are generally made by wire transfers. Without a chequebook or credit card, you could offer a bank account without any risk that the bank would ever have to pay out more than its nominal balance.",

It says my money would be SIPC insured, which means if anything goes missing (obviously not through loss of equity value, but through missing funds or a ledger bug), I get my money back, up to the SIPC limit, right? I just want to ensure this isn't the same situation with fintechs that say your money is \"FDIC insured\", but that only protects you if the bank fails, not if the fintech goes bankrupt. I'm just really, really wary of new fintech products to save like .3% on fees when I hear all these horror stories of people trusting fintech startups with their money any then losing 95% of their deposits like the Yotta customers. reply jjmaxwell4 1 hour agoparentIf Double goes out of business, your assets are safe and held in your name at Apex Clearing.

We are not currently a brokerage so SIPC would not apply if Double goes bankrupt. Dear @jjmaxwell4 -- I'm not really worried about your service given you're a layer atop Apex, however, this is a very common conversation happening right now on many forums -- could you clarify a bit more, how one would \"get comfortable\" with a new product? I'm assuming the list is something like this, but that is an non-expert guess: - Is the institution i'm interacting with regulated (in your case, Yes, Double is regulated by The SEC) - Who holds my funds, and are they regulated (in your case, the funds are held by Apex Clearing, and if I understand correctly, Apex is a broker dealer regulated by The SEC) - Are the funds held in my name or pooled in with other money? (in your case, I think the funds are held by Apex only in my name) I think one of the problems with the Yotta/Synapse/Evolve collapse is -- its unclear how one even evaluates their level of risk. It is also unclear how one validates SIPC coverage, like could I go to SIPC and enter an account number and validate the funds are actually covered somewhere across the layers? Would be great for someone who knows this area to comment. reply AznHisoka 28 minutes agorootparentDitto.

I want to ensure \"in your name\" is not the same thing as \"for benefit of\". The thing that actually gives me the most reassurance is that they say definitively that they are a Registered Investment Advisor. In the Synapse situation, all the regulatory agencies were essentially saying \"not my problem\" because Synapse itself wasn't covered under any explicit regulatory regime. That doesn't seem to be the case here, but I'd feel better if the founders said something along the lines of \"This is how we're different from Synapse...\" reply jjmaxwell4 3 hours agorootparentThe account is opened in your name and your securities are held in your name at Apex Clearing.

For a reputable company, even if their support is a hassle, they'll probably make you whole eventually. But presume they don't address the issue or repeatedly have widespread issues, what then?

Someone on HN suggested getting the comptroller involved. I think I found a state office called the comptroller, but it might have been the federal one? In any case, the moment they showed up in a conference call the bank transferred me to someone important, stopped fooling around, and made the transfer happen. The person at the comptroller office never got past the asking questions stage, but the bank's behavior changed immediately in a way that suggested they recognized the smell of authority.

That's the dirty secret way of making money that you seem to have completely excluded. The reality is that adds up to substantial \"invisible\" fees that the investor has no transparency over because you sell your trade flows to them and they make a higher than normal spread. And the whole \"doesn't matter if we sell your trade flows, the rules require you to get best execution\" is a farce and everyone in the industry knows this - otherwise there is no reason why Citadel or Virtu would bid billions of dollars to just buy the trade flow. 2) Are you going to rebate your borrow fees back to investors? This is the other dirty secret way of making money. Many people don't realize that you can earn lending fees by lending your shares out for people looking to short stocks, and those add up to substantial amounts over time for a scaled asset manager. Do you keep this instead of rebating it fully back to your customers? 3) If the answer is no, you don't sell trade flows and yes, you will rebate your borrow fees, can you make a lifetime commitment that you won't go back on your word?

Defenders of PFOF have claimed that retail brokers who route to high-speed traders (in exchange for PFOF) provide better price execution for investors and that it’s a net positive, despite creating an inherent misalignment between these platforms and their customers, and despite public evidence to the contrary. Leaning on the flawed argument that they categorically provide retail customers with best price execution quality, there is little by way of self-regulation to foment change or prevent applications designed to optimize transaction volume (i.e. speculation and day trading) and risky activity (i.e. margin and options trading).

Others make less. Some big retail brokerages do not accept any payment for order flow at all: They still use this system (routing their orders to market makers), but they take 100% of the value in the form of price improvement for their customers instead of payments for themselves. Intuitively, you might think that the brokerages that get a lot of PFOF would get worse price improvement. But, nope! Here is Bill Alpert in Barron’s: Critics of retail brokers like Robinhood Markets condemn those companies for routing customers’ orders to market makers like Citadel Securities in exchange for payments. ... The suspicion is that greater payments to brokers must be offset by less favorable execution prices. But that isn’t what a new study finds. In an Aug. 13 working paper, five finance professors analyzed 85,000 stock trades they made through five leading retail brokers. They did get significantly different pricing through different brokers for identical orders to buy or sell at the current market price. But their best pricing came from a broker that takes payment for order flow, namely TD Ameritrade, now a unit of Charles Schwab. Fidelity, which takes no order payments, got worse prices on the professors’ trades than did TD Ameritrade. And its prices were no better than those from the E*Trade unit of Morgan Stanley, which does take payments. Robinhood, which used revenue from order-flow payments to subsidize the industry’s first commission-free trading, delivered middle-of-the-pack pricing. Interactive Brokers ranked last in the execution pricing of the professors’ orders. That's from https://news.bloomberglaw.com/mergers-and-acquisitions/matt-...

The reason its bad is because its anti-competive and gives them information that no-one else has access to. By trading against you, Citadel prevents any other potential market maker from trading with you. With less competition, the spread widens and even after price improvement, you're paying more. PFOF also tells them who they are trading against but anyone else who just sees a quote doesn't know that. Generally, things are very zero sum so wins all around are very unlikely. But some thinking is needed to track where the value loss and gains are. reply wrsh07 56 minutes agorootparentPlease see my other comment that provides links to a study that shows: yes you get the best price from a broker using pfof Your argument seems reasonable but isn't borne out empirically https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42378516 reply wrsh07 4 hours agorootparentprevHere's the money stuff excerpt: https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/02/th... > I feel like most of what I read about payment for order flow is insane?

First of all, it is illegal to front-run your order, and the Securities and Exchange Commission does, you know, keep an eye on this stuff. Second, the wholesaler is ordinarily filling your order at a price that is better than what’s available in the public market, so “front-running”—going out and buying on the stock exchange and then turning around and selling to you at a profit—doesn’t work. Third, because retail orders are generally uninformative, the wholesaler is not rubbing its hands together being like “bwahahaha now I know that Matt Levine is buying GameStop, it will definitely go up, I must buy a ton of it before he gets any!” The whole story is widely accepted but also completely transparent nonsense. reply 1oooqooq 18 minutes agorootparentit's already public that frontrunning is perfectly legal if you can do it with large volume as to not show intent of frontrunning one single person. reply hn_throwaway_99 2 hours agoparentprev> If the answer is no, you don't sell trade flows and yes, you will rebate your borrow fees, can you make a lifetime commitment that you won't go back on your word?

That said, based on the comments here I'm curious: 1. I've always assumed % fees were related to the cost of risks being proportional to account AUM crossed with holding and transaction expenses. Fixed fees to me imply that you don't think any risks on your end are portfolio size or transaction size proportional. If this is really the case, why is this the case? (Or why am I wrong about the link?) 2. Lots of commentators seem interested in questions about how you loan holdings and if shareholders get cuts and if you accept payment for order flow. I'm less concerned with these exact things and more concerned with how the customer relationship is defined. Is there an equivalent to being a fiduciary when it comes to handling such things?

The direct indexing piece is nice because you can build \"around\" your existing holding, which you can't do with, say, VOO. And the TLH is nice because you have a lot of capital gains in your position to offset. This is something you can do with, e.g. Fidelity's FidFolios, but those are paid for via an AUM fee. Can you do the same here? That is choose an index, but seed it with some amount of shares that you already hold? Another potential annoyance is filling out your tax return. Can you talk a bit about how that would work, with all the trades throughout the year you'll be doing? I'd also love any more info you can provide on how exactly you do TLH. A factor model linear optimization problem is interesting! When I talked to my Fidelity advisor she pitched it as the pair-wise solution you mentioned, and gave an example of \"sell Pepsi to buy Coke\".

When a stock is identified for TLH purposes, we will sell it and try and bring your overall portfolios factor exposure back in line.

While $12 per year would certainly save some money, it’s coffee money vs. life savings money.

Plus, zero fees doesn’t save me any money unless you can stay within 0.15% of the big index funds you’re going to be compared too. If you’re selling to harvest tax losses, I’ll bet there are some deviations at the fractions of a percent level that might erase all my savings. Move fast and break things works great for computer startups, but if you want me to move my life savings over I need more confidence that you’re going to be around in 40 years and still have my accounts intact.

For example, daily rebalancing/tax loss harvesting sounds neat, but how it is implemented can vary -- you would be incentivized to trade client accounts 'trigger happy' whenever possible to maximize fees. I could see that leading to the $1-10k annual revenue per customer that people on this thread are confused about relative to the $1 flat account fee. The potential negatives of this bias that I can see for customers: - tax loss harvesting is more a craft than a science. The goal of investing is primarily to have gains! And no one can predict the future fully. So it's really hard to know if selling a large position at a loss is a good move -- if that position goes up next year you may have missed out (like selling NVIDIA 3 years ago in a dip -- you would have been following the TLH playbook but you would be kicking yourself now). - If this is indeed your business model, this model only works for direct indexing portfolios with many stocks, so you will be biased to suggest portfolios with many companies instead of concentrated holdings, and biased against offering ETFs/funds. Not the end of the world in terms of negatives. But I just wanted to mention that 'churning stocks for fees' is a business model I haven't seen discussed on this thread. reply jnskender 1 hour agoprevAny relation to Boldin Financial Planner?

You mentioned generating short term/long term capital gains numbers, which is fine, but what about all the different transactions? Won't someone using your service have to enter all of them manually on their return? reply dmoy 1 hour agoparentSo I have zero enthusiasm for direct indexing, and there's effectively no chance I'm gonna use this product (or any other direct indexing company)[1], but The tax filing thing should be a non-issue. Yes you'll probably get a 1099-B with like a gazillion entries. But, assuming this is done normally, all your holdings will be covered stocks, and all the trades will show up as reported to the IRS in box 12. Then you'll be able to just summary entry with IRS 8949 box A/D, entering like literally two lines, and you're set. It sounds bad but it won't (I'M GUESSING!) be bad for tax filing headaches - two lines, same as any other broker. Yea I don't like Apex and they've fucked up a couple things for me before, but they should get this part right. And even if they don't... Say they don't report basis to the IRS, you can still enter summary, and just physically mail the IRS your 1099-B (even if you efile), and it'll still be okay without too much work. [1] my complaints stem mostly from portability. With a ~0.03% fee ETF, I can go to any broker in the future and still deal with it. If for whatever reason I want to stop working with , now I'm stuck dealing with thousands of individual holdings. If I was operating with large enough amounts that I could literally transfer to a different broker (IBKR) and hoist the remains into a creation unit of VTI or whatever, sure. But that's increments of $30M each, so ... lol not for people like me. Or maybe in the future there's enough direct indexer services that they solve portability at increments smaller than . Then maybe yea, idk. reply Glyptodon 16 minutes agorootparentOnly works out easy if nothing ends up being a potential wash sale with something in your other brokerage accounts. reply dmoy 5 minutes agorootparentHa, fair If you're also using a other direct indexing service, or doing a bunch of manual stock trades yourself, then RIP your time :( reply Gh0stRAT 1 hour agoparentprevIIRC if your brokerage reports everything to the IRS properly, you only need to fill out net short- and long-term capital gains on your schedule D rather than specifying every single transaction on a bunch of Form 8949 copies.

I'm usually very much a DIY type of person when it comes to investing because of the typical fees mentioned, but excited to try this out! reply ikourtid 3 hours agoprevPAYMENT-FOR-ORDER-FLOW IS GOOD FOR YOU. There, I said it. [Source: I have 10 years of HFT / market making experience] PFOF is misunderstood, as others pointed out here. However, it's not a 'win win win'; it's more like a 'win win lose'. This is something even media gets wrong all the time. I've only seen this mentioned as a footnote in Matt Levine. [Note: I don't know if Double is doing it, or if they plan to - this is just a general summary]. So: * Win: Citadel (etc.) make money by trading against order flow that's more benign than the resting orders in public exchanges. * Win: The client gets a better execution price than the publicly displayed bid/ask. Back when I started (20+ years ago, yes, I'm old) this was 1/100 of a penny, the legal minimum (due to minimum tick print size). But recently, the market orders in my personal account have been getting price improvement of almost half the spread. Things are a bit different in some options exchanges, where retail flow gets some priority, regardless of when you joined a given price point at the order book queue. But almost all equity exchanges use price-time priority, you're almost guaranteed adverse selection. Example for those who may need it: if you place a buy limit @ $1.07 in a 1.07 (bid) - 1.08 (ask) market. Then, the bids at 1.07 slowly disappear, because firms such as \"Shark Holdings, LLC\" (the trading firm consisting solely of quants with unpronounceable foreign-sounding names) will cancel their bids if they sense the market is going down, e.g. if they observe a lot of trades at the bid. Then, the new market will be 1.06-1.07, and you will have sold at the ask. OK, so here's who loses: any large orders that have to trade in the open markets (not 'dark pools', ATS, etc.) will be stuck with more 'toxic' orders, and get worse execution. The question is: do I gain more as an individual from having my (quasi-entertainment-value, usually small) personal account orders get better execution? or do I lose more by having my indirect trading (possibly an index fund that I hold my retirement money in) get worse execution? I think it's the latter. But nobody connects the dots and/or seems to care. [Of course, this is more complicated, because large institutional orders aren't 100% on behalf of small investors.] You may say this component of market structure is stupid/wrong/suboptimal. I personally think so. But this is the reality of it. It's encased in rules. There was some attempt to get rid of PFOF a couple of years ago, but it failed. So that's not going away. So this is a win-win-lose: it's globally suboptimal, but for the 2 first 'wins', it's locally optimal. Summary: although PFOF has bad optics and stimulates pitchfork-y instincts (\"big bad evil companies are out to gitcha\", etc.), if your broker doesn't do it, you're both leaving money on the table - and guess what, they'd have to charge you some other way. reply ddulaney 4 hours agoprevHow are you tied back into the financial markets?

In all honesty though it would take a lot to get me to switch from Wealthfront because they not only offer these funds but also various IRA funds, bonds, etc. I like having everything in one place, and I don't have the time, nor sufficient knowledge of the market (if I'm honest with myself), to micro-manage my investments, so I can put up with a 0.25% AUM fee to \"set it and forget it\". But for those want more control or who are trying to reduce fees as much as possible, this looks great. Good luck. Update: Having said that, the fact that you say stocks are held in an account at Apex in my own name (avoiding the Synapse problem), is attractive. I'm actually not sure whether Wealthfront does that.
