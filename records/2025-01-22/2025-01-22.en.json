    "commentBody": "Ross Ulbricht granted a full pardon (twitter.com/free_ross)1681 points by Ozarkian 18 hours agohidepastfavorite1833 comments wolfgang42 17 hours agoTangentially related: I had the disconcerting experience of reading a Wired article about his arrest[1] while unknowingly sitting about six feet from the spot where he was apprehended. When I read that the FBI agents had stopped at Bello Coffee while preparing their stakeout, I thought, huh, interesting coincidence, I just had a coffee there. Then Ulbricht walked into the public library and sat down at the table directly in front of me, and suddenly as I was reading I could look up and see exactly the chair he had been in, where the plainclothes police had positioned themselves, how they had arranged a distraction. Having this tableau unexpectedly unfold right in front of my eyes was a fascinating experience, and it certainly made the article suddenly get a lot more immersive! [1] https://www.wired.com/2015/05/silk-road-2/ EDIT: to be clear, I was not present for the arrest. I was reading the magazine, some years after the arrest, but in the same place as the arrest. (I didn’t qualify the events with “I read that...” since I thought the narrative ellipsis would be obvious from context; evidently not.) reply syspec 16 hours agoparentSorry, it went over my head a bit, you read about his arrest while he was being arrested? reply wolfgang42 16 hours agorootparentHe was being arrested in the article, not IRL. When I say “Ulbricht walked into the public library and sat down at the table directly in front of me” I mean that I read > He went... past the periodicals and reference desk, beyond the romance novels, and settled in at a circular table near science fiction, on the second floor... in a corner, with a view out the window and his back toward the wall. and realized that I was in the Glen Park public library, at a circular table near science fiction on the second floor, in a corner with my back to the window, and facing directly towards where the article had just said he had sat. reply chrisco255 14 hours agorootparentI see so you accidentally retraced his footsteps from years prior and then realized it as you were reading about it. reply pwdisswordfishz 6 hours agorootparentprevnext [2 more] > He was being arrested in the article, not IRL. So the article lied that he was arrested? reply chocolateteeth 6 hours agorootparentCute reply kordlessagain 3 hours agorootparentprevThat’s because they are describing the inner workings of their visualization systems. They saw him walk in because he was where it happened. The image of Ross, and others, was in mind, however. reply Satam 14 hours agorootparentprevnext [39 more] I had the same confusion initially, interestingly chat GPT gets it: So while wolfgang42 wasn't there when Ulbricht was actually arrested, their realization created a vivid mental image of the event unfolding in that space, which made the story feel more immersive. In short: they were reading about an old event, but it happened to occur in the same spot they were sitting at that moment. Hope that clears it up! reply TeMPOraL 12 hours agorootparent> their realization created a vivid mental image of the event unfolding in that space, which made the story feel more immersive. Glad that ChatGPT, probably like GP themselves, is a visualizer and actually can create a \"vivid mental image\" of something. For those of us with aphantasia, that is not a thing. Myself, I too was mighty confused by the text, which read literally like a time travel story, and was only missing a cat and tomorrow's newspaper. reply xerox13ster 9 hours agorootparentLegitimately and I say this was absolutely no shade intended. This is a reading comprehension problem, nothing to do with aphantasia. He clearly states that he was reading an article, he uses past tense verbs when referring to Ross, and to the events spelled out in the article. If you somehow thought that he could be reading an article that ostensibly has to be describing a past event as he was seeing it in real time that is a logic flaw on you. It has nothing to do with what you can or cannot visualize. All you have to do is ask yourself could he have been reading an article about Ross’s arrest while watching it? Since nobody can violate the causality of space time the answer is no. This isn’t just you this is everybody in this thread who is reading this and going this is a little confusing. No it’s very clearly him speaking about a past experience reading an article about a past event. reply oneeyedpigeon 9 hours agorootparentI realised what was going on, but I did a double-take at: > Then Ulbricht walked into the public library and sat down at the table directly in front of me The problem is that two past events are being described, so tense alone cannot distinguish them. Cut the readers some slack; the writing could have been better. reply adinisom 8 hours agorootparentDone for effect: it felt to the OP as if it was the present so the writing conveys that, while elsewhere making it clear the arrest was not the present. reply whycome 5 hours agorootparentprevTo follow the tense and delivery of the previous sentence, it would have been clearest to say \"Then when Ulbricht...\" That \"then\" always does a lot of heavy lifting in English prose. reply themdonuts 8 hours agorootparentprevYes, same here. reply mlyle 3 hours agorootparentprevI do think the comment had something about how it was written that made it hard to follow. I understood the first sentence. But then I got to > Having this tableau unexpectedly unfold right in front of my eyes And the metaphor / tense shift caught me by surprise and made my eyes retrace to the beginning. I still got it, but there was a little bit of comprehension whiplash as I hit that bump in the road. In some ways, we're treated to an experience like the author's as we hit that sentence, so in that sense it's clever writing. On the other hand, maybe too clever for a casual web forum instead of, say, a letter. reply JohnMakin 7 hours agorootparentprevI am as baffled at the responses and appreciated this explanation as it was helpful to me to work on my communication style and expresses a lot of similar frustrations I have. Like what is actually going on here? this isn’t shade at anyone, I just feel like people are losing some fundamental ability to deduce from context what they are reading. it’s doubly concerning because people immediately reach to an AI/LLM to explain it for them, which cannot possibly be helping the first problem. reply lee-rhapsody 2 hours agorootparentAgree. This entire thread is weird. How do so many people in this thread have such obvious reading comprehension issues? On a similar note--I've noticed that HN comments are often overwrought, like the commenter is trying to sound smarter than they actually are but just end up muddling what they're trying to say. Perhaps these things are connected. reply Nevermark 4 hours agorootparentprevIf an LLM clears up a misunderstanding, I am having trouble seeing that as a bad thing. Maybe in 10 years we can blame poor reading comprehension on having a decade of computers reading for us. But it’s a bit early for that. reply firesteelrain 2 hours agorootparentWho will think if LLM is doing all the thinking? reply dontlikeyoueith 1 hour agorootparentprevThe problem is that people already have piss-poor reading comprehension. Relying LLMs to help them is going to make it worse than it already is. reply JohnMakin 1 hour agorootparentI wonder what is going on? I’ve noticed this getting worse for a long time to the point I’m not sure it’s my imagination anymore. I usually like to lambast whole word reading as a complete failure in the american school system that contributes to this, but I think it’s likely something else. Shorter attention spans? reply firesteelrain 2 hours agorootparentprevAgree this is a consequence of people reading too fast and reacting. reply dambi0 11 hours agorootparentprevIsn’t it at least equally likely that one would be more prone to confusion if one was a visual thinker? I don’t think we can infer anythin about how LLMs think based on this. reply TeMPOraL 10 hours agorootparentRight. I'm not claiming the LLM has visual imagination I suspect that OP has it, and that ChatGPT was trained on enough text from visual thinkers implicitly conveying their experience of the world, that it's now able to correctly interpret writing like that of OP's. reply ben_w 8 hours agorootparentIt's a strange feeling, watching the AI get better at language comprehension than me. I made a similar mistake on the original comment as you (I read it as \"Ulbricht returned to the cafe, he actually sat down right in front of me while I was reading the story about his previous arrest here, and that's when I realised it was the same place\"), and also thought you were saying that you think ChatGPT has a visual \"imagination\" inside. (I don't know if it does or doesn't, but given the \"o\" in \"4o\" is supposed to make it multi-modal, my default assumption is that 4o can visualise things… but then, that's also my default assumption about humans, and you being aphantasic shows this is not necessarily so). reply Sophira 8 hours agorootparentprevAs a visual thinker myself, I was also confused by how the story was presented. ChatGPT did better than me. reply Applejinx 7 hours agorootparentYou could also say that ChatGPT erred similarly to the original writer, who was unclear and misleading about events. We needn't act like they share some grand enlightenment. It's just not well expressed. ChatGPT's output is also frequently not well expressed and not well thought out. reply TeMPOraL 6 hours agorootparentThere's many more ways to err than to get something right. ChatGPT getting OP right where many people here didn't tells us it's more likely that there is a particular style of writing/thinking that is not obvious to everyone, but ChatGPT can identify and understand, rather than just both OP and ChatGPT accidentally making exactly the same error. reply Applejinx 3 hours agorootparentWhy would that be more likely? Seems like OP and ChatGPT (which is just many people of different skill levels) might easily make the same failure to communicate. Many failures of ChatGPT are failures to communicate or to convey structured thinking. reply hackinthebochs 8 hours agorootparentprevFeel the AGI reply mod50ack 5 hours agorootparentprevOne, ChatGPT isn't a \"visualizer.\" Two, I have aphantasia and didn't picture anything. I got it the first time without any confusion. Are you seriously asking ChatGPT to read things for you? No wonder your reading comprehension is cooked. Don't blame aphantasia. reply beacon294 3 hours agorootparentReducing any judgment out of your comment, you have to admit that the commenter's action was a successful comprehension strategy they learned from and can use in the future without chatgpt. reply blooalien 14 hours agorootparentprevOkay, that's actually pretty wild. I totally misunderstood too, but the response from the \"AI\" does indeed \"clear it up\" for me. A bit surprised actually, but then again, I suppose I shouldn't be, since language is what those \"large language models\" are all about after all... :) reply babkayaga 12 hours agorootparentIndeed. But their is something surprising here, however. people like chomsky would present examples like this for decades as untracktable by any algorithm, and as a proof that language is a uniquely human thing. they went as far as to claim that humans have a special language organ, somewhere in their brain perhaps. turns out, a formula exists, it is just very very large. reply TuringTest 12 hours agorootparent> chomsky would present examples like this for decades as untracktable by any algorithm, and as a proof that language is a uniquely human thing Generatove AI has all but solved the Frame Problem. Those expressions where intractable bc of the impossibility to represent in logic all the background knowledge that is required to understand the context. It turns out, it is possible to represent all that knowledge in compressed form, with statistical summarisation applied to humongous amounts of data and processing power, unimaginable back then; this puts the knowledge in reach of the algorithm processing the sentence, which is thus capable of understanding the context. reply TeMPOraL 11 hours agorootparentWhich should be expected, because since human brain is finite, it follows that it's either possible to do it, or the brain is some magic piece of divine substrate to which laws of physics do not apply. The problem turned out to be that some people got so fixated on formal logic they apparently couldn't spot that their own mind does not do any kind of symbolic reasoning unless forced to by lots of training and willpower. reply overu589 3 hours agorootparentThat’s not what it means at all. You threw a monkey in your own wrench. The brain has infinite potentials, however only finite resolves. So you can only play a finite number of moves in a game of infinite infinities. Individual minds have varying mental technology, our mental technologies change and adapt to challenges (not always in real time.) thus these infinite configurations create new potentials that previously didn’t exist in the realm of potential without some serious mental vectoring. Get it? You were just so sure of yourself you canceled your own infinite potentials! Remember, it’s only finite after it happens. Until then it’s potential. reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agorootparent> The brain has infinite potentials No, it doesn't. The brain has a finite number of possible states to be in. It's an absurdly large amount of states, but it is finite. And, out of those absurd but finite number of possible states, only a tiny fraction correspond to possible states potentially reachable by a functioning brain. The rest of them are noise. reply erehweb 12 hours agorootparentprevHuge amounts of data and processing power are arguably the foundation for the \"Chinese room\" thought experiment. reply ben_w 7 hours agorootparentI never bought into Searle's argument with the Chinese room. The rules for translation are themselves the result of intelligence; when the thought experiment is made real (I've seen an example on TV once), these rules are written down by humans, using human intelligence. A machine which itself generates these rules from observation has at least the intelligence* that humans applied specifically in the creation of documents expressing the same rules. That a human can mechanically follow those same rules without understanding them, says as much and as little as the fact that the DNA sequences within the neurones in our brains are not themselves directly conscious of higher level concepts such as \"why is it so hard to type 'why' rather than 'wju' today?\" despite being the foundation of the intelligence process of natural selection and evolution. * well, the capability — I'm open to the argument that AI are thick due to the need for so many more examples than humans need, and are simply making up for it by being very very fast and squeezing the equivalent of several million years of experiences for a human into a month of wall-clock time. reply Nevermark 4 hours agorootparentI didn’t buy that argument at all either. Minds shuffle information. Including about themselves. Paper with information being shuffled by rules exhibiting intelligence and awareness of “self” is just ridiculously inefficient. Not inherently less capable. reply dambi0 11 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think I understand this entirely. The point of the thought experiment is to assume the possibility of the room and consider the consequences. How it might be achievable in practice doesn’t alter this reply erehweb 10 hours agorootparentThe room is possible because there's someone inside with a big list of rules of what Chinese characters to reply with. This represents the huge amount of data processing and statistical power. When the thought expt was created, you could argue that the room was impossible, so the experiment was meaningless. But that's no longer the case. reply dambi0 10 hours agorootparentif you go and s/Chinese Room/LLM against any of the counter arguments to the thought experiment how many of them does it invalidate? reply erehweb 10 hours agorootparentI'm not sure I'm following you. My comment re Chinese room was that parent said the data processing we now have was unimaginable back in the day. In fact, it was imaginable the Chinese room imagined it. reply dambi0 8 hours agorootparentI was responding to the point that the thought experiment was meaningless. reply racl101 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah, whoosh for me. reply alwa 14 hours agoparentprevJust as an additional datapoint, since I’m confused by fellow commenters’ confusion—I thought your narrative was clear, colorful, and entertaining, and I hope you’ll keep things so literary and engaging in your future contributions too :) As with so many matters of crime, punishment, and high dudgeon, the physical reality of the situation always feels so banal. Dread Pirate Roberts’ lawless dark kingdom, where he commissions trans-national assassinations… looks a lot like a nerdy dude’s laptop on a municipal library table. reply pests 10 hours agorootparentYes, I thought it was an interesting blend of past and present. If this were a scene in a show or movie it could be edited beautifully the reader, sitting alone in a corner, looks up and in a lucid, almost psychedelic way, the past comes to life with Ulbrict sitting in front of him, that unfold as he continues reading. reply Nevermark 4 hours agorootparentprevUntil you looked over his shoulder at his Bitcoin account balance rising dramatically in real time.

The first paragraph kind of lines up with you reading about it. But the second one is kind of confusing, and I think it's because \"then\" can mean two different things here. You meant \"at the time of his arrest\". If you casually read it without cross referencing the first paragraphs context, you might think it means \"as I was sitting there\". And there's nothing in the following sentences that corrects this garden path assumption. >Then Ulbricht walked into the public library and sat down at the table directly in front of me Would not confuse as many if you wrote >At the time of his arrest Ulbricht walked into the public library and sat down at the table directly in front of me Or even clearer >At the time of his arrest Ulbricht had walked into the public library and sat down at the table which was now directly in front of me reply johnfn 2 hours agorootparentWow, you've totally cracked the mystery.

We lived in the neighborhood (Glen Park one of the \"gems\" of San Francisco) and the downtown is almost like a little village (except with California levels of traffic and trash). It was a bit weird to think that my kids were probably reading books while this guys was, uh, transacting his business nearby. reply ews 11 hours agoparentprevI used to live in Glen Park at that time and I vividly remember seeing Ross working as a cashier at the Canyon Market, helping me bag my groceries. It was probably around the time he was starting the Silk Road. The place where he was arrested was also my favorite table at the Public Library, where I used to go work. It is incredible to be that close to history. reply Henchman21 30 minutes agoparentprevLiteracy and nuance is hard with written words — especially when a large chunk of your audience is either a non-native English speaker or and Adderall addict. I feel like this community is heavily laden with both, and surely there must be some significant overlap between those groups.

This part makes your comment super confusing.

Alternatively, they are themselves Ross Ulbricht, describing an out-of-body fever dream or post-traumatic flashback. This seems ... somewhat less likely. reply InDubioProRubio 11 hours agorootparentnext [10 more] [flagged] vidarh 9 hours agorootparentSingular \"they\" dates at least back as far as the 14th century, and I've yet to meet a person who objects to it but does not use it themselves now and again without even noticing if you observe them speak enough. It's entirely integral to English. The interlude during which some pushed for \"they\" to be exclusively plural, was a mere brief blip in the history of the language. It's also a couple of centuries older than singular \"you\", so if you want to complain about a pronoun changing between singular and plural, that's a better candidate. reply defrost 11 hours agorootparentprevIn commonwealth english \"they\" can and frequently does work to indicate a singular person.

That way you are leaving some ambiguity, but are not directly lying with the tenses. reply pineaux 10 hours agorootparentWell, a lot of times the audience is to blame... There are many people that are stupid, aren't trained in style figures of writing or just not trained in reading in a way that allows for complex conceptual frameworks. It also happens in software: someone writes great code, it's very complex and some people don't understand it and blame the author of writing unreadable code. Its easy to call something unreadable if you don't understand what it's saying. Let me bring it differently: it takes two to tango. I found his story interesting and engaging. Let me bring it in another way: Sometimes the joke is brilliant, but the audience just doesn't understand it. It's not a bad joke or a bad comedian. It's a bad audience. To go into the meat of this: he is imagining it while reading in the same location as the incident happened. This is a style of writing. It's definitely not wrong. reply oneeyedpigeon 9 hours agorootparentTo paraphrase the asshole quote: \"if one person misunderstands you, that's their fault; if everyone does, it's yours\". The same goes for your comedian analogy: sure, you can tell a brilliant joke in French to a Chinese audience, but why? reply Dylan16807 14 hours agorootparentprevI think you could have told it as experiencing the events without making your post confusing, but you'd have to redo your first paragraph. Your first paragraph is external, meta, and places his arrest in your past, which throws off the effect when that suddenly changes in the next sentence. It's not the audience's fault that that is hard to parse. reply oneeyedpigeon 9 hours agorootparentprev> it seems I overestimated my audience I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt, somebody who aspires to be a better writer.

Personally, for nearly three decades I thought the ability to vividly experience a book this way was just some overused and extremely exaggerated metaphor and then I discovered aphantasia is a thing, and I score close to top of its severity scale. So perhaps it's less about your starting point, and more about describing a frame of mind some in the audience don't have, and can't relate to. Curiously, I don't recall ever seeing this particular style of writing before, in any of the books I ever read. reply ipaddr 12 hours agorootparentprevI found it interesting and could visualize you as you were visualizing it while reading.

Yes, of course vendors could have also attempted to infiltrate these forums. But as enough of these functions were provided by/for the community, the profit incentive tilts. If you ran a vendor account on the Silk Road, your effort was better spent maintaining/improving good infosec and mail/postal security. Some techniques they developed were quite innovative, the professionalism was evident. Ross’s story is fascinating and tragic as everything that’s said for and against his character is generally true. Silk Road was built on naive yet admirable ideals.

I've never argued that Ross shouldn't have served time but it's always been clear his prosecution and sentencing were excessive and unjust. The prosecutors asked for a 20 year sentence, which seemed disproportionate given the sentencing guidelines for a first-time offender and the non-violent charges he was convicted of. But the judge sentenced Ross to TWO life sentences plus 40 years without the possibility of parole. There's no doubt Ross made a series of unwise and reckless decisions but serving over ten years of hard time in a FedMax prison is more than enough given the charges and his history. It's just unfortunate that Trump, and now, excessive pardons are politically polarized, which could cloud the fact that justice was done today. I don't credit Trump in any way for doing \"the right thing\" or even having a principled position regarding Ross' case. Clearly, others with influence on Trump convinced him to sign it.

Like, ehh, okay? To be honest, I don't really understand much of the logic (\"logic\") of the US justice system.... reply mrandish 14 hours agorootparentJudges are allowed to consider some evidence during sentencing which was not presented at trial. The standard for this evidence is lower than the \"beyond a shadow of doubt\" standard required for a criminal conviction. This is allowed because during sentencing the judge is considering information related to the history and character of the defendant. The 'hiring an online hitman' (who was an FBI informant) allegation was never charged or tried. Even if it hadn't been obvious entrapment, it might well have evaporated under discovery and cross-examination by a competent defense. Including such evidence in sentencing consideration is not uncontroversial in the U.S. However, it can cut both ways, in that a judge can consider extenuating circumstances in a defendant's life to reduce sentencing. We want judges to evaluate cases and make sentencing adjustments where appropriate. So, I don't think I'd do away with the practice. The real issue is that this specific judge went absolutely bonkers far beyond the 20 years the prosecution asked for during sentencing (which was already very high) and sentenced Ross to two life sentences plus 40 years without parole. Most of us who are happy that Ross was pardoned agree that he was guilty and deserved a jail sentence for the crimes he was convicted of. The only problem is the sentence was so wildly excessive for a non-violent, first-time offender. Compared to guidelines and other sentences it was just crazy and wrong.

That's probably about right. reply butlike 12 minutes agorootparentOn the one hand you say we should retain judges making sentencing adjustments where appropriate, but who judges the appropriateness of the adjustments?

Going after Craigslist has had a negative effect on our cities and has increased crime, and I suspect going after SilkRoad has had a similar impact. reply munificent 33 minutes agoparent> getting prostitutes off the streets. By this, do you mean \"reducing the total amount of prostitution occurring\" or \"making prostitution less visible\"? Your third paragraph implies the former, but I suspect the answer is actually the latter. There is probably less total prostition now, but what's there is more visible. You talk about \"increased crime\" in reference to pimp shootouts, but you know prostitution and sex trafficking are crimes too, right? If thousands of women and girls are suffering but you can't see it because it's all organized online, that's not necessarily better. reply cogman10 15 hours agoparentprevI wish instead of criminalizing addiction we'd fund harm reduction centers and rehabilitation services. I would much rather the police be focused on stopping violent crime rather than these victimless crimes. Legitimizing drugs/prostitution makes is easier to regulate and ultimately make safer.

Rather than decriminalising they're just enabling users. Look towards other countries with similar policies (Portugal, Netherlands, etc.) in their cases they saw a decrease in drug usage and fatalities.

The contraband and services offered on these marketplaces has always been backed by criminal enterprises.

I had friends who were affected by the crackdown on craigslist etc. reply bloudermilk 10 hours agorootparentI sincerely didn't mean to minimize the harm to sex workers, which is devastating. My point is rather that an online marketplace in the absence of decriminalization and reform can only provide a marginal increase in safety. Sex workers marketing on Backpage, Craigslist, Onlyfans, and IG still face a great deal of risk of violence, pressure from pimps, and prosecution by law enforcement. It's a deeply complex systematic issue which can't be fixed by a website. For drugs in particular, darknet marketplaces primarily rely on unspeakably violent criminal enterprises upstream. The consumers, sellers, and communities implicated in this supply chain are all losers in this system. The cartels are the winners and the global \"war on drugs\" establishment are a close second place. reply joe_the_user 50 minutes agorootparentI sympathize with the call for decriminalization. Still, in the case of sex work, I think you are simply wrong. Your overall sketch is the \"movie version\" or police/puritanical version of sex work, a version that equates trafficking and voluntary transactions (not that those transactions can't exploitative in other ways). The majority sex work isn't filled with violence except on the level of the literal street. Notably, my friends and acquaintances who used Craigslist back in the day didn't deal with any pimps and a moment's thought would show pimps are only needed when someone sells sex at a physical location. Also, afaik, onlyfans is a virtual only platform so workers there face the same physical dangers as people on zoom calls. Drugs is a more complex beast. reply idunnoman1222 1 hour agorootparentprevWell, the cartels own most of the avocados so why don’t you think about that next time you go shopping? reply brohee 10 hours agorootparentprevIllegal online marketplaces absolutely do reduce \"turf wars\". It's argueable that there is harm reduction compared to street dealing. Then I suspect it creates new consumers so there is that too. reply aftbit 14 hours agorootparentprevAsk an actual sex worker what they think about that. reply anon84873628 14 hours agorootparentprevSure, but the point is about secondary effects. If pimps are \"competing\" online then they need to compete on, well, marketing and UX. If they compete in real life then it is about who controls physical territory.

If that sale goes through, should eBay be taken down since they operate a marketplace where unsafe products are being sold ? eBay cannot reasonably test every single item that is sold through their platform. Same goes for every second hand marketplace in the world. They need to take some measure to address this, but cannot reduce the risk to 0. As far as I know, SilkRoad had a whole reputation system in place to allow users to flag untrustworthy sellers; that system was inline or even ahead of what many \"legal\" marketplace had put in place. A part of why SilkRoad was so successful is precisely because overall that reputation system allowed users to identify trustworthy sellers. reply echoangle 4 hours agorootparentEbay tries to prevent you from selling illegal stuff though.

As someone running a market where buyers and sellers meet I think it's valid to let the buyers and sellers participate in the exchange among themselves at their own risk.

Whether I agree with it or not, the law often recognises differences like this. It's not illegal to lie, but it is illegal to lie in the aid a murder. The lier themselves might not be a murderer, but the lier is knowingly facilitating murder. Ulbricht was knowingly facilitating crime in the case, and sometimes this crime would result in the deaths of people. And despite knowing all this he took no action to address it. Perhaps your point was he just didn't deserve the sentence he receive, which is fair, but he clearly did something that most people would consider very wrong. I also wonder how people would feel if Silkroad was associated more with the trading of humans, CSAM, biological weapons or more serious things rather than just drugs. I doubt the \"he's just running a marketplace\" reasoning would hold in most people's eyes then. reply throwawaythekey 11 hours agorootparentprevAs an Australian who had friends who bought product on silk road my understanding was: 1) It's safer to buy something online and have it mailed to your house than go pick it up from some shady dude. 2) On the street you would often get duds or spiked product, online reputations were built up over time and important to be maintained (think uber/ebay stars).

That said, I do think he absolutely deserved to be released, not because he didn't deserve to be locked up in the first place, but because he's clearly been rehabilitated and has done great work during his time in prison.

The problem here being that it was money spent that was never earned back, and money that eventually had to be paid back, right? This can also happen with private capital. 2008 was a bust caused by private banks, for example. AI hasn't proven to be profitable yet [1], and I'm not sure it'll makes a difference, for the success of projects like this, wether the money is coming from government or not.

In part. It was money borrowed by the state. That means when it can't be paid back, it's automatically a systemic issue. And it was money borrowed to fund consumption. There was no good reason to ever expect it to be paid back because it wasn't funding productive activity. > if this turns out to be a bubble it will be taxpayers who end up fronting the bill Very possibly, particularly if part of the package are e.g. federally-subsidised loans. Before that, however, private parties will almost certainly lose tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars. That cushion, together with those parties being spread between domestic and foreign sources, is what makes this less risky to the United States than similar relative-magnitude projects in South America.

Centralized planning doesn't fail because of government bureaucrats, it fails because there is too much spending to be decided on by too few people.

This isn't a single corp, it is multiple corps. For a sense of scale, MSFT alone spent ~$55B in Capex last year. Check out this[1] for a sense of how much different industries spend each year. Note that this will cross several industries including Power, Telecom, Software, electrical equip, etc. 2. There is no commitment to spend in a single year 3. There is no actual contractual commit here, this is a press release (i.e. Marketing) 4. There is not actually a $500B pile of gold being spent.

Sounds pretty centralized to me. The fact that a handful of individuals have half a trillion dollars to throw at something that may or may not work while working people can pay the price of a decent used car each year, every year to their health insurance company only to have claims denied is insane. reply JumpCrisscross 2 hours agorootparent> fact that a handful of individuals have half a trillion dollars This is disputed [1]. In reality, a handful of individuals have the capital to seed a half-a-trillion dollar megaproject, which then entails the project to raise capital from more people.

Also the guy disputing it is trying to regain control of an entity that he was too distracted to hold to its original mission, is on record as agreeing with the statement that Jewish people are the enemies of white people, takes copious amounts of mind-altering substances daily, has lost billions of dollars on purchasing a company that had a path to (modest) profitability, and did what could easily be seen as a Roman salute at an inauguration speech. Maybe he's not a great source of statements on objective reality, even within the AI industry. With regard to the monetary amount, understand, once you reach a certain point, the amount of capital held by the quantity of individuals we're talking about is immaterial. Any capital they raise is usually derived from the labor of others and they operate a racket to prevent any real competition for how that capital is distributed by the labor or the customers who are the source of their actual wealth. The average Oracle employee (I know a few), for example, probably has a few more immediate things they want the surplus value of their labor to be spent on than Larry's moonshot. However, he ultimately controls the direction of that value through a shareholder system that he can manipulate more-or-less at-will through splits, buybacks, and other practices. His customers would probably also like to pay less for what are usually barely Web 2.0 database applications. Of course, he has the capital to corner markets and shove competition out of the space. All of this is to say when you reach this amount of money in the hands of one individual, they're more likely to regularly harm people than beat the odds on their next bet in a way that actually uplifts society, at least in a way that could beat the way just disbursing that capital among those who created it could. reply tanseydavid 2 minutes agorootparent>> takes copious amounts of mind-altering substances daily Hyperbole much? JumpCrisscross 57 minutes agorootparentprev> disputed by the guy who has a business interest in making sure his competition can't do as well This is a valid conflict of interest.

This is more like a \"promise\" to invest a few $B and then continue to invest more and more if things go well reply whimsicalism 2 hours agorootparentprevFree movement of capital and the ability to identify promising projects and allocate our resources there are why our society is prosperous and why we are able to devote more resources towards healthcare than any society that has ever come before us. This money is managed by small amounts of people but it is aggregated from millions of investors, most of these are public companies. The US spends over 10x that amount on healthcare each year. reply lenerdenator 2 hours agorootparentIs that why I, and a lot of other people my age, have a lower standard of living than my parents did at the same point in their lives? The \"free movement of capital\" only ever seems to move the capital one direction: up to the people who needed the labor of others to reach such wealth. reply whimsicalism 2 hours agorootparentThe large majority of people do not have a lower standard of living than their parents at the same age.

Which is kind of proving my point. reply JumpCrisscross 1 hour agorootparent> Age-adjusted?...So if you take out the fact that it took up more of the one resource that matters more than anything else to become property owners Ask before assuming. Age adjusted means taking each generation when they were the same age, how wealthy were they? A Boomer today is wealthier than a Millenial because they've had more time to accumulate. But when a Boomer was Millenial-aged, she had on average less wealth than a Millenial today. reply lenerdenator 54 minutes agorootparentWealth is the preponderance of resources. If you have more wealth, you can theoretically purchase more goods and services than if you had less. The exception to this, of course, is if the goods and services cost more, and for things that you need to exist in American society (healthcare, education, transportation, housing, food), those things generally cost several times more for younger people than they did, \"age-adjusted\", when their parents were the same age, often with a difference that is more than that in wealth. That's why wages have been flat. There's also the question of how that wealth is distributed among the generations and how it's stored. If the property-owning Millennial owns a few rental properties that their peers have to pay to live in, the \"average\" properties owned by the group can be the same (or even higher) but the number of people those properties are spread among is lower. There's also the fact that lots of wealth is held in the casin... er... stock markets as people need to participate in those markets with their 401(k)s to be able to retire some day. You can't sleep in a stock certificate, but if you want to have any savings, it's easier to enter the equities market than it is to get into real estate from a startup cost perspective.

This is an argument for Millenials being even better off than the statistics show. > People are having to compromise the \"stability\" of their fundamental needs (like housing) in order to grow more abstract definitions of wealth Yes.

I disagree with the grandparent. They don't support Trump because they do not want to be on his bad side (well, at least not only that), they support Trump because they see the opportunity to suppress regulation worldwide and become more powerful than governments.

And in this, the amount of public simping is really weird to what usually happens, everybody praising Trump even before he was taking office, and even tiktok, \"coming out\" as whatever etc. Oligarchs want less regulation, but they also want these beefy government contracts.

So far the US just kicks that can down the road so... reply vtashkov 3 hours agorootparentThat is a big assumption. Tax money need not be a constant. But for the sake of following the same logic: if companies pay bigger taxes, they also have to make up the shortfall. Actually, this last one is much more accurate statement. Companies do not pay taxes, PEOPLE pay taxes. So taxes are paid either by the employees, the clients or by the owners (which in case of the big tech are generally common people). With high taxation you are hurting: the customers, the workers and the middle class saving for their retirement. Who is winning the tax money: state bureaucracy, corrupt politicians and the business around them, people who live like parasites (or rather are forced to live like that, because they are electoral power). reply mattlutze 5 hours agorootparentprevTax breaks, i.e. a company extracting wealth from a community without paying into the systems that keep all the parts of that community running, forcing the community to ultimate subsidize that business's weath extraction from them. reply vtashkov 4 hours agorootparentCompanies do not extract value, they create value which is then transferred to the people via the market through voluntary exchange (ideally).

If 1000 people go to a deserted island with no government and taxation would that mean the inflation will be plus infinity or at least very high??? Inflation is monetary phenomenon, it happens when money is being printed. reply shoxidizer 3 hours agorootparentIn that case there would be no inflation or deflation, assuming a fixed money supply and no economic growth. However, the the key here is that the government, the federal government anyways, is spending money regardless of the tax break. Anytime the government writes a check, that's a little bit more money floating around; anytime the government collects some money, such as taxes, there's that much less money to be had. Every tax break causes the money supply to increase more relative to if the tax break did not exist, causing more inflation (or less deflation, if that were the case). If the government spent exactly as much as it taxed, then there would be... actually deflation, because the economy is growing. This is the basics of fiscal policy. There's also the monetary policy, which is when the federal reserve does this on purpose. The general principle is the same, but instead it spends its money buying bonds and gets its money selling those bonds, and creates a bunch of rules about where banks keep their money so it always has some money on hand. reply vtashkov 3 hours agorootparentSo, in this desert there would be no inflation or deflation, you say. Let’s say we use gold coins there. Wouldn’t we have an inflation if we find a gold mine there and everybody start digging up gold? You are missing the fact that the money printing is not driven only by government spending. It is driven primarily by the monetary policy (in the hands of the FED) and to some extent by the government debt. You have knowledge gaps on a very basic level. The idea that taxation stops inflation is absolutely ridiculous. It would mean that countries with low taxes have very high inflation and this is not the case. It would also means that the inflation should be constant and in struct correlation with the taxes. Both statements are completely false and very easily provable by quick fact check. The only things taxes do are: misplacing capital and stopping economic growth, which may be the same thing arguably reply shoxidizer 2 hours agorootparent> It is driven primarily by the monetary policy Yeah, that's why I mentioned the fed. > It would mean that countries with low taxes have very high inflation and this is not the case. It's about the total balance of government spending and taxes. The point being made is that tax breaks have the same effect as government spending. Recall that I was replying to > Tax breaks, i.e. my money not being in your pocket means that they are stolen? The government writing someone a million dollar check and the government giving someone a million dollar tax break (assuming they pay at least a million in taxes), contribute to inflation by increasing the money supply by a million dollars than it would be otherwise. Yes, this federal reserve is by far a larger driver of inflation, but the government giving this tax break still degrades the value of your money, same as if they wrote a check. Of course, it is easy to view a tax break as a non-action, but that's exactly why the government gives so many tax breaks. Once you're taxing everyone, you can hand out tax breaks that's the same as handing out money only you can pretend that it's doing nothing. Think of it as 3 Scenarios: 1) The island government writes a check to everyone except you, increasing their wealth by 50%. 2) The island government taxes just you for 50% of your wealth. 3) The island government taxes everyone 75% of their wealth, grants everyone but you a total tax-break, and you 25 percentage point tax break. Basically the same result, only in one they say \"It was fair, and we handed out a few tax-breaks, what's wrong with letting people keep their money?\" reply vtashkov 0 minutes agorootparent1) wealth is not increased by tax break, only current income is increased 2) if government gives everyone tax break but not me, it means only that the government taxes only me 3) if everyone has 50% more money, there is very high probability that my business will go up A LOT Seriously, dude, it’s not worthy anymore to try and explain to you very basic stuff. Inflation is not a balance between taxation and spending. All Middle Eastern countries are having huge spending and almost zero taxes. I asked you very simple question and you couldn’t answer. What bothers me most is why people write about things they have no clue about and clearly haven’t even put a decent thought into it. Basically what you believe in is that the thieves are controlling the inflation because they get some of the citizens wealth. lupire 5 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you think NASA does with the money?

My post that you responded to set my premise which was that China has its own form of colonialism that is quite different than Americas but it exists and it’s quite strong. To classify China as a peaceful loving nation that respects other cultures is as if we were saying the US has never started a conflict. It’s factually a lie.

This is basically OpenAI matching the major cloud provider's spending. This could also be (at least partly) a reaction to Microsoft threatening to pull OpenAI's cloud credits last year. OpenAI wants to maintain independence and with compute accounting for 25–50% of their expenses (currently) [2], this strategy may actually be prudent.

Does OpenAI have similar revenue numbers to Microsoft? reply tuvang 19 hours agorootparentOpenAI has a very healthy revenue stream in the form of other companies throwing money at them. But to answer your question, no they aren’t even profitable by themselves. reply manquer 19 hours agorootparent> they aren’t even profitable Depends on your definition of profitability, They are not recovering R&D and training costs, but they (and MS) are recouping inference costs from user subscription and API revenue with a healthy operating margin. Today they will not survive if they stop investing in R&D, but they do have to slow down at some point. It looks like they and other big players are betting on a moat they hope to build with the $100B DCs and ASICs that open weight models or others cannot compete with. This will be either because training will be too expensive (few entities have the budget for $10B+ on training and no need to monetize it) and even those kind of models where available may be impossible to run inference with off the shelf GPUs, i.e. these models can only run on ASICS, which only large players will have access to[1]. In this scenario corporations will have to pay them the money for the best models, when that happens OpenAI can slow down R&D and become profitable with capex considered. [1] This is natural progression in a compute bottle-necked sector, we saw a similar evolution from CPU to ASICS and GPU in the crypto few years ago. It is slightly distorted comparison due to the switch from PoW to PoS and intentional design for GPU for some coins, even then you needed DC scale operations in a cheap power location to be profitable. reply enragedcacti 49 minutes agorootparent> but they (and MS) are recouping inference costs from user subscription and API revenue with a healthy operating margin. As far as I am aware the only information from within OpenAI one way or another is from their financial documents circulated to investors: > The fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products. Subscriptions are the lions share of their revenue (73%). It's possible they are making money on the average Plus or Enterprise subscription but given the above claim they definitely aren't making enough to cover the cost of inference for free users. https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/openai-chatgpt... reply Fade_Dance 18 hours agorootparentprevThey will have an endless wave of commoditization chasing behind them. NVIDIA will continue to market chips to anyone who will buy... Well anyone who is allowed to buy, considering the recent export restrictions. On that note, if OpenAI is in bed with the US government with this to some degree, I would expect tariffs, expert restrictions, and all of that to continue to conveniently align with their business objectives. If the frontier models generate huge revenue from big government and intelligence and corporate contracts, then I can see a dynamo kicking off with the business model. The missing link is probably that there need to be continual breakthroughs that massively increase the power of AI rather than it tapering off with diminishing returns for bigger training/inference capital outlay. Obviously, openAI is leveraging against that view as well. Maybe the most important part is that all of these huge names are involved in the project to some degree. Well, they're all cross-linked in the entire AI enterprise, really, like OpenAI Microsoft, so once all the players give preference to each other, it sort of creates a moat in and of itself, unless foreign sovereign wealth funds start spinning up massive stargate initiatives as well. We'll see. Europe has been behind the ball in tech developments like this historically, and China, although this might be a bit of a stretch to claim, does seem to be held back by their need for control and censorship when it comes to what these models can do. They want them to be focused tools that help society, but the American companies want much more, and they want power in their own hands and power in their user's hands. So much like the first round where American big tech took over the world, maybe it's prime to happen again as the AI industry continues to scale. reply fragmede 17 hours agorootparentWhy would China censoring Tiananmen Square/whatever out of their LLMs be anymore harmful to the training process when the US controlled LLMs also censor certain topics, eg \"how do I make meth?\" or \"how do I make a nuclear bomb?\". reply vaccineai 17 hours agorootparentBecause China censors very common words and phrases such as \"harmonized\", \"shameless\", \"lifelong\", \"river crabbed\", \"me too\".

They have made the business decision to reduce the usefulness of their AI to prevent their liability from being legally, or even socially, held accountable. Again, consider my example about YouTube it's not illegal for Google to put pornography on YouTube.

This is probably fundamental. That said, this is also not helped by the fact that all of the default interfaces lack many essential features, so you have to build the interface yourself. Neither \"clear the context on every attempt\" nor \"reuse the context repeatedly\" will give good results, but having one context producing just one-line summaries, then fresh contexts expanding each one will do slightly less badly.

But those say what’s in the commit. The commit diff already tells you that. The best commit messages IMO tell you why you did it and what value was delivered. I think it’s gonna be hard for an LLM to do that since that context lives outside the code. But maybe it would, if you hook it to e.g. a ticketing system and include relevant tickets so it can grab context. For instance, in your first example, why was that change needed? It was a fix, but for what issue? In the second message: why was that a desirable change? reply rane 5 hours agorootparentMost of the time you are not able to fit the \"Why?\" in the summary.

This was my favorite talk at Strange Loop (including my own). reply azhenley 22 hours agoprevMicrosoft published a paper on their FLAME model (60M parameters) for Excel formula repair/completion which outperformed much larger models (>100B parameters). https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13779 reply coder543 15 hours agoparentThat paper is from over a year ago, and it compared against codex-davinci... which was basically GPT-3, from what I understand. Saying >100B makes it sound a lot more impressive than it is in today's context... 100B models today are a lot more capable. The researchers also compared against a couple of other ancient(/irrelevant today), small models that don't give me much insight. FLAME seems like a fun little model, and 60M is truly tiny compared to other LLMs, but I have no idea how good it is in today's context, and it doesn't seem like they ever released it. reply aDyslecticCrow 30 minutes agorootparentI would like to disagree with its being irrelevant. If anything, the 100B models are irrelevant in the context and should be seen as a \"fun inclusion\" rather than a serious addition worth comparing against. It out-performing a 100B model at the time becomes a fun bragging point, but it's not the core value of the method or paper. Running a prompt against every single cell of a 10k row document was never gonna happen with a large model. Even using a transformer model architecture in the first place can be seen as ludicrous overkill but feasible on modern machines. So I'd say the paper is very relevant, and the top commenter in this very thread demonstrated their own homegrown version with a very nice use-case (paper abstract and title sorting for making a summary paper) reply coder543 24 minutes agorootparent> Running a prompt against every single cell of a 10k row document was never gonna happen with a large model That isn’t the main point of FLAME, as I understood it. The main point was to help you when you’re editing a particular cell. codex-davinci was used for real time Copilot tab completions for a long time, I believe, and editing within a single formula in a spreadsheet is far less demanding than editing code in a large document. After I posted my original comment, I realized I should have pointed out that I’m fairly sure we have 8B models that handily outperform codex-davinci these days… further driving home how irrelevant the claim of “>100B” was here (not talking about the paper). Plus, an off the shelf model like Qwen2.5-0.5B (a 494M model) could probably be fine tuned to compete with (or dominate) FLAME if you had access to the FLAME training data — there is probably no need to train a model from scratch, and a 0.5B model can easily run on any computer that can run the current version of Excel. You may disagree, but my point was that claiming a 60M model outperforms a 100B model just means something entirely different today. Putting that in the original comment higher in the thread creates confusion, not clarity, since the models in question are very bad compared to what exists now. No one had clarified that the paper was over a year old until I commented… and FLAME was being tested against models that seemed to be over a year old even when the paper was published. I don’t understand why the researchers were testing against such old models even back then. reply andai 21 hours agoparentprevThis is wild. They claim it was trained exclusively on Excel formulas, but then they mention retrieval? Is it understanding the connection between English and formulas?

Getting the speed gains is hard unless you are able to pay for dedicated GPUs. Some services offer LoRA as serverless but you don't get the same performance for various technical reasons. 2. Lack of talent to actually do the finetuning. Regular engineers can do a lot of LLM implementation, but when it comes to actually performing training it is a scarcer skillset. Most small to medium orgs don't have people who can do it well. 3. Distribution. Sharing finetunes is hard. HuggingFace exists, but discoverability is an issue. It is flooded with random models with no documentation and it isn't easy to find a good oen for your task. Plus, with a good finetune you also need the prompt and possibly parsing code to make it work the way it is intended and the bundling hasn't been worked out well. reply grisaitis 3 hours agoparentwhen you say fine-tuning skills or talent are scarce, do you have specific skills in mind? perhaps engineering for training models (eg making model parallelism work)? or the more ML type skills of designing experiments, choosing which methods to use, figuring out datasets for training, hyperparam tuning/evaluation, etc? reply jbentley1 3 hours agorootparentThe technical parts are less common and specialized, like understanding the hyperparameters and all that, but I don't think that is the main problem. Most people don't understand how to build a good dataset or how to evaluate their finetune after training. Some parts of this are solid rules like always use a separate validation set, but the task dependent parts are harder to teach. It's a different problem every time. reply mritchie712 21 hours agoprevI used local LLMs via Ollama for generating H1's / marketing copy. 1. Create several different personas 2.

It doesn't always just give one translation but different options. I can do things like give it a phrase and then ask it to break it down. Or give it a word and if its translation doesn't make sense to me ask how it works in the context of a phrase. llm c, which continues the previous conversation, is specifically useful for that sort of manipulation.

That's something you could train on a 2 GB GPU. The general guidance I've used is that to train a model, you need an amount of RAM (or VRAM) equal to 8x the number of parameters, so a 0.125B model would need 1 GB of RAM to train. reply staticautomatic 19 hours agoparentprevIs that why their tab completion is so bad now? reply sam_lowry_ 7 hours agorootparentHm...

Wechat Group Xiaohongshu X Discord “ Living out everyone’s imagination on creating and manipulating 3D assets.” 🔥 News Jan 21, 2025: 💬 Enjoy exciting 3D generation on our website Hunyuan3D Studio! Jan 21, 2025: 💬 Release inference code and pretrained models of Hunyuan3D 2.0. Jan 21, 2025: 💬 Release Hunyuan3D 2.0. Please give it a try via huggingface space our official site! Abstract We present Hunyuan3D 2.0, an advanced large-scale 3D synthesis system for generating high-resolution textured 3D assets. This system includes two foundation components: a large-scale shape generation model Hunyuan3D-DiT, and a large-scale texture synthesis model Hunyuan3D-Paint. The shape generative model, built on a scalable flow-based diffusion transformer, aims to create geometry that properly aligns with a given condition image, laying a solid foundation for downstream applications. The texture synthesis model, benefiting from strong geometric and diffusion priors, produces high-resolution and vibrant texture maps for either generated or hand-crafted meshes. Furthermore, we build Hunyuan3D-Studio a versatile, user-friendly production platform that simplifies the re-creation process of 3D assets. It allows both professional and amateur users to manipulate or even animate their meshes efficiently. We systematically evaluate our models, showing that Hunyuan3D 2.0 outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including the open-source models and closed-source models in geometry details, condition alignment, texture quality, and e.t.c. ☯ Hunyuan3D 2.0 Architecture Hunyuan3D 2.0 features a two-stage generation pipeline, starting with the creation of a bare mesh, followed by the synthesis of a texture map for that mesh. This strategy is effective for decoupling the difficulties of shape and texture generation and also provides flexibility for texturing either generated or handcrafted meshes.

Case in point, I have a series of photos (48) that capture a small statue. The photos are high quality, the object was on a rotating platform. Lighting is consistent. The background is solid black. These normally are ideal variables for photogrammetry but none of the various common applications and websites do a very good job creating a mesh out of it that isn't super low poly and/or full of holes. I've been casually scanning huggingface for relevant models to try out but haven't really found anything. reply troymc 17 hours agoparentCheck out RealityCapture [1].

If you like the distance field approach, there are also research work [2], to estimate neural unsigned distance fields directly, (kind of a similar way as Gaussian splats). [1] https://github.com/nzfeng/signed-heat-3d [it works but it's research code, so buggy, not user friendly, and mostly on toy problems because complexity explode very quickly when using a grid the number of cells grows as a n^3, and then they solve a sparse linear system on top (so total complexity bounded by n^6), but tolerating approximations and writing things properly practical complexity should be on par with methods like finite element method in Computational Fluid Dynamics.

But I haven't seen much about going from splats to high quality 3D meshes. I've tried one or two with pretty poor results. reply jiggawatts 10 hours agorootparentThere have been a few papers published on the topic, but it's \"early days\". Expect a lot of progress over the next couple of years. reply Elucalidavah 12 hours agoparentprev> the object was on a rotating platform Isn't a static-object-rotating-camera basically a requirement for photogrammetry? reply jdietrich 5 hours agorootparentNo. For small objects, it is typical to use a turntable to rotate the object; there are a number of commercial and DIY turntables with an automated motion system that can trigger the shutter after a specified degree of rotation. reply Mashimo 11 hours agorootparentprevWhy would that make a difference? reply addandsubtract 8 hours agorootparentThe OC mentioned \"static lighting\". If they meant static, while the platform was spinning, then the lighting would be inconsistent, because the object would change lighting with each photo. You would have to fix the lighting to the platform to spin with the object, while taking the pictures to get consistent lighting. reply geuis 2 hours agorootparentI think you just nailed why I have been having a hard time with my photo set. It's the lighting. Well crap, because I don't have access to the statue or studio again. Thanks for the tip. reply SequoiaHope 11 hours agorootparentprevPhotogrammetry generally assumes a fully static scene. If there are static parts of the scene which the camera can see and also rotating parts, the algorithm may struggle to properly match features between images. reply Mashimo 11 hours agorootparenti think it's common to have dots on the rotating disk where the object is placed on. reply SequoiaHope 2 hours agorootparentSure, but if the background has a lot of features it will still confuse the algorithm unless it has some special settings for ignoring the background. reply Joel_Mckay 14 hours agoparentprevCOLMAP + CloudCompare with a good CUDA GPU (more VRAM is better) card will give reasonable results for large textured objects like buildings. Glass/Water/Mirror/Gloss will need coated to scan, dry spray on Dr.scholls foot deodorant seems to work fine for our object scans. There are now more advanced options than Gaussian splatting, and these can achieve normal playback speeds rather than hours of filtering.

Best of luck, =3 reply falloon 17 hours agoparentprevKiri engine is pretty easy to use and just released a good update for their 3DGS pipeline, and they have one of the better 3DGS to mesh options. https://kiri-innovation.github.io/3DGStoMesh2/ reply archerx 11 hours agoparentprev>The background is solid black. >These normally are ideal variables for photogrammetry Actually no, my friend learned this the hard way during a photogrammetry project, he rented a photo studio, and made sure the background were perfectly black and took the photos but the photogrammetry program (Meshroom I think) was struggling to reconstruct the mesh. I did some research and I learned that it uses features in the background to help position itself to make the meshes. So he redid his tests outside with \"messy\" backgrounds and it worked much much better. This was a few years ago so I don't know if things are different now. reply tzumby 17 hours agoparentprevI’m not an expert, only dabbled in photogrammetry, but it seems to me that the crux of that problem is identifying common pixels across images in order to sort of triangulate a point in the 3D space. It doesn’t sound like something an LLM would be good at. reply MikeTheRocker 19 hours agoprevGenerative AI is going to drive the marginal cost of building 3D interactive content to zero. Unironically this will unlock the metaverse, cringe as that may sound. I'm more bullish than ever on AR/VR. reply jsheard 19 hours agoparentI can only speak for myself, but a Metaverse consisting of infinite procedural slop sounds about as appealing as reading infinite LLM generated books, that is, not at all. \"Cost to zero\" implies drinking directly from the AI firehose with no human in the loop (those cost money) and entertainment produced in that manner is still dire, even in the relatively mature field of pure text generation. reply torginus 10 hours agorootparentI think the biggest issue with stable diffusion based approaches has always been poor compositional ability (putting stuff where you want), and compounding anatomical/spatial errors that gave the images an offputting vibe. All these problems are trivially solvable (solved) using traditonal 3d meshes and techniques. reply grumbel 8 hours agorootparentThe issue with composition is only a problem when you rely on a pure text prompt, but has been solved for quite a while by ControlNets or img2img. What was lacking was the integration with existing art tools, but even that is getting solved, e.g. Krita[1] has a pretty nice AI plugin. 3D can be a useful intermediate when editing the 2D image, e.g. Krea has support for that[2]. But I don't think the rest of the traditional 3D pipeline is of much use here, AI image generation already produces images at a quality that traditional rendering just can't keep up with, neither in terms of speed, quality or flexibility. [1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPxOE9YH57E [2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ER5qfoJXd0 reply torginus 7 hours agorootparentWow, those look impressive. But I think we are saying the same thing stable diffusion can make pretty pics, but needs a lot of handholding context. I too have played around with ComfyUI, and while there are a LOT of techniques that allow you to manipulate the image, I have always felt like you were fighting SD. In the videos you've attached, both tools (esp) the first, look impressive, but in the first example, you can clearly see that the model regenerates the street around the chameleon, when the artist changes it for no good reason. In the second example you can see there's a bunch of AI tools under the hood, and they don't work together particularly well, with the car constantly changing as the image changes. I think while a lot of mileage can be extracted from SD as it stands (I could think of a bunch of improvements to what was demonstrated here, by applying existing techniques ) but the fundamental issue remains, in that Stable Diffusion was made to generate whole images at once unlike transformers, which output a single token. Not sure what's the image equivalent of a token is, but I'm sure it'd be feasible to train a model to fill holes which'd be created by Segment Anything or something similar, and it would react better to local edits. reply jkolio 4 hours agorootparentprevBut not consistent state. The pipeline still needs to exist because most games require objects and environments to stay consistent across play sessions. That means generating from a 3D skeleton, at the very least, if not relegating genAI to production, not runtime. reply steinhafen 9 hours agorootparentprevI have tried the model, and I agree with you on the point. A product was uploaded for a test, the output catches the product quite well, but the text on the generated 3D model is unreadable. reply MikeTheRocker 18 hours agorootparentprevIMO current generation models are capable of creating significantly better than \"slop\" quality content. You need only look at NotebookLM output. As models continue to improve, this will only get better. Look at the rate of improvement of video generation models in the last 12-24 months. It's obvious to me we're rapidly approaching acceptable or even excellent quality on-demand generated content. reply jsheard 18 hours agorootparentI feel like you're conflating quality with fidelity. Video generation models have better fidelity than they did a year ago, but they are no closer to producing any kind of compelling content without a human directing them, and the latter is what you would actually need to make the \"infinite entertainment machine\" happen. The fidelity of a video generation model is comparable to an LLMs ability to nail spelling and grammar it's a start, but there's more to being an author than that. reply MikeTheRocker 18 hours agorootparentI already feel like text models are already at sufficiently entertaining and useful quality as you define it. It's definitely possible we never get there for video or 3D modalities, but I think there are strong enough economic incentives such that big tech will dump tens of billions of dollars into achieving it. reply jchw 14 hours agorootparentI don't know why you think that's the case regarding text models. If that was the case, there would be articles on here that are just created by only generative AI and nobody would know the difference. It's pretty obvious that's not happening yet, not the least of which because I know what kinds of slop state-of-the-art generative models still produce when you give them open-ended prompts. reply cma 12 hours agorootparentIronic how this comment exemplifies the issue broad claims about \"slop\" output but no specific examples or engagement with current architectures. Real discussions here usually reference benchmarks or implementation details. (from Claude) reply nilamo 12 hours agorootparentYou're sort of ignoring the issue? If the generated content was good and interesting enough on it's own, we would already have ai publishing houses pushing out entire trilogies, and each of those would be top sellers. Generative content right now is OK. OK isn't really the goal, or what anyone wants. reply jdietrich 7 hours agorootparentI feel like this is missing the point of GenAI. I read fewer books than I did a year ago, primarily because Claude will provide dynamic content that is exactly tailored for me. I don't read many instructional books any more, because I can tell Claude what I already know about a topic and what I'd like to know and it'll create a personalised learning plan. If I don't understand something, it can re-phrase things or find different metaphors until I do. I don't read self-help books written for a general audience, because I can get personalised advice based on my specific circumstances and preferences. The idea of a \"book\" is really just an artifact of a particular means of production and distribution. LLM-generated text is a categorically different thing from a book, in the same way as a bardic poem or hypertext. reply cma 4 hours agorootparentprevFirst it was AI articles, raising it to entire successful book trilogies seems like a much bigger leap. Even considering the largest context windows they wouldn't directly fit and there is much less data to train context of that size on fiction than the data out there for essays and articles. I don't think it is there yet for articles either. My point with the Claude generated comment was maybe it could get pretty close to something like an hn comment. reply jchw 12 hours agorootparentprevI'm sorry I didn't meet the LLMs expectations, but whether something is subjectively entertaining or not can't be exemplified by objective benchmarks. reply modeless 14 hours agorootparentprevNotebookLM is still slop. I recommend feeding it your resume and any other online information about you. It's kind of fun to hear the hosts butter you up, but since you know the subject well you will quickly notice that it is not faithful to the source material. It's just plausibly misleading. reply deeznuttynutz 18 hours agorootparentprevThis is exactly while I'm building my app now with the expectation that these assets will be exponentially better in the short term. reply jdietrich 17 hours agorootparentprevI can only speak for myself, but a large and growing proportion of the text I read every day is LLM output. If Claude and Deepseek produce slop, then it's a far higher calibre of slop than most human writers could aspire to. reply leoedin 6 hours agorootparentWhat kind of text are you reading? Do you work in LLM development? Or are you just noticing that many news sites are using LLMs more and more? I've noticed obvious LLM output on low quality news sites, but I don't tend to read them anyway. Maybe all the comments I read are from LLMs and I just don't realise? reply jdietrich 5 hours agorootparentPerplexity is now my default search engine. If I'm doing research, I use LLMs to summarise documents or scan through them to find relevant excerpts. If I'm doing general background reading on something, I'll ask an LLM for an explainer; likewise if I've read about one particular thing and want to understand the broader context around it. If I'm thinking through a problem, I'll bat the idea around with Claude or Deepseek, asking them to provide alternative perspectives. It's quite difficult to analogise because LLMs are so profoundly novel, but the best I can do is that it's like having an infinitely patient and extremely knowledgeable assistant. That assistant isn't omniscient or infallible, but it's extremely useful because it tends to provide the information that I want, presented in a way that's particularly relevant to me. That requires a certain amount of rapport-building understanding the characteristics of various models, learning to ask good questions, guiding the model towards my preferences with customised system prompts but the effort pays off handsomely. reply echelon 19 hours agorootparentprevYou're too old and jaded [1].

Those who don't are likely to play Minecraft or Fortnite. Play mediated by the computer in this way is already one of the most popular forms of play. Kids are going to go absolutely nuts for this and if you think otherwise, you really need to talk to some children. reply TeMPOraL 7 hours agorootparentprevScrew Metaverse. Let's make a VR holodeck. Star Trek's Holodeck is actually a good case study here (especially with the recent series, Lower Decks, going as far as making two episodes that are interactive movies on a holodeck, going quite deep into how that could work in practice both in terms of producing and experiencing them). One observation derived here is that infinite procedural content at your fingertip doesn't necessarily kill all meaning, if you bring the meaning with you. The two major use cases[0] for the holodeck are: Multiplayer scenarios in which you and your friends enjoy some experience in a program. The meaning is sourced from your friendship and roleplay; the program may be arbitrary output of an RNG in the global sense, but it's the same for you and your friends, so shared experience (and its importance as a social object) in your group is retained. Single-player simulations that are highly specific. The meaning here comes from whatever is the reason you're simulating that particular experience, and it's connection to the real world. Like idk., a flight simulator of a random space fighter flying over random world shooting at random shit would quickly get boring, but if I can get the simulator to give me a highly accurate cockpit of an F/A-18 Hornet, flying over real terrain and shooting at realistic enemies in realistic (even if fictional) storyline now that would be deeply meaningful to me, because 1) F/A-18 Hornet is a real plane that I would otherwise never experience flying, and 2) I have a crush on this particular fighter because F/A-18 Hornet 3.0 is one of the first videogames I ever played in my life as a kid. Now, to make Metaverse less like bullshit and more like Star Trek, we'd need to make sure the world generation is actually available to the users. No asset stores, no app marketplace bullshit. We live in a multimodal LLM era we already have all the components to do it like Star Trek did it: \"Computer, create a medieval fantasy village, in style of England around year 1400, set next to a forest, with tall mountains visible in the distance\", then walk around that world and tweak the defaults from there.

For example, an AI picture of a bush is not slop, because we don't expect much from a picture of a bush (not aspirational). A hand-drawn picture of a knight in armor by an enthusiastic, but not very skilled artist is not slop either it has tons of details that resolve in an interesting way, and what it lacks in details, it allows the viewers to fill in for themselves. A 'realistic' knight generated by AI is slop it contains no imaginative detail, and allows very little room for personal interpretation, and it's not rewarding to view. Slop doesn't need to be AI creatively bankrupt overproduced garbage counts as slop in my mind as well. reply leoedin 6 hours agorootparent'aspirational and highly detailed content that resolves its details in an uninteresting or nonsensical way'. This is a great definition. All the AI text I read is somehow missing the \"meat\" you find in good writing. All the right parts are there, but the core idea that makes me interested is just missing.

Most human made art is slop too. reply dtn 12 hours agorootparentI think you fundamentally misunderstand what people use \"slop\" to describe. > Most human made art is slop too. I'm assuming you're using the term \"slop\" to describe low-quality, unpolished works, or works where the artist has been too ambitious with their skill level. Let me put it this way: Every piece of art that is made, is a series of decisions. The artist uses their lived experience, their tastes and their values to create something that's meaningful to them. Art doesn't need to have a high-level of technical expertise to be meaningful to others. It's fundamentally about communication from artists to their audience. To this point, I don't believe there's such a thing as \"bad art\" (all works have something to say about the artist!). In contrast, when you prompt an image generator, you're handing over the majority of the decisions to the algorithm. You can put in your subject matter, poses, even add styles, but how much is really being communicated here? Undoubtedly it would require a high level of technical skill to render similarly by hand, but that's missing the forest for the trees what is the image saying? There's a reason why most \"good\" AI-generated images generally have a lot of human curation and editing. Here's an example of some \"slop\" from the AI Art Turing Test (https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/how-did-you-do-on-the-ai-ar...) from a while back: https://i.imgur.com/RAMFKP1.jpeg There's definitely a high level of technical expertise that a human would require to paint something like this.

As a side note, here's a human-made piece that I appreciate a lot. https://i.imgur.com/AZiiZj1.jpeg The longer you explore it, the more the story unfolds, it's quite lovely.

I don't think I do, actually. It's not a term with a technical definition, but in simple terms it means art that is obviously AI, because it has the sheen, weird hands, inconsistencies, weird framing or thematic elements that are hard to describe without an art degree but which we instinctively know is wrong, or is just plain bad. I used the term slop to describe bad humans art too, but I meant something subtly different. It's a term that has been used to describe bad work of all kinds from humans since long before there was AI. In this case, it's art from humans who are learning what makes good art. You say there's no bad art, and it's a valid viewpoint, but I'd say bad art is when the artist has a clear goal in their mind, but they lack the skills to realize it. Nonetheless, they share it for feedback and approval anyway, and by doing that on a site like DeviantArt they learn and grow as artists. But meanwhile, to me or anyone else who is visiting that site to find \"good\", meaningful art made by skilled artists, this is slop.

As a classically trained oil painter, I know for sure there is bad art especially because I've made more than enough bad art for one lifetime. Bad art begins with a lack of craftsmanship and is exemplified by a poor use of materials/media and forms, or a lack of knowledge of those forms (e.g. poor anatomical knowledge, misunderstanding the laws of perspective), or an overly literal representation of forms (a photograph is better at being literal, for example). > Here's an example of some \"slop\" from the AI Art Turing Test […] But it's very clearly AI-generated. Can you figure out why? It's only \"clearly AI-generated\" because we know that AI is capable of generating art. If you saw this without that context you wouldn't immediately say \"AI!\" Instead, you'd give it a normal critique that you'd give a student or colleague: I'd say: there's too much repetition of large forms. there's an unpleasant hierarchy of values and not enough separation of values. The portrait of the human is the focus of the image yet it has been lost in the other forms. The composition can improve with more breathing room in the foreground or background which are too busy.

As such, the \"purpleness\" of prose is not an indictment of any sort except if the style doesn't serve the substance. So yes, purple prose is sometimes required and can be used correctly, just ask James Joyce or Hitchens or remember that first sentence in Lolita, for example. Furthermore, almost every piece of writing you've probably enjoyed went through an editor or several professional editors. You'd be shocked to read early or even late drafts.

Maybe it doesn't generalize well, but sometimes that's not a problem. I think this is one of the bigger lessons we've learned with recent ML models. My viewpoint is \"Sometimes you want a database with a human language interface. Sometimes you want to generalize\". So we have to be more context driven here. But certainly there are a lot of things we should be careful about when we're talking about generation. These things are trained on A LOT of data. If you're more \"database-like\" then certainly there's potential legal ramifications... Edit: For context, by \"look pretty good\" I mean in comparison to other works I've seen.

Most of the generations are assets you could download freely from the internet and you could probably get better ones by some artist on fiver or something. But the last example is more our realistic use case. Something that is relatively reasonable, probably not in the set of easy to download assets, and might be something someone wants. It isn't too crazy of an ask given Chimera and how similar a dragon is to a bird in the first place, this should be on the \"easier\" end. I'm sure you could prompt engineer your way into it but then we have to have the discussion of what costs more a prompt engineer or an artist? And do you need a prompt engineer who can repair models? Because these look like they need repairs. This can make it hard to really tell if there's progress or not. It is really easy to make compelling images in a paper and beat benchmarks while not actually creating a something that is __or will become__ a usable product. All the little details matter. Little errors quickly compound... That said, I do much more on generative imagery than generative 3d objects so grain of salt here.

People just see fancy demos and start crapping on about the future, but just look at stable diffusion. It's been around for how long, and what serious professional game developers are using it as a core part of their workflow? Maybe some concept artists? But consistent style is such an important thing for any half decent game and these generative tools shit the bed on consistency in a way that's difficult to paper over. I've spent a lot of time thinking about game design and experimenting with SD/Flux, and the only thing I think I could even get close to production that I couldn't before is maybe an MTG style card game where gameplay is far more important than graphics, and flashy nice looking static artwork is far more important than consistency.

There is a strong preference for \"lazy evaluation\" which is too dependent on assuming high levels of ethical presentation and due diligence. I find it so problematic because this focus actually makes it hard for people to publish who are tackling these problems. Because it makes the space even noisier (already incredibly noisy by the very nature of the subject) and then it becomes hard to talk about details if they're presumed solved. I get that we gloss over details, but if there's anywhere you're allowed to be nuanced and be arguing over details should it not be in academia? (fwiw, I'm also very supportive of having low bars to publication. If it's void of serious error and plagiarism, it is publishable imo. No one can predict what is important or impactful, so we shouldn't even play that game.

It is pretty good with some easier assets that I suspect there's lots of samples of (and we're comparing to other generative models, not to what humans make.

    "originLink": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/01/mastercard-dns-error-went-unnoticed-for-years/",
    "originBody": "January 22, 2025 15 Comments The payment card giant MasterCard just fixed a glaring error in its domain name server settings that could have allowed anyone to intercept or divert Internet traffic for the company by registering an unused domain name. The misconfiguration persisted for nearly five years until a security researcher spent $300 to register the domain and prevent it from being grabbed by cybercriminals. A DNS lookup on the domain az.mastercard.com on Jan. 14, 2025 shows the mistyped domain name a22-65.akam.ne. From June 30, 2020 until January 14, 2025, one of the core Internet servers that MasterCard uses to direct traffic for portions of the mastercard.com network was misnamed. MasterCard.com relies on five shared Domain Name System (DNS) servers at the Internet infrastructure provider Akamai [DNS acts as a kind of Internet phone book, by translating website names to numeric Internet addresses that are easier for computers to manage]. All of the Akamai DNS server names that MasterCard uses are supposed to end in “akam.net” but one of them was misconfigured to rely on the domain “akam.ne.” This tiny but potentially critical typo was discovered recently by Philippe Caturegli, founder of the security consultancy Seralys. Caturegli said he guessed that nobody had yet registered the domain akam.ne, which is under the purview of the top-level domain authority for the West Africa nation of Niger. Caturegli said it took $300 and nearly three months of waiting to secure the domain with the registry in Niger. After enabling a DNS server on akam.ne, he noticed hundreds of thousands of DNS requests hitting his server each day from locations around the globe. Apparently, MasterCard wasn’t the only organization that had fat-fingered a DNS entry to include “akam.ne,” but they were by far the largest. Had he enabled an email server on his new domain akam.ne, Caturegli likely would have received wayward emails directed toward mastercard.com or other affected domains. If he’d abused his access, he probably could have obtained website encryption certificates (SSL/TLS certs) that were authorized to accept and relay web traffic for affected websites. He may even have been able to passively receive Microsoft Windows authentication credentials from employee computers at affected companies. But the researcher said he didn’t attempt to do any of that. Instead, he alerted MasterCard that the domain was theirs if they wanted it, copying this author on his notifications. A few hours later, MasterCard acknowledged the mistake, but said there was never any real threat to the security of its operations. “We have looked into the matter and there was not a risk to our systems,” a MasterCard spokesperson wrote. “This typo has now been corrected.” Meanwhile, Caturegli received a request submitted through Bugcrowd, a program that offers financial rewards and recognition to security researchers who find flaws and work privately with the affected vendor to fix them. The message suggested his public disclosure of the MasterCard DNS error via a post on LinkedIn (after he’d secured the akam.ne domain) was not aligned with ethical security practices, and passed on a request from MasterCard to have the post removed. MasterCard’s request to Caturegli, a.k.a. “Titon” on infosec.exchange. Caturegli said while he does have an account on Bugcrowd, he has never submitted anything through the Bugcrowd program, and that he reported this issue directly to MasterCard. “I did not disclose this issue through Bugcrowd,” Caturegli wrote in reply. “Before making any public disclosure, I ensured that the affected domain was registered to prevent exploitation, mitigating any risk to MasterCard or its customers. This action, which we took at our own expense, demonstrates our commitment to ethical security practices and responsible disclosure.” Most organizations have at least two authoritative domain name servers, but some handle so many DNS requests that they need to spread the load over additional DNS server domains. In MasterCard’s case, that number is five, so it stands to reason that if an attacker managed to seize control over just one of those domains they would only be able to see about one-fifth of the overall DNS requests coming in. But Caturegli said the reality is that many Internet users are relying at least to some degree on public traffic forwarders or DNS resolvers like Cloudflare and Google. “So all we need is for one of these resolvers to query our name server and cache the result,” Caturegli said. By setting their DNS server records with a long TTL or “Time To Live” — a setting that can adjust the lifespan of data packets on a network — an attacker’s poisoned instructions for the target domain can be propagated by large cloud providers. “With a long TTL, we may reroute a LOT more than just 1/5 of the traffic,” he said. The researcher said he’d hoped that the credit card giant might thank him, or at least offer to cover the cost of buying the domain. “We obviously disagree with this assessment,” Caturegli wrote in a follow-up post on LinkedIn regarding MasterCard’s public statement. “But we’ll let you judge— here are some of the DNS lookups we recorded before reporting the issue.” Caturegli posted this screenshot of MasterCard domains that were potentially at risk from the misconfigured domain. As the screenshot above shows, the misconfigured DNS server Caturegli found involved the MasterCard subdomain az.mastercard.com. It is not clear exactly how this subdomain is used by MasterCard, however their naming conventions suggest the domains correspond to production servers at Microsoft’s Azure cloud service. Caturegli said the domains all resolve to Internet addresses at Microsoft. “Don’t be like Mastercard,” Caturegli concluded in his LinkedIn post. “Don’t dismiss risk, and don’t let your marketing team handle security disclosures.” One final note: The domain akam.ne has been registered previously — in December 2016 by someone using the email address um-i-delo@yandex.ru. The Russian search giant Yandex reports this user account belongs to an “Ivan I.” from Moscow. Passive DNS records from DomainTools.com show that between 2016 and 2018 the domain was connected to an Internet server in Germany, and that the domain was left to expire in 2018. This is interesting given a comment on Caturegli’s LinkedIn post from an ex-Cloudflare employee who linked to a report he co-authored on a similar typo domain apparently registered in 2017 for organizations that may have mistyped their AWS DNS server as “awsdns-06.ne” instead of “awsdns-06.net.” DomainTools reports that this typo domain also was registered to a Yandex user (playlotto@yandex.ru), and was hosted at the same German ISP — Team Internet (AS61969).

Any attention they pay to security is only a side-effect of caring about reputation management. reply jedberg 48 minutes agorootparentAnd as we've learned from significant breaches, there is rarely a reputational hit for even the biggest breaches. Anyone remember that time Target accidentally doxxed 70 million people? I don't think there was any noticeable difference in their income or profits. No one cared. reply diggan 1 hour agorootparentprevAnd ultimately, the only reason they care about their reputation is because it affects their profits. For-profit companies optimize for profits, as always :) reply hinkley 19 minutes agorootparentNo. There’s prestige and power in running high profile companies. It’s a middle class fantasy that money is power. Look at the Cheeto. How many times has he been bankrupt? What does he say about bankruptcy? He knows he’ll be fine because power brings money, not the other way around. Taxing billionaires will help the economy absolutely, but it won’t control the billionaires, because a lot of their deals aren’t denominated in hard currency. We don’t know how to tax favors or threats. reply sirlone 35 minutes agorootparentprevSo the mom-and-pop donut shop on the corner always optimizes for profits? The local donut shop? Most companies do not actually optimize for profit. If they did they'd stop whatever it is they are currently doing and switch to whatever industry makes the most profit. They don't though, they keep making/doing whatever it is they start with generally. That means they aren't actually optimizing for profit. reply kevin_thibedeau 3 minutes agorootparentProfitability is important to any size business. Profit growth is what many large business C-levels obsess over because they get to eat a slice of the expanding pie. reply eddd-ddde 17 minutes agorootparentprevNot all work is equal. Value is derived from having an edge over the competition. If you are a good baker then baking may be optimizing for profit. Also if everyone just switched to X it wouldn't be the best option anymore. reply neilwilson 28 minutes agorootparentprevThat is optimising for profit. One of the problems with any comparative advantage argument is that capital is destroyed during any pivot. That cost has to be factored into the return from pivoting. reply jbs789 12 minutes agorootparentprevUmm… continuing the donut example, the owners are likely maximising their return given their skill sets, knowledge, time, etc. But return is pretty nuanced too bc it probably is not just be profits, but family time etc. in any event, I think you’re right that businesses don’t just focus on profits. But the example doesn’t prove the point. reply newsclues 31 minutes agorootparentprevCompanies do have a motivation to have good security practices (and disclosure), because they are motivated by their reputation which is essential for customers to trust them to be customers, even more with the proliferation of SaaS means more longterm relationships and customer data. The challenge is for customers and companies to communicate and agree to the new social contract. reply cedws 34 minutes agoparentprevMastercard should be heavily fined for this. And I mean really heavily, like some percentage, or fraction of a percentage of global revenue. That's how you get them to take security seriously. reply josh_cutler 29 minutes agorootparentBy who? reply zettabomb 1 hour agoparentprevYeah, isn't it pretty standard to first report privately, then report publicly if they don't take any action (and you believe it to still be an issue)? That seems consistent with mosr organization's responsible disclosure practices. reply JohnMakin 24 minutes agorootparentthis is standard, but there are people out there that believe this is malicious/blackmailing behavior.

Why would you be able to bill for a service that you weren’t asked to provide? reply cperciva 43 minutes agorootparentWhy would you be able to bill for a service that you weren’t asked to provide? This can happen; if you're found unconscious and taken to the hospital, you can be billed for medical care which you didn't ask for, based on the doctrine of presumed consent. One could imagine a parallel a critical emergency where it's impossible to communicate but it's reasonable to presume that they would want to have the issue fixed if they were aware. I don't think it necessarily applies here, but it's at least possible that another case could meet that bar. reply bmicraft 1 hour agorootparentprevWell, in a case such as this: because they're putting other people's data/money at risk and should have payed somebody to discover flaws like this in the first place.

The screenshot of the mail is apparently sent from the \"Platform Behavior Standards Team,\" which means that either Bugcrowd are taking a rather expansive view of their platform standards [1] by attempting to police behaviour outside the platform, or Mastercard are impersonating official Bugcrowd staff. Neither option is particularly palatable. [1] https://www.bugcrowd.com/resources/hacker-resources/platform... reply ApolloFortyNine 52 minutes agoparentThe wording is also downright terrible.

Doesn't behavior like this mean that security researchers are more likely to intrude further next time at this company and others to gather more evidence of impact, expecting the company to lie about it otherwise?

Then kinda going after the researcher in trying to suppress the news, after (AFAICT) the researcher already did the right thing... Does the credit card company have a reason to do that?

Probably, but again, the risk depends on what it is, and wouldn't affect users visiting 'mastercard.com.' reply diggan 1 hour agorootparentI think the idea was that because this typod domain was being used behind the CDN, you could trick mastercard.com (that uses the CDN) somehow to serve from the hijacked domain that was misconfigured at the CDN. At least that's my guess, but it's not super clear what attacks would be possible here. reply e28eta 43 minutes agoparentprevre: SSL/TLS certs My first thought is using one of the ACME-based certificate providers, since DNS control of a domain is sufficient (either TXT record or directing requests to a HTTP server you control). reply fuzzer371 1 hour agoprevObviously this was a huge mistake on Mastercards part, but does anyone else think it's a mistake to even /have/ domains that are literally one letter away from the original TLD's? For instance .com and .co, .net and .ne. It just seems to be asking for trouble. If those didn't exist, they couldn't be registered and the erroneous DNS request would just go nowhere. reply abound 1 hour agoparentNot exactly, since typos can occur anywhere in the name, not just the TLD. Hell, even without typos, you can bitsquat [1] on domains one bit away from popular site names (usually CDNs) and get some traffic because of various computer glitches. Here's a random paper I found (and skimmed) with some examples [2] [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitsquatting [2] https://www.securitee.org/files/bitsquatting_www2013.pdf reply cbhl 24 minutes agoparentprevI'd expect big companies to use Markmonitor to handle this problem basically, they _also_ register all of the one-edit-distance away typos that they can. According to Wikipedia, Akamai is one of Markmonitor's customers, so it is surprising that this wasn't already registered by them. reply dataflow 1 hour agoparentprevHow is this any different from having a phone number that's just one digit away from another sensitive one? reply fuzzer371 1 hour agorootparentWell nobody has the phone number 912 for instance.

Not everything is a life and death matter (and neither was the Mastercard incident). reply toast0 1 hour agoparentprevI mean, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 TLDs are clearly useful, but given the address space, there's lots of one away typos there. It's not a big difference when the non contry code domains are also one dropped letter away from an ccTLD. On the other hand, this sort of misconfiguration would show up in any sort of good DNS checking tool. One of your registered nameservers doesn't resolve and/or one of your name servers doesn't return the same zone serial (likely) or actual response if you check a name. In .is, they wouldn't let me register a domain unless I provided two known good nameservers, but .com isn't picky anymore. reply indigodaddy 1 hour agorootparentI would think you'd get client query errors from time to time as well if one of the auth NS names doesn't even route/not registered.

A disruption to predatory/parasitic credit/debit networks is well overdue. reply antithesis-nl 1 hour agoprevYeah, huge surprise. Have you ever tried to report a technical issue to a Big Tech company, like, at all? If so, 'silence' is the best you can expect, with 'a threatening letter' and 'a SWAT visit' being the runners-up. Example of the first: if your mail server uses the default-Windows-2016-TLS stack, Facebook's mail servers will immediately disconnect after issuing a STARTTLS command and receiving your server certificate. Why? No idea, everyone else seems to be fine, but this has been ongoing for years. Second example: you can steal any Dutch \"OV bike\" simply by impersonating the MiFare classic UID of any valid subscriber, without any rate limits on those attempts. I reported this issue to them in 2016, they tried to sue me and failed, then tried to talk me and failed to listen, and to this day this vulnerability exists. Third example: phew, none (SWATs are not as eager to mobilize around here), but I would not be surprised, like, at all, if I were to get an early-morning wake-up call just for trying to correct someones SPF records via an advisory email... reply m3047 20 minutes agoparentHere's Renee Burton's (at Infoblox) comment on Philippe Caturegli's post on LinkedIn: \"When we contacted DNS providers about sitting ducks attacks ONGOING in their network via lame delegation... some responded with aggression and others with ambivalence. no criminals were disrupted and it was a waste of our resources even though it was the right thing to do.\" And I can personally vouch that's mostly my experience and expectation as well, and not just for DNS issues. reply toast0 1 hour agoparentprev> Example of the first: if your mail server uses the default-Windows-2016-TLS stack, Facebook's mail servers will immediately disconnect after issuing a STARTTLS command and receiving your server certificate.

Admitting fault means a poor market signal. Poor market signal means leadership perceived as inept and “failing to deliver shareholder value”. Of course this isn’t unique to public companies. Have seen private companies do the same for less to avoid embarrassment or perhaps they think it would harm their IPO reply antithesis-nl 1 hour agorootparent> Admitting fault means a poor market signal Nah, not really. I sincerely doubt that Facebook admitting \"yeah, our outgoing mail servers did TLS cert verification improperly in some cases\", or the Dutch National Railways saying \"yeah, we make renting bikes easy, maybe too easy\" would affect their valuation.

      "MasterCard resolved a DNS (Domain Name System) error that could have led to traffic interception by registering an unused domain, which had been a vulnerability for nearly five years. Security researcher Philippe Caturegli identified the issue, involving a typo in a DNS server name, and registered the domain for $300 to prevent potential misuse, despite MasterCard's claim of no security risk. Caturegli's actions and public disclosure highlighted potential vulnerabilities and criticized MasterCard's response, revealing a history of similar DNS typos with the domain."

What's crazy is how modern shipping has made it economical to process this elsewhere, all over the globe. For example, from one of the biggest bauxite mines, in Pará, Brazil, the raw bauxite is shipped across the Atlantic to be processed by Hydro in Norway, which refines it into alumina powder, which is then shipped elsewhere to be refined into aluminum. You would think it would be more cost-effective and energy-efficient to centralize this, not to mention more environmentally friendly. [1] https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/profiling-the-top-five... reply cjs_ac 5 hours agorootparentExtracting aluminium from bauxite is notoriously energy-intensive.

There's an idea in psychology called the illusion of explanitory depth. It's the idea that everyone has much more confidence in their understanding of how things work, even the most mundane and apparantly simple things, than is warranted. In turn we tend to hugely underestimate the difficulty, complexity and skill in jobs we have never done. The world is absolutely full of utterly prosaic objects that are far more sophisticated that we imagine, either in their function and design or in their manufacture. Most people overestimate how well they would cope in some post-apocalyptic world. But I think even many people who regard themselves as prepared, underestimate how much skill and sheer effort is involved in making really simple things like rope. To do more than just scrape by you would need to reconstruct a society of specialists, it won't be the rugged individualists. reply potato3732842 7 hours agorootparentI hate this take (and every other take wherein one basically looks down their nose at the rest of the population and claims they all have a bad take on something). Most things are pretty simply and someone with a basic understanding could get them mostly right or at least right enough to work. The complexity comes from the many layers of refinement over the years. No, your clay molded toilet won't flush like a modern one but if you understand the basics of how a toilet works it'll probably flush. reply noneeeed 4 hours agorootparentThis absolutely isn't looking down on people. I didn't say that people couldn't do these things. I am absolutely ignorant of how the vast majority of the world actually works. I would never look down on someone because they don't know something. I get very annoyed with my fellow techies and the way they seem to assume that non-technical people are stupid for not understanding things that they themselves see as simple and obvious. Of course people can learn anything. It's that we tend to not realise that we don't know this stuff, and so we underestimate the difficulty/complexity of them. This often leads to people actually looking down dismissively on other people's jobs, as they assume they must be simple or easy, because they have never done them. You get endless political commentry on how people doing certain jobs don't deserve to be paid well because what they do appears \"simple\". Train drivers are a classic example. It's a job that is a lot harder and more involved than it appears at first. For a while I worked in the rail industry. That was full of things that were way more complex and involved than I had ever realised. Things that seemed simple on the surface had decades of refinement and subtlety to them born of experience. Your example is a great one. The principals of the flushing toilet with a siphon flush, ballcock and an S-bend outflow are not complex, but a lot of people have no idea what pressing a flush down actually does to get the water into the bowl, how it refills or what the S-bend is actually for (it's more than just the smell, sewer gas is explosive). It's the reason that a lot of people don't tackle more DIY jobs, they suddenly realise they don't understand it. But it's also why YouTube is so great, because these things are all learnable. In the event of a societal collapse, I sometimes think that preserving all the instructional YouTube videos would be our best hope for rebuilding :D reply infecto 5 hours agorootparentprevI believe you are overestimating the percentage of the population that understand the basics of how a toilet works. Not looking down on those folks but in my experience, there are folks that think about how things work or have some practical experience, the rest don't ever think about it and so most likely do not even understand the basics. Nothing wrong with it but its fairly apparent. Inversely, those folks that think about how things work tend to be fairly overconfident in their ability to recreate/repair/innovate.

That just maybe bureaucracy cant help but to expand forever every time someone with a title has a question that cant be answered immediately by someone standing in the room, they have to create a committee so they can have someone on speed dial? If the coast guard doesnt have plans for this, one wonders what the coast guard does all day. reply sympil 3 hours agorootparentIt’s common for organizations to reorganize. It’s quite possible that the committee was formed for purposes of centralization and efficacy. It’s also possible it was government overreach.

You just need coast guard for emergencies. They got along just fine before 2018 when this committee was created. reply mcculley 2 hours agorootparentI grew up in the commercial fishing industry and then worked in the tug boat industry. Many USCG regulations that were vehemently opposed by the old men save lives every day. This is a classic Chesterton's Fence. Those who don't understand the origin of the regulations will continue to have strong, uninformed opinions about them. Many crew working on boats have safety gear only because USCG requires it. The owners of those boats would not expend the money without the regulation. reply theultdev 2 hours agorootparentWhat regulations of this committee do you think saved lives that other agencies did not? The USCG, NMFS, NIOSH, and OSHA regulations are still there. When you were growing up, was it earlier than 2018? This committee didn't exist before then. But yeah, maybe we should add 20 more agencies just to be safe... reply avs733 1 hour agorootparentThis committee doesn’t make regulations they make expert suggestions. This is way off the original topic of course…but you can do a quick search of the federal register they you can see the agenda of meetings and such. A recent one reviewed structural failures that led to boats sinking. Fields learn as new things happen. There’s a reason aerospace industries talk about rules having body counts. Freezing regulations rarely makes work easier or faster, it just makes knowledge sharing worse.

If we take the birth of the federal government or the USCG as our start point, it is these type of committees that actually moved Chesterton's Fence reply jacoblambda 1 hour agorootparentThat's not how Chesterton's Fence works? The point isn't that the fence was always there. It's that people who try to dismantle the fence never bothered to learn why the fence was put up in the first place. The fence could have been put up yesterday but if you never even bother to learn why the fence was put up before trying to remove it, that's still Chesterton's Fence. reply ianmcgowan 1 hour agorootparentprevChesterton's point wasn't that the fence should never move (which is what you seem to be implying), but that it should only be moved (or technically removed) when you understand why it was initially put in place. I'm sympathetic to the idea that there is bloat and over-regulation, but most of the laws and regulations on the books are in response to a bad thing happening. It's kind of like a legacy code base just deleting the repo and starting over from scratch is usually not the best idea, it takes some careful refactoring and judicious tests to move in the right direction. It's sort of an interesting idea what are \"tests\" in the context of the legal/regulatory framework? The constitution? The judiciary? reply ahmeneeroe-v2 1 hour agorootparentMy point is that a fence existed (Fence #1). Someone moved Fence #1 (by making these DHS committees), which we will call Fence #2. We are now removing Fence #2 back to Fence #1, which is more Chesterton-y by virtue of being there first. reply jacoblambda 14 minutes agorootparentThe fence is a restriction. i.e. a regulation or series of rules. These committees make those rules. It's not just a state of being. Getting rid of a fence doesn't mean there's magically an older fence you've moved to. It's only when you replace a set of rules with a different set of rules to serve the same purpose that you've moved the fence. Removing the fence is exactly that, getting rid of the fence. There is no before fence. You've just removed the fence. reply Kon-Peki 3 hours agorootparentprev“This is unsafe!

The problem is you're assuming good faith when there has been ample demonstration that there isn't any here. reply theultdev 1 hour agorootparentYou're assuming good faith of these committees. Comes down to who you trust. I voted in Trump to do this and more, I trust the evaluations were made properly and I support the decision. There's obvious bias in your tone (which is okay, which is why I stated my position) so it makes sense you don't like this move because you don't trust this administration. We're similar in that regard in that I don't trust the government implicitly, which is why I support culling bloat. reply viraptor 31 minutes agorootparentIf they were made in good faith, then surely we have some documentation for it in order to learn from those original mistakes.

Chesterton’s fence can never be an argument against creating something new. The whole point of it is that if you come across a fence then that was the result of a conscious human decision and subsequent effort, which strongly implies there was a reason it was created, and until you understand what that reason was, you’re taking a risk by destroying the fence. But if there is “nothing” and you’re creating something new, Chesterton’s fence doesn’t apply because the lack of existence of anything was not the result of intentional human design and effort, therefore there’s no evidence that the lack of existence of something “had a reason for it”. reply tptacek 1 hour agorootparentRead The Drift From Domesticity, where this whole \"fence\" thing comes from.

Or maybe im missing your point? reply alephnerd 4 hours agorootparentWhat OP is saying is instead of having some sort of legal liability attached or outside directives being handed to them, they would rather implement on their own or push their own standards. A notable example is SEC mandates on breach disclosures, which will most likely be dead now. Those were a major forcing function to make companies realize security is important. Otherwise, paying a ransom and doing the bare minimum to not get cut by Chubbs or AXA is the norm. I agree with JumpCriscross on his read of this situation. It ain't great.

The current techbro CEO squad is a small group of people who got extraordinarily lucky and made a bunch of money. The techbro CEO squad takes their luck to be ability, and they think the fact that they have more money than other people means that they're smarter than everyone else. Some members of the techbro CEO squad think of themselves as prophets or messiahs. In addition to this, the techbro CEO squad is addicted to money and its accumulation. This isn't a \"I need more money to live a more comfortable retirement\" thing, it is a \"my sole purpose for being is the accumulation of wealth\" thing. They are more akin to machines whose purpose it is to grab onto as much money as possible than they are actual human beings. The techbro CEO squad's vast wealth has enabled them to surround themselves with an army of staff whose only job it is to make their dreams a reality and execute their orders. There is a vast, impenetrable field of personnel and money that insulates them from the reality of the world. So, they think that they're better than anyone else to the point of being god-like, they are sociopaths who only care about money, they are surrounded by an army of yes men, and they have lost (or never had) any connection to the average human being and his or her existence. They believe that any restriction on their ability to accumulate wealth is an assault on their freedom, an enemy to be defeated, an injustice to be made right by any means possible. Limits on their ability to pollute, protections for employees operating in the heat or cold or around hazardous materials, regulations designed to prevent market manipulation or money laundering, it is all evil and must be destroyed. They are willing to dismantle any system to get what they want. Because they think that they are better than everyone else, the techbro CEO squad does not value consensus or institutional knowledge that has led to regulation slowly building up over centuries in response to events and emergencies: if they don't like it, it must go. So, the slow infiltration of government by the Peter Theil, Andreessen and Horowitz, Musk, (but mainly their servants) and the rest started a couple of years ago and continues to this day. tl;dr: Billionaires will rape your grandmother's corpse for lower taxes, harvest and sell her organs for a laugh, then label you a woke communist and kick you off twitter for criticizing them. reply duke_sam 10 hours agoprevWhatever problems or limitations the existing approach had dropping everything on the floor is one of the least helpful ways of trying to fix it (assuming good intent). reply matwood 10 hours agoparent“They are never as dumb as I hoped they were, and I am never as smart as I thought I was.” Basically nearly every person who goes into a new situation thinking only they can fix it. reply leptons 9 hours agorootparent\"The same level of awareness that created a problem, cannot be used to fix it\" reply dkjaudyeqooe 10 hours agoparentprevYou have to assume competence too.

This assumption is accepted with such a degree of faith that few scholars have seen fit to even question whether and to what degree private roads have been constructed historically. >But in the early years of the new republic, Americans underwent what some historians have described as a “turnpike craze.” The term “turnpike” specifically refers to roadways constructed and operated privately. Early Americans, wanting to connect their communities to the developing market economy, eagerly subscribed to turnpike corporations for local roads.

Based on the GOA, approx. $500 billion/yr (including veterans benefits) goes into actually running the military [https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59475].

The US has been in a privileged position for so long they don't even realize why they are there. People flock to the USD because of stability, rule of law, and the ability to park a carrier strike force off any coast in the world and project that 'full faith and credit' the US speaks of.

The military itself has been trying to close unneeded bases, get rid of weapons it doesn’t need, etc. But Congress and the rest of the civilian leadership won’t let it because the civilian leadership is more interested in kickbacks from contractors than doing what is best for the military.

Local markets are good at sussing this out. We need federal regulation when supply (and thus trust) chains get longer.

No, particularly not with the bird flu ruminating in dairy cows. Do I think banning raw milk makes it more likely (on the margin) that in 10 years I'll be eating leaded spices? Yes.

    "originBody": "The Essence of Successful Abstractions Complexity has to live somewhere; but it does not have to live everywhere. Assumed audience: Software developers who want to improve at their craft. Assumes a bit of background about programming in general, and also just a little bit of background knowledge about Rust and TypeScript. (You’ll be just fine if you know no more of either than that they exist and roughly what they are.) As a bit of a prelude, consider this extended quote from Fred Hebert, Complexity Has to Live Somewhere Fighting complexity is a recurring theme of software development I’ve seen repeat itself over and over again. It’s something I keep seeing debated at all levels: just how much commenting should go on in functions and methods? What’s the ideal amount of abstraction? When does a framework start having “too much magic”? When are there too many languages in an organisation? We try to get rid of the complexity, control it, and seek simplicity. I think framing things that way is misguided. Complexity has to live somewhere. … When we adopt something like microservices, we try to make it so that each service is individually simple. But unless this simplicity is so constraining that your actual application inherits it and is forced into simplicity, it still has to go somewhere. If it’s not in the individual microservices, then where is it? Complexity has to live somewhere. If you are lucky, it lives in well-defined places. In code where you decided a bit of complexity should go, in documentation that supports the code, in training sessions for your engineers. You give it a place without trying to hide all of it. You create ways to manage it. You know where to go to meet it when you need it. If you’re unlucky and you just tried to pretend complexity could be avoided altogether, it has no place to go in this world. But it still doesn’t stop existing. With nowhere to go, it has to roam everywhere in your system, both in your code and in people’s heads. And as people shift around and leave, our understanding of it erodes. There’s more, and it’s good, so read the whole thing! And as you do, you might consider how it pairs with the quote from Peter Naur I shared yesterday. Now —  Hebert applies this to microservices, I think appropriately. I think it also applies to types. The types always exist; the complexity they represent always exists. The question is first of all whether we have written them down anywhere — that is, whether we have a contract about them that can be enforced, and if so what can enforce them. Secondarily, then, the expressiveness of a type system is a measure of what kinds of the program’s complexity we can write down as types. People who are a bit allergic to types often feel constrained by them, but those of us who like robust types see that relationship the other way around. As Dan Freeman put it to me recently: types are a tool, just like tests, but you have to use that tool. Types do provide constraints, much as tests do — but they are only the types we choose to impose. That is, they are knowledge we are encoding into the program. The same basic thesis applies to our tests, which represent a different set of knowledge than our types. This is the benefit of “test-driven development”, particularly in the red-green cycle: it is a way of encoding knowledge into the program. Test expressiveness works in different ways than type expressiveness, but it is a useful way of evaluating different kinds of and different approaches to testing. This is why I like Rust. The complexity of correctly spatial and temporal safety has to live somewhere. Rust pushes the majority of that complexity into its type system, and particularly the famed borrow checker. The rest of the complexity it isolates in unsafe blocks. Mind: unsafe allows you to know where the complexity lives, but it does not tell you where your getting that complexity wrong will surface. But the combination of the borrow checker and the isolation that unsafe offers does allow us to control the complexity. We cannot get rid of it. We can only isolate it. A garbage collector gives you memory safety and not having to think explicitly about memory allocation and deallocation, but the complexity is still not gone — it has moved to the implementation, to weird performance cliffs, and to difficult-to-debug leaks of memory or other resources. That trade is very often worth it, though! Whether with Rust or with a garbage collector, isolating the temporal and spatial safety means we don’t have to keep it in our heads most of the time, and that allows us to focus on other problems. This is why there are so many developer tools for JavaScript and Python being written in Rust: not because people didn’t want fast tools before, but because for many developers, keeping all the safety issues in their heads as they would have had to do with C or C++ was more than they felt they could reasonably do and also ship the thing they cared about. Rust’s borrow checking opens that door to many more people, because it has isolated that complexity, and thereby provided a more usable tool. This exact dynamic is also why I like TypeScript, even including some of the wilder types I ended up writing for Ember and LinkedIn in years past. The complexity was always there — often far more than anyone realized before we started trying to write down types that actually accurately represented the system. TypeScript did not create the complexity, much as people sometimes felt like it added complexity to the code we were looking at. No, it merely shone a light on the existing complexity, and gave us the opportunity — and a tool with which — to start grappling with it. Isolating complexity is useful. As Hebert says, “If you are lucky, it lives in well-defined places.” It is not always possible to isolate complexity — we are not always lucky — , but when isolating complexity is possible, it is glorious, because isolating complexity is the essence of successful abstractions.

    "commentBody": "Isolating complexity is the essence of successful abstractions (chriskrycho.com)198 points by chriskrycho 17 hours agohidepastfavorite62 comments wavemode 3 hours agoThe author's assertion is true complexity has to live somewhere. The nuance, though, is that all places complexity can live are not created equal. Let's take the example of memory management: by pushing that complexity into the type system, Rust forces the programmer to deal with it and design around it. At the expense of some performance, we could instead push this complexity into a runtime garbage collection system. Since the runtime system understands things about the runtime characteristics of the program that can't be proven via static analysis, it can also handle more things without the programmer having to intervene, thus reducing the difficulty of the programming language. For most programmers this is a positive tradeoff (since most programmers are not writing software where every microsecond matters). Similar tradeoffs exist in many different areas of software engineering. One monolith, where all the information is in one place, is easier to write code in than two microservices, which keep having to ask each other questions via API call. Yet, sometimes we need microservices. Rendering your web application entirely on the frontend in React, or entirely on the backend with templates, where all the logic lives in one place, is much easier than doing server-sided rendering then hydrating on the frontend. Yet, sometimes we need server-sided rendering and hydration. Complexity is an irreducible constant, yes, but cognitive load is not. Cognitive load can increase or decrease depending on where you choose to push your complexity. reply gorjusborg 2 hours agoparent(I'm not responding directly to parent post, more adding my two cents in agreement) 'Necessary complexity' needs to live somewhere. There is often a core of complexity that is intrinsic to the problem being solved. This cannot be removed, only moved/converted/etc.. That doesn't mean everything needs to be complex, and that you need to 'collect' it somewhere. There is such a thing as unnecessary complexity, and code that has a lot of it is 'bad code'. Don't fall for the trap of thinking that you can't improve code by identifying and eliminating unnecessary complexity. reply clarkmoody 13 minutes agoparentprevThe other tradeoff comes with ease of debugging. Compile-time vs runtime errors. Dredging through microservice logs vs stack traces from the monolith. reply freehorse 4 hours agoprevI do not think of complexity as one thing. Abstractions are about both hiding and exposing complexity at the same time. Different levels of abstractions can expose or isolate different part of complexity. Exposing parts of it in a way that they become amenable to your tools is as important as isolating other parts somewhere in the background. Essentially, this has to do with how well a given abstraction choice maps into the structure of the problem-space and the relationships there. The choice of which parts of complexity you isolate and which you expose is important. You probably do not want to deal with everything at once, but also usually you cannot avoid dealing with something. The way I primarily see (and often like) type systems wrt complexity is as choosing which parts of complexity are important and exposing them (and rest being still there to deal with). There is a cognitive aspect to abstractions and complexity, irrespective even of IDEs, debuggers, compilers etc. I personally want my abstractions to make at least some sense in my head or a piece of paper in the way I think about the problem before even I start writing code. If the abstractions do not help me actually cognise about (some part of) the problem, they probably solve other problems, not mine. reply chuzz 7 hours agoprevThat's why Typescript/Python optional typing hit the best balance for me. Coding in duck-typed language is generally fine when your test suite is as fast and frequent as a type checker. That also explains why TDD is more popular in say Ruby or Python vs. Java. Speaking of Java, the problem with types is when you try to reify every single problem you encounter in your codebase.

I'd say that TDD being more popular in untyped languages speaks against TDD, as it hints that maybe some of its benefits are covered already by a type system. reply bluGill 4 hours agorootparentYou did clarify latter a bit, but this cannot stand unchallenged. TDD and tests solve different problems from types and so are valuable for that. Tests assert that no matter what you change this one fact remains true. Types assert that you are using the right things in your code. I don't think it is lack of types at fault for untyped languages liking TDD (though I miss types a lot). I think it is there is no way to find out if functions exist until runtime (most allow self modifying code of some form so a static analysis can't verify without solving the halting problem). Though once you know a function exists the next step of verifying the function (or an overload in some languages) exists does need types. reply dlahoda 6 hours agorootparentprevtypes are just autoverified logic. tdd just tests logic which cannot be typed in given type system. in lean4 one can type a lot(dependant types to test integration shapes and proofs are proptests). reply bluGill 4 hours agorootparentTDD also asserts that if you make a change you don't break anything. Most programs are too complex to keep all behavior in your head so sometimes what looks like an obvious change breaks something you forgot about. Types won't tell you because you adjusted the types, but the test will tell you. (if you have the right tests of functionality a very hard problem outside the scope of this discussion) reply Tainnor 3 hours agorootparentThe person you're replying to mentioned Lean4. In such a language, types can definitely assert that a change didn't break anything, in the sense that you can write down the property you want as a type, and if there is an implementation (a proof), your code satisfies that property. Now, proofs can be often devilishly hard to write whereas tests are easy (because they're just examples), so in practice, types probably won't supplant tests even in dependently typed languages. reply marcosdumay 4 hours agorootparentprevIt's blatantly obvious that some of the benefits of extensive testing are covered by a type system. Even by a mostly useless one like Java's. If you look at any well tested program in a dynamic language, almost all the tests check the same properties that a type system would also check by default. If you remove those, usually only a few remain that test non-trivial properties. EDIT: And I just love that in the time I took to write this, somebody wrote a comment about how it isn't so. No, it is still blatantly obvious. reply hitchstory 6 hours agorootparentprevId say if you think tests and types are doing the same thing in the same way you are badly abusing at least one of them. One attacks the problem of bugs from the bottom up and the other from the top down.

All I say is that maybe _some_ of those tests deliver value by just making sure that code even runs, which is otherwise covered by types. reply hitchstory 6 hours agorootparentWhen I do TDD (virtually every time i write a line of code) each test scenario isnt just a way to verify that the code is working, it's also a specification often for a previously unconsidered edge case. Throwing away the test means throwing away that user story and the value that comes with it. reply youerbt 6 hours agorootparentI believe you (other than tests being specifications, they are examples at best). But that doesn't change the fact that TDD looks more adopted in untyped languages, and that deserves an explanation. Mine is that a lot of potential errors (typos, type mismatches) don't need to be exercised by running code in typed language. Yours is... well, you don't really address it. reply hitchstory 4 hours agorootparent>I believe you other than tests being specifications If you're not, that suggests you're not doing them right which in turn suggests why you might have an issue with them... reply koolba 6 hours agorootparentprevThat’s exactly what those tests are for. When you no longer have to worry if you invoked .foo() or .fooTypo(), you eliminated one class of bug. Namely trying to run things that do not exist. Maybe you meant to invoke .bar(), but at least we know thanks to type checks that the target exists. reply agentultra 2 hours agoprevIsolating complexity, I would say, is a consequence of using good abstractions... not necessarily the essence of abstraction however. The essence of abstractions are in semantics. I define a type and an algebra of relations on that type which gives me theorems I can use. That is the essence. The consequence is that I can now think in terms of the theorems and definitions I've established rather than all of the details at the lower-level. However, sometimes it's a bit over-rated when all that's needed is some information hiding and indirection, which is what this article appears to be discussing. These tools are the ones that are \"leaky\" in the sense that the complexity they attempt to hide often escapes the confines of their interface. It tends to give \"abstraction\" a bad reputation among programmers who have to deal with such systems. Essential complexity does have to live somewhere. Best to be upfront about it. reply dartos 14 hours agoprevI don’t think I agree that either typescript nor rust successfully hide the complexity in their type systems. By the nature of type systems, they are tightly coupled with the code written around them. Rust has rich features to handle this coupling (traits and derives), but typescript does not. reply andrewflnr 12 hours agoparentIt's not about hiding the complexity in the type system, that is, the complexity of the type system. At least for Rust, it's about that (yes, complex) type system isolating the even worse complexity of tracking lifetimes and aliasing and such, for all possible control flow paths, in your head. It's harder to summarize what Typescript is isolating, except that JavaScript function signatures are the flipping wild west and the type system has to model most of that complexity. It tends to produce very leaky abstractions in my experience unless you put in a lot of work. reply mmis1000 4 hours agorootparentSometimes the original js function isn't safe at all. So does the typescript definition. For example, `Object.assign` overrides all property with same name. Sometimes you use it to construct a new object, so it is a safe usage. But what about using it to override the buildin object's property? It is definitely going to explode the whole program. However there isn't really a mechanism for typescript to differ the usage is safe or not. So in order to maintain compatibility, typescript just allow both of them. And typescript in my opinion don't really isolate very much complexity. But it does document what the 'complexity' is. So you can offload your memory tax to it. Put it away, do something else, and resume later by looking at what definition you write before. In this way. It can make managing a big project much easier if you make proper use of it. reply andrewflnr 57 minutes agorootparentYeah, TS is kinda rough that way. It's not my favorite. Harder job, rougher results, understandable to be honest. reply knome 12 hours agoparentprevI didn't get the general idea that the author thought they hid the complexity, but rather that they exposed and codified it. They gave the complexity that would previously live in your head somewhere it could be expressed. And once expressed, it can be iterated on. reply dartos 11 hours agorootparentEncoding complexity in your type system forces you to deal with that complexity throughout your codebase. It doesn’t give complexity a specific place to live. reply knome 11 hours agorootparentYou were going to have to deal with that complexity either way.

It doesn't differentiate between the complexity of the types themselves and the complexity of representing them in a static type system. reply sfn42 4 hours agorootparentIt certainly isn't bullshit. I take advantage of type systems every day to help me write code that works on the first try. Obviously I'm not saying all my code works on the first try, but it often does even when it's quite complex. The main problem is that a lot of developers don't know how to use the type system well, so they write code in a way that doesn't take advantage of the type system. Or they just write bad code in general that makes life difficult despite a type system. It doesn't solve all problems, but if you use it well it can solve a lot of problems very elegantly. reply yakshaving_jgt 5 hours agorootparentprevIf you parse a value into a guaranteed non-null value at the system boundary, then you have eliminated the need to check for that nullability throughout the rest of your codebase. Did you mean to write the literal polar opposite of what you wrote? reply tomnipotent 12 hours agoparentprevThe argument isn't that complexity is being hidden, but how it's managed and where it shows up in your experience of solving other problems. OP mentions: > The complexity was always there... it merely shone a light on the existing complexity, and gave us the opportunity — and a tool with which — to start grappling with it It's not about Rust vs. TypeScript per se but uses garbage collection and borrow checker as examples of two solutions to the same problem. For whatever task you have at hand, what abstractions offer the best value that lets you finish the solution to the satisfaction of constraints? > they are tightly coupled with the code written around them Which is where the cost of the abstractions comes in. Part of the struggle is when the software becomes more complicated to manage than the problems solved and abstractions move from benefit to liability. The abstractions of the stack prevent solving problems in a way that isn't bound to our dancing around them. If I'm working on a high-throughput networked service shuffling bytes using Protobuf, I'm going to be fighting Node to get the most out of CPU and memory. If I'm writing CRUD code in Rust shuffling JSON into an RDBMS I'm going to spending more time writing and thinking about types than I would just shuffling around arbitrarily nested bag-of-bags in Python with compute to spare. I always thought this was why microservices became popular, because it constrained the problem space of any one project so language abstractions remained net-positives. reply dartos 12 hours agorootparent> how it's managed and where it shows up in your experience of solving other problems That’s what I’m talking about. Encoding complexity in your types does not manage where that complexity lives or where you have to deal with it. It forces you to deal with that complexity everywhere in your codebase. reply tomnipotent 11 hours agorootparent> It forces you to deal with that complexity everywhere in your codebase. The alternative is fighting the abstraction. Imagine trying to write the Linux Kernel in JavaScript or Python. Lot less fighting types in your code, more time fighting the abstractions to achieve other things. Considering a big part of the kernel is types it makes sense to encode complexity within them. Going \"low-level\" implies that you're abandoning abstractions to use all the tools in the CS and compute toolbox and the baggage that entails. reply atoav 12 hours agoparentprevType systems like in Rust may introduce their own complexities, but they also help you tackle the complexity of bigger programs if wielded correctly. Typesystems can be complex to use, but in the end they constrain the degrees of freedom exposed by any given piece of code. With a type systems only very specific things can happen with any part of your code, most of which the programmer may have had in mind — without a type system the number of ways any piece of code could act within the program is way larger. Reducing the possible states of your program in the case of programming error is a reduction of complexity. Now I don't say type systems may introduce their own complexity, but in the case of Rust the complexity exposed is what systems programmers should handle. E.g. using different String types to signify to the programmer that your OS will not allow all possible strings as file names is the appropriate amount of complexity. Knowing how your program handles these is again reducing complexity. Imagine you wrote a module in a language where you don't handle these. Every now and then the module crashes specifically because it came across a malformed filename. Or phrased differently: The program does more than you intended, namely crashing when it encounters certain filenames. Good luck figuring that out and preventing it from happening again. With a type system the choice had to be explicitly made during programming already. Less things you code can do, less complexity. Many developers confuse complexity of the internal workings of a program with the complexity of the program exposed at the interface. These are separate properties that could become linked, but shouldn't. reply IronRod 3 hours agoprevI find this topic particularly interesting. I've often said to others that software, in itself, is a general abstraction of one or more complex tasks. The whole point of software is to hide complexity and make possible, in a hopefully simpler manner, doing things that would otherwise be very difficult or impossible. Despite what users may experience, the complexity remains but becomes hidden. reply layer8 4 hours agoprevI don’t think abstractions are inherently tied to hiding complexity. The purpose of an abstraction is to abstract over variations of a thing (think polymorphism), where each variation by itself might still be simple, or to separate essential features (e.g. parameters you have to pass) from accidental features (e.g. implementation details), where again there is no inherent implication of complexity on either side. In slightly different words, an abstraction separates what client code needs to reason about from what it should be able to ignore. Of course, if an abstraction isolates client code from certain complexities, that will contribute to the success of the abstraction. But it’s not the essence of what an abstraction does, or a necessary condition for it to count as successful. reply bb88 14 hours agoprevPython showed what relaxed types could do.

The author talks about complexity like it's always an intrinsic thing out there (essential) and the job of the abstraction is to deal with it.

I agree with this. Sometimes abstractions are the wrong ones. In a layered system, where each layer completely hides the layer below, sometimes abstraction inversion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_inversion) occurs where the right mechanism is at the bottom layer but intermediate layers hide it and make it inaccessible, leading to a crappy re-implementation that is slower and usually less capable. reply picografix 16 hours agoprevcomplexity has to live somewhere, code anxiety was a real thing for me reply amelius 5 hours agoparentuntil what happened? reply revskill 9 hours agoprevDoes complexity mean a long block of code with many levels of nested conditionals which are messed with cross-block mutable variables ? reply quotemstr 12 hours agoprevI have always felt that it's better to \"concentrate\" complexity into one key component and make the rest of the codebase simple than to distribute complexity evenly everywhere in some kind of open-coded swamp. reply gsf_emergency 16 hours agoprev>The question is first of all whether we have written them down anywhere The only hard thing in software: papers please (easily accessible documentation) reply stuartaxelowen 2 hours agoparentThe hard part about documentation is that it requires you to have a component that can be comprehensibly and sufficiently documented.

A well isolated/abstracted variant of that program is as simple as a blackbox with two or three inputs and a single output. One of the inputs are the files, the others might be a configuration file or user adjustable parameters like length. The program is well isolated if you can't give it any combination of inputs that doesn't produce a poem or an error message related to the usage of the program. A badly isolated variant of the same program would be one where the user had to think a lot about the internal behavior of the program, e.g. how file names are handled or where so many parameters of the poem generation have to be supplied as parameters, that the user essentially has to rewrite the core of program with their parameters. Or the user could supply a file that allows them to gain RCE or crash the program. reply timewizard 11 hours agoprev> Complexity has to live somewhere.

      "Complexity in software development should be managed and isolated rather than eliminated, as emphasized by Fred Hebert. In microservices, complexity is often hidden within individual services, while programming languages like Rust and TypeScript manage complexity through type systems and tools like Rust's borrow checker. Rust and TypeScript are favored by developers for their ability to reveal and manage complexity, allowing for successful abstractions by isolating complexity in well-defined areas."
    ],
    "commentSummary": [
      "Isolating complexity is essential for creating effective abstractions in software engineering, as it determines where complexity is managed and how it impacts cognitive load. Rust's type system requires programmers to handle memory complexity, contrasting with garbage collection systems that manage it at runtime, illustrating different tradeoffs in complexity management. The decision to expose or hide complexity through abstractions is crucial, with types and tests serving different purposes; types can constrain code behavior but also introduce their own complexities."

    "originBody": "My struggle with doom scrolling December 3, 2024 It's been a few months since I deleted a lot of apps on my phone and instead installed many restrictive apps to control my insatiable scrolling addiction. Fighting the interconnected reality There are simply too many means to escapism in one's electronic devices: Content apps: Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, etc. Work apps: Slack, Workplace, etc All these apps have moderate web apps, so no getaway while you have an easily accessible browser on your phone You can easily login to these websites on your work laptop Everything is hyper-connected and available at all times to occupy us. Wouldn't people prone to procrastination, such as myself, naturally choose to enter the rabbit hole if everything is at their fingertips? I think they would. At least, I did so. Do I need all these means of viewing content and scrolling at all times? Probably not. Let's experiment. The solution Delete content apps Entertainment: YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Reddit Information databases: GoodReads, StoryGraph, IMDB Messaging: Gmail, Slack Delete the browser from the phone Chrome, or rather disable it, because deleting it is not an option on my Android phone Google, a super-app on Android phones with the browsing feature Delete personal profile/browser from the work laptop I used to have \"Arc\" browser on my work laptop with my personal Google account profile Some early-stage issues Sharing a link/content from the work laptop to a personal space got more difficult. However, it's not a frequent problem. I lost access to some services I used with my personal account. It was more convenient to do a simple task while working on my corporate laptop. Again, a problem that one can get used to. Deleting Chrome browser and Google apps caused worse problems I didn't even realize until then that some separate apps rely on the Google super-app. Like the weather app or some functionalities of the translation app! I lost access to these functionalities with disabling the super-app. In some rare cases, the web app is better than the native Android app. I lost the ability to use them because I didn't have a browser anymore. Some bank transfers need the browser page for authentication. Rarely, some other operations get blocked too without a browser. Some quick, simple tasks don't need a whole Android app, a browser can handle them. But without a browser, those simple tasks become cumbersome. Without the Email app, it's difficult to quickly access a ticket or receipt when you need it outdoors, away from your laptop. Current Situation Deleting the personal account browser from the work laptop was successful. After a while, I got used to the minor inconveniences. More importantly, I removed some easily accessible procrastination tools from my professional workflow. No more checking personal emails, running quick online errands, or look something up. Deleting work feeds from my phone was also successful. I realized I don't really need Slack, Gmail and Workplace apps all the time. It helped me set healthy boundaries with work. Now I only check my messages when I'm behind my desk and I'm not busy with focused, deep work. Deleting content apps from my phone was another successful attempt. I've tried this method now and then. This time, I stuck with it once and for all. Deleting the browser apps from my phone proved more problematic, though. It impeded some daily operations with my phone. Some actions became impossible, as I mentioned in the previous part To resolve that, I had to return to having browser apps on my phone, but with new restrictions. Later modifications To resolve the complications of not having a browser on my phone, I took these steps: A minimal launch UI to break my habits: The new UI is a simplistic black screen with no widgets or app icons This app can restrict other apps or hide an app from the view For example, I use this feature to enable the Google super-app, but hide it completely. So it's difficult for me to open it directly. A more advanced website blocker and set restrictions on social media and browsing websites An interesting method I found in this app was to block distracting websites based on the location. I set them to be blocked at home, where I spend most of my focused time. A new browser instead of Chrome Doing this helped me break some old habits I've formed over the years with a browser I'm used to. For example, the Google ecosystem knew me too well and constantly recommended articles to me to click on. A new browser without this historical data helped me to focus on the task at hand instead of getting distracted by the shiny, new, but useless information online. The Results After a few months of making the above changes and applying some adjustments, I'm seeing its effects. I still procrastinate, however, my devices can't lure me into the rabbit hole anymore. I have more control over what's available to me and I have an easier time choosing the alternatives over infinite scrolling. These days when I spend time on my phone, I usually play \"Spelling Bee,\" a game I enjoy and it has a daily \"end\" state unlike the infinite content apps. When I reach that point, I know that there isn't much to do with my phone. I always wanted to expand my reading time but never got to do that with the constant exposure to easy content. It's been a while that I'm able to choose to read when I'm looking for something to do besides work and chores. I constantly need to find new ways to constrain my media consumption addictions, but I'm happy with my efforts. When it works, I feel saner and calmer and I do what I actually enjoy doing with my time. And if not, at least I'm doing what I need to do.",

It has storage for keys, wallet, and other things to grab when heading out. It has an abundance of wired and wireless chargers for all devices. Then I got a dumb (but nice) alarm clock for the bedroom. Then I noticed that a common reason to pick up the phone is to check the calendar. I ended up hanging a monitor on the wall, displaying the family month/agenda calendars. It’s read only, but it prevents a lot of device checking.

When I'm bored/tired enough, it becomes a game to disable my own restrictions. You see, I've actually had some success with using Blocksite on my phone and blackholing things on my laptop by editing /etc/hosts. Of course if you have the access to put these filters in-place then you'll have the access to remove them, but the time it takes to fire up the blocker on my phone and disable it or to pop open a shell and type \"mv /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.bak\" is time enough for me to go \"Am I actually accessing this because I care about some particular piece of content or am I just trying to plop myself into the dopameme stream?\" It's not about 100% physically preventing myself from accessing these sites. It's about interrupting the flow. I used to have a problem where I'd be doomscrolling FB or TikTok in particular, realize that I haven't had any actual fun in about half an hour, close the app and exit the loop for a second, start looking for something else to do and then compulsively open the app again and start doomscrolling. Getting rid of the apps and having the web version default to being unavailable has made it so that I can still do the social part of social media with real people who send me content that I actually like and want, but I can't do the completely antisocial part of social media where robots send me content designed to piss me off and frighten me so that I interact with them and their masters get money. I think there's one common element between our two approaches though: intentionality.

I've found that having no social media apps on my phone has helped. It also helps to stick to just Firefox+ublock on Android and resist every time a site tries to install an app. Try to steer clear of any sites with infinite scrolling and recognize the dark patterns that try to suck you in. One thing that was eye-opening was to visit reddit and see which of the stories in /r/all were \"amygdala-bait\"; rage, indignation, hate, fear, superiority, they're all bait on the hook to reel you in. People on reddit write fake stories that push as many buttons as possible; an obviously wrong/evil antagonist, the ridiculous situations that only get more and more extreme to try to attract notice, the righteous moral superiority over the antagonist and their minions, etc etc. Realizing that the result is the same, whether it's a fake story or \"news\", it's all amgydala-bait.

I don't necessarily do \"doom\" scrolling, but lately I have gotten drawn into wasting time on these various stupid \"shorts\" or \"reels\" or whatever, mostly on FB. It's weird too... for ages I was vehement about never, ever clicking on any of that crap on FB or Youtube (and I barely use Instagram at all and don't even have TikTok). But one day, somehow, I got suckered in by a thumbnail of a cute dog or something, and lately I've been finding myself wasting an hour or more at a time, idly watching stupid videos of low value crapola. :-( This is a habit I feel like I absolutely have to shed. Luckily, a lot of the impetus to do that will go away when I ditch FB, which I'm going to do as soon as I get my new personal website/blog set up. reply nobodywasishere 1 hour agoparentI finally broke wasting hours on YouTube shorts (and youtube in general) by turning off the watch history on my account [1]. It completely removes all videos from the \"homepage\" (including shorts from the sidebar). There are still shorts in the subscriptions page, but I think this is an acceptable tradeoff. YouTube for me now has just become who I'm subscribed to, which is a much more pleasant experience there's an \"end\" where I'm finally caught up and can move on to doing something else.

It also adds another layer of difficulty to stopping your own doom scrolling/excessive internet usage with so many people ignoring reality in favor of whatever the algorithm serves them up on their phone, there are far fewer chances to socialize in real life, social skills atrophy, and the cycle continues.

You're right that in general it's about getting those random dopamine hits when something nice appears in the news feed. However, after some time, you got a lot of the nice stuff and no exciting stuff appears anymore. At that point, you're still scrolling, hoping for a dopamine hit. It does not come because you are satiated, desensitized and the algorithm no longer has good stuff to offer you. I get it here on Hacker News.

You could model the failure of \"delete everything\" strategies as hitting against this hard constraint: banking, authentication, and basic services simply assume browser availability. Maybe the key insight here is the pivot from prohibition to differential friction. By architecturing high activation energy for distractions (black UI, location blocks) while maintaining low friction for utilities, you've essentially created a \"price spread\" between productive and unproductive uses of the same capability. I suspect we're seeing an inevitable arms race: platforms driving activation energy toward zero (think TikTok's frictionless feed) versus commitment devices manufacturing artificial friction.

I have tried a few different strats: * ScreenZen on IOS breaks up screen time into discrete sections rather than a lump sum (e.g. 10 segments of 10 minutes each) making it much easier to know each time I've used a segment (\"okay, that was ten minutes, do I want to go again?\"). * Utilizing focus modes aggressively. DND and Sleep mode can be used aggressively to limit notification spam. While I'm at it I regularly go through my notification list and prune any app that has no pressing need to notify (or demote it to the daily summary). * physical separation: my friend put me on to this, which is if I can do something without my phone, I'll consider it. Yesterday I drove to the store and back without my phone. Not feeling that weight in your pocket and not having it there to fill your time is a powerful experience.

I did this recently with the Bluesky and Discord apps, for example. reply boomskats 6 hours agoprevA little over a year ago I gave away my flagship samsung phablet and bought one of their flip phones, in an attempt to change my habits by consciously making myself doubtful/anxious about the longevity of the flip phone's infamous hinge. The idea was that the little front screen would do everything that a semi-dumb phone replacement could (notifications, camera, calls, timers, calculator, calendar), but I'd also have a 'real smartphone' whenever I needed one it's just that with this one, using it came at a cost. Every time I'd go to use the big screen I'd remember there was an anxious moment that stood in the way, and the paranoia would make me just anxious enough to question whether I really needed to do what I was about to do. It's been about 15 months, and I haven't really had to compromise or sacrifice anything: I haven't uninstalled any social media apps, my banking apps are all still there, I have contactless payments on hand, etc.. However, I can say with absolute certainty that my habits have changed _drastically_. Interestingly, I'm not even hesitant to use the phone when I need to, I use it all the time but when I use it I now use it intentionally, and very briefly; gone are the days of catching myself somehow scrolling through instagram just because 5 minutes ago I opened a whatsapp notification from my mum. It's like night and day, and what's more I feel like I barely had to try. This is obviously sample of one anecdata, but I'm genuinely surprised at how successful it's been. A real 'life hack'. (And no I don't have any samsung coupon codes nor do I particularly care for them as a company. Worth mentioning though the hinge on the zf5 is still really solid 15 months in) reply nicholassmith 1 hour agoparentI do the same thing (Motorola Razr rather than Samsung), and I've found that working on the smaller screen means I don't get sucked into things as it's useful for quickly checking on a limited set of apps but doesn't lend itself to a \"open app => consume => next app\" cycle. reply gman83 6 hours agoprevIt's really too bad that you can't disable YouTube shorts.

You don't get watch-progress memory on videos, which is simple to adjust to. Recommended are less targeted and I get a lot of the typical ragey youtube stuff but it is mostly half relevant. I no longer watch any shorts which I kept clicking just to \"see how bad they are\" until it became a habit. And the UI keeps pushing it... If youtube makes the no-watch-history method not work, I'm just deleting the app and waiting until I'm bothered to configure revanced. reply latexr 6 hours agoparentprevThis may not apply to you, but the way I consume YouTube is by turning off history and subscribing to the creators I want via RSS.

As long as there's a logged in session somewhere, I have to have various tricks and extensions on my browser to manage things. Most have been only varying degrees of successful, often ending up in me just disabling the feature whenever I want to get my fix. The most successful iteration I've found so far is keeping these apps uninstalled from my phone, and using https://one-sec.app/ to forcibly install a barrier between me and the site. It's not too much different, and the wait time can be customised. You can still just learn to wait through it, but importantly it also has an \"intervention\" feature that will block you off after a chosen time period and re-prompt you if you want to stay on. It's been quite flaky on Instagram on desktop, but it's been very useful for Youtube on mobile (which I keep to play videos in the background sometimes). Otherwise, Unhook for Youtube on desktop also helps blocking things like the home page and shorts.

Something about his approach that I really appreciate is that he doesn't just recommend abstention and ways to disconnect from social media. His approach is on the one hand to focus on other rewarding offline activities that are creative or which help grow deep in-person relationships. And on the other hand, to engage with technology in specific ways when that usage is justified by being the best way to solve a particular need. For an example of the latter, one suggested practise is to always keep your phone on do-not-disturb (except for certain important contacts who may genuinely need to phone you in an emergency) and then to triage any notifications only at specific limited times of the day. Avoid the buzzes and pings, but carry on conversations when you aren't trying to focus on something else. reply dash2 6 hours agoprevI had reasonable success deleting Safari from my iPhone.

There are no technical blockers to letting me do these; they aren't even much technical work. It would be a material life improvements for me (and I believe for everyone). But I'm not allowed to use the subsets of consumer tech which would enrich my life without exposing myself to the Reels button, the For You feed, and an avalanche of black magic attention hacking. I am bad at moderating my use and I have a low tolerance for doomscrolling, so I don't let myself use these products. As a result I'm cut off from the genuinely life improving subsets of social media which could be so easily made available. We just accept that _of course_ you have to be willing to get your frontal lobe mined if you want to see what your friends have been doing. _Of course_ you have to be willing to scroll an infinite feed of AI-generated slop if you want to read opinions from people you respect. I'm perfectly happy to see ads, I'm happy to pay money, I'm happy to come to any fair economic arrangement; but I value my attention highly and I can't pay the attentional price demanded of me, so I don't get to use these products. People on this site might say \"just don't use Reels / For You Feed\" and maybe they're right. But for me and the vast majority of people that's not an option, it's my individual willpower pitted against an army of designers, PMs and data scientists every hour of the day. I am happier without social media than I was with it; but I would be much happier still with the genuinely enriching subset of social media which is there for the offering. As social media becomes a bigger and bigger part of modern life it feels more like essential infrastructure which we _should_ be able to access in ways which work for us. The Fediverse is a great step though I haven't gone as far as to built a custom frontend which works for me (I think it's a big untapped market). Youtube is the clear winner here. They let you turn personalization off at which point the Recommended tab disappears, Youtube Shorts don't work, and I can still see new videos from people I subscribe to and follow links to videos when I need to watch them. It's a fantastic compromise and I live in fear of some PM (maybe reading this thread) inevitably realizing they could squeeze a few more minutes of sweet attention juice out of me by taking it away. reply felipeerias 6 hours agoprevThe nature of programming means that there are a lot of small gaps while you work, for example as the code is compiling and deploying.

Columns for Senior Women Web Social Movements The Civil Rights Movement Social Protest in the Sixties Political Parties Reporting on the Right War Reviews Cranston Campaign Diary (1984) THE TYRANNY of STRUCTURELESSNESS by Jo Freeman aka Joreen The earliest version of this article was given as a talk at a conference called by the Southern Female Rights Union, held in Beulah, Mississippi in May 1970. It was written up for Notes from the Third Year (1971), but the editors did not use it. It was then submitted to several movement publications, but only one asked permission to publish it; others did so without permission. The first official place of publication was in Vol. 2, No. 1 of The Second Wave (1972). This early version in movement publications was authored by Joreen. Different versions were published in the Berkeley Journal of Sociology, Vol. 17, 1972-73, pp. 151-165, and Ms. magazine, July 1973, pp. 76-78, 86-89, authored by Jo Freeman. This piece spread all over the world. Numerous people have edited, reprinted, cut, and translated \"Tyranny\" for magazines, books and web sites, usually without the permission or knowledge of the author. The version below is a blend of the three cited here. During the years in which the women's liberation movement has been taking shape, a great emphasis has been placed on what are called leaderless, structureless groups as the main if not sole organizational form of the movement. The source of this idea was a natural reaction against the over-structured society in which most of us found ourselves, and the inevitable control this gave others over our lives, and the continual elitism of the Left and similar groups among those who were supposedly fighting this overstructuredness. The idea of \"structurelessness,\" however, has moved from a healthy counter to those tendencies to becoming a goddess in its own right. The idea is as little examined as the term is much used, but it has become an intrinsic and unquestioned part of women's liberation ideology. For the early development of the movement this did not much matter. It early defined its main goal, and its main method, as consciousness-raising, and the \"structureless\" rap group was an excellent means to this end. The looseness and informality of it encouraged participation in discussion, and its often supportive atmosphere elicited personal insight. If nothing more concrete than personal insight ever resulted from these groups, that did not much matter, because their purpose did not really extend beyond this. The basic problems didn't appear until individual rap groups exhausted the virtues of consciousness-raising and decided they wanted to do something more specific. At this point they usually foundered because most groups were unwilling to change their structure when they changed their tasks. Women had thoroughly accepted the idea of \"structurelessness\" without realizing the limitations of its uses. People would try to use the \"structureless\" group and the informal conference for purposes for which they were unsuitable out of a blind belief that no other means could possibly be anything but oppressive. If the movement is to grow beyond these elementary stages of development, it will have to disabuse itself of some of its prejudices about organization and structure. There is nothing inherently bad about either of these. They can be and often are misused, but to reject them out of hand because they are misused is to deny ourselves the necessary tools to further development. We need to understand why \"structurelessness\" does not work. FORMAL AND INFORMAL STRUCTURES Contrary to what we would like to believe, there is no such thing as a structureless group. Any group of people of whatever nature that comes together for any length of time for any purpose will inevitably structure itself in some fashion. The structure may be flexible; it may vary over time; it may evenly or unevenly distribute tasks, power and resources over the members of the group. But it will be formed regardless of the abilities, personalities, or intentions of the people involved. The very fact that we are individuals, with different talents, predispositions, and backgrounds makes this inevitable. Only if we refused to relate or interact on any basis whatsoever could we approximate structurelessness and that is not the nature of a human group. This means that to strive for a structureless group is as useful, and as deceptive, as to aim at an \"objective\" news story, \"value-free\" social science, or a \"free\" economy. A \"laissez faire\" group is about as realistic as a \"laissez faire\" society; the idea becomes a smokescreen for the strong or the lucky to establish unquestioned hegemony over others. This hegemony can be so easily established because the idea of \"structurelessness\" does not prevent the formation of informal structures, only formal ones. Similarly \"laissez faire\" philosophy did not prevent the economically powerful from establishing control over wages, prices, and distribution of goods; it only prevented the government from doing so. Thus structurelessness becomes a way of masking power, and within the women's movement is usually most strongly advocated by those who are the most powerful (whether they are conscious of their power or not). As long as the structure of the group is informal, the rules of how decisions are made are known only to a few and awareness of power is limited to those who know the rules. Those who do not know the rules and are not chosen for initiation must remain in confusion, or suffer from paranoid delusions that something is happening of which they are not quite aware. For everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and to participate in its activities the structure must be explicit, not implicit. The rules of decision-making must be open and available to everyone, and this can happen only if they are formalized. This is not to say that formalization of a structure of a group will destroy the informal structure. It usually doesn't. But it does hinder the informal structure from having predominant control and make available some means of attacking it if the people involved are not at least responsible to the needs of the group at large. \"Structurelessness\" is organizationally impossible. We cannot decide whether to have a structured or structureless group, only whether or not to have a formally structured one. Therefore the word will not be used any longer except to refer to the idea it represents. Unstructured will refer to those groups which have not been deliberately structured in a particular manner. Structured will refer to those which have. A Structured group always has formal structure, and may also have an informal, or covert, structure. It is this informal structure, particularly in Unstructured groups, which forms the basis for elites. THE NATURE OF ELITISM \"Elitist\" is probably the most abused word in the women's liberation movement. It is used as frequently, and for the same reasons, as \"pinko\" was used in the fifties. It is rarely used correctly. Within the movement it commonly refers to individuals, though the personal characteristics and activities of those to whom it is directed may differ widely: An individual, as an individual can never be an elitist, because the only proper application of the term \"elite\" is to groups. Any individual, regardless of how well-known that person may be, can never be an elite. Correctly, an elite refers to a small group of people who have power over a larger group of which they are part, usually without direct responsibility to that larger group, and often without their knowledge or consent. A person becomes an elitist by being part of, or advocating the rule by, such a small group, whether or not that individual is well known or not known at all. Notoriety is not a definition of an elitist. The most insidious elites are usually run by people not known to the larger public at all. Intelligent elitists are usually smart enough not to allow themselves to become well known; when they become known, they are watched, and the mask over their power is no longer firmly lodged. Elites are not conspiracies. Very seldom does a small group of people get together and deliberately try to take over a larger group for its own ends. Elites are nothing more, and nothing less, than groups of friends who also happen to participate in the same political activities. They would probably maintain their friendship whether or not they were involved in political activities; they would probably be involved in political activities whether or not they maintained their friendships. It is the coincidence of these two phenomena which creates elites in any group and makes them so difficult to break. These friendship groups function as networks of communication outside any regular channels for such communication that may have been set up by a group. If no channels are set up, they function as the only networks of communication. Because people are friends, because they usually share the same values and orientations, because they talk to each other socially and consult with each other when common decisions have to be made, the people involved in these networks have more power in the group than those who don't. And it is a rare group that does not establish some informal networks of communication through the friends that are made in it. Some groups, depending on their size, may have more than one such informal communications network. Networks may even overlap. When only one such network exists, it is the elite of an otherwise Unstructured group, whether the participants in it want to be elitists or not. If it is the only such network in a Structured group it may or may not be an elite depending on its composition and the nature of the formal Structure. If there are two or more such networks of friends, they may compete for power within the group, thus forming factions, or one may deliberately opt out of the competition, leaving the other as the elite. In a Structured group, two or more such friendship networks usually compete with each other for formal power. This is often the healthiest situation, as the other members are in a position to arbitrate between the two competitors for power and thus to make demands on those to whom they give their temporary allegiance. The inevitably elitist and exclusive nature of informal communication networks of friends is neither a new phenomenon characteristic of the women's movement nor a phenomenon new to women. Such informal relationships have excluded women for centuries from participating in integrated groups of which they were a part. In any profession or organization these networks have created the \"locker room\" mentality and the \"old school\" ties which have effectively prevented women as a group (as well as some men individually) from having equal access to the sources of power or social reward. Much of the energy of past women's movements has been directed to having the structures of decision-making and the selection processes formalized so that the exclusion of women could be confronted directly. As we well know, these efforts have not prevented the informal male-only networks from discriminating against women, but they have made it more difficult. Because elites are informal does not mean they are invisible. At any small group meeting anyone with a sharp eye and an acute ear can tell who is influencing whom. The members of a friendship group will relate more to each other than to other people. They listen more attentively, and interrupt less; they repeat each other's points and give in amiably; they tend to ignore or grapple with the \"outs\" whose approval is not necessary for making a decision. But it is necessary for the \"outs\" to stay on good terms with the \"ins.\" Of course the lines are not as sharp as I have drawn them. They are nuances of interaction, not prewritten scripts. But they are discernible, and they do have their effect. Once one knows with whom it is important to check before a decision is made, and whose approval is the stamp of acceptance, one knows who is running things. Since movement groups have made no concrete decisions about who shall exercise power within them, many different criteria are used around the country. Most criteria are along the lines of traditional female characteristics. For instance, in the early days of the movement, marriage was usually a prerequisite for participation in the informal elite. As women have been traditionally taught, married women relate primarily to each other, and look upon single women as too threatening to have as close friends. In many cities, this criterion was further refined to include only those women married to New Left men. This standard had more than tradition behind it, however, because New Left men often had access to resources needed by the movement such as mailing lists, printing presses, contacts, and information and women were used to getting what they needed through men rather than independently. As the movement has charged through time, marriage has become a less universal criterion for effective participation, but all informal elites establish standards by which only women who possess certain material or personal characteristics may join. They frequently include: middle-class background (despite all the rhetoric about relating to the working class); being married; not being married but living with someone; being or pretending to be a lesbian; being between the ages of twenty and thirty; being college educated or at least having some college background; being \"hip\"; not being too \"hip\"; holding a certain political line or identification as a \"radical\"; having children or at least liking them; not having children; having certain \"feminine\" personality characteristics such as being \"nice\"; dressing right (whether in the traditional style or the antitraditional style); etc. There are also some characteristics which will almost always tag one as a \"deviant\" who should not be related to. They include: being too old; working full time, particularly if one is actively committed to a \"career\"; not being \"nice\"; and being avowedly single (i.e., neither actively heterosexual nor homosexual). Other criteria could be included, but they all have common themes. The characteristics prerequisite for participating in the informal elites of the movement, and thus for exercising power, concern one's background, personality, or allocation of time. They do not include one's competence, dedication to feminism, talents, or potential contribution to the movement. The former are the criteria one usually uses in determining one's friends. The latter are what any movement or organization has to use if it is going to be politically effective. The criteria of participation may differ from group to group, but the means of becoming a member of the informal elite if one meets those criteria art pretty much the same. The only main difference depends on whether one is in a group from the beginning, or joins it after it has begun. If involved from the beginning it is important to have as many of one's personal friends as possible also join. If no one knows anyone else very well, then one must deliberately form friendships with a select number and establish the informal interaction patterns crucial to the creation of an informal structure. Once the informal patterns are formed they act to maintain themselves, and one of the most successful tactics of maintenance is to continuously recruit new people who \"fit in.\" One joins such an elite much the same way one pledges a sorority. If perceived as a potential addition, one is \"rushed\" by the members of the informal structure and eventually either dropped or initiated. If the sorority is not politically aware enough to actively engage in this process itself it can be started by the outsider pretty much the same way one joins any private club. Find a sponsor, i.e., pick some member of the elite who appears to be well respected within it, and actively cultivate that person's friendship. Eventually, she will most likely bring you into the inner circle. All of these procedures take time. So if one works full time or has a similar major commitment, it is usually impossible to join simply because there are not enough hours left to go to all the meetings and cultivate the personal relationship necessary to have a voice in the decision-making. That is why formal structures of decision making are a boon to the overworked person. Having an established process for decision-making ensures that everyone can participate in it to some extent. Although this dissection of the process of elite formation within small groups has been critical in perspective, it is not made in the belief that these informal structures are inevitably bad merely inevitable. All groups create informal structures as a result of interaction patterns among the members of the group. Such informal structures can do very useful things But only Unstructured groups are totally governed by them. When informal elites are combined with a myth of \"structurelessness,\" there can be no attempt to put limits on the use of power. It becomes capricious. This has two potentially negative consequences of which we should be aware. The first is that the informal structure of decision-making will be much like a sorority one in which people listen to others because they like them and not because they say significant things. As long as the movement does not do significant things this does not much matter. But if its development is not to be arrested at this preliminary stage, it will have to alter this trend. The second is that informal structures have no obligation to be responsible to the group at large. Their power was not given to them; it cannot be taken away. Their influence is not based on what they do for the group; therefore they cannot be directly influenced by the group. This does not necessarily make informal structures irresponsible. Those who are concerned with maintaining their influence will usually try to be responsible. The group simply cannot compel such responsibility; it is dependent on the interests of the elite. THE \"STAR\" SYSTEM The idea of \"structurelessness\" has created the \"star\" system. We live in a society which expects political groups to make decisions and to select people to articulate those decisions to the public at large. The press and the public do not know how to listen seriously to individual women as women; they want to know how the group feels. Only three techniques have ever been developed for establishing mass group opinion: the vote or referendum, the public opinion survey questionnaire, and the selection of group spokespeople at an appropriate meeting. The women's liberation movement has used none of these to communicate with the public. Neither the movement as a whole nor most of the multitudinous groups within it have established a means of explaining their position on various issues. But the public is conditioned to look for spokespeople. While it has consciously not chosen spokespeople, the movement has thrown up many women who have caught the public eye for varying reasons. These women represent no particular group or established opinion; they know this and usually say so. But because there are no official spokespeople nor any decision-making body that the press can query when it wants to know the movement's position on a subject, these women are perceived as the spokespeople. Thus, whether they want to or not, whether the movement likes it or not, women of public note are put in the role of spokespeople by default. This is one main source of the ire that is often felt toward the women who are labeled \"stars.\" Because they were not selected by the women in the movement to represent the movement's views, they are resented when the press presumes that they speak for the movement. But as long as the movement does not select its own spokeswomen, such women will be placed in that role by the press and the public, regardless of their own desires. This has several negative consequences for both the movement and the women labeled \"stars.\" First, because the movement didn't put them in the role of spokesperson, the movement cannot remove them. The press put them there and only the press can choose not to listen. The press will continue to look to \"stars\" as spokeswomen as long as it has no official alternatives to go to for authoritative statements from the movement. The movement has no control in the selection of its representatives to the public as long as it believes that it should have no representatives at all. Second, women put in this position often find themselves viciously attacked by their sisters. This achieves nothing for the movement and is painfully destructive to the individuals involved. Such attacks only result in either the woman leaving the movement entirely-often bitterly alienated or in her ceasing to feel responsible to her \"sisters.\" She may maintain some loyalty to the movement, vaguely defined, but she is no longer susceptible to pressures from other women in it. One cannot feel responsible to people who have been the source of such pain without being a masochist, and these women are usually too strong to bow to that kind of personal pressure. Thus the backlash to the \"star\" system in effect encourages the very kind of individualistic nonresponsibility that the movement condemns. By purging a sister as a \"star,\" the movement loses whatever control it may have had over the person who then becomes free to commit all of the individualistic sins of which she has been accused. POLITICAL IMPOTENCE Unstructured groups may be very effective in getting women to talk about their lives; they aren't very good for getting things done. It is when people get tired of \"just talking\" and want to do something more that the groups flounder, unless they change the nature of their operation. Occasionally, the developed informal structure of the group coincides with an available need that the group can fill in such a way as to give the appearance that an Unstructured group \"works.\" That is, the group has fortuitously developed precisely the kind of structure best suited for engaging in a particular project. While working in this kind of group is a very heady experience, it is also rare and very hard to replicate. There are almost inevitably four conditions found in such a group; 1) It is task oriented. Its function is very narrow and very specific, like putting on a conference or putting out a newspaper. It is the task that basically structures the group. The task determines what needs to be done and when it needs to be done. It provides a guide by which people can judge their actions and make plans for future activity. 2) It is relatively small and homogeneous. Homogeneity is necessary to insure that participants have a \"common language\" for interaction. People from widely different backgrounds may provide richness to a consciousness-raising group where each can learn from the others' experience, but too great a diversity among members of a task-oriented group means only that they continually misunderstand each other. Such diverse people interpret words and actions differently. They have different expectations about each other's behavior and judge the results according to different criteria. If everyone knows everyone else well enough to understand the nuances, these can be accommodated. Usually, they only lead to confusion and endless hours spent straightening out conflicts no one ever thought would arise. 3) There is a high degree of communication. Information must be passed on to everyone, opinions checked, work divided up, and participation assured in the relevant decisions. This is only possible if the group is small and people practically live together for the most crucial phases of the task. Needless to say, the number of interactions necessary to involve everybody increases geometrically with the number of participants. This inevitably limits group participants to about five, or excludes some from some of the decisions. Successful groups can be as large as 10 or 15, but only when they are in fact composed of several smaller subgroups which perform specific parts of the task, and whose members overlap with each other so that knowledge of what the different subgroups are doing can be passed around easily. 4) There is a low degree of skill specialization. Not everyone has to be able to do everything, but everything must be able to be done by more than one person. Thus no one is indispensable. To a certain extent, people become interchangeable parts. While these conditions can occur serendipitously in small groups, this is not possible in large ones. Consequently, because the larger movement in most cities is as unstructured as individual rap groups, it is not too much more effective than the separate groups at specific tasks. The informal structure is rarely together enough or in touch enough with the people to be able to operate effectively. So the movement generates much motion and few results. Unfortunately, the consequences of all this motion are not as innocuous as the results' and their victim is the movement itself. Some groups have formed themselves into local action projects if they do not involve many people and work on a small scale. But this form restricts movement activity to the local level; it cannot be done on the regional or national. Also, to function well the groups must usually pare themselves down to that informal group of friends who were running things in the first place. This excludes many women from participating. As long as the only way women can participate in the movement is through membership in a small group, the nongregarious are at a distinct disadvantage. As long as friendship groups are the main means of organizational activity, elitism becomes institutionalized. For those groups which cannot find a local project to which to devote themselves, the mere act of staying together becomes the reason for their staying together. When a group has no specific task (and consciousness raising is a task), the people in it turn their energies to controlling others in the group. This is not done so much out of a malicious desire to manipulate others (though sometimes it is) as out of a lack of anything better to do with their talents. Able people with time on their hands and a need to justify their coming together put their efforts into personal control, and spend their time criticizing the personalities of the other members in the group. Infighting and personal power games rule the day. When a group is involved in a task, people learn to get along with others as they are and to subsume personal dislikes for the sake of the larger goal. There are limits placed on the compulsion to remold every person in our image of what they should be. The end of consciousness-raising leaves people with no place to go, and the lack of structure leaves them with no way of getting there. The women the movement either turn in on themselves and their sisters or seek other alternatives of action. There are few that are available. Some women just \"do their own thing.\" This can lead to a great deal of individual creativity, much of which is useful for the movement, but it is not a viable alternative for most women and certainly does not foster a spirit of cooperative group effort. Other women drift out of the movement entirely because they don't want to develop an individual project and they have found no way of discovering, joining, or starting group projects that interest them. Many turn to other political organizations to give them the kind of structured, effective activity that they have not been able to find in the women's movement. Those political organizations which see women's liberation as only one of many issues to which women should devote their time thus find the movement a vast recruiting ground for new members. There is no need for such organizations to \"infiltrate\" (though this is not precluded). The desire for meaningful political activity generated in women by their becoming part of the women's liberation movement is sufficient to make them eager to join other organizations when the movement itself provides no outlets for their new ideas and energies. Those women who join other political organizations while remaining within the women's liberation movement, or who join women's liberation while remaining in other political organizations, in turn become the framework for new informal structures. These friendship networks are based upon their common nonfeminist politics rather than the characteristics discussed earlier, but operate in much the same way. Because these women share common values, ideas, and political orientations, they too become informal, unplanned, unselected, unresponsible elites whether they intend to be so or not. These new informal elites are often perceived as threats by the old informal elites previously developed within different movement groups. This is a correct perception. Such politically oriented networks are rarely willing to be merely \"sororities\" as many of the old ones were, and want to proselytize their political as well as their feminist ideas. This is only natural, but its implications for women's liberation have never been adequately discussed. The old elites are rarely willing to bring such differences of opinion out into the open because it would involve exposing the nature of the informal structure of the group. Many of these informal elites have been hiding under the banner of \"anti-elitism\" and \"structurelessness.\" To effectively counter the competition from another informal structure, they would have to become \"public,\" and this possibility is fraught with many dangerous implications. Thus, to maintain its own power, it is easier to rationalize the exclusion of the members of the other informal structure by such means as \"red-baiting,\" \"reformist-baiting,\" \"lesbian-baiting,\" or \"straight-baiting.\" The only other alternative is to formally structure the group in such a way that the original power structure is institutionalized. This is not always possible. If the informal elites have been well structured and have exercised a fair amount of power in the past, such a task is feasible. These groups have a history of being somewhat politically effective in the past, as the tightness of the informal structure has proven an adequate substitute for a formal structure. Becoming Structured does not alter their operation much, though the institutionalization of the power structure does open it to formal challenge. It is those groups which are in greatest need of structure that are often least capable of creating it. Their informal structures have not been too well formed and adherence to the ideology of \"structurelessness\" makes them reluctant to change tactics. The more Unstructured a group is, the more lacking it is in informal structures, and the more it adheres to an ideology of \"structurelessness,\" the more vulnerable it is to being taken over by a group of political comrades. Since the movement at large is just as Unstructured as most of its constituent groups, it is similarly susceptible to indirect influence. But the phenomenon manifests itself differently. On a local level most groups can operate autonomously; but the only groups that can organize a national activity are nationally organized groups. Thus, it is often the Structured feminist organizations that provide national direction for feminist activities, and this direction is determined by the priorities of those organizations. Such groups as NOW, WEAL, and some leftist women's caucuses are simply the only organizations capable of mounting a national campaign. The multitude of Unstructured women's liberation groups can choose to support or not support the national campaigns, but are incapable of mounting their own. Thus their members become the troops under the leadership of the Structured organizations. The avowedly Unstructured groups have no way of drawing upon the movement's vast resources to support its priorities. It doesn't even have a way of deciding what they are. The more unstructured a movement it, the less control it has over the directions in which it develops and the political actions in which it engages. This does not mean that its ideas do not spread. Given a certain amount of interest by the media and the appropriateness of social conditions, the ideas will still be diffused widely. But diffusion of ideas does not mean they are implemented; it only means they are talked about. Insofar as they can be applied individually they may be acted on; insofar as they require coordinated political power to be implemented, they will not be. As long as the women's liberation movement stays dedicated to a form of organization which stresses small, inactive discussion groups among friends, the worst problems of Unstructuredness will not be felt. But this style of organization has its limits; it is politically inefficacious, exclusive, and discriminatory against those women who are not or cannot be tied into the friendship networks. Those who do not fit into what already exists because of class, race, occupation, education, parental or marital status, personality, etc., will inevitably be discouraged from trying to participate. Those who do fit in will develop vested interests in maintaining things as they are. The informal groups' vested interests will be sustained by the informal structures which exist, and the movement will have no way of determining who shall exercise power within it. If the movement continues deliberately to not select who shall exercise power, it does not thereby abolish power. All it does is abdicate the right to demand that those who do exercise power and influence be responsible for it. If the movement continues to keep power as diffuse as possible because it knows it cannot demand responsibility from those who have it, it does prevent any group or person from totally dominating. But it simultaneously insures that the movement is as ineffective as possible. Some middle ground between domination and ineffectiveness can and must be found. These problems are coming to a head at this time because the nature of the movement is necessarily changing. Consciousness-raising as the main function of the women's liberation movement is becoming obsolete. Due to the intense press publicity of the last two years and the numerous overground books and articles now being circulated, women's liberation has become a household word. Its issues are discussed and informal rap groups are formed by people who have no explicit connection with any movement group. The movement must go on to other tasks. It now needs to establish its priorities, articulate its goals, and pursue its objectives in a coordinated fashion. To do this it must get organized locally, regionally, and nationally. PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRATIC STRUCTURING Once the movement no longer clings tenaciously to the ideology of \"structurelessness,\" it is free to develop those forms of organization best suited to its healthy functioning. This does not mean that we should go to the other extreme and blindly imitate the traditional forms of organization. But neither should we blindly reject them all. Some of the traditional techniques will prove useful, albeit not perfect; some will give us insights into what we should and should not do to obtain certain ends with minimal costs to the individuals in the movement. Mostly, we will have to experiment with different kinds of structuring and develop a variety of techniques to use for different situations. The Lot System is one such idea which has emerged from the movement. It is not applicable to all situations, but is useful in some. Other ideas for structuring are needed. But before we can proceed to experiment intelligently, we must accept the idea that there is nothing inherently bad about structure itself only its excess use. While engaging in this trial-and-error process, there are some principles we can keep in mind that are essential to democratic structuring and are also politically effective: 1) Delegation of specific authority to specific individuals for specific tasks by democratic procedures. Letting people assume jobs or tasks only by default means they are not dependably done. If people are selected to do a task, preferably after expressing an interest or willingness to do it, they have made a commitment which cannot so easily be ignored. 2) Requiring all those to whom authority has been delegated to be responsible to those who selected them. This is how the group has control over people in positions of authority. Individuals may exercise power, but it is the group that has ultimate say over how the power is exercised. 3) Distribution of authority among as many people as is reasonably possible. This prevents monopoly of power and requires those in positions of authority to consult with many others in the process of exercising it. It also gives many people the opportunity to have responsibility for specific tasks and thereby to learn different skills. 4) Rotation of tasks among individuals. Responsibilities which are held too long by one person, formally or informally, come to be seen as that person's \"property\" and are not easily relinquished or controlled by the group. Conversely, if tasks are rotated too frequently the individual does not have time to learn her job well and acquire the sense of satisfaction of doing a good job. 5) Allocation of tasks along rational criteria. Selecting someone for a position because they are liked by the group or giving them hard work because they are disliked serves neither the group nor the person in the long run. Ability, interest, and responsibility have got to be the major concerns in such selection. People should be given an opportunity to learn skills they do not have, but this is best done through some sort of \"apprenticeship\" program rather than the \"sink or swim\" method. Having a responsibility one can't handle well is demoralizing. Conversely, being blacklisted from doing what one can do well does not encourage one to develop one's skills. Women have been punished for being competent throughout most of human history; the movement does not need to repeat this process. 6) Diffusion of information to everyone as frequently as possible. Information is power. Access to information enhances one's power. When an informal network spreads new ideas and information among themselves outside the group, they are already engaged in the process of forming an opinion without the group participating. The more one knows about how things work and what is happening, the more politically effective one can be. 7) Equal access to resources needed by the group. This is not always perfectly possible, but should be striven for. A member who maintains a monopoly over a needed resource (like a printing press owned by a husband, or a darkroom) can unduly influence the use of that resource. Skills and information are also resources. Members' skills can be equitably available only when members are willing to teach what they know to others. When these principles are applied, they insure that whatever structures are developed by different movement groups will be controlled by and responsible to the group. The group of people in positions of authority will be diffuse, flexible, open, and temporary. They will not be in such an easy position to institutionalize their power because ultimate decisions will be made by the group at large. The group will have the power to determine who shall exercise authority within it. To Top Books by JoWhat's NewAbout JoPhotosPolitical Buttons HomeSearchLinksContact JoArticles by Jo",

Any time it comes up people invariably go, \"Yeah, so that is why we should institute a hierarchy\" which is not at all what Freeman was saying. > Once the movement no longer clings tenaciously to the ideology of \"structurelessness,\" it is free to develop those forms of organization best suited to its healthy functioning. This does not mean that we should go to the other extreme and blindly imitate the traditional forms of organization. She mentions some concrete ideas: Leaders do not select their teams, instead, teams select their spokesperson. A spokesperson does not have authority over the team but can make decisions on their behalf in conversation with other spokespeople. Rotating the role of spokesperson among the eligible of the team. Possibly even having multiple spokespeople on the same team for different types of decisions. Set up processes to ensure someone does not sit on important information others do not have access to. All data should be public in the group. etc. This is far from instituting an explicit hierarchy! reply abdullahkhalids 1 hour agoparentYes, anarchists think that the right set of social processes can allow for organizations that don't have abusive hierarchies. But these processes themselves are very structured and take a lot of careful work. This is so far from popular understanding of anarchism. reply duxup 30 minutes agorootparentThere was an interesting story someone wrote about their time with some anarchists who traveled to New Orleans to help in the wake of the hurricane to help. The had a house and kitchen and in addition to traveling around and helping on an individual basis they planned to provide free meals to the locals. They ran into the problem where one group of volunteers that aligned to cook together were vegan and insisted on making only vegan food (it also sounded like the dishes were very strange to the locals). This made sense for the cooks, but the locals didn't want the food. But nobody could convince this group to do anything differently. Their system resulted in a sort of rotating hierarchy that meant every few days they couldn't provide for the locals. Functional anarchy seems like it takes a lot of work. reply abdullahkhalids 19 minutes agorootparentFunny. Anarachism, like every other political philosophy, is not an antidote to stupidity. That said, it is easy to think that some other decision making mechanism (besides the rotating decision makers these guys were practicing) would lead to better outcomes. A common consensus mechanism is decision by majority voting. Which often works, but often just picks the suboptimal solution, because it the average of the actual close to optimal solutions different subgroups are advocating for. Every decision making mechanisms has some failures (and advantages). It's good to know what they are. reply duxup 17 minutes agorootparentEven if just putting someone in charge of collecting some data that might say \"looks like we feed more people with PPJ sandwiches than X,Y,Z, let's mix that into the rotation a bit more\". Could even satisfy all parties. Unfortunately there's an underlying \"i do what I want\" in a lot of political philosophies where it just doesn't work that way, even for getting what they want.. reply JackMorgan 24 minutes agorootparentprevImagine being homeless from a hurricane yet still so privileged you can turn your nose up at a free vegan meal! Guess they didn't really need the meal after all... I feel like this is more a commentary on the \"needy\" folks. No one goes into a soup kitchen and expects to get their favorite meal, but I guess these folks were expecting the vegans to give up their beliefs and cook them hamburgers. reply duxup 20 minutes agorootparentThe people who they were helping weren't starving on the streets, I don't know what you imagine the aftermath of in New Orleans was like, but it wasn't that. There's a strange cruelty to your comment where you're thinking of homeless people who went through a natural disaster ... so you can call them 'privileged'. reply JackMorgan 10 minutes agorootparentI'm not trying to be cruel, but rather point out perhaps these community meals weren't that valuable if locals just turned their noses up at the free food. When folks are really hungry, it wouldn't matter if lentils isn't their normal cuisine, they'd eat it anyway and be grateful. It would be a different story if the meals violated some religious taboo, but the way you wrote it really makes the survivors sound ungrateful. reply Aunche 7 minutes agoparentprevA traditional hierarchy is a tree, whereas a flat governance aims to be as close as possible to a connected graph. It's significantly easier to maintain a tree than a connected graph, especially with a sufficient group size. You're unlikely to find many people willing to invest so much effort into maintaining a flat organization, and even if you do, often times it's a better investment for those people to be actively making progress on that shared goal rather than governance. IMO, a regular representative democracy is \"good enough.\" It may be biased towards the elite, but it's still by far the most successful form of governance when it comes to creating large systemic change. The perceived ineffectiveness of it comes from people's unwillingness to put actual work, which applies to any other form of organization as well. reply yamrzou 1 hour agoparentprevIt seems that those ideas are mainly optimizing for making sure that the group of people in positions of authority will be diffuse, flexible, open, and temporary, or what she calls \"democratic structuring\" in the essay. If one wants a default, well-tested structure, hierarchy seems to be a good candidate[1]. Another idea is to optimize for viability, meaning the ability to adapt to and survive changes in the environment, described by the Viable System Model[2]. I wonder if there are studies on the different ways of structuring and their goals and tradeoffs. [1] Choose Boring Culture — https://charity.wtf/2023/05/01/choose-boring-technology-cult...

I've been part of a few \"structureless\" groups which spontaneously organized around an opportunity and were initially effective because of that structureless (e.g. somebody gets an idea, the whole group moves like a military unit, opponents had no idea something like that could happen) but succumbed to the dynamics in that article on a time scale of three weeks (arguably ended a public company in that time!) to three years. reply leoc 1 hour agoparentThere was and is a whole literature about unstructured and less-structured and alternatively-structured organisations; it even used to get a fair amount of coverage in mainstream news publications. But some time shortly after the year 2000 someone rang a bell, and now the only way to discuss the subject is to reshare \"The Tyranny of Structurelessness\" (which to be clear, is very good) every so often. (EDIT: And to re-emphasise, I'm not criticising yamrzou for sharing it!) Pasting one of my earlier comments on one of the earlier reposts: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36292289 > This is really a good essay and surely deserves a high profile, but it's disappointing that it, and some bits of angst about Valve's internal situation, seem to be the only discussions of organisational structure that get widely shared these days. Back from about the '70s to the early '90s it seems that there was quite a lot of management-theory/theory-of-the-firm research into different organisational structures and how they affected innovation, ability to change and other desirable or undesirable characteristics of organisations. And it didn't just stay hidden in academia, as the results got a fair amount of coverage in newsmagazines and the like in the early '90s. (Which is how I heard about it: I'm no expert.) As you might expect, the findings on relatively \"structureless\" orgs seem to have been pretty compatible with Freeman's observations. But there was also research on many other unusual forms of structure and hierarchy, for example the \"matrix management\" which famously got implemented at Dow Chemical in the 1970s https://hbr.org/1978/05/problems-of-matrix-organizations . > But for some reason interest and attention seems to have completely faded out, at least at the popular level, by about 2000 or so. So the Valve situation gets reported on as if it's some kind of unprecedented novelty, and not an example of a sort of situation whose outcomes had been hashed out pretty thoroughly a decade or more earlier. reply PaulHoule 1 hour agorootparentThe book https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Autonomous_Zone is of interest. In my mind the most interesting application of that was the contemporaneous Falun Gong movement in China. Falun Gong practitioners would show up at a park and practice a set of simple physical and spiritual practices; the organization was deliberately structureless because organizations of all kinds in China are required to admit a cadre of Communist Party members to surveil and control the organization. No organization = no control network. (The very act of gathering a group of people at a point, however, is a basic practice of military science) The one bit of authority in the organization is a book which is said to be infallible, which defends them from having the book rewritten by the authorities. (We know pretty well how the Communists and Republican governments oppressed folk religion movements such as the Huxian cult, but Taoism in its established form has always been some selection of folk practices which are approved by the authorities as long as China has had governments) An unfortunate consequence of this is that Falun Gong cannot change any doctrine, such as their belief that \"being gay is bad for your gong.\" They lost the support of mainstream western organizations and descended into pandering to right-wing nuts to get what support they could. reply monadINtop 1 hour agorootparentI think this misses the deeper relationship between the Falun Gong and western intelligence agencies, that goes beyond just \"pandering to right-wing nuts\" after a period of \"spontaneous\" support from mainstream western organizations. reply romanhn 2 hours agoparentprevI'd love to hear more about how an org structure (or lack thereof) killed a public company in 3 weeks. reply lkrubner 1 hour agorootparentThis is one of the main topics that I teach entrepreneurs about.

If you are in New York City, we have 2 different speakers who will speak to 2 different aspects of this problem, at our event on February 27th. reply PaulHoule 1 hour agorootparentprevSee https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-e&q=etoy+vs... First you need to know how conformist the culture was in the 1990s, when my wife and I would visit Manhattan we looked like two hippie throwbacks to the 1960s and got told we were the weirdest looking people in the city. I couldn't have stood to live there because you would look up and see a Tommy Hilfiger billboard and look down and see a lot of people wearing Tommy and if you couldn't take it, you couldn't take it. You couldn't get as good of a cup of coffee as you could get at an indy espresso bar in a small town in a flyover state because there was a Starbucks on every block to convince stock market analysts that it was like that coast to coast. In Dec 1999 there were the WTO riots which have broken the WTO ever since (e.g. the old \"corn law\" fight over free trade in agriculture reached the impasse it at now) and it had an effect that washed over everyone. For a few weeks there was a wave of honesty, for instance I saw an article in the tech press that somebody went to a Microsoft press conference and he was bored out his mind. So when Etoy had their domain stolen by Etoys many people from radical artists to people who didn't want to have their private property taken away rallied. We had a system where people would visit our web site and we'd use iframes to DDOS their web site. It ran for a few days with no effect, then I contributed a code snippet that made the attack many times more effective and brought the site down for a short time during the last shopping day of the year. Immediately they called the FBI who pulled the server out of the rack. We put a lot of effort into public relations and talking to the media, never mind flooding stock market discussion groups with propaganda. We knew we were being infiltrated by the FBI so we used the tactic of creating new mailing lists with (we believed) a clean list of participants periodically. (A general answer to \"Eternal September\" problems) The stock dropped precipitously when we were working on it, and a few weeks later they settled with etoy, an event we knew about before it was announced at their earnings call. It wasn't a good earnings call and the stock price spiraled downward and eventually the company folded (might have been more than three weeks but the critical part was about that long) The management and IT folks at Etoys would minimize the contribution of activists, wrote a blog about how they defeated our DDOS (but we scared them enough to call the FBI, caused a panic on the most critical day of the year, and could boast that the registration numbers that they triumphantly announced were inflated dramatically by fake users we injected) and would say that the company failed because the earnings were not good. I would say, however, that Etoys could have been a viable business in the long term if investors believed in management, selling toys online in 1999 was an idea with legs. Activism contributed to investors not believing in management, so they were forced to throw in the towel. reply flerchin 1 hour agorootparentThis is an interesting piece of history, but doesn't seem to be a company folding after 3 weeks due to lack of org structure. reply rout39574 1 hour agorootparentI think the intended parable is that an unstructured group of activists took down a much larger, much better resourced, hierarchy. reply krisoft 1 hour agorootparentprevYou misread the original comment I’m afraid. It doesn’t say that the company folded after 3 weeks due to a lack of org structure.

When someone describes their organization as being \"flat\", it's often a red flag because it means that there are unwritten power structure that newer employees will likely be excluded from. reply abdullahkhalids 1 hour agoparentIndeed, flat or unstructured social organizations are going to lead to abuse if not coupled with some explicit philosophy that ensures that the group doesn't devolve into \"might is right\" or ingroup/outgroup thinking. Anarachists as in OP have one such philosophy and corresponding actionable processes to prevent abuse in unstructured groups. So yes, the startups or orgs have to very explicitly lay down processes, otherwise the red flag is probably warranted. reply kqr 1 hour agoparentprevThat is a beige flag at worst. Every organisation has unwritten power structures that (often) exclude newcomers. Some organisations also have additional written power structures that (often) exclude newcomers. reply lolinder 1 hour agorootparentWhile you're correct, my experience has been that the unwritten power structure is much stronger in places where there is no written power structure. Where there is a written power structure you can usually appeal to it and eventually get something done. Where there exists no written power structure at all, you're out of luck unless you can quickly figure out what the power structure is. A written power structure is a low resolution map. It's not perfect, but it gives you some idea of where to start making sense of things. A flat organization is never actually flat, but it also has no guideposts at all to show you even the rough outlines of the real hierarchies. reply npstr 1 hour agoparentprevIn Germany it just means it's a bad place to have a career in. Thankfully most HRs will happily advertise it in the job description making it easy to dodge. reply Barrin92 1 hour agoparentprev>especially in a start up It's an example that Zizek has often given. The startup boss is more insidious than the old school boss because he's \"just your pal\". The traditional boss you can rebel against, in the startup you can't because duh, you have no boss, so what are you complaining about? It's a way to disguise power. Another thing is that it's also a way to dodge responsibility, as you see in tech. When a Japanese company fucks something up, you'll often see CEOs take salary cuts and sincerely apologize in front of the public.

E.g. If a government wants to raise money via taxes on food production, growing food becomes disincentivized. Or the simple fact that maps can't show everything about the piece of land they represent. I think the opposite of the tyranny of structurelessness looks more like our legal + regulatory system where sometimes you need a team of experts to tell you where you can build a building, or the military where everything is so regimented so that you need to fill out forms to buy toilet paper. reply duxup 43 minutes agoprevGreat read. >The basic problems didn't appear until individual rap groups exhausted the virtues of consciousness-raising and decided they wanted to do something more specific. I do think of some of the \"awareness\" activism I see where it never seems to lead anywhere. Folks are just busy with their awareness activities and everything is deemed good because they're generating awareness. Like minded people do their awareness thing, they like to do it, and there ya go... awareness is sort of its own means to an end and I'm not sure the given individuals or groups are structured in a way that they'll ever be capable of more. I'd even argue that some of these structureless groups are incapable of much critical discussion as their group exists purely because of their awareness raising efforts, it is what they are, change might take some leadership. reply robertclaus 55 minutes agoprevI've run into a similar problem many times at small companies.

The Corporate Rebels blog (https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog) has a lot of good content in this vein as well. Teal hasn't really seemed to develop much except through outlets like Corporate Rebels, but IMO Holacracy has shown some real continued promise. The Zappos adoption had middling success over time (and while they're no longer practicing, their market-based model owes a lot to it), but overall Holacracy and the similar structure-heavy self-management stuff it has inspired is continuing to press on. It's not growing, but it's fairly steady. They released a new version of Holacracy a few years ago set up for \"modular adoption\" instead of all-at-once adoption, and I think it's a significant improvement. reply bunderbunder 1 hour agoparentprevI find \"Turn the Ship Around!\" to be an interesting companion to this essay. It provides an excellent example of how, if you do it right, a well-defined structure can actually be quite empowering to people at all levels of the organization. Speaking from personal experience, I've seen it myself at one previous employer. The clear hierarchy and delegation of ownership and responsibilities made it easier for everyone to get things done and enhanced everyone's sense of psychological safety. People explicitly knowing exactly what authority they do and do not have means they can make confident decisions without feeling the need to play wasteful and exhausting games of \"mother may I\" with the latent power structure for fear of accidentally stepping on influential toes. reply tikhonj 33 minutes agorootparentSeconding that book. It's one of several things that got me to realize that a lot of the problems I had seen with hierarchies were not fundamental to the idea of a hierarchy but rather functions of culture, practices and individuals.

To relate to this essay, freeing yourself from the idea that structurelessness is what you need, or a strict hierarchy at the other extreme, or anything in between. After that, you're free to actually develop and select good ideas and trial ideas without being constrained by your initial paradigm and the magical thinking associated with locking yourself into a paradigm. In the software world, check out Weinberg's The Psychology of Computer Programming which touches on these ideas (more about how to look at and examine systems, not prescriptive).

The premise is that in the 1500s, no one thought Europe was going to be the next great power. The dominant civilizations at the time were the Chinese and the Ottomans. Why did Europe win? Because no one could unify Europe. It was basically a collection of states. Whereas China and the Ottoman Empire were centralized. The problem with centralization is that if the guy at the top says to do something, everyone must fall in line, even if it's a bad idea. China used to have the most dominant navel fleet in the world. Then in the early 1500s, their government decided to stop building ships. Which ultimately led to them falling behind in the world order. In Europe however, even if one country received a decree to stop building ships, it wouldn't stop the others from doing so. This created a hotbed of innovation and competition that allowed them to develop rapidly. And establish dominance. The trade offs between centralization and decentralization are fascinating. reply dbspin 29 minutes agoparentHistory is complicated. The reason the Chinese stopped building (and in fact scuttled) their fleets is collective trauma after the mass genocide carried out by the Mongols. Including the decapitation of the Chinese imperial elite and the erasure and sacking of several notable cities. The reason the Mongols were able to do what no steppe people had done before was because of the centralisation of the hordes under the leadership of Temujin, otherwise known as Genghis Khan. reply jandrese 50 minutes agoparentprevIt mirrors in a lot of ways capitalism vs. communism. Or more precisely market based economies vs. command economies. The ultimate problem is that efficient distribution of resources depends on the unique conditions at thousands or millions of sites across the country. The people who are most well informed about what is needed are the people at those sites. The fundamental problem with command economies is transmitting that information up to the central source without overwhelming the system. Because it is way too much information to deal with they have to make simplifying assumptions, which lead to inefficiencies that compound over time. The more decentralized your decision making the more efficient the system runs. However, this has drawbacks as it becomes hard or impossible to focus on big problems. On the flipside centralized systems are highly vulnerable to corruption. No system is perfect, and the most sensible systems use a combination of both. reply matthest 34 minutes agorootparent100% agree. Market economies really do seem like the only way to prosperity in the modern era. Mao's command economy had the country stuck in poverty. Deng's market economy reforms turned them into a superpower. reply bell-cot 2 hours agoprevSounds like she majored in Mathematics but Wikipedia say Political Science. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Freeman reply jumatier 1 hour agoprevnext [2 more] [flagged] Jtsummers 1 hour agoparentInteresting method of spamming.

      "Jo Freeman, also known as Joreen, critiques the concept of \"structurelessness\" in the women's liberation movement, arguing that all groups form structures, whether formal or informal. The article highlights issues with informal structures, such as elitism and lack of accountability, and suggests principles for democratic structuring. Emphasizes the necessity of formal structures to prevent power imbalances and to help the movement achieve its goals effectively and inclusively."
