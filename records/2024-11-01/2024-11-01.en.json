By Jake Edge October 30, 2024 XDC The kernel graphics driver for the Apple M1 and M2 GPUs is, rather famously, written in Rust, but it has achieved conformance with various graphics standards, which is also noteworthy. At the X.Org Developers Conference (XDC) 2024, Alyssa Rosenzweig gave an update on the status of the driver, along with some news about the kinds of games it can support (YouTube video, slides). There has been lots of progress since her talk at XDC last year (YouTube video), with, of course, still more to come. It is something of an XDC tradition, since she began it in Montreal in 2019 (YouTube video), for Rosenzweig to give her presentations dressed like a witch. This year's edition was no exception, though this time she started her talk in French, which resulted in some nervous chuckles from attendees. After a few sentences, she switched to English, \"I'm just kidding\", and continued with her talk. Updates and tessellation Last year at XDC, she and Asahi Lina reported that the driver had reached OpenGL ES 3.1 conformance. They also talked about geometry shaders, because \"that was the next step\". Since then, the driver has become OpenGL 4.6 conformant. That meant she was going to turn to talking about tessellation shaders, \"as I threatened to do at the end of last year's talk\". Tessellation, which is a technique that \"allows detail to be dynamically added and subtracted\" from a scene, is required for OpenGL 4.0, and there is a hardware tessellator on the Apple GPU—but, \"we can't use it\". The hardware is too limited to implement any of the standards; \"it is missing features that are hard required for OpenGL, Vulkan, and Direct3D\". That makes it \"pretty much useless to anybody who is not implementing Metal\". Apple supports OpenGL 4.1, though it is not conformant, but if you use any of the features that the hardware does not support, it simply falls back to software; \"we are not going to do that\". As far as Rosenzweig is aware, the hardware lacks point mode, where points are used instead of the usual triangles; it also lacks isoline support, but those two things can be emulated. The real problem comes with transform feedback and geometry shaders, neither of which is supported by the hardware, but the driver emulates them with compute shaders. However, the hardware tessellator cannot be used at all when those are being emulated because minute differences in the tessellation algorithms used by the hardware and the emulation would result in invariance failures. She is not sure whether that is a problem in practice or not, \"but the spec says not to do it\", so she is hoping not to have to go that route. Instead, \"we use software\". In particular, Microsoft released a reference tessellator a decade or more ago, which was meant to show hardware vendors what they were supposed to implement when tessellation was first introduced. It is \"a giant pile of 2000 lines of C++\" that she does not understand, despite trying multiple times; \"it is inscrutable\". The code will tessellate a single patch, which gave the driver developers an idea: \"if we can run that code, we can get the tessellation outputs and then we can just draw the triangles or the lines with this index buffer\". There are some problems with that approach, however, starting with the fact that the developers are writing a GPU driver; \"famously, GPUs do not like running 2000 lines of C++\". But, she announced, \"we have conformant OpenCL 3.0 support\" thanks to Karol Herbst, though it has not yet been released. OpenCL C is \"pretty much the same as regular CPU C\", though it has a few limitations and some extensions for GPUs. So the idea would be to turn the C++ tessellation code into OpenCL C code; \"we don't have to understand any of it, we just need to not break anything when we do the port\". That works, but \"tessellator.cl is the most unhinged file of my career\"; doing things that way was also the most unhinged thing she has done in her career \"and I'm standing up here in a witch hat for the fifth year in a row\". The character debuted in the exact same room in 2019 when she was 17 years old, she recalled. The CPU tessellator only operates on a single patch at a time, but a scene might have 10,000 patches—doing them all serially will be a real problem. GPUs are massively parallel, though, so having multiple threads each doing tessellation is \"pretty easy to arrange\". There is a problem with memory allocation; the CPU tessellator just allocates for each operation sequentially, but that will not work for parallel processing. Instead, the driver uses the GPU atomic instructions to manage the allocation of output buffers. In order to draw the output of the tessellators, though, there is a need to use draw instructions with packed data structures as specified by the GPU. That is normally done from the C driver code using functions that are generated by the GenXML tool. Since the tessellators are simply C code, \"thanks to OpenCL\", the generated functions can be included into the code that runs on the GPU. Rosenzweig went into more detail, which fills in the holes (and likely inaccuracies) of the above description; those interested in the details should look at the presentation video and her slides. \"Does it work? Yes, it does.\" She showed an image of terrain tessellation from a Vulkan demo. It was run on an M2 Mac with \"entirely OpenCL-based tessellation\". There is also the question of \"how is the performance of this abomination?\" The answer is that it is \"okay\". On the system, software-only terrain tessellation runs at less than one frame-per-second (fps), which \"is not very fun for playing games\"; for OpenCL, it runs at 265fps, which is \"pretty good\" and is unlikely to be the bottleneck for real games. The hardware can do 820fps; \"I did wire up the hardware tessellator just to get a number for this talk.\" There is still room for improvement on the driver's numbers, she said. Vulkan and gaming She also announced Vulkan 1.3 conformance for the Honeykrisp M1/M2 GPU driver. It started by copying the NVK Vulkan driver for NVIDIA GPUs, \"smashed against the [Open]GL 4.6 [driver]\", which started passing the conformance test suite \"in about a month\". That was six months ago and, since then, she has added geometry and tessellation shaders, transform feedback, and shader objects. The driver now supports every feature needed for multiple DirectX versions. There are a lot of problems \"if we want to run triple-A (AAA) games on this system\", however. A target game runs on DirectX and Windows on an x86 CPU with 4KB pages, but \"our target hardware is running literally none of those things\". What is needed is to somehow translate DirectX to Vulkan, Windows to Linux, x86 to Arm64, and 4KB pages to 16KB pages. The first two have a well-known solution in the form of the DXVK driver and Wine, which are \"generally packaged into Proton for Steam gaming\". Going from x86 to Arm64 also has off-the-shelf solutions: FEX-Emu or Box64. She has a bias toward FEX-Emu; \"when I am not committing Mesa crimes, I am committing FEX-Emulation crimes\". The big problem, though, is the page-size difference. FEX-Emu requires 4KB pages; Box64 has a \"hack to use 16KB pages, but it doesn't work for Wine, so it doesn't help us here\". MacOS can use 4KB pages for the x86 emulation, but \"this requires very invasive kernel support\"; Asahi Linux already has around 1000 patches that are making their way toward the mainline kernel, but \"every one of those thousand is a challenge\". Making changes like \"rewriting the Linux memory manager\" is not a reasonable path. It turns out that, even though Linux does not support heterogeneous page sizes between different processes, it does support them between different kernels; \"what I mean by that is virtualization\". A KVM guest kernel can have a different page size than the host kernel. So, \"this entire mess\", consisting of FEX-Emu, Wine, DXVK, Honeykrisp, Steam, and the game, \"we are going to throw that into a virtual machine, which is running a 4KB guest kernel\". There is some overhead, of course, but it is hardware virtualization, so that should have low CPU overhead. The problem lies with the peripherals, she said. So, instead of having Honeykrisp in the host kernel, it runs in the guest using virtgpu native contexts; all of the work to create the final GPU command buffer is done in the guest and handed to the host, rather than making all of the Vulkan calls individually traverse the virtual-machine boundary. The VirGL renderer on the host then hands that to the GPU, which \"is not 100% native speed, but definitely well above 90%\", Rosenzweig said. The good news is that the overheads for the CPU and GPU do not stack, since the two run in parallel. \"So all the crap overhead we have in the CPU is actually crap that is running in parallel to the crap overhead on the GPU, so we only pay the cost once.\" \"'Does it work?' is the question you all want to know.\" It does, she said, it runs games like Portal and Portal 2. She also listed a number of others: Castle Crashers, The Witcher 3, Fallout 4, Control, Ghostrunner, and Cyberpunk 2077. All of the different pieces that she mentioned were made available on October 10, the day of the talk. For those running the Fedora Asahi Remix distribution, she suggested immediately updating to pick up the pieces that she had described. Before taking questions, she launched Steam, which took some time to come up, in part because of the virtual machine and the x86 emulation. Once it came up, she launched Control, which ran at 45fps on an M1 MAX system. There was a question about resources from someone who has a Mac with 8GB of RAM. Rosenzweig said that the high-end gaming titles are only likely to work on systems with 16GB or more. She noted that she was playing Castle Crashers on an 8GB system during the conference, so some games will play; Portal will also work on that system. She hopes that the resources required will drop over time. Another question was about ray-tracing support, since Control can use that feature. Rosenzweig suggested that patches were welcome but that she did not see that as a high priority (\"frankly, I think ray tracing is a bit of a gimmick feature\"). Apple hardware only supports it with the M3 and the current driver is for M1 and M2 GPUs, though she plans to start working on M3 before long. The session concluded soon after that, though Rosenzweig played Control, admittedly poorly, as time ran down.

Posted Oct 30, 2024 20:59 UTC (Wed) by titaniumtown (subscriber, #163761) [Link] Alyssa Rosenzweig is very cool. I watched her talk and it was fascinating and I loved how she presented. I'm following her work very closely, very impressive! Great ! Posted Oct 30, 2024 20:59 UTC (Wed) by matp75 (subscriber, #45699) [Link] Whoah ! This looks crazy and huge huge work even if I am far away from understanding it all !

It's always amazing seeing kids doing this sort of thing. I'm old enough to remember seeing Rasterman making everyone else feel old back in the day (even though I'm a few years younger than him, he still made me feel old) - it's nice to see that in this aspect at least, the world of 2024 is as exciting and hopeful as the world of 1999. I find it a little disturbing . . .

I find it a little disturbing . . . Posted Oct 31, 2024 22:19 UTC (Thu) by himi (subscriber, #340) [Link] Yeah, that's one of the things that makes me hopeful - there are so few women in this industry, and even fewer in the open source/free software subset, having young women out there doing exciting things and having fun with it is great to see.

Ms Rosenzweig has done some fantastic work. A shame Apple didn't make things a lot easier, though. I admit to some curiosity: why the witch hat? Has Ms Rosenzweig ever explained this?

A surprising number of kernel hackers working on fringe hardware (or just... different stuff) are trans folk and a *lot* of them are of the witchy persuasion.

You're a mysterious woman spending your days in a dim room doing mystical incantations with strange hardware people don't understand but are very impressed by, opening the news to see a new satanic panic, riots, hate crimes and politicians trying to ban your existence.

Too many projects get dropped the moment the next shiny ray-traced toy comes along. I know this type of work can be challenging to say the least. My own dabble with Zig and Pinephone hardware drivers reminded me of some of the pain of poorly documented hardware, but what a reward when it works. My own M1 was only purchased because of this project and Alyssa's efforts with OpenGL+ES. It only ever boots Asahi Linux. Thank-you very much for your efforts. reply Cthulhu_ 9 hours agoparentOne thing I noticed in the M4 macbook announcement comments was how many people were happy with their M1 laptop, and second, how many people kept their Macbooks for nearly a decade; these devices are built to last, and I applaud long-term support from Apple itself and the Linux community. Second, since it's open source, Apple themselves are probably paying attention; I didn't read the whole thing because it's going over my head, but she discussed missing features in the chip that are being worked around. reply outworlder 15 minutes agorootparent> how many people kept their Macbooks for nearly a decade; these devices are built to last, and I applaud long-term support from Apple itself and the Linux community. Anecdotal but I have a White Macbook from 2010. It's sitting on a shelf not because it doesn't work (minus the battery), but because it's too outdated to be of much use. And there's a small crack in the case. I have a Macbook Pro from 2016. I still whip it out from time to time when I don't want to use my latest one for whatever reason (say, network troubleshooting). It works fine. Even the battery still holds charge. If those two had USB-C (and charging over that port) I'd probably use them more often. Their keyboards is also pleasant (since they are before the scissor key nonsense). My company has thousands of Macbooks. It's rare that I see anyone at all with issues. They aren't perfect, but the build quality is far better than most PC laptops and so is the attention to detail. The price premium kinda blows, but the M line made them way better. reply attendant3446 6 hours agorootparentprevI have the opposite experience. Apple is incredibly difficult and expensive to repair. But I have been pleasantly surprised by the longevity and repairability of ThinkPads. I like those Apple M processors, but I know where I'm spending my money. reply windowsrookie 5 hours agorootparentYes, MacBooks are generally more expensive to repair, but they also tend to not need repairs. It’s quite normal to hear from people who are using their 7+ year old MacBook without any issues and are still perfectly happy with it. I myself still use my 2018 MacBook Pro as my main device. When considering longevity, I will agree that Thinkpads are probably the only device that can compete with MacBooks. But there are trade-offs. MacBooks are going to be lighter, better battery life, and have better displays. Not to mention MacOS, which is my preferred OS. Thinkpads usually have great Linux support and swappable hardware for those who like to tinker with their devices. They also tend to be more durable, but this adds more weight. reply MSFT_Edging 4 hours agorootparent> MacBooks are going to be lighter Not going let Macs have this one, my X1 carbon is considerably lighter than a MBA. But generally agreeing. My last X1C lasted 8 years and still works perfectly, I just wanted an upgrade. My new one is even lighter than my old one. I opt for the FHD w/o touch screen and the second best processor to balance battery life and performance. Definitely not getting 18hrs battery life but 8-10 isn't something to laugh at. reply windowsrookie 2 hours agorootparentI admit I was assuming they would be heavier, I didn't consider the X1 Carbon. When I think of Thinkpads I still picture the traditional IBM-style Thinkpad. A quick look at the specs shows the 14\" X1 Carbon at 2.42lbs, 13\" MacBook Air at 2.7 lbs, and a 14\" Thinkpad E series at 3.17 lbs. reply FuriouslyAdrift 3 hours agorootparentprevMacBooks are some of the heaviest laptps on the market. The Air is the \"light\" one at 2.7 lbs 13\" and 3.3 lbs for the 15\" For reference, there are several 13\" laptops on the market that are around 2 - 2.5 lbs and 15\"+ that are less than 3 lbs reply windowsrookie 2 hours agorootparentDo any of those lighter laptops match the battery life and performance of the MacBook Air, while also being completely silent? I suppose I should have been more specific and stated I don't believe there are any laptops that can match the MacBook in all categories while being lighter. reply majormajor 3 hours agorootparentprevI haven't gotten a new Thinkpad since the 25th anniversary one but that was the last I bought while using a few as daily drivers for a decade since 2008. The ultimate issue was that the batteries degraded on them on incredibly fast. I don't know if that's been fixed, but the ease of replacing (at least one of) the batteries was more than canceled out by the short life compared to a Mac. reply Dah00n 3 hours agorootparentprev>MacBooks are going to be lighter That sounds like an Apple sound bite, and it is wrong, compared to pretty much any MacBook competitor out there... reply throwaway24124 4 hours agorootparentprevI still use a 2014 macbook air as my home server. It was my daily driver for 7 years. No complaints, still works perfectly. Haven't been careful with it either. reply crossroadsguy 3 hours agorootparentprevIndeed. However once you need the repair it's so daunting. Now factor in non-developed nations (prices are usually same or more there as well for both parts and service) and it's just insane. I had a 7-8 year old macbook air that I had bought for ~60K INR and I had to replace its SSD. Just because it was do be done for an Apple device even the outside repairperson charged ~16K (Apple \"authorised\" service centre quoted 28K + taxes with a straight face). That outside repair was way too costly in late 2022 for a 128GB SSD. Same goes for their other devices. So what's to be done? Buy their insanely costly \"limited\" extended warranty for \"2 more\" years? And let's say we do that, then? I am sure there is an argument for that. I am typing this from a M1 MacBook Pro and if it dies I am really not sure whether I will even be able to get it repaired without \"feeling\" fleeced, or might as well move back to the normal laptop + Linux world and know that a laptop repair will never be a \"minor bankruptcy\" event ;-) No, \"but Apple devices last long\" doesn't cut it. So do non-Apple devices, yes they do. And if they need repair you don't at all fret w/ or w/o warranty. I am not sure how many here on HN will be able to connect with this but that hanging Damocles' sword is not a nice thing to have around when you use a costly Apple device. Making it easy and cheap/affordable for their devices to be repaired should not be an option left for OEMs. reply javier2 4 hours agorootparentprevYes, modern macs are stupidly hard to repair. But I am never using any Lenovo product again since the whole rootkit incident. reply jrochkind1 3 hours agorootparentprevAgreed, hard to repair (which is a problem), but my experience is owning one for 8 years, and another for 4 years now (with hopes to keep it another 6), which never once needed a repair. reply TylerE 59 minutes agorootparentThe only Mac hardware failure I’ve experienced in over 25 years of ownership (My first Mac was black and had a G3 in it and ran OS 8), I’ve experienced a grand total of one hardware failure, and that was 15+ years ago. reply jhenkens 6 hours agorootparentprevI agree on modern Mac's being difficult to repair. I also will say that back a decade or two ago, it was likely you'd need to repair your computer after four years. Now, a four year old Macbook Air still feels brand new to me. reply TrainedMonkey 9 hours agorootparentprevUnderrated point, maybe it's aluminum unibody or more stable OS, but in my experience average MBP lifetime is meaningfully higher compared to a windows machine. My longest lasting windows machine was T400 Thinkpad which lasted 5 years before Core 2 Duo architecture stopped being able to keep up. It got replaced with HP Envy with great specs but made out of plastic which barely lasted 1.5 years before screen fell off (literally). Replaced with 17\" 2014 MBP which is still alive after SSD replacement. reply ho_schi 7 hours agorootparentThinkPad X220 here. From late 2012 until late 2023 in service with Linux. It is still usable but finally replaced it by an X13 Gen3 AMD with Linux. The magnesium body is a bless and feels a lot better to the skin than aluminium. The HiDPI display is the biggest upgrade. The six row keyboard is sturdy but a downgrade from the seven row keyboard. I miss the notch to open the lid. It got worse with Gen4/5 which now have an awful hump (reverse notch) like a smartphone. The long usage of the X220 depends on the built quality but also on the five year replacement part support. New batteries and a new palm rest (cracked during a journey). It not just quality you pay for, it is this support level. And of course more memory. Apple still fails in this regard and barely does something when forced by the European Union. Anyway - Apple doesn’t officially support Linux therefore I cannot buy them for work. This is the part wich saddens me, they do good work and the next MacBook will also not run fully with Linux. This kind of catchup things by hackers cannot be won - until the vendor decides you’re a valuable customer. Therefore, don’t buy them that you can run Linux. You maybe can. But these devices are made for macOS only. But if you want to run Linux on a MacBook? Talk your politicians! And send „messages“ with your money to Apple. Like buying ThinkPads, Dells Developer Edition, Purism, System 76 and so on :) reply bluedino 1 hour agorootparentI never kept my ThinkPads around long because of the screens (which they have fixed, somewhere around the T450 timeframe. The X220/230 had that godawful 1366x768 panel. A shame when the 13\" Air at the time had a 1440x900 panel, which while it wasn't amazing with the viewing angles and colors, it was light years ahead of the screen in something like a T430. reply ho_schi 13 minutes agorootparentThinkPads come usually with two panel options: The cheap one and the good one. Often even a third or fourth. Lenovo should only ship the good ones! If I buy a ThinkPad I want the good one. I struggled to get the HiDPI panel for the X13 and ordered it from the replacement parts. Same for the X220, I replaced the TN panel by drumroll IPS panel. Apple takes ridiculous amounts for memory or disk but you always get the good stuff with the base model. This makes it simple and reliable for customers. Except keyboards The ThinkPads always win, convex key caps, better switches and pressure/release point, travel way, better layout and a TrackPoint. In some models you can still replace it within 30 seconds (T14). With the X13 or MacBook it is a horror, requires removal of the mainboard. Not mentioning Apples failure with the TouchBar, which “feels” like the tried to save money on expensive switches by replacing them with a cheap touchscreen and selling this horrible downgrade as feature. And the infamous butterfly switches are the reason to avoid any used older MacBook (often defective). reply user_7832 7 hours agorootparentprev> The magnesium body is a bless and feels a lot better to the skin than aluminium. Just curious, how does it feel better? My framework apparently has an aluminium lid and a magnesium base, and the mg feels “smoother” than the slightly more textured al… however my iPad is apparently aluminium too and is smooth to the touch. reply ho_schi 35 minutes agorootparentIt is not about smoothness. Actually the magnesium bottom feels like some high quality polymer/plastic. And it is leightweight. Therefore it doesn’t feel like metal and doesn’t transport heat/cold. Aluminum is a nice material for planes, cars or bikes but I avoid skin contact because it is uncomfortable. I guess like often it depends on how the magnesium made. Lenovo also uses for other parts high quality plastics (keyboard of course and probably the palm rest). reply throw88888 8 hours agorootparentprevIf you replaced the T400 because it felt slow, maybe it’s just a software/OS issue. The hardware on Thinkpad T-models should last longer than just 5 years in general. My daily-driver laptop at home is a T420 from 2011 with a Core 2 Duo, SSD and 8GB RAM. Works fine still. I run Linux + OpenBox, so it is a somewhat lightweight setup to be fair. reply dm319 6 hours agorootparentMy daughter just asked me for the 'tiny' laptop. She has taken my Thinkpad X60 which runs linux mint. It's getting on for 20 years old soon! reply bhouston 6 hours agorootparentprev> My daily-driver laptop at home is a T420 from 2011 with a Core 2 Duo, SSD and 8GB RAM. Works fine still. I am not sure I would be productive with that. Any Core 2 Duo is 10x slower single core and 20x slower multi-core than a current generation laptop CPU at this point. Eg: https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/compare/8588187?baselin... I think it would mostly be good as an SSH terminal, but doing any real work locally on it seems frankly unfeasible. reply pixelfarmer 6 hours agorootparentThe problem is software, though. I have a X200s with 4 GiB RAM from 2009. It was interesting to see how Firefox got slower and slower over the years. Granted, it not only is Firefox but also retard websites which use loads and loads of JS to display static content in the end. In return, it is not like JS didn't exist back then: The XhtmlRequest thingy for dynamic website updates or whatever the name for that was has been added years prior to that. So, yes, a lot of this comes down to software and a massive waste of cycles. I remember one bug in Electron/Atom where a blinking cursor caused like 10% CPU load or something along that line. They fixed it, but it tells you way more about how broken the entire software stack was at that time and it didn't get better since then. I mean, think about this: I used 1280x1024 on a 20\" screen back in the mid 90ies on (Unix!) machines that are insanely less powerful than even this X200s. The biggest difference: Now you can move windows around visually, back then you moved the outer frame of it to the new place and then it got redrawn. And the formatting options in browsers are better, i.e. it is easier to design the layout you want. Plus there is no need for palette changes when switching windows anymore (\"true color\"). The overall productivity hasn't kept up with the increase in computing power, though. Do you think a machine 100x the performance will give you 100x the productivity? With some exceptions, the weak link in the chain were, are, and will always be humans, and if there are delays, we are talking almost always about badly \"optimized\" software (aka bloat).

This is no longer true for me. I've been an Apple fan since the Apple ][ days, and reluctantly left the ecosystem last year. The hardware walled garden with soldered-on components and components tied down to specific units for ostensible privacy and security reasons (I don't buy those reasons), combined with the steadily degrading OS polish in fine attention to detail, for me personally, meant I could no longer justify the cognitive load to continue with a Mac laptop as my daily driver. While others might point to a cost or/or value differential, I'm in the highly privileged position to be insensitive to those factors. Last straw was an board-soldered SSD that quit well before I was willing to upgrade, and even Louis Rossman's shop said it would cost way more to desolder and solder a new one on than the entire laptop is worth. Bought a Framework the same day, when it arrived I restored my data files to it and been running it as my daily driver ever since. The Mac laptop is still sitting here, as I keep hoping to figure out when to find time to develop my wave soldering skills to try my hand at saving it from the landfill, or break down and unsustainably pay for the repair (I do what I can to avoid perpetuating dark patterns, but it is a Sisyphean effort). I found myself in a position of having to think increasingly more about working around the Mac ecosystem instead of working invisibly within it (like a fish in water not having to think about water), that it no longer made sense to stick with it. It has definitively lost the \"It Just Works\" polish that bound me so tightly to the ecosystem in the past. I see no functional difference in my daily work patterns using a Mac laptop versus a Framework running Fedora. To be sure, there are a lot of areas I have to work around on the Framework-Fedora daily driver, but for my personal work patterns, in my personal needs, I evaluated them to be roughly the same amount of time and cognitive load I spent on the Mac. Maybe Framework-Fedora is slightly worse, but close enough that I'd rather throw my hat into the more open ring than the increasingly closed walled garden Apple's direction definitely is taking us, that does not align with my vision for our computing future. It does not hurt that experimenting with local LLM's and various DevOps tooling for my work's Linux-based infrastructure is way easier and frictionless on Fedora for me, though YMMV for certain.

This also touches on a broader question about the future of open-source efforts on platforms that are inherently restrictive. While it's inspiring to see games like Control running at 45fps on an M1 MAX with open-source drivers, it begs the question: Should the community continue to invest significant resources into making closed systems more open, or should efforts be redirected toward promoting more open hardware standards? Apple's approach to hardware design warrants criticism. By creating GPUs with limitations that hinder standard functionalities like tessellation shaders and using non-standard page sizes, Apple places unnecessary obstacles in the path of developers.

In fact, the main advertised feature of GS was to create geometry out of nothing (unbounded particle effects), while the main advertised feature of Mesh Shaders is GPU-driven and efficient culling of geometry (see for example the recent mesh shader pipeline talk from Remedy on Alan Wake 2). It is true that Mesh Shaders are designed also for amplification, and that word has been chosen specifically to hint that you will be able to \"multiply\" your primitives but not generating random sequences out of thin air.

A major and unfortunate consequence is that it has driven even more games to rely on upscaling and heavy post-processing, all of which tend to blur the output image and introduce artifacts and add latency. reply jms55 18 hours agorootparentprevYou're looking at years of careful artist and engineer work to get something that looks almost as good as pathtraced visuals. The fact that it's so good without any raytracing is a credit to the developers. Replacing all that effort with raytracing and having one unified lighting system would be a _major_ time saver, and allows much more dynamic lighting than was previously possible. So yeah some current games don't look much better with RT, but the gameplay and art direction was designed without raytracing in mind in the first place, and had a _lot_ of work put into it to get those results. Sure fully pathtraced graphics might not be 100% usable currently, but the fact that they're even 70% usable is amazing! And with another 3-5 years of algorithm development and hardware speedups, and developers and artists getting familiar with raytracing, we might start seeing games require raytracing. Games typically take 4+ years to develop, so anything you're seeing coming out now was probably started when the best GPU you could buy for raytracing was an RTX 2080 TI. reply wtallis 17 hours agorootparent> Sure fully pathtraced graphics might not be 100% usable currently, but the fact that they're even 70% usable is amazing! Aside from Cyberpunk 2077 and a handful of ancient games with NVIDIA-sponsored remakes, what even offers fully path traced lighting as an option? The way it went for CP2077 makes your \"70% usable\" claim seem like quite an exaggeration: performance is only good if you have a current-generation GPU that cost at least $1k, the path tracing option didn't get added until years after the game originally shipped, and they had to fix a bunch of glitches resulting from the game world being built without path tracing in mind. We're clearly still years away from path tracing being broadly available among AAA games, let alone playable on any large portion of gaming PCs. For the foreseeable future, games will still need to look good without fully path traced lighting. reply jms55 13 hours agorootparent> performance is only good if you have a current-generation GPU that cost at least $1k That's why I said games aren't currently designed with only pathtracing in mind, but in 3-5 years with faster hardware and better algorithms, we'll probably start to see it be more widespread. That's typically how graphics usually develop; something that's only for high end GPUs eventually becomes accessible to everyone. SSAO used to be considered extremely demanding, and now it's accessible to even the weakest phone GPU with good enough quality. Again the fact that it's feasible at all, even if it requires a $1000 GPU, is amazing! 5 years ago real time path tracing would've been seen as impossible. > The way it went for CP2077 makes your \"70% usable\" claim seem like quite an exaggeration Based on the raw frame timing numbers and temporal stability, I don't think it is. RT GI is currently usually around ~4ms, which is at the upper edge of usable. However the temporal stability is usually the bigger issue - at current ray counts, with current algorithms, either noise or slow response times is an inevitable tradeoff. Hence, 70% usable. But with another few years of improvements, we'll probably get to the point where we can get it down to ~2.5ms with the current stability, or 4ms and much more stable. Which would be perfectly usable. reply wtallis 13 hours agorootparent> RT GI is currently usually around ~4ms, which is at the upper edge of usable.

And you seem to be very optimistic about what kind of improvements we can expect for affordable, low-power GPU hardware over a mere 3-5 years. I don't think algorithmic improvements to denoisers and upscalers can get us much further unless we're using very wrong image quality metrics to give their blurriness a passing grade. Two rays per pixel is simply never going to suffice. Right now, an RTX 4090 ($1700+) runs at less than 50 fps at 2560x1440, unless you lie to yourself about resolution using an upscaler. So the best consumer GPU at the moment is about 70-80% of what's necessary to use path tracing and hit resolution and refresh rate targets typical of high-end gaming in 2012. Having better-than-4090 performance trickle down to a more mainstream price point of $300-400 is going to take at least two more generations of GPU hardware improvements even with the most optimistic expectations for Moore's Law, and that's the minimum necessary to do path tracing well at a modest resolution on a game that will be approaching a decade old by then. It'll take another hardware generation for that level of performance to fit in the price and power budgets of consoles and laptops. reply porphyra 13 hours agorootparentprevUE5 supports fully path traced lighting and Black Myth Wukong is a recent example. reply paavohtl 11 hours agorootparentprevAlan Wake 2 has had path tracing from day 1, and it looks excellent with (and without) it. reply talldayo 14 hours agorootparentprev> For the foreseeable future, games will still need to look good without fully path traced lighting. And in 7-10 years when the software stack is matured, we'll be thanking ourselves for doing this in hardware the right way. I don't understand why planning for the future is considered so wasteful - this is an architecture Apple can re-use for future hardware and scale to larger GPUs. Maybe it doesn't make sense for Macs today, but in 5 years that may no longer be the case. Now people don't have to throw away a perfectly good computer made in these twilight years of Moore's law. For non-games applications like Blender or Cinema4D, having hardware-accelerated ray tracing and denoising is already a game-changer. Instead of switching between preview and render layers, you can interact with a production-quality render in real time. Materials are properly emissive and transmissive, PBR and normal maps composite naturally instead of needing different settings, and you can count the time it takes before getting an acceptable frame in milliseconds, not minutes. I don't often give Apple the benefit of the doubt, but hardware-accelerated ray tracing is a no-brainer here. If they aren't going to abandon Metal, and they intend to maintain their minuscule foothold in PC gaming, they have to lay the groundwork for future titles to get developed on. They have the hardware investment, they have the capital to invest in their software, and their competitors like Khronos (apparently) and Microsoft both had ray tracing APIs for years when Apple finally released theirs. reply rowanG077 13 hours agorootparentI think you have the wrong impression.

Anecdotally, when I was playing Black Myth Wukong recently, there were some shiny environments where full path tracing really made a huge difference.

Wukong is a perfect example. Unfortunately most people’s experience with raytracing is turning it on for a game that was not designed for it, but it was added through a patch, which results in worse lighting. Why? Because the rasterized image includes baked-in global illumination using more light sources than whatever was hastily put together for the raytracing patch. reply IntelMiner 11 hours agorootparentThe first game I encountered with RayTracing support was World of Warcraft \"Classic\"'s Burning Crusade launch a couple years back. WoW Burning Crusade launched in *2006* originally. The \"Classic\" re-release of the game uses the modern engine but with the original game art assets and content. Does it do anything in the 'modern' WoW game? Probably! In Classic though all it did was tank my framerate. Since then I also played the unimaginable disaster that was Cyberpunk 2077. For as \"pretty\" as I suppose the game looked I can't exactly say if the ray tracing improved anything reply adastra22 2 hours agorootparentWhat's perhaps not obvious is that if you take a 2006 game and \"add\" raytracing, there's no relevant information available for the raytracer. Whatever original light sources were used to bake in global illumination does not exist in the game assets used for rasterization. In the best case the original art assets can be used to create raytracing scenes, but it's not as straightforward as it might seem, and most conversions are pretty sloppy.

They've been leveraging marketing hard to try to generate demand for upgrades among gamers, knowing cryptocurrency won't buoy them forever.

Also a gimmick. reply talldayo 18 hours agorootparent [–] 3D TVs failed before they existed as a product category. You cannot encode enough information through stereoscopy to create a convincing or \"realistic\" 3D effect. The conditions for making it work have always been fickle and as 6DOF VR/AR is proving, it was never enough to be convincing anyways. Encoding two slightly different versions of a video and layering them on top of each other is a dirty hack. It is not a holistic solution to a problem they seriously intended to solve in the first place. It is a novelty designed from the bottom-up as a scarcely-usable toy. Ray tracing is, by comparison, the holy grail of all realtime lighting effects. Global illumination makes the current raster lighting techniques look primitive by comparison. It is not an exaggeration to say that realtime graphics research largely revolves around using hacks to imitate a fraction of ray tracing's power. They are piling on pipeline-after-pipeline for ambient occlusion, realtime reflections and shadowing, bloom and glare as well as god rays and screenspace/volumetric effects. These are all things you don't have to hack together when your scene is already path tracing the environment with the physical properties accounted for. Instead of stacking hacks, you have a coherent pipeline that can be denoised, antialiased, upscaled and post-processed in one pass. No shadowmaps, no baked lighting, all realtime. There is a reason why even Apple quit dragging their feet here - modern real-time graphics are the gimmick, ray tracing is the production-quality alternative. reply adastra22 13 hours agorootparent [–] Thank you. This guy gets it. Path tracing is the gold standard for computer graphics. It is a physically based rendering model that is based on how lighting actually works. There are degrees of path tracing of varying quality, but there is nothing else that is better from a visual quality and accuracy standpoint. Your modern AAA title does a massive amount of impressive hacks to get rasterization into the uncanny valley, as rasterization has nothing to do with how photons work. That can all be thrown out and replaced with “model photons interacting with the scene” if the path tracing hardware was powerful enough. It’d be simpler and perfectly accurate. The end result would not live in the uncanny valley, but would be indistinguishable from reality. Assuming the hardware was fast enough. But we’ll get there. reply flohofwoe 10 hours agorootparentThink of the 'impressive hacks' used in realtime 3D rendering as compression techniques to reduce bandwidth (and this goes all the way back to 8-bit home computers with their tricky video memory encoding, this was essentially hardware image compression to reduce memory bandwidth). Why waste computing power on 'physically correct' algorithms, when the 'cheap hacks' can do so much more in less time, while producing nearly the same result. reply talldayo 2 hours agorootparentBecause a lot of the \"cheap hacks\" aren't even cheap. Famously, using real-time SSR to simulate ray-traced reflections can end up slower than ray tracing them from the jump, the same goes for high-res shadowmaps. Ambient occlusion is a lighting pass you can skip entirely if you render shadows the right way with RT from the start. If you keep stacking these hacks until you have every feature that a RT scene does, you're probably taking longer to render each frame than a globally illuminated scene would. Accelerating ray tracing in-hardware is a literal no-brainer unless you deliberately want to ostracize game developers and animators on Mac. I understand the reactionary \"But I don't care about dynamic shadows!\" opinion, but there's practically no opportunity cost here. If you want to use traditional lighting techniques, you can still render it on an RT-enabled GPU. You just also have the option of not wanting to pull out your fingernails when rendering a preview in Blender. reply flohofwoe 2 hours agorootparentYes, for some specific problems, raytracing definitely makes a lot of sense, but rasterization and 'geometry compression' via triangles also makes a lot of sense for other situations. I think the best approach will always be a hybrid approach instead of a 100% pure raytracing pipeline. The other question is how much of the raytracing features in 3D APIs need to be implemented in fixed-function hardware units, or whether this is just another area where the pendulum will swing back and forth between hardware and software (running on the GPU of course). But then maybe in 10 years we'll have 'signed distance field units' in GPUs and nobody talks about raytracing anymore ;) reply Nullabillity 12 hours agorootparentprev [–] This is all built on the, frankly, nonsensical assumption that photorealism is the, let alone a, primary goal. reply adastra22 11 hours agorootparentIn most cases of high end / AAA game titles, it is. Not all, but certainly most. reply talldayo 3 hours agorootparentprev [–] Not really. Tiny Glade is a recent ray-traced title that has no goal of photorealism whatsoever, and it looks gorgeous with RT lighting and shadows: https://youtu.be/QAUSBxxgIbQ You can scale these same principles to even less photorealistic games like the Borderlands series or a Grand Theft Auto game. Ray tracing is less about photorealism (although it is a potent side effect) and more about creating dynamic lighting conditions for an interactive scene. By simulating the behavior of light, you get realistic lighting - photoreal or not a lot of games rely on SSR and shadowmaps that can be replaced with realtime RT. reply Consider applying for YC's W25 batch!

    "originBody": "Today A new home for Pixelmator Today we have some important news to share: the Pixelmator Team plans to join Apple. We’ve been inspired by Apple since day one, crafting our products with the same razor-sharp focus on design, ease of use, and performance. And looking back, it’s crazy what a small group of dedicated people have been able to achieve over the years from all the way in Vilnius, Lithuania. Now, we’ll have the ability to reach an even wider audience and make an even bigger impact on the lives of creative people around the world. What to expect Pixelmator has signed an agreement to be acquired by Apple, subject to regulatory approval. There will be no material changes to the Pixelmator Pro, Pixelmator for iOS, and Photomator apps at this time. Stay tuned for exciting updates to come. Thank you We want to give a big thanks to our amazing users for your support over the past 17 years. Your feedback has played a huge role in shaping our apps into what they are today. As we step into this exciting new chapter, we can’t wait to share what’s next. – Pixelmator Team Twitter Facebook Email Link Copy Link",

    "commentBody": "Apple acquires Pixelmator (pixelmator.com)481 points by dm 3 hours agohidepastfavorite265 comments thenberlin 1 hour agoPutting concerns about future states aside, congrats to the Pixelmator team. I've been using the app for years and it's a really great piece of software, well designed and well built. It's always been incredible value for the price, especially given that it basically replaces Photoshop for a wide swath of the market without compromising on UX (which is a problem for other competitors) at a price point that's like 1-2 months of an Adobe subscription (I don't even know exactly what that costs any more because Pixelmator + parts of the Affinity suite got me out of their clutches). Adobe must not be stoked about this news. And I'll just keep my fingers crossed this all heads in a direction that's more Logic than Dark Sky. reply wlesieutre 58 minutes agoparentThe greatest news for customers is that Adobe aren't the ones buying it RIP Macromedia Fireworks reply highwaylights 22 minutes agorootparentMan do I ever miss Fireworks. And Dark Sky for that matter. Fireworks really was it though. reply adastra22 33 minutes agorootparentprevIdk, Apple is just as likely to kill it. reply thenberlin 31 minutes agorootparentThough way less likely to turn it into a cursed subscription zombie. reply ghaff 6 minutes agorootparentLeaving aside pricing specifics, the main issue with subscriptions is for products that you just fire up once in a great while. So long as the pricing is reasonable, I have no particular issue with subscriptions for products I use on a routine basis--especially if they're products that more or less require ongoing updates to remain useful. reply newsclues 29 minutes agorootparentprevDoubtful. It might get worked into iPhoto or a new version of Aperture as part of their pro apps. reply adastra22 22 minutes agorootparentHow is that different from what I said? reply newsclues 6 minutes agorootparentIt would be a different name or form but it would not be dead. reply nsbk 10 minutes agoparentprevI can’t even remember how long have I been a Pixelmator and then Pixelmator pro user. I tried it once and I knew I would never go back to Photoshop again. An incredible bang for the price as well! Congrats to the Pixelmator team, and hoping for a bright future for their product. Fingers crossed though! reply lynndotpy 2 hours agoprevIs there any way this can go bad? When Apple acquired DarkSky, they absolutely destroyed a service that I loved and relied on. Four years on, Apple Weather is less reliable than DarkSky, and not even close to feature complete. But DarkSky was a cross-platform service, whereas Pixelmator is software that's already Apple-only. I'm wondering how much I should be worried, and if I should already be abandoning ship. reply madeofpalk 1 hour agoparentOn the other hand, Testflight has a pretty good acquisition story. It got \"merged into main\" and is now a first class citizen of the iOS development ecosystem. Workflow being acquired and turning into Shortcuts is a pretty successful outcome IMHO. Beats still continues to make slightly cheaper headphones. FoundationDB is still there. Apart from Dark Sky, what other products with users has Apple acquired and shut down? Being acquired by Apple doesn't seem to be the obvious death knell that it is for other companies. reply kstrauser 1 hour agorootparentI wish every acquisition improved the end product as much as Workflow's did. All Apple's OSes got better for embracing it. I can write and have written AppleScript things, but Shortcuts is a vastly more convenient UX for the things it's good at. reply azinman2 4 minutes agorootparentWhat do you use it for? reply dbbk 1 hour agorootparentprevI totally forgot TestFlight started out third party reply awwstn 55 minutes agorootparentprevShazam is a huge success story! reply jhdias 54 minutes agorootparentIn what way, specifically for android users? reply crossroadsguy 50 minutes agorootparentIn this way https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shazam.and... reply mh- 44 minutes agorootparentFor posterity: > 4.8 star / 10.5M reviews > 500M+ Downloads > No data shared with third parties reply mintplant 3 minutes agorootparentIt (optionally) integrates with the Apple Music Android app now, and offers to add to your library there whenever you scan a song, so I assume it's a good funnel for them to get people into their service ecosystem. gardaani 1 hour agorootparentprev> what other products with users has Apple acquired and shut down? Shake was acquired in 2002 and killed 7 years later. reply xattt 20 minutes agorootparentIt was wild to see Linux and a Pentium III listed as a supported system on an Apple site in 2004. https://web.archive.org/web/20040613170323/http://www.apple.... reply blihp 1 hour agoparentprevThe talent and ideas that were Pixelmator will be substantially diffused as it's absorbed by Apple... most of what you liked about Pixelmator is likely no more over the next year or two. Depending on Apple's reasoning for the acquisition (i.e. how much of it was just for the talent vs the product) you'll may see some small glimpses of Pixelmator's influence a couple years from now in Apple's stuff. Most of the time Apple doesn't keep the acquired product around. reply Eric_WVGG 1 hour agorootparentOn acquisitions like DarkSky (RIP), sure. This looks a lot more like a Logic-style acquisition. Pixelmator would slot nicely into the same consumer set of productivity apps that ship with all Macs (Pages, Numbers, Keynote). Photomator will get them back into the market they abandoned when Aperture was shuttered. Speaking of Aperture… am I the only person who remembers that Apple owns Claris? Why didn't Apple just hand off Aperture to Claris and say \"just keep this thing working on new MacOS releases\"? reply SllX 1 hour agorootparentClaris isn’t really a dumping ground anymore. That’s how it started, but they’ve evolved their own business since then. reply iwontberude 59 minutes agorootparentprevAnd the management team that brought us Claris is still leading Apps to this day. Apple doesn't wipe out management during acquisitions, it permanently entrenches them in their structure. reply grahamj 1 hour agorootparentprevugh don't get me started about Aperture. I'm still salty about that. reply jstummbillig 1 hour agorootparentprevLogic and and Final Cut were bought and developed since. Pixelmator fills the open Photoshop space in an Apple way, and will plausibly go the same way — no vague pessimism required. reply askafriend 1 hour agorootparentprevPixelmator as a product is literally what Apple would have built anyway if they made an attempt. The difference here is how aligned the original team is with their acquirer...down to the corner radius on every button. With other products like Dark Sky, the product is substantially different in philosophy or design. reply wlesieutre 1 hour agorootparentThe main worry is that it will be an acquihire into the Photos app and Apple doesn’t actually want to have a separate image editor (let alone two). They used to have Aperture competing with Lightroom and then decided pro photography wasn’t a space they needed to be in, has something changed where now they want their own Photoshop competitor? reply zarzavat 1 hour agorootparentThis would be very short sighted as Pixelmator adds way more value to the Mac platform than a better Photos app. reply wlesieutre 1 hour agorootparentDark Sky would've added more value if they'd just renamed it Weather and made it the built-in app, and yet... I do hope they'll offer Pixelmator as an included app on Macs and Pixelmator Pro alongside Logic, Finalcut, and other \"Pro\" software. The lack of a built-in image editor can be annoying. Photos works for some stuff, Preview includes basic adjustments too, but sometimes you just want something like a hue/saturation adjustment instead of color temperature and pink/green tint, or multiple layers so you can experiment with different edits non-destructively. reply jbverschoor 1 hour agorootparentprevThere’s no way Apple can build this. Their human interface people all seem to be gone on the desktop. So many things work so bad these days when they migrated to the new ui framework. reply askafriend 1 hour agorootparentLogic Pro for Mac is regarded very well. When they make a focused effort in professional software, Apple can deliver. reply mxey 1 hour agorootparentprevWorkflow becoming Shortcuts mostly as-is would be a counterexample. reply 39896880 1 hour agorootparentprevNote that this hasn’t happened with Shazam, miraculously reply Insanity 16 minutes agorootparentOk so to be fair.. I own an iPhone for about 3 years now and only discovered it comes shipped with Shazam about 6 months ago and only used it twice since. When I told my wife (also a somewhat long-time iPhone user), she didn’t know it came build-in either. I’m not a power user, neither is my wife.. I don’t think it is all that well advertised. reply iwontberude 1 hour agorootparentprevI want to point out that the same management team that brought us ClarisWorks is still leading Apps. Apple drag and drops teams into their org chart and gives them tons of autonomy. reply whamlastxmas 1 hour agorootparentprevI don’t understand why companies buy other companies for the talent and not product. Why not just make everyone working there an incredible offer at the same time? It would cost so so so much less than these massive buy outs. Maybe not all of them would take you up on it, but if you buy the company a lot of them may not stick around post-buyout anyway. I feel like this would be a lot more effective also because in a buyout, employees just make the same old salary at the new company. In my method, they make a ton more and are more likely to stay reply jahewson 42 minutes agorootparent> Why not just make everyone working there an incredible offer at the same time? Under civil law this is regarded as tortious interference. Businesses have a contract with their employees and if you interfere with it to harm the employer then you are liable for damages. If you tried to make a mass offer like this, the employer could likely get a judge to place an injunction against it immediately. If they don’t notice until further down the line, watch out: damages are unlimited. They can extend to a judge breaking up your new business unit and handing it back to the original employer or rewarding damages of the entire lifetime value of the business unit. That’s why you never see companies do this :) reply cultureswitch 30 minutes agorootparentI wonder what's the theory of harm behind such law. Employers competing over talent is... illegal? Explains a lot actually. reply SupremumLimit 3 minutes agorootparentStep 1: make everyone an incredible offer Step 2: get them all hired away from your competitor who is now out of business Step 3: in a year or two, restructure all these people out (or just fire them if your jurisdiction allows) Step 4: your competitor is gone, and all it cost was a year or two of salaries. Seems like a great way to help out budding monopolies. dahart 1 hour agorootparentprevMultiple reasons. That it does happen should be reason to question your assumptions, rather than assume some obvious imagined alternative has been overlooked by everyone, right? While poaching one employee at a time might be usually legal, attempting to poach all employees of a company might not be legal, and either way is considered unethical. Paying off the investors may be the goal. Eliminating the product or competition ethically may be the goal. Buying the competition’s customers, and/or distribution channels may be the goal. Acquiring the top talent, while giving them the expected reward for having bootstrapped a company, might be the goal. Founders are often uninterested in a salaried position for themselves, but may be interested in a return for the company and payoff for everyone in it - as backpay for their investment, completely separate from their salary going forward. Also, your hypothesis is not accurate. Buyouts are not always, or even usually, massive. It’s common for them to be small and medium sized. It is definitely not a given that making persuasive individual offers would be any cheaper than an acquisition, let alone “so much” cheaper. Depends entirely on the situation. reply dwaite 46 minutes agorootparentprevSometimes that does happen. Apple historically tends to look for shipping results, and the underlying software and services (such as using DarkSky's algorithms and server code as starting points) are often worth it over just putting offers out to key people. This obviously isn't always true; they do have some longer-term research projects and strategic initiatives we've seen leak out (cars and non-invasive blood glucose monitoring are common mentioned ones), but I think Apple generally would prefer to let others succeed or fail in the research. There's nothing _to_ Pixelmator IMHO other than the product. Apple knows how to do sepia tone filters already. reply alexwhb 1 hour agorootparentprevYa that’s a solid point. Though many startups give their employees equity options… so you have to factor that in too. Also buying a start up for talent seems risky since many people that join startups are looking for a totally different energy than a large corporation, so it seems reasonable that there’d be a big drop off of that talent as soon as it gets acquired… especially if the vision is not aligned reply yoz-y 43 minutes agorootparentprevApple did do that when they were building an electric car: https://www.reuters.com/article/business/apple-s-auto-ambiti... reply jahewson 38 minutes agorootparentNo, this was a failing business and the employees fled. reply shagie 19 minutes agoparentprevYou can get WeatherKit cross platform. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/weatherkitrestapi https://developer.apple.com/weatherkit/ - the pricing is comparable to the original - https://web.archive.org/web/20150811201137/https://developer...

The predicted rain over the next hour looks the same as it did in DarkSky, and you can view the scrub the predicted clouds map timeline and see that it's predicting the same stuff. And the real-life quality where I live has shown no change, nor is there any obvious reason why there would have been. I presume Apple bought DarkSky for their tech rather than their userbase, so it wouldn't make any sense for them to reduce its computational quality. > and not even close to feature complete. To be honest, I don't really remember what else was in DarkSky, I just used it for its main feature -- rain over the next hour. But the Apple Weather app has a ton of features. Is there one or more specific features you're missing? I think it sucks for Android users that Apple bought it. But for iOS I've been totally happy to have it integrated, rather than dealing with 2 separate apps. reply wrongotron 30 minutes agorootparentI am a regular runner. The accurate micro-forecasts on Dark Sky were a huge help for me to plan ahead so I wouldn't get caught in the rain. Apple Weather mostly fails at this. Additionally, I really dislike the Apple Weather dataviz for the day's trends. This time of year, the my local weather can wildly change from early morning to late afternoon, and I want to plan what to wear. I could glance quickly at Dark Sky and see the trend almost instantly. Apple Weather requires this awkward tap and drag gesture to see actual temperature values through the day. Apple weather puts all sorts of weather data at the same level, despite the utility being wildly different. I need to know the temperature trend for the day, or rain chance. Wind speed isn't very useful to me day to day, yet they are at the same \"level\" of UI access. It doesn't feel very driven by user needs, but perhaps there are a lot more sailors using the app than I realize. reply lynndotpy 58 minutes agorootparentprevI miss the visualization, but IMO the biggest feature loss is the history feature. You could select any day in the past, even going back decades, and get historical weather information. The hyper-local rain forecasts were always accurate for me with DarkSky. The \"rain starting in 3 minutes, stopping in 10\" was accurate. But right now, Apple Weather is telling me it's cloudy and raining where I'm at, and I'm looking outside my window to clear skies and dry ground. reply dwaite 36 minutes agorootparent> I miss the visualization, but IMO the biggest feature loss is the history feature. AFAIK this is still in the API (although it wasn't at launch). Apple is fine with third party weather apps that provide all the information within WeatherKit. > The hyper-local rain forecasts were always accurate for me with DarkSky. DarkSky didn't magically rectify the difference between the macro predicted weather and hyperlocal forecasting either. One is a legitimate weather model, one is vectoring based on the last few radar maps. Apple just still puts the macro predictions up front, and treats hyperlocal as short term badging/alerts. > But right now, Apple Weather is telling me it's cloudy and raining where I'm at Does it say \"rain will continue for the next hour\", e.g. a hyperlocal forecast? reply crazygringo 40 minutes agorootparentprev> But right now, Apple Weather is telling me it's cloudy and raining where I'm at, and I'm looking outside my window to clear skies and dry ground. Huh, I definitely haven't experienced that with the chart that shows rain over the next hour, the part that comes from DarkSky. What happens when you look at the rainfall map timeline from the past couple hours and the prediction over the couple next? Are you just on the very edge of rain/sun? Or is it all super spotty? Or is it totally and completely wrong regionwide? And is the historical data from the previous couple hours accurate at least? Just curious where the problem is coming from. Because it's visually pretty obvious how it works when you look at it. reply MichaelZuo 45 minutes agorootparentprevYeah, Apple Weather is not even accurate 95% of the time in north eastern Toronto 1 hour ahead… And sometimes it’s bizarrely off, like saying the UV index is 1 on a cloudless June afternoon. There’s no sanity checking to speak off. reply crazygringo 9 minutes agorootparent> And sometimes it’s bizarrely off, like saying the UV index is 1 on a cloudless June afternoon. There’s no sanity checking to speak off. That sounds like weather data that hasn't updated for hours because you have a bad connection or something. It does drive me nuts that all weather apps I've ever used always show you the previously loaded data, even if it's 5 days stale. I absolutely despise this \"optimistic\" UX model where it assumes that the most recent data is \"good enough\" until new data is fetched. Especially since it never even tells you how stale the data is. Like, if weather data is more than two hours old, I'd rather you show me nothing, because then at least I know to go outside and check, rather than be deceived by the app lying to me. reply jshier 43 minutes agorootparentprevApple Weather is still missing some of the data that Dark Sky exposed, like cloud coverage percentage and other niche info. I also find the UX a little worse, as I like more data at a glance. But you can tell they're using the Dark Sky backend, as it has the same bugs that Dark Sky had, like slowing loading map tiles which sometimes fail altogether. And there was the time they accidentally reenabled the Dark Sky API after an Apple backend deployment. :D reply grahamj 1 hour agorootparentprevI was (selfishly) happy with the acquisition because DarkSky didn't support where I live. Now I have hyperlocal rain notifications I didn't get before. reply sleepybrett 1 hour agorootparentprevI think weather is ... fine. I liked darksky better, it was more focused and less cluttered. It's purely a design, not functionality thing for me. reply HumblyTossed 1 hour agoparentprev> Is there any way this can go bad? 6 months they'll realize they can't fit in with Apple's culture and most of the team will hit the road. reply saaaaaam 57 minutes agorootparentYou'd assume that their new deal with Apple will involve a certain amount of stock based comp with a cliff. Golden handcuffs. reply ablation 2 hours agoparentprevWhy worry about something you have no control over? Keep using it, but be exploring alternatives now in case it does. Don't waste energy fretting over this. reply latexr 2 hours agorootparentI feel like those ideas are contradictory. Exploring alternatives just in case is wasting energy. For example, for months I’ve been thinking of trying Inkscape to replace Affinity Designer, yet I keep putting it off because I’m not exactly enthused about the idea of having to learn yet another vector app again and deal with all its bugs and quirks. reply robotresearcher 1 hour agorootparentExploring is not wasted. Fretting is wasted. reply latexr 1 hour agorootparentIt is wasted, because in this situation you’re forced to do it. If you end up not switching, all the time you spent trying something else comes to nothing. If you do switch, you were still forced to spend a bunch of time looking for something. reply shermantanktop 1 hour agorootparentFor me, \"nothing\" is rarely true. When I've had to learn a tool that operated in a different way, I've often come away realizing that I could think about a common task differently, or that there are capabilities I didn't realize I wanted. I this case I'm thinking of domain-specific tools meant for creation or curation, like an IDE, image editor, word processor, etc. That wouldn't apply to bureaucratic paperwork-type tools, where learning the site is typically a one-off and is pure waste. reply latexr 1 hour agorootparentYes, I agree, “nothing” won’t always be true. But I felt like the idea came across and that having to overly explain and nitpick my own clarification was unnecessary. reply HumblyTossed 1 hour agorootparentprevWho is \"fretting\".

That’s usually the consequence of such acquisitions. reply mikey_p 2 hours agoparentprevI dunno, I thought \"sherlocking\" wouldn't be a thing if they acquired instead of duplicating their solution in-house, but it's the same effect, just more equitable to the original creators. reply lucianbr 2 hours agoparentprevThere's always a way. On the other hand, does it help to worry? I don't think you can influence Apple. reply archagon 1 hour agoparentprevApple is all-in on services revenue.

Forgetting to periodically save their work and have the app crash, or was it saving incorrectly and producing corrupted files? reply spacedcowboy 1 hour agorootparentAperture was utterly paranoid about data-loss. There was the SQLite database that was run on its own thread, and regularly synced to disk, the hard-sync that waited until the data had flushed through to the disk platters. In addition to that there was a whole structure of plist files, one per image, that meant the database could be reconstructed from all these individual files, so if something had somehow corrupted the SQLite database, it could be rebuilt. There was an option to do that in the menu or settings, I forget which. The plists were write-once, so they couldn't be corrupted by the app after they'd been written-and-verified on ingest. Finally, there were archives you could make which would back up the database (and plist files) to another location. This wasn't automated (like Time Machine is) but you could set it running overnight and come back to a verified-and-known-good restore-point. If there was a catastrophic data loss, it's (IMHO much) more likely there was a disk failure than anything in the application itself causing problems - and unless you only ever had one instance of your data, and further that the disk problem was across both the platter-area that stored plists and well as database, it ought to have been recoverable. Source: I wrote the database code for Aperture. I tested it with various databases holding up to 1M photos on a nightly basis, with scripts that randomly corrupted parts of the database, did a rebuild, and compared the rebuilt with a known-good db. We regarded the database as a cache, and the plists as \"truth\" I'm not saying it was impossible that it was a bug in Aperture - it was a very big program, but we ran a lot of tests on that thing, we were very aware that people are highly attached to their photos, and we also knew that when you have millions of users, even a 1-in-a-million corner-case problem can be a really big issue - no-one wanted to read \"Aperture lost all my photos\", ever. reply vr46 23 minutes agorootparentAgain, thanks for the interesting insights. I personally witnessed one incident I mentioned, and for my sins tried to help my panicking classmate, I think we reached a good-enough outcome. On the subject of raw files processing, I have yet to find an ideal system, if it is even possible, where edits to get a RAW photo to its final state are handled and stored in some deterministic format, yet somehow connected to said image, in a way that allows the combination of the edit and raw to travel around. Everything I've tried - let's see, Aperture, Lightroom, Capture One - have to use some kind of library or database and there's no great way of managing the whole show. The edits ARE the final image and the only solution I had that ever works was to maintain a Mac Pro with RAID and an old copy of Lightroom, and run all images through that. IIRC, I never understood the Aperture filesystem, probably not meant for humans, which didn't help. Does that sound right? reply vr46 1 hour agorootparentprevGoing back to 2007, so can't remember super clearly, but IIRC the db was a sqlite like thing and all info about everything was stored in this, and it was vulnerable to corruption, plus all versions and thumbnails were mixed together with original image files - a total mess. The digital photo management landscape wasn't so mature then, and some people trusted Aperture with their original images whereas later versions allowed or encouraged people to keep their \"masters\" elsewhere. Because the whole thing was as slow as a slug dragging a ball-and-chain, pre-SSD, issues with that filesystem or master database were sometimes mistaken for just general slowness. I jumped to Lightroom faster than you could say Gordon Parks. reply spacedcowboy 1 hour agorootparentAperture 1.0 was very slow. The stories I could tell about its genesis... I came on board just before 1.0 release, and for 1.5 we cleaned things up a bit. For 2.0 we (mainly I) completely rewrote the database code, and got between 10x and 100x improvements by using SQLite directly rather than going through CoreData. CoreData has since improved, but it was a nascent technology itself back then, and not suited to the sort of database use we needed. The SQLite database wasn't \"vulnerable to corruption\", SQLite has several articles about its excellent ACID nature. The design of the application was flawed at the beginning though, with bindings used frequently in the UI to managed objects persisted in the database, which meant (amongst other things) that: - User changes a slider - Change is propagated through bindings - CoreData picks up the binding and syncs it to disk - But the database is on another thread, which invalidates the ManagedObjectContext - Which means the context has to re-read everything from the database - Which takes time - By now the user has moved the slider again. So: slow. I fixed that - see the other post I made. reply vr46 35 minutes agorootparentThanks for the lovely insight, super interesting - I don't think I made it to Aperture 2 - but sounds like some unusual decisions made in that editing process. I suspect, based on my own history with disk problems, that the filesystem issues that would regularly pop up and not dealt with by your average technically-over-trusting student were the root cause, but exacerbated by the choices of image management and application speed. reply hggigg 2 hours agorootparentprevYeah this. Aperture was a mess. Some of the \"full\" edit tools from Aperture are actually lurking in Photos which is a fairly competent photo editor on macOS surprisingly. I think they have a chance. I know a couple of professional photographers. One uses Capture One and only for tethering support. The other an ancient copy of Lightroom that was a one time purchase and use that for persistent contract work for one of the larger advertising companies in London. If the price is right and it's good enough, they are probably going to do fine. I'm an amateur and I want to get off LR because I hate giving Adobe money every month and the damn thing is a fat pig compared to Photomator. Photomator is missing decent dehaze and because I have a shitty little DX mirrorless, I need the denoise and it's not as good as LR is. reply dylan604 2 hours agorootparentI was quite surprised (pleasantly) with the editing features available in Photos. I rarely use it on the desktop, and primarily only use it on the device I took the image, but to see how much more in depth the editing was on desktop was one of those that I thought for a second might make me switch to using it for device captured image editing. For non-device camera images, I still use full tilt apps as that's just my workflow and I do not ever see Photos working its way into that workflow reply hggigg 1 hour agorootparentYeah I’m currently using lightroom for my mirrorless.

And creating things with those apps was just fun. It feels like a shame that only vestiges of that time remain today. The bar is much higher in some ways (lower in others), it takes a lot more skill and specialized knowledge to compete, and almost all vendors don't put in the same careful attention to detail (especially UX) that the Apple pro apps of that era had. reply dylan604 2 hours agorootparentIt seems there was a huge loss of software in the 32bit->64bit switch.

As a professional, you need to keep up, and you want new features to reduce your busywork in the app. Buzz is actually a pretty good metric, because it means the product is being maintained and improved, and you want to be investing in tools that will continue to meet your needs over the next 10 years rather than become stagnant, and then you have to re-train on a competitor. reply jwells89 36 minutes agorootparentI dunno, I'd be more inclined to subscribe to a version of Photoshop CS1/CS2 that runs on modern operating systems where all development effort goes into fixing bugs and improving performance instead of something like current Photoshop CC, where the focus is on gee-whiz gimmicky features. Plugins can fill in for the gee-whiz stuff without turning the core app into a cosmically bloated mess. reply VyseofArcadia 2 hours agorootparentprevI suppose we need to be more specific about what we mean by buzz. I mean \"buzz\" to be a general enthusiasm about the software even among non-users. I recall times when there was quite a lot of this kind of buzz about both Logic and Final Cut, in part I think because they were a part of Apple's Mac OS X comeback story. I suspect you mean \"buzz\" to be enthusiasm in the community of users of the tools. I know software I've worked on in the pass, the general public couldn't care less about our product, but new releases always got a lot of buzz in our forums. This kind of buzz might actually be a pretty good metric. reply bangaroo 2 hours agorootparentprevpeople who work in jobs tend to talk about their tools. i worked in tv for a while a couple decades back, i went to school for film, and thus i have many friends who do creative video editing and professional video editing and still follow the industry closely. i'm not talking about typical social media buzz, i'm talking about \"companies moving on to the product\" or even \"companies continuing to use the product,\" or professionals choosing to invest in the tool for their work. i've only seen businesses and creatives i know moving their workflows away from FCP and Logic. i've not talked to friends in the industry who are moving on to them. buzz may be a poor word to choose, but for example i have a friend who does a lot of in-house editing for a massive, national company that owns many local TV stations and they're moving from avid to _premiere_, of all things, which really feels shocking given that premiere for a long time felt like the hobbyist tool. a good example of a tool that has industry buzz lately is davinci resolve, which has had a meteoric rise in prominence. i don't think that it's the same thing as the average person talking around the water cooler but more and more of my friends who work at networks or in production are starting to use resolve in their color and editing workflows, and it's a topic of discussion. reply VyseofArcadia 1 hour agorootparentMy mistake then, I thought you meant a more general social media kind of buzz. Logic and Final Cut did at one point have that kind of buzz when they were a part of Apple's \"wow look at all the pros using macs\" Mac OS X comeback story. reply bangaroo 1 hour agorootparentone hundred percent - and i felt like when they initially launched garageband they were doing a great play to get people (particularly folks who dabble and school kids) invested in the logic-style workflow to build up their familiarity so that folks entering the industry would demand it in their workplaces... and then it all just fell off. they actually seemed to want to have that kind of flow in place for basically every kind of professional tool! imovie->FCP and garageband->logic being the prime examples (or maybe only, I guess) that I can think of. I assume there was some shift in how they thought about serving professionals and where apple's place in the work ecosystem was because the beginning of the end for apple pro software in terms of prominence aligned roughly, it seems, with things like the discontinuation of the xserve line (which itself wound down as apple seemed to rebrand itself as a consumer device company first on the heels of the iPhone's success.) reply rty32 1 hour agoparentprev> it feels like something they'd be well-positioned to seriously take on if they invested heavily in it. I agree, but history just proved that Apple does not care. And let's be real: Photoshop is cross-platform, and lots of content creation software is cross platform (or a web app). There are many more content creators that use Windows than people here are aware of or want to acknowledge (on HN, sometimes you get the impression that Windows is a forgotten OS that nobody uses). Now, Apple is at a huge disadvantage for losing that market -- often you can only be a big player if you have enough users. Apple also is never known for putting apps on the web like Figma and doesn't appear to have plan to do so. A similar example is the iWork suite. It exists, but neither users nor Apple seem to care about it. In the end, they just kind of development native Mac OS software half-mindedly. Which is fine -- that's what they want to do. reply mxey 1 hour agorootparent> A similar example is the iWork suite. It exists, but neither users nor Apple seem to care about it. I would disagree on that, at least about Keynote.

Apple was into pro apps 20 years ago when they were trying to win over creatives to their new platform (OS X). That's hasn't been a priority for them since then, they've vaguely migrated to the prosumer market (Final Cut Pro X). But that strikes me more as a compromise to give the products more life without doing things that are antithetical to Apple (mainly backwards compatible, i.e., real pros need this). I've speculated here that my only guess is this is about visionOS (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42018695), but curious to hear from anyone what specific problem expanding their pro line up solves beyond that?

Why would you feel like its being abandoned? Professional tools don't change UX every 2 years. reply bangaroo 2 hours agorootparentApple is clearly investing in it, but for whatever reason it's simply not got the foothold it once had and they don't seem super interested in pushing it and people aren't using it. I feel like it's substantially less prominent in the industry than it was a decade or two ago, I see it in far fewer studios (or, even further I'll say I literally have not seen anyone using it in person in the past ten years, which is a marked change.) For a very long time, I feel like cubase/logic/pro tools were The DAWs That People Used. Logic doesn't seem to be appealing to new producers as much and it doesn't seem like Apple is as invested in pushing or promoting it as it used to be. I might be wrong, though! I much more frequently see Ableton for folks doing electronic music now (that really eats up most of the dance music space, as far as I can tell) with pro tools being the juggernaut in the live recording space. That said, I'm like... a hobbyist audio engineer who records and mixes friend's bands, so it's not like I'm in and out of studios all the time and there's tons I haven't seen. It's just anecdotal. reply changing1999 1 hour agorootparentprevLogic falls into a weird space between pro (studio) software and home studio software. Professional studios mostly use Pro Tools and Cubase (Europe). Home users mostly migrated to Live. It's obviously an oversimplification but it does reflect the problem Logic is facing. Live is far ahead of Logic in the electronic music space. With a streamlined UI and M4L it dominated the market for the new(ish) generation of musicians. Every single musician I know (100s) moved from Logic to Live within the last two decades. The only people I know who still use Logic are composers (Live lacks music notation) using laptops at home.

This strategy works extremely well for them in the consumer space but it’s just frustrating for pros to deal with. When professionals invest in a software tool for their business they need to have some assurance of commitment from the software vendor. It takes an enormous amount of time and effort to retrain for new tools and retool for new workflows. Pros really like when a company that makes their tools is really open about the development roadmap and engaged in two-way conversations about issues with the tools and what needs to be fixed, what new features are needed, etc. Apple has traditionally been seen to be hostile to that sort of relationship. reply BolexNOLA 2 hours agoparentprevThe abandoning of FCPX after surviving the reputation blow it took during the transition from 7->X is baffling to me.

I’m cautiously optimistic about this acquisition, I almost hope Apple just makes it free as part of the iLife suite (or whatever it’s called now). reply kccqzy 2 hours agoprevI bought and used Pixelmator a long time ago, but stopped right after Affinity Photo (and Designer) came out. I didn't follow its development very closely since then. Has anyone used both Pixelmator and Affinity Photo recently? I'd appreciate some comparison here. reply handsclean 1 hour agoprevMan, I don’t think this will be good for users. The biggest shortcoming of Pixelmator is its lack of Windows support. This rules out use in most of the professional world, not because one must run Windows, but because one must collaborate with others. Pixelmator has long been Apple-centric, but while previously I’d hoped that, in the right situation, they might expand their strategy, now I can’t imagine I will ever be able to use Pixelmator for work. Its second biggest shortcoming is the plugin ecosystem’s apathy towards it. Apple doesn’t have it in their DNA to fix this. Apple’s developer relations strategy is to own a lucrative enough audience that developers will endure anything for access to them. Apple doesn’t own the audience for professional image editor plugins, and I can’t imagine them suddenly learning a whole new mode of interacting with developers. Additionally, when a company acquires a much smaller one, they really don’t care at all about the smaller one’s business, they care about how their existing business is affected. For example, when Apple acquired Dark Sky, they transplanted the features that fit into their existing strategy, but they weren’t interested in crowd sourced data or Android weather apps, so they just deleted it, and now the world’s weather forecasts are worse. Maybe, hopefully, Apple believes their walled garden’s value will be increased by the addition of a Pixelmator-like product. But I fear it’s more likely they just want to stick layers in Photos, delete the rest, lose every Pixelmator customer, and cry a fraction of a tear equal to Pixelmator’s profits divided by their own. Affinity sold out, too. I don’t know where to go at this point. reply giobox 1 hour agoparentThe issue with Windows support for tools like Pixelmator is that a great many of its features are wrappers around OS level image manipulation libraries that come with macOS/iOS - Windows doesn't have anything like the rich image manipulation libraries built in that macOS has, so to get feature parity would very likely involve building from scratch a ton of the stuff they didn't have to do on macOS. The Pixelmator developers have said this before in their own support forums too when question of Windows/Linux support is asked. This is partly why we often see new image editor apps only hit macOS/iOS sometimes, especially if its from a smaller development team. > This rules out use in most of the professional world I don't agree with this; I have never worked at a company the design team weren't all on Macs, regardless of company size. Sure it rules out some professional use but I doubt it's even a majority. The output image file assets can be shared with any OS etc etc so not like it stops collaboration either. reply ozten 1 hour agoparentprevWhy do you say Affinity sold out? reply handsclean 1 hour agorootparentThey sold to Canva, which is strictly subscription based. As far as I know there haven’t been negative changes yet, but we’re still in the period before we’d see them. reply pier25 2 hours agoprevVery interesting move. Adobe must be trembling. Lots of people have already left Premiere and AE for Resolve. If Apple offers Photoshop and Illustrator alternatives it will remove the need to pay for the Adobe subscription for a lot of Mac users (that will probably be the case for me). reply 999900000999 2 hours agoparentAdobe is at a weird place.

I think currently I'm paying $25 a month but they refunded me the first month where I accidentally lapsed back onto the \"real\" pricing, and gave me the next four months for free. So basically $175 for the year. I'll probably cancel it next time it comes up though, I basically only use it for complicated PDF stuff, and I'm sure I can find something else to do that. reply 999900000999 47 minutes agorootparentThis is basically it, just complain and they'll cut you a deal. reply kylehotchkiss 52 minutes agorootparentprevHow are you grandfathered?

I used to buy several copies of CS3 and CS4 back when they came on DVD and I'm still using the same account, and moved to subscriptions with three seats as soon as they came in. So my LTV is probably fairly compared to a normal \"consumer\" account where they've only ever subscribed. Obviously compared to an enterprise account it's nothing, but if you're buying enterprise licensing I imagine you're getting it for less than $30 per seat per month. reply hbosch 2 hours agoparentprevWeird, because the overlap between After Effects and Resolve is insignificantly small.

Everyone around me has moved on from Premiere and Final Cut to Resolve. AE is objectively a more powerful solution for motion graphics than Fusion. But OTOH it's super convenient to have it all in a single app and for many projects (probably most video projects) you don't need more than Fusion. reply robenkleene 22 minutes agorootparentIf you don't mind sharing I'd love to hear which industry you're in. What I typically hear is advertising is Premiere, Hollywood is Avid, and Resolve is taking over prosumer/smaller shops (although still AE for any remotely sophisticated motion graphics/2D work). And Nuke for VFX compositing. I've actually never heard of Fussion itself being being popular for anything actually, it seems like it's not sophisticated enough to compete with Nuke, and not a great fit for the motion graphics/2D stuff that AE excels at. reply hbosch 2 hours agorootparentprevI would be shocked if Rive had even 1% of the DAU that After Effects does. reply pier25 2 hours agorootparentI agree but it's getting better every day and the growth has been phenomenal.

The top features for nearly 30 years have not been the destructive editing portion of the app but the composition tools. By composition tools I mean the layer, channel, and layer effects tools. Layer effects/adjustments and masks make for easy compositing and live readjustment. It's the live nature of these features which is helpful because you're having to constantly refine the look of things based on a client's feedback. Photoshop manages to handle all sorts of layering while still providing color correct output. It's not glamorous but it's important and most supposed Photoshop competitors over the decades fail at it. Some tools do many of the same things but I don't know of apps that can do everything Photoshop does it that space. It's fine to snipe at Photoshop users that only have very basic needs for which Photoshop is overkill. I don't do anything graphic design anymore so Pixelmator and Affinity Photo have my needs covered. I purchased both and they've been well worth the money. But if you want to actually go after professional Photoshop users, not just incidental users, you really need 100% of Photoshop's functionality. Otherwise you'll miss a must-have feature that some designer requires for their workflow. As much as I've enjoyed Pixelmator it's not even 50% of Photoshop's capabilities. It's not even on par with the decades old Photoshop 6. reply pier25 33 minutes agorootparentI agree. The feature that keeps me using Illustrator vs all the other vector graphics apps is group isolation. Nobody has implemented this properly and it's a deal breaker since my vector workflow relies on groups instead of using layers.

There's a decent sized market of prosumer/enthusiast photographers where CaptureOne is a bit overkill, but DarkTable isn't intuitive enough compared to Lightroom. They don't want the subscription, but have no other real choice ever since Aperture was killed. If Apple continues development of Photomator and continues to improve on it I can see it starting to eat away at Lightroom's marketshare for the enthusiast/semi-pro market. Cross-platform is a non issue as that market is majority macOS already. I'm hopeful, as someone that has a photography business on the side, that this works out. I miss Aperture, and CaptureOne isn't as good as batch editing for events as Lightroom Classic (although it's improved quite a bit lately).

    "originBody": "We empower parents to say yes to waiting for the smartphone. The Wait Until 8th pledge empowers parents to rally together to delay giving children a smartphone until at least the end of 8th grade. Let’s protect the elementary and middle school years from the distractions and the dangers of a smartphone. Banding together helps decrease the pressure to have a phone at an early age. Ten years old is the average age children get their first smartphone. You can change this! More than 82,000 parents have said yes to waiting on the smartphone for their families. This is making a tremendous difference in communities across the country! Smartphones are distracting and potentially dangerous for children yet are widespread in elementary and middle school because of unrealistic social pressure and expectations to have one. These devices are quickly changing childhood for children. Playing outdoors, spending time with friends, reading books and hanging out with family is happening a lot less to make room for hours of snap chatting, instagramming, and catching up on YouTube. Parents feel powerless in this uphill battle and need community support to help delay the ever-evolving presence of the smartphone in the classroom, social arena and family dinner table. Link arms with other parents to wait until at least the end of eighth grade for a smartphone! By signing the online pledge, you promise not to give your child a smartphone until at least the end of 8th grade as long as at least 10 families total from your child’s grade and school pledge.

This is a LOT easier today than it was 5-10 years ago. It feels like there's been a generation divide where younger kids are not as insistent on smartphones as the older kids were. Maybe it was covid. But also there's a lot of negative sentiment even amongst kids about smartphones - that they are addictive, encourage anti-social behaviors, and enable bullying. \"Brain-rot\". Our local school district banned phones during school hours just this last year and there has been an overwhelming positive sentiment from faculty and kids. We don't otherwise do things like track screen time. Our kids have videogames and computers and tablets. But we're providing a dumbphone in late grade school and so far there are no protests to get anything else. reply simplyluke 16 hours agoparentI'm 26, so now a decade removed from the relevant age bracket here, but was one of the first waves to hit high school with a majority of students having smartphones. There's been a palpable shift in peers (and myself) post-pandemic with regards to phones and social media in particular. A lot more emphasis being placed on being present in person and a lot more skepticism across the board towards phones/social media. Peers are starting to have kids and almost none of them are posting pictures of their kids and when it's come up in conversation they're doing everything they can to delay ipads/smartphones. reply pixxel 10 hours agorootparentThis is wonderful to hear. reply warner25 20 hours agoparentprevI've had this same thought. I have younger kids, so we haven't yet reached the point of needing to contend with all this (e.g. \"...but everyone else has an iPhone and Instagram and Tik-Tok account...\"), and I've been encouraged by what seems like an increasingly popular movement to deal with it through collective action. It does seem like parents with kids 5-10 years older went through the worst of it; with society caught off-guard and any parent who fought the problem going hard against the grain. reply trogdor 18 hours agoparentprevI am 38 years old. I attend concerts very frequently, and - though it’s uncommon - some shows don’t allow photos or videos, at the artist’s request. And it’s enforced by venue staff. Even as someone who enjoys taking videos at concerts, I really like the vibe at shows that have a no-photo/no-video policy. It increases audience engagement, and it stops the phenomenon where everyone has their phone held high in the air, blocking the view during popular songs. reply prisenco 7 hours agorootparentI used to take video at concerts, a lot of it. And I rarely if ever went back and watched it in any meaningful capacity. It became dead space on my phone. But at some point I started a ritual of recording of the performer coming out, picking up their instruments, and the first 20-30 seconds of the opening song. Then I put my phone away for the rest of the concert. These videos are dear to me. They capture the feeling of the concert more than any longer random moment from before. I have a small library of them and I love to rewatch. I wouldn't mind a concert enforcing those rules at all, though I appreciate that I've found a way to immortalize the moment in a way that coincidentally helps me feel comfortable putting away my phone for the rest of the night. reply jcul 8 hours agorootparentprevI was at a DJ shadow concert recently and he had a notice at the start about not using phones and letting others enjoy the show without devices.

I would love my kids to have (a) gps tracking, (b) ability to send texts/calls to like 5 predefined numbers, (c) tell the time, and nothing else. But watches all seem to have games or weird gamified fitness trackers (Google's new fitbit for kids). Or they are super kid-ish, like bright blue with animal icons, and would be revolting to my older kids. That would make it easy to wait until 9th grade for a more feature-rich phone, though maybe still not unfettered access. Does anyone have a basic watch/dumbphone solution for older kids that they like? reply lairv 21 hours agoparentEveryone has a different threshold for what they want from a dumb phone, some wants Google Maps, some think Youtube is ok, Google Chrome etc. which makes it hard to have a one true dumb phone. If you give access to the play store it's no longer a dumb phone The best way to have a dumb phone tailored to your needs is to take a cheap smartphone and make it dumb, either by using a different launcher, or a customized OS I wish there was an easy to customize \"dumb android os\" that would let you pick initial applications you want to have, and then disable play store reply adriand 21 hours agorootparentIt’s true. My daughter didn’t have a phone until 9th grade, which she just started. She had talked about getting a dumb phone because she wasn’t very into the smartphone thing, which I was supportive of. However she now takes public transit to high school, and really wanted the Transit app so she could easily navigate in the city. So, an iPhone is where we landed. And I have to say, it is astounding how quickly that thing got its hooks into her. I naively thought she might have been immune to it, given her habits and attitude. Boy was I wrong. reply noduerme 13 hours agorootparentIt's a real addiction, no matter how resistant you are. I'm 44. I've never had social media accounts. When I was 18 or so, I had a Palm Pilot with a cellular modem cradle that let you actually go to (mostly text-based) websites. It was the first smart phone, really. Amazing for finding information, for someone who didn't even have dial-up internet until 5 years earlier. But eventually I put the Palm Pilot away. It wasn't really addicting (and it was insanely nerdy to walk around with a computer connected to the internet, in your pocket like that). I militantly avoided owning anything beyond a flip phone again until I was 36 (2016), when I finally caved in and grudgingly bought a cheap Android phone to work on a mobile game. (For the first 6 months of development, I'd just written and tested it under emulation, but bug reports were getting too hard to reproduce). Six months after that, I found myself doom-scrolling on the damn thing every time I had a free moment. What I noticed during my smartphone-free years of watching people play with theirs were a few things: They weren't considered nerdy. They weren't considered computers. The social awkwardness of looking at a device in public had changed into a shield for people against the social awkwardness of looking at their surroundings or acknowledging other people. People forgot how to interact and how to sit and wait without doing something with their phone. Doing something with the phone was more than passively sipping a drink or smoking a cigarette; it was a way to show other people that they didn't want to interact. Or a way to hide from interaction. I think this has to do with the way apps are structured. The vast majority of people never needed a computer in their pocket. Computers were for information and for work. I think of smartphones and the current app ecosystem as more like a swiss-army-knife of spyware and ad tech shoved into a package with as many sensors as possible, to monitor the population. And so, it had better be addictive. Because the underlying act of looking at one and spending so much time with one is, and always has been, antisocial and therefore somewhat repulsive. It took a great amount of marketing to normalize it, and people still rebel against it. reply sourcepluck 7 hours agorootparent> I think of smartphones and the current app ecosystem as more like a swiss-army-knife of spyware and ad tech shoved into a package with as many sensors as possible, to monitor the population.

Excellently put.

The parent has to take the time to sit down and set it up. The iPhone has a lot of parental setting customization. You can disable certain built in apps, prevent installing anything from the App Store or just prevent making purchases, set screen time restrictions, and a whole bunch of other things [1].

[1] https://families.google/familylink/ reply JaggedNZ 17 hours agorootparentApple is really dropping the ball here, there are serious issues with parental controls on iOS. No way to revoke install permission. e.g. child got ahold of a parent's unlocked phone, turned off parent approval for their own phone, and then installed a social media app. We have uninstalled the app, but he can re-install without requesting permissions. We have resorted to a 1-minute (the minimum) screen time limit instead. (Only work around would be to create a whole new iCloud account for the child!) You used to be able to delete the purchase from purchase history, but now you can only hide it, hiding it should just retrigger the approval process? There are well known / well documented ways to circumvent screen time limits. You can't add additional pass code / authentication for the settings app or the parental controls No way to prevent deletion of messages and call logs (and 3rd party tools just do a remote sync on Wi-Fi, after the kids already likely deleted them) Parental controls are often janky or laggy and sometimes just don't work at all. And often require multiple re-authentication (iOS 18 / Face ID does improve this to be fair) reply valval 12 hours agorootparentYour comment reads a bit silly to me. It’s like your child has control over this situation instead of you, and you’re trying your hardest to negotiate a good position for yourself.

I've also done an android phone with an MDM in kiosk mode. None of those let you limit who is contacted though, so it ends up being more like a classic dumb phone in that you can't browse the web, but can dial whomever you want. Just make sure that you disable the Google SMS app and use a stripped down one (I used simple-sms). reply JeremyNT 18 hours agoparentprevI can buy my kid a very cheap android phone and lock it down to only run a couple of select apps. The advantage of this is that it is as smart or dumb as I allow it to be. Now that she is a little older (8th grade) I've slowly increased the allowed apps and screen time. She is able to do really useful things with it. So in short: you can make a smart phone dumb, but you can't make a dumb phone smart. reply burnt-resistor 19 hours agoparentprevI think the problem is it's not a defensible business because there's little barrier to entry to create an Android watch with less features. Every carrier has their own dumb, minimal smart watches, but I'm sure most of them suck because the product management is probably outsourced. Essential features and nonfunctional requirements: - Calendar, time and date, alarms and reminders - IP67 - Ruby or gorilla glass screen (scratches OK) - Locked-down phone, texting, messaging, and location sharing - Ability to call 911 - Minimal apps - Minimal animation - Band that's somewhat difficult to undo and hypoallergenic material... silicone seems pretty neutral - Not disassemblable without tools because the kids I know would have them in pieces in minutes. - Neither a fashion statement nor a kid group social faux pas If any existing models fulfill these close enough, then great. If not, then it might be worth entertaining but would need a go-to-market strategy to compete with every other smartwatch mfgr on the market with unlimited funding. reply m463 12 hours agorootparentlol, I know someone who got his kid a \"dumb\" flip phone figuring that would solve things.

Their 8-year-old is home alone for about an hour after school, and they don't have a landline. We plugged in an old phone to a wall outlet, and just keep it locked with a pin. It allows for emergency calls. There is almost always someone home, so we don't feel the need to allow our kids to call us. Another set of friends trusts their 11-year-old with full access. reply xrd 8 hours agoparentprevYes. The Timex smart watch is perfect for this. You can find them on eBay for $20. You can get a SIM that works with T-Mobile usually. The only issue is that sometimes they are locked and getting them unlocked is some work. But I love these watches. I'm using the watch for older people. There is a sport watch, which I think has an esim. I have one of these but haven't been able to use it yet. Feel free to ask me more over email if you want. It's on my profile page. I definitely went down the rabbit hole on finding this watch and it was a doozy. reply maxbond 21 hours agoparentprevI would submit map functionality to the list as well. I think it would be healthy for a kid old enough to tell time to experiment with navigating, maybe following along on their map on drives. reply amluto 15 hours agorootparentThis problem was quite well solved by a kids learning their way around using their eyes and good paper map. (I miss paper maps. They were actually designed to confer understanding — in particular, every street showed a name! Smartphone navigation apps and navigation websites often don’t show names any more.) reply maxbond 13 hours agorootparentI agree that spending time with a really good map is like reading a book and confers more understanding than a map app. Map apps are pretty crumby, presumably because they're crammed into a screen. Paper maps are still a thing, I was at a book store the other day with a really big paper map section. In particular I enjoy geologic maps; they add depth and history to the landscape around you. Map apps are much faster for navigation though. At least on the scale of walking a few blocks. reply asveikau 20 hours agoparentprevMy daughter has a normal android phone with Google Family Link and tons of builtin apps removed and websites blocked. The parental controls are pretty good. reply silisili 19 hours agorootparentGotta agree here. The only apps that aren't blocked are the phone itself, messages, and a few games. Doesn't even have a browser on it much less social media. It's really been fantastic in letting her have a phone for communication, and technically she can text her friends if they want to, but no social media. It's pretty close to a dumb phone really. The location tracking alone is worth it, to me. My only annoyance came when she turned 13, and Google decided to offer her complete freedom without parental consent. Left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth about the project, which is a shame. reply asveikau 13 hours agorootparentThanks for the warning, I guess I'll need to watch out for that in a few years. reply silisili 12 hours agorootparentIt was scummy, because naturally it will always cause tension. I feel the right way would have been to approach us. Instead they approach the child who will always click freedom. They also sent us parents an email letting us know she's free to do as she wishes and we're SOL. We told her she could stay under Family Link, or else buy her own phone and service. That seems effective. Sorry Google, I'll decide my childrens' internet access. Not your giant advertising machine. reply w10-1 12 hours agoparentprevThe iPhone has restricted access mode, to limit access to bad stuff, typically used for child gateways. It also has assistive access mode, which only permits access to good stuff, mostly to simplify UI's for the elderly, et al. Both put the burden of integration on the configuring user, who basically becomes the system UI designer with a limited and awkward palette. A nice feature in either case would be a way to edit, package and share or sell such configurations. Indeed, I could see Apple building out this capability as a product line architecture supporting enterprise, health, and childhood/education. reply cjpearson 10 hours agoparentprevI'm not a parent, but I see why someone might want to always know exactly where there child is and invest in anything which might improve their safety.

On the downside they kept begging for a phone so they could text their friends, which was reasonable, and texting on the Watch is a terrible experience. So we finally did give in to a phone but with locked down parental controls, so they can't install apps, etc. (though I'm finding those iOS parental controls don't work as well I had hoped; there's a huge issue with them being reset suddenly -- lots of forums of people complaining about this). reply vundercind 21 hours agorootparentIf it’s like an iPhone (or Mac!) you can disable all the apps you don’t want them to use.

But no. reply dgacmu 21 hours agoparentprevWe've used both gabb and an apple watch and they both work decently well. The apple watch has a few too many features by default but it's not as engrossing as a smartphone. The gabb watch was great overall. We switched from gabb -> apple at the end of 6th grade because we felt like our daughter had reached a point of being able to ignore the distractions of the watch in most settings and for the most part that's worked out well. We upgraded specifically to allow texting/IM'ing friends, which may or may not be within what some people want happening. I will note that having her be able to call us is fantastic. There's a lot of end-of-school \"hey you need to walk home today / walk over to my office / oh wait i'll pick you up\" kind of coordination, which we could probably avoid with careful advance planning but it's really nice to be able to be flexible. And also, youtube shorts / tiktok are the most addictive thing I've seen put in front of a child that age.

How can anyone trust this website has any basis in reality when they wrote a whole page explaining why and none of it was applicable? Of course parents should regulate how much time their kids spend on electronics (similar to how parents of previous generations would prevent kids from watching TV 5 hours a day) - but this website presents no evidence that giving a kid a smartphone in 8th grade rather than 5th grade would make a meaningful difference. reply medion 11 hours agoparentSigh. Sometimes you don’t need 10 peer reviewed articles to just know when something is bad. Were you the guy in the 60s saying smoking was totally fine because studies?

As far as we can tell, the association between smartphone use and poor mental health is strongly concentrated in a minority of people with very high usage.

I don't need a website to provide some type of evidence (not sure what kind of evidence you'd be referring to) to understand that. It's parenting 101.

My daughter has autism, and struggles to connect with her classmates. She gets overwhelmed in groups, and is shy talking in person sometimes. Now that her classmates started messaging each other, she is actually being included a lot more. She has started messaging and setting up online play dates with her classmates.

Speaking from experience, most kids get too sucked into the social aspect of phone use, to a detrimental degree. Group chats end up being the location of cyber bullying, for example. reply wkat4242 10 hours agorootparentThere were no smartphones when I was young and I got bullied a lot. Kids bully wherever they interact. It's not the tech that's the problem. reply michaelt 8 hours agorootparentRight but the tech creates some new forms of bullying, and they're in addition to the traditional forms of bullying. All of which still presumably exist. For example, you can now bully people anonymously. And you can bully people at any hour of the day or night - not just in public, in the brief periods between classes. And with widespread camera phones you can not only make someone cry, you can video them crying, keep it forever, and send it to lots of people. And don't forget that very fragile $300-1000 bit of electronics the kid is carrying, would be a real shame if something happened to it. reply adastra22 2 hours agorootparentThe fact that you can never escape the bullying is a huge differentiator from the before times, where coming home after school was a sanctuary (assuming you didn't come from an abusive household).

I've said this elsewhere in this thread, but it bears repeating: that's the whole point of this program. Parents are playing the prisoners' dilemma here. Many (most) feel like cell phones (social media in particular) are a net negative for younger kids. But they don't want their kids to be left out / socially isolated. So it's really easy to get into a situation where we all defect because \"I don't really like this but everyone else is doing it\". This \"wait until 8th\" thing provides a framework for parent to agree to cooperate on this issue. TBD if it actually works. I certainly like the idea that we have some control over our culture/community and don't just need to passively accept a \"tragedy of the commons\" on an issue like this. reply bigstrat2003 21 hours agorootparentprevAssuming that's true*, it honestly isn't good reason to give your kids a smartphone. Your job description as a parent is pretty much to stop your kids from doing things they don't understand will hurt them. There's (imo) plenty of evidence that smartphones are hurting kids, and therefore it's a parent's job to crack down on it even if it costs them in their social life. Like, if all the other kids were shooting up heroin it would be considered insane to say \"you have to let them do it because all their friends are junkies\", and I don't see it as being different for phones. *It's also not clear that your premise is even true.

From personal experience, being isolated as a kid can also be profoundly psychologically damaging and stunt development of normal life skills. Sure, see if the kid can get by without a smartphone for as long as possible, but if they do wind up completely excluded it's time to reevaluate the cost-benefit analysis and potential ways to mitigate smartphone overuse, not just think that the isolation is \"okay\" cause you're protecting them from phones. reply ahnick 20 hours agorootparentprevPlease provide links to the \"plenty of evidence that smartphones are hurting kids\". reply brewdad 20 hours agorootparentGoogle exists reply ahnick 20 hours agorootparentThere's a lot of people making claims based on paid research with agendas to sell fear.

Certainly kids can have a social life without a phone. It’s not required. I just had a kid who didn’t get instagram until 14. They claimed that their life was ruined, but they had a healthy social life without it (and without a phone). I think people generalize what will happen without things they think are common incorrectly. Just because phones are used for many things, it doesn’t mean those things are impossible without phones.

If you don't give them a smartphone, and all their peers use their phones to communicate, as well as talk about TikTok videos, your kid will be excluded from all that.

If a study came out that showed evidence that having a smartphone at an early age actually improved educational outcomes, do you think these people would reverse their position? I would guess not because above all else, this is a value judgement (\"These devices are quickly changing childhood for children. Playing outdoors, spending time with friends, reading books and hanging out with family is happening a lot less to make room for hours of snap chatting, instagramming, and catching up on YouTube.\").

I have had almost unrestricted access to a computer since the age of 9, and to a smartphone since the age of 12, and I can definitely say that I wouldn't be the person I am right now without that access. It's sad to see people lament the demise of the \"hacker spirit\" on one hand, while denying their kids access to the devices necessary for that spirit to thrive on the other. I've known several kids in my age group whose access to technology was severely restricted, and I strongly believe that all of them were significantly worse off and have had serious mental health consequences because of that. Not to mention that the restrictions didn't actually accomplish much in most cases, and, if anything, caused a form of Streisand effect when it came to e.g. explicit content or talking to (older) strangers online. Unrestricted (and even more importantly, unmonitored) access to tech provides an \"escape hatch\" against abusive families. Yes, it may have somewhat of a bad effect on some kids, but for the kids that do need it, it's life changing to an extend that's hard to overstate. English-speaking countries have always seemed more uptight about this though.

Some do better with a computer or phone as an intermediary. This has been true since the BBS scene in the 1980s through smartphones today. I have had two teens with very different relationships with their phones, one is a socialite, the other just uses it to read manga and text close friends. Both have used their phones since grade 6, and had access to phones and iPads and PCs since age 3. They’re comfortable with technology and understand the risks of talking to people online because that was my job as a parent: to teach them from a young age to see these devices as an extension of themselves, that they will eventually be the ones in charge of their privacy and how they wish to be treated. reply dartharva 10 hours agoparentPublic policy is based on aggregate behavior patterns of the overall population.

I read your comment as an older Millenial and thought \"what?! a smartphone in 8th grade?!\" Despite being in the same \"generation,\" someone born in the mid-80s came of age with radically different consumer technology compared to someone born just ten years later in the mid-90s. I have clear memories of trying to understand what the \"Information Superhighway\" was, and then getting dial-up Internet in our home for the first time. At the end of 8th grade, I convinced my dad to upgrade from 33 kbps dial-up to cable. As a sophomore in college, I remember thinking that some company would make a lot of money by putting Wi-Fi access points everywhere so we could have always-on Internet access with some sort of mobile device... Just a night-and-day difference from the experience of someone getting a smartphone in 8th grade. reply spondylosaurus 20 hours agorootparentHa, maybe the labels were more useful when day-to-day technology wasn't progressing as quickly as it is now! Your internet story is also funny to me because my dad worked at an ISP when I was a toddler. One of my earliest computer memories is when he taught me how to go into the Windows 98 graphics menu and toggle the color settings from 16-bit to 32-bit (or vice versa, can't remember now) before booting up a particular CD-ROM game, because otherwise the graphics would be put of whack.

I've seen the definition of Millenials span all the way up to 2000 births, and I'm pretty sure the games \"just worked\" for a kid born in 2000. To be fair, I've wondered if people in previous generations feel the same way.

Going to watch a movie is very, very expensive - without snacks, you pay around 10 EUR, while the recommended amount of pocket money is around 30 EUR per month. There are less and less public swimming pools, playgrounds usually don’t appeal to teens and are frequently neglected (on top of that, teens who meet at a playground are often chased away since they tend to leave litter behind, and the playgrounds are for younger kids).

This is helicopter parenting. Specifically, the way that the pledge requires that kids share all passwords and only install approved apps. Kids need a degree of independence that they've lost in how structured modern day youth has become. An important part of growing up is being exposed to people who have different ideas and beliefs than parents and extended family, and making decisions and having real consequences. I think it's more important to talk to children about what they encounter in their day-to-day lives, and find out about their struggles. It's important to remind children that they can turn off their smartphone, or delete an account on a social media site, if it doesn't bring them joy. As parents, it's our duty to tell children that they have the choice, but not make that choice for them. reply BirAdam 7 hours agoprevMy son is in high school. He has a smartphone.

It is great that you had this informing chat as a parent with your child, and that he was able to understand and draw his conclusions. That said, I think for many kids that social pressure or network effect is quite a motivator to get social media accounts. Say all their friends have one and they have a group, where they usually organize. Or say they are interested in someone and wants their contact info, but they only give them their social media details. For many people traditional ways of communication are somehow not their way any longer. I am talking about e-mail, phone calls, SMS, letters, and whatever else.

While I believe small children shouldn't carry smartphones, it's currently our only way to monitor their health when they're outside our immediate range, such as in daycare. My child is quite small and not yet interested in the phone, but I expect that will change eventually.

However, maintaining that restriction may become challenging as she grows. reply tonymet 12 hours agoparentis it for uploading glucose diagnostic results? reply massive 12 hours agorootparentYes, that's correct. It uploads data from the continuous glucose sensor to the medical device provider, allowing us parents to access that data on our smartphones. But it's not just about collecting statistics. For instance, delivering alerts to us, such as low glucose levels or pump malfunction, requires the phone to be present. Additionally, it allows for remote monitoring of glucose levels. For example, during winter, when the child is bundled up in overalls, daycare staff can check the values without needing to undress her in freezing temperatures. Recently, many insulin pumps, although not ours, have also evolved so that the algorithm controlling the pump operates via a smartphone.

But I guess kids should learn chinese or what is the current fad now or torment the kid with 50 extraculliculars. reply bigger_cheese 19 hours agoparent> Reality is that the kid will be a loser / outsider due to no phone I grew up in the 90's and my parents were strict, particularly compared to a lot of my peers. Things like watching television was heavily restricted. I remember making similar arguments to my parent's deaf ears \"I won't fit in, all the kids at school will be talking about what they watched on TV last night, I'll be a loser\" etc. My experience was that most of the kids didn't care that I couldn't understand their Simpson's references or whatever. If anything they were sympathetic, I would get a lot of \"man your parents really suck\" and then kids would shrug and move on. I did resent my parents growing up. Looking back I think they were pretty clear examples of \"tiger parent\" stereotype. I felt immense pressure and stress to achieve good grades and it honestly felt like nothing I did was enough to make my parents happy. I get along with my parents now as an adult but as a teen my home life felt very unhappy at times. I can remember the relief I felt when I left home to live on my own. So I think it is more likely your child will resent you, then them being ostracized by their peers. reply bigstrat2003 21 hours agoparentprev> Reality is that the kid will be a loser / outsider due to no phone. That is supposition, not reality, and there are parents here who have shared their experience with kids having a healthy social life without a phone.

    "originBody": "Physical Intelligence (π) π0: Our First Generalist Policy Published October 31, 2024 Email research@physicalintelligence.companyKevin Black, Noah Brown, Danny Driess, Michael Equi, Adnan Esmail, Chelsea Finn, Nick Fusai, Lachy Groom, Karol Hausman, Brian Ichter, Szymon Jakubczak, Tim Jones, Kay Ke, Sergey Levine, Adrian Li-Bell, Mohith Mothukuri, Suraj Nair, Karl Pertsch, Lucy Shi, James Tanner, Quan Vuong, Anna Walling, Haohuan Wang, Ury Zhilinsky Paper π0.pdf We are living through an AI revolution: the past decade witnessed practically useful AI assistants, AI systems that can generate photorealistic images and videos, and even models that can predict the structure of proteins. But in spite of all these advances, human intelligence dramatically outpaces AI when it comes to the physical world. To paraphrase Moravec’s paradox, winning a game of chess or discovering a new drug represent “easy” problems for AI to solve, but folding a shirt or cleaning up a table requires solving some of the most difficult engineering problems ever conceived. To build AI systems that have the kind of physically situated versatility that people possess, we need a new approach — we need to make AI systems embodied so that they can acquire physical intelligence. Over the past eight months, we’ve developed a general-purpose robot foundation model that we call π0 (pi-zero). We believe this is a first step toward our long-term goal of developing artificial physical intelligence, so that users can simply ask robots to perform any task they want, just like they can ask large language models (LLMs) and chatbot assistants. Like LLMs, our model is trained on broad and diverse data and can follow various text instructions. Unlike LLMs, it spans images, text, and actions and acquires physical intelligence by training on embodied experience from robots, learning to directly output low-level motor commands via a novel architecture. It can control a variety of different robots, and can either be prompted to carry out the desired task, or fine-tuned to specialize it to challenging application scenarios. An extended article on our work can be found here. The promise of generalist robot policies Today’s robots are narrow specialists. Industrial robots are programmed for repetitive motions in choreographed settings, repeatedly making the same weld in the same spot on an assembly line or dropping the same item into the same box. Even such simple behaviors require extensive manual engineering, and more complex behaviors in messy real-world environments such as homes are simply infeasible. AI could change that, allowing robots to learn and follow user instructions, so that programming a new behavior is as simple as telling the robot what you want done, and the robot can itself figure out how to adapt its behavior to its environment. But this requires data. Language models and other foundation models mine data from the web, utilizing a significant fraction of all available documents. There is no such treasure trove of robot data, so to enable a robot to learn a new skill, large amounts of data need to be collected with that particular robot and for that particular application. If we could train a single generalist robot policy that can perform a wide range of different skills and control a wide range of different robots, we would overcome this challenge: such a model would need only a little bit of data from each robot and each application. Just as a person can learn a new skill quickly by drawing on a lifetime’s worth of experience, such a generalist robot policy could be specialized to new tasks with only modest amounts of data. This would not be the first time that a generalist model beat a specialist at the specialist’s own task: language models have superseded more specialized language processing systems precisely because they can better solve those downstream specialist tasks by drawing on their diverse and general purpose pretraining. In the same way that LLMs provide a foundation model for language, these generalist robot policies will provide a robot foundation model for physical intelligence. To get there, we will need to solve major technical challenges. Our first step is π0, a prototype model that combines large-scale multi-task and multi-robot data collection with a new network architecture to enable the most capable and dexterous generalist robot policy to date. While we believe this is only a small early step toward developing truly general-purpose robot models, we think it represents an exciting step that provides a glimpse of what is to come. A cross-embodiment training mixture π0 uses Internet-scale vision-language pre-pretraining, open-source robot manipulation datasets, and our own datasets consisting of dexterous tasks from 8 distinct robots. The model can then perform a wide variety of tasks, via either zero-shot prompting or fine-tuning. Our first prototype generalist robot policy is trained on the largest robot interaction dataset to date. The full training mixture includes both open-source data and a large and diverse dataset of dexterous tasks that we collected across 8 distinct robots. Our dataset contains diverse tasks, with each task exhibiting a wide variety of motion primitives, many different objects, and various scenes. The tasks in this dataset exercise different dimensions of robot dexterity while covering the range of real tasks that these robots might be asked to perform, from bussing dishes to packing items into envelopes, folding clothing, routing cables, assembling boxes, plugging in power plugs, packing food into to-go boxes, and picking up and throwing out trash. Our goal in selecting these tasks is not to solve any particular application, but to start to provide our model with a general understanding of physical interactions — an initial foundation for physical intelligence. Inheriting Internet-scale semantic understanding Beyond training on many different robots, π0 inherits semantic knowledge and visual understanding from Internet-scale pretraining by starting from a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM). VLMs are trained to model text and images on the web — widely used VLMs include GPT-4V and Gemini. We use a smaller 3 billion parameter VLM as a starting point, and adapt it for real-time dexterous robot control. VLMs effectively transfer semantic knowledge from the web, but they are trained to output only discrete language tokens. Dexterous robot manipulation requires π0 to output motor commands at a high frequency, up to 50 times per second. To provide this level of dexterity, we developed a novel method to augment pre-trained VLMs with continuous action outputs via flow matching, a variant of diffusion models. Starting from diverse robot data and a VLM pre-trained on Internet-scale data, we train our vision-language-action flow matching model, which we can then post-train on high-quality robot data to solve a range of downstream tasks. Our vision-language-action model uses a novel flow matching formulation, which augments a vision-language model pre-trained on Internet-scale data with continuous outputs. This enables high-frequency dexterous control, making it particularly well-suited for fine-tuning for complex robot manipulation tasks, such as folding laundry or assembling boxes. Post-training for dexterous manipulation More complex and dexterous tasks may require the model to be fine-tuned to specialize it to downstream challenges. Fine-tuning the model with high-quality data for a challenging task, such as folding laundry, is analogous to the post-training process employed by LLM designers. Pre-training teaches the model about the physical world, while fine-tuning forces it to perform a particular task well. Let’s take a look at some of these tasks. After post-training, the robot can unload the dryer, bring the clothes over to the table, and fold the clothes into a stack. The video is uncut, from a single policy operating fully autonomously. Laundry. We fine-tuned π0 to fold laundry, using either a mobile robot or a fixed pair of arms. The goal is to get the clothing into a neat stack. This task is exceptionally difficult for robots (...and some humans): while a single t-shirt laid flat on the table can sometimes be folded just by repeating a pre-scripted set of motions, a pile of tangled laundry can be crumpled in many different ways, so it is not enough to simply move the arms through the same motion. To our knowledge, no prior robot system has been demonstrated to perform this task at this level of complexity. Notably, by training on diverse data, we find that the robot is able to recover when someone tries to intervene in a variety of different ways. Table bussing. We also fine-tuned the model to bus a table. This requires the robot to pick up dishes and trash on the table, putting any dishes, cutlery, or cups into a bussing bin, and putting trash into the trash bin. This task requires the robot to handle a dizzying variety of items. One of the exciting consequences of training π0 on large and diverse datasets was the range of emergent strategies that the robot employed: instead of simply grasping each item in turn, the model could stack multiple dishes to put them into the bin together, or shake off trash from a plate into the garbage before placing the plate into the bussing bin. Assembling a box. Here, the robot has to take a flattened cardboard box and build it, folding the sides and then tucking in the flaps. This is very difficult, because each fold and tuck might fail in unexpected ways, so the robot needs to watch its progress and adjust as it goes. It also needs to brace the box with both arms, even using the table, so that the partially folded box doesn’t come apart. Evaluating and comparing π0 to prior models We compared π0 to other robot foundation models that have been proposed in the academic literature on our tasks: OpenVLA, a 7B parameter VLA model that uses discretized actions, and Octo, a 93M parameter model that uses diffusion outputs. These tasks are very difficult compared to those that are typically used in academic experiments — for example, the tasks in the OpenVLA evaluation typically consist of single stage behaviors (e.g., “put eggplant into pot”), whereas our simplest bussing task consisting of sorting multiple objects into either a garbage bin or a bussing bin, and our more complex tasks might require multiple stages, manipulation of deformable objects, and the ability to deploy one of many possible strategies given the current configuration of the environment. These tasks are evaluated according to a scoring rubric that assigns a score of 1.0 for a fully successful completion, with “partial credit” for partially correct execution (e.g., bussing half the objects leads to a score of 0.5). The average scores across 5 zero-shot evaluation tasks are shown below, comparing the full π0 pre-trained model, π0-small, which is a 470M parameter model that does not use VLM pre-training, OpenVLA, and Octo. Although OpenVLA and Octo can attain non-zero performance on the easiest of these tasks (“Bussing Easy”), π0 is by far the best-performing model across all of the tasks. The small version, π0-small, attains the second best performance, but there is more than a 2x improvement in performance from using our full-size architecture with VLM pre-training. Average scores for π0, π0-small, OpenVLA, and Octo for zero-shot evaluation on 5 test tasks. Across all of the tasks, π0 consistently attains good performance, and outperforms both the small variant and the prior models. We include detailed videos from our rigorous empirical evaluation below, with examples of successful and failed episodes for both our zero-shot experiments and the fine-tuning evaluation. Complete results from all experiments can be found in the full article. Task Eggs in carton Grocery Bagging Toast out of toaster Towel fold Stack bowls Tupperware in microwave Items in drawer Laundry fold (shirts) Laundry fold (shorts) Paper towel in holder Food in to go box Status Success Fail Where do we go from here? Our mission at Physical Intelligence is to develop foundation models that can control any robot to perform any task. Our experiments so far show that such models can control a variety of robots and perform tasks that no prior robot learning system has done successfully, such as folding laundry from a hamper or assembling a cardboard box. But generalist robot policies are still in their infancy, and we have a long way to go. The frontiers of robot foundation model research include long-horizon reasoning and planning, autonomous self-improvement, robustness, and safety. We expect that the coming year will see major advances along all of these directions, but the initial results paint a promising picture for the future of robot foundation models: highly capable generalist policies that inherit semantic understanding from Internet-scale pretraining, incorporate data from many different tasks and robot platforms, and enable unprecedented dexterity and physical capability. We also think that succeeding at this will require not only new technologies and more data, but a collective effort involving the entire robotics community. We already have collaborations underway with a number of companies and robotics labs, both to refine hardware designs for teleoperation and autonomy, and incorporate data from our partners into our pre-trained models so that we can provide access to models adapted to their specific platforms. If you are interested in collaborating, please reach out. We are particularly excited to work with companies scaling up data collection with robots deployed for real-world applications, who are looking to collaborate on autonomy. We are also hiring!

I’m mostly joking, but my point is that physical AI probably implies a complete rethink of every individual routine from first principles: why fold the shirt at all? Why not just-in-time-ironing? We’re focusing on the hard problems because we’re imitating how a human with limited resources would approach the issue. If you asked a robot to provide you with a fresh and clean shirt every morning - would a home washing machine come into the equation? My best answer is “maybe”, which implies some huge portion of our normal routines will disappear instead of being automated. If restaurants require no staff, why even have a home kitchen?

Specifically, it is good for auto executives and their shareholders (in their capacity as executives and shareholders, though presumably many of them are drivers as well). It's a cost measure that makes customers' lives worse (and more dangerous) for the entire life of the car in exchange for pennies in their pocket now. This isn't technology getting its way or anything, but people using their power to further their own interests with indifference to the interests of others. That's not new, just the details are. reply modeless 1 hour agoparentprevWashing and folding clothes won't become obsolete. But washing machines might. The robot can \"hand\" wash your clothes while you sleep. You can reclaim the space that your washing machine took up. Same with the dishwasher. No need to save labor means no need for labor saving devices! reply harimau777 5 hours agoparentprevIt likely depends on the quality of the clothing. If we are talking about a fairly standardized and utilitarian outfit like a t-shirt and straight leg jeans then that would make automated sewing easier. On the other hand, if someone wants to wear clothing that flatters their body type and sense of style, then the robot is going to need to be able to make different patterns. Things like different types of yokes, pleats, princess seams, collar types, etc. The next step is clothing that is tailored for an individual. In this case the robot would need to be able to add darts and other modifications in order to adjust the fit. Note that this and the previous step may need to take into account the behavior of the fabric; e.g. how does it stretch. Finally, in the realm of high end tailoring you have features that are used precisely because they must be done by hand. That being said, there is precedent for what you are suggesting: traditionally kimonos are unsewn when they are washed and then reassembled. reply maxerickson 6 hours agoparentprevIf robots are doing everything, people will have bigger kitchens... reply insane_dreamer 4 hours agorootparentSo long as the robots didn't eliminate their job (and make it very difficult to get another job), in which case they'll have a smaller kitchen (or no kitchen). reply TylerE 11 hours agoparentprevThat could just as easily be turned on it's head too - if you don't need skilled (or any) staff to shop, cook, serve, and then washup, why would you ever NOT eat at home?

The inability to recognise this means your community is already broken. reply netruk44 38 minutes agorootparentI suppose our restaurant-going experiences must significantly differ. If I'm going to a restaurant with friends for social interaction, it typically doesn't involve the other people in the restaurant who just happen to be there at the same time as me. If I wanted that, I would go to a bar instead, which is a separate conversation from the one we were having. However, I don't think I would be so bold as to call either of our lifestyles 'broken'.

That said, the logic doesn't fully hold up.

Taking a long tour along the neighborhood, to see what I want to buy first hand before pulling the trigger, or seeing an old friend and getting a nice coffee at that café are all valid reasons to go out. Getting fresh air, regularly walking, seeing a couple of different and unknown faces are regular maintenance tasks for the body and brain. I don't think humans should hole up at their homes and work/doom scroll/eat/doom scroll/sleep/repeat just because they can. That's unhealthy for every aspect of your body and life to begin with. reply usrusr 4 hours agorootparentThat's why I called it a dystopia. After a year of working fully remote I now have the option of walking to an office and I haven't skipped on that a single day.

As I mentioned, I have medical issues that are currently rather sucky and limiting, and being chronic, largely irreversible conditions, well, they aren't gonna get better.

It is simply too stupid(despite being a smart model with camera and room mapping LiDAR) and get stuck at carpet edges and under chairs. If I want to use it on schedule I need to perpetually have all areas I want it to clean adapted to robotic vacuuming. Which I don't, meaning I have to manually go over the entire area and pick up objects, move chairs, move the small carpets and then empty the all too small storage bin on the robotic vacuum after it have done its rounds. And don't even get me started on the mopping function. The end result being that if I take a regular vacuum in my hand and do the pre-robot screening round, I've managed to already vacuum the entire flat with a much more powerful machine in less time than the robot vacuum process would've required. reply imp0cat 3 hours agorootparentYeah, I demand more info about the mop from the OP.

More hands allows say pipelining the tasks execution, like staged clothes holding or shooting an RPG while one of the hands already ready to put another warhead into the barrel (generally 2 persons job for RPG or mortar) - again our imagination is severely limited by 2 hands and even in such case we've evolved minimal specialization, ie. right/left-handedness. >If restaurants require no staff, why even have a home kitchen?

Many more people, and many more jobs, and most of the world still lives in relative poverty and various forms of insecurity and unmet material and labor needs.

In my opinion, if we don't aim at doing anything about it, the gap between the rich and the poor will widen. Both between societies, and within one society. I'm now in Canada, but in my childhood country, most of the recent \"smart\" (meaning connected) devices and the recent AI models are not available. This is starts a viscious cycle that makes things worse and worse. For the less connected high teck devices, the ratio of the price (That's set based on supply/demand in the richest countries) to income (that's damanged by sanctions and general government stupidity) is getting so high that it's really hard to get high-end devices. As the labour required to produce goods and services is automated, one possible scenario is that fewer and fewer people will stay \"relevant\", while the rest will sink and become invisible. Things can be avoided, but looking at countries that have been unable/unwilling to ensure housing (as one of the 3 most fundamental material needs of the human: food, housing, clothing) stays affordable, does not raise hope. In my opinion, the housing problem is extremely easy to solve when looking at the problem as a technical one, and impossible when you include the way economic incentives are working at it. I hope I'm wrong, but when I project the current path into future, it's not bright. reply seventhtiger 18 hours agorootparentIs our goal to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, or to improve the lives of the poor? Because the gap itself is actually irrelevant to poor people's lives. Rich people's improvement outpacing poor people's is not necessarily an issue. Second, a financial gap does not necessarily translate to a material gap. Someone with 1,000,000x someone else's net worth still buys the same iPhone and drinks the same coca cola. Many important wellbeing factors are not actually blocked by finance, like healthcare and education. Even if you take all the rich people's money and repurpose to education not much will change. Maybe an iPad for every kid, but what good does that do? Housing is actually a great example. Real estate has a way of sucking up entire GDPs worth of money. As a country you can't pay your way out of housing problems. Look at something like China which has been consistently overbuilding housing for decades now. They still have housing issues. reply harimau777 5 hours agorootparentTwo great of a gap between rich and poor produces a number of problems: It produces a two tier society where different rules apply to the rich and the poor. It insulates the rich from the negative impact their actions have on the poor. It results in the rich having a much greater say in democracy than the poor. It produces problems when the rich and the poor are competing for resources (e.g. housing). It can encourages the market to focus on the desires of the rich at the expense of the desires of the poor. It damages social cohesion due to the rich and poor having increasingly different life experiences and worldviews. reply kelseyfrog 3 hours agorootparentHumans have an innate sense of fairness that isn't satisfied by \"everyone played by the same rules, so wildly different outcomes are ok.\" Eventually resentment builds up and an extra-legal solution transpires. reply insane_dreamer 4 hours agorootparentprev> Is our goal to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, or to improve the lives of the poor? Because the gap itself is actually irrelevant to poor people's lives. The resources to improve the lives of the poor (and not just the very poor but the struggling middle classes), have to come from somewhere. They are not infinite. So unless you're creating a bunch of wealth from nothing, then it naturally requires a more equal distribution of existing wealth. > China which has been consistently overbuilding housing for decades now. They still have housing issues. This is in fact a problem of unequal distribution of resources: one of the main reasons there are housing issues is because houses have been seen as an investment and gobbled up by those who can afford to do so (all my friends in Beijing own multiple apartments), so prices rise and the poor can't get them anyway. reply seventhtiger 9 minutes agorootparentBut financial wealth is not equal to material wealth. Financial wealth literally is created from nothing, and its mapping to material wealth is arbitrary. The last 4 years are a great example of massive paper gains while everyone was losing. There are real diminishing returns to money. Some issues are surely caused by lack of funding, but that's not most real issues. Most real issues will remain even despite maximal funding. So before you start advocating for taking people's wealth you have to make a convincing argument that it can solve something. reply hakfoo 14 hours agorootparentprev> Rich people's improvement outpacing poor people's is not necessarily an issue. That's like saying \"the fact there's a black hole in the centre of the galaxy is not an issue.\" Extreme wealth distorts the universe around it. There are people who have no business making nation-state level decisions that are still on the speed dial of the people who are, because of their financial positions. There's also a strong case that education blocked by finance, on a second order. Wealth creates flight opportunities. Parents who can afford it take their kids out of the default public school and take them to a magnet, charter, or private school. Not everyone can afford that, even if some are nominally tuition-free-- if they don't offer the same bussing, for example, that's going to add thousands of dollars a year in bus or petrol costs to get the kid to and from campus. But aside from that, when the parents take their kids away, they also take their volunteerism, activity support, and holding staff accountable. The public school ends up supported by the least resourced and least concerned parents, and the students left behind suffer. Housing is probably solvable with a more holistic central-planning mindset. Everyone wants to live in a few desirable areas, but we have no mechanism to generate more desirable areas. A planned economy could help by steering new economic development to places where housing can be built affordably, perhaps with build-out mandates. The Chinese \"Ghost Cities\" are actually a great idea in retrospect-- if you build everything at once before the first residents arrive, you can avoid some of the very expensive retrofit problems. Building a subway on the barren ground of a planned city is a lot cheaper than drilling under Lower Manhattan. A secondary problem is that housing costs and the need for retirement/end of life savings creates a doom loop-- if you're paying 60% of your income on a mortgage, you can't invest in any other way, so it HAS to be the nest egg. I'm not sure how to address that-- richer and more universal pensions might help reduce the load on home equity, and there are certainly ways to de-asset-ify land (maybe replacing outright land ownership with peppercorn leases-- people wouldn't be able to \"buy\" a house, at best they could try to bribe the existing owner to abandon the lease and hope to grab it when the property goes back up for redistribution) reply seventhtiger 4 minutes agorootparentYou outlined how education is blocked by finance at an individual level for a specific family or person. We're talking about the national level. Do you think that with more funding every kid can go to a charter school? The problem is that the amount of elite and high quality education is limited. Unless your plan is to give every kid an iPad, then your plan can't just be increasing funding, it must include how to fix the education system from the bottom up. sokoloff 10 hours agorootparentprev> Parents who can afford it take their kids out of the default public school and take them to a magnet, charter, or private school. I think it’s pointless to try to prevent this. Try to block it and parents who can afford to will just move to where the public schools are good.

However, that doesn't mean that we shouldn't take steps to get closer to equality. For example, wealthy parents sending their kids to private schools isn't as much of an issue when it doesn't take money away from public schools (e.g. via vouchers). reply kelseyfrog 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's fairly easy to prevent. Accreditation is a legitimization mechanism eminently modulatable by law. When only state schools are accredited and truancy is enforced, there is no other option. The funding issue is also trivial, local property taxes should be transferred to the state rather than being used directly. The idea that somehow poor neighborhoods should have poor schools is asinine and re-enforces existing class structure. reply sokoloff 3 hours agorootparentIt’s not a funding issue, or at least not just a funding issue. In many states, the lower performing districts have more per-pupil funding than higher performing schools. Parents and community are a massive influence, and parents will move as needed to attend better school districts, even if private schools are outlawed. reply kelseyfrog 2 hours agorootparentWe can find a reason for any intervention to fail, but empiricism should be our guide, not our ability to conjure failure scenarios. reply nradov 4 hours agorootparentprevIn the US, magnet and charter schools are free and operated by public school districts. When there aren't enough slots, admission is typically handled by lottery so wealthy parents can't pay to get their children in. What they can do is move to a neighborhood with better public schools, and in fact we see a very direct relationship between public school ratings and housing prices in that school's catchment area.

For money to work as universal medium, it needs to circulate - but if everything that the rich consume is made by robots that the rich also own, and it's cheaper than a human's living wage, then all trade would happen in that circle, and money used for that would never leave that part of the economy. So people outside of it simply wouldn't have anything useful to buy goods with. Or, to put it in another way - any wealth transfer from the haves to the have-nots in such an arrangement would be pure welfare. Which, given a socioeconomic system that does not encourage altruism, to put it mildly, would only be done to the extent that is necessary to prevent a torches and pitchforks situation.

Yes, AI can assist, but it doesn't replace human presence as it is now, in any field. Instead it creates demand for improvements across the board and creates more work for us. When we went from horses to cars, we increased the volume of shipments and percentually more people work in transportation now than in 1910. Another example - programming has been automating itself for 60 years. Each new language, framework or library, each project on Github makes future work more efficient. Yet we have seen an increase, not a decrease, in development jobs, and good salaries. I would say humans are the critical ingredient AI needs to be effective, at least for now. And in the far future where AI can work without assistance, then it just empowers everyone to not need to work. We can use AI directly for our own benefit, automating self reliance for people. Unlike UBI, you can copy an AI and give it to everyone for free. In both scenarios: weak AI making room for jobs, or strong AI making work not necessary, it turns out ok.

You could also end up with social revolutions. - another is that we transition to a different type of economy altogether, based not on scarcity of resources (as is presently), but on all citizens having their needs met without having to work for them.

If people didn't need to work I suspect a large portion of the population will feel depressed, without a purpose and will waste their life getting whatever convenient pleasure they can afford on that basic income (doom scrolling, Netflix, video games) reply defrost 11 hours agorootparentWhat's a \"large portion\" and what's the concrete basis for your suspicion? People are aspirational, my observation of people that have sufficient means to just survive is that a large portion will apply themselves to levelling up in a variety of ways, some in crafts, some in small business, some in music, sports, etc. Of those that do, a number go on to join leaders in their chosen fields. Sure, another portion might also kick back and do little else but doom scroll, but that's on them and at least that's keeping them off the streets, adding to the crime stats, etc. reply jack_pp 11 hours agorootparentPeople that have sufficient means in the current system had to have discipline and motivation to get in that position and considering how few people are like this then that's where my theory comes from. I'm in a pretty unique position because I've never had a strong drive to work but got lucky and got that passive income without having it as a goal I worked towards. If I had no financial or social pressure I would do little else than play video games all day. Considering how popular social media is I suspect I'm right about most of the population.

A nice idea from sci-fi is food machines in busy locations in every city. Insert an ID and get biscuits that are nutritious, kinda filling, and while not necessarily \"tasty\", they get the job done.

Yes. But the flipside of that is that it's hard to earn money. The cheaper it is to live, the harder it is to make money.

Once that happens there are only a few options, and the least unpleasant is simply to give them (us) money tokens. reply nightski 14 hours agorootparentHumans don't need to compete with machines in the economic system. Machines aren't out to make a profit. Only humans are. The truth is if this technology really advances to the point we are talking about money won't really be a relevant concept. Money at it's essence imho is a claim on future labor. If that labor is extremely cheap, then all money is nearly worthless. But LLMs/transformers are not this technology. We need some significant advancements before we start seeing things like this. reply soco 9 hours agorootparentMachines aren't out by themselves for anything. The machine owners on the other hand, they are out to make a profit. So human workers compete with machine workers for the profit f the owners, and at least here I'm sure we can agree who wins in the end. Because as popular the comparison with the horses vs cars might be, at some point the machines will be smarter than humans with or without AGI. From that point on, any job a human would be able to do, and I mean any job invented or not, a machine would do cheaper and probably better. Zero options for the jobless humans from that point on, zero money to spend except welfare/UBI. And even that doesn't sound very appealing, because humans will look at the machine owners with jealousy and yeah I expect quite some fuss with many only unpleasant outcomes. reply haccount 5 hours agorootparentprevUBI assumes the entire financial sector doesn't exist. That companies grow like plants without agency. That everyone just accepts UBI as an equal portion and that the future is rosy and fair. The predatory institutions will still be there in the UBI future and price things accordingly, do a little hostile takeover here and there, bribe some politician and get a totally not monopoly started in as many sectors as they can. For UBI to actually work it needs to spring out of the goodwill from a monstrous institution that brutalizes all other financial entities or from a financial apocalypse that leaves virtually no one standing. A much more likely entry point to \"free living conditions\" is free as in advertisment driven data mining and resale.

And Palantir hands out free phones with preloaded internet and bomb homing beacons to streamline military interventions against you when the gov decides you're a terrorist.

How is “going to a book club” going to be “better done by robots”? It is not an activity where there is an objective quality metric. If you enjoyed reading the book, and then enjoyed talking about the book, and had a good time then you did the book club right. Even if we have a robot which reads the book faster, extracts deeper meanings from it, and has a more engaging conversation about it you can still enjoy the act of doing it yourself. Same with sailing. It is not necessarily the most efficient, fastest, or optimal way to get from here to there. It is on the other hand a challenge to your mind and body and that gives you satisfaction as you do it. Even if robots are faster, better equiped, or safer sailors they are not you. Only you yourself can can create the experience of sailing by yourself. I do hobby jewelry. I design my pieces and then cast them, polish them, and gift them to friends. I don’t do it because it is cheaper than buying jewelry (it is very much not). I don’t do it because I’m better at it than others. (Very much not.) I do it because i enjoy the long walks while I’m thinking about a new design. I enjoy the challenge of figuring out how I can make a certain piece. Then i enjoy fidgeting with it until it casts just perfect. Then i enjoy polishing it, patinating it, polishing again, engraving, attaching gems. And finally I enjoy very much putting it in a neat little box and then meeting with a friend and gifting it to them. I also enjoy telling the story of how each piece was made, what things worked and what didn’t. It is a bucket of fun! But here is the thing. Even if robots were obviously better at it than me, i wouldn’t care. Wouldn’t change my enjoyment even a bit. How do i know? Because there are already right today othere who are better at it than I will ever be. Professional foundries make jewelry faster and cheaper I can ever hope to. Amazing and legendary jewellers design designs i could never dream of. Excelent crafters share their stories better than I could. So like why am I doing it?

That is all I can say. reply int_19h 12 hours agorootparentprevWhat people consider deeply satisfying is very much culturally engrained. Our society conditions us to define our own value mostly in terms of how much value we contribute to others, and to treat personal enjoyment as at least somewhat suspect. But this isn't a universal set of values, not even in our own societies historically. If you really want to get philosophical about it, what's the point of you serving someone else or adding value to society? Society, after all, is other people just like you. If you're trying to make them happy, why wouldn't you want to also make yourself happy?

Eastern europe and asia of course. reply forgetfreeman 13 minutes agorootparentI'm not certain what you base your confidence on given trackable economic and social mobility markers don't support it. Its fascinating that apologists default to some combination of postmodern argle-bargle over defining the term \"middle class\" and pointing to modest economic successes in what until recently were unambiguously 3rd world countries when a discussion of the middle class in America comes up. I honestly do not understand the perceived relevance of economic outcomes in ex-soviet countries in this context, unless the goal is to provide some kind of cover for neoliberal economic theory, which also seems nonsensical unless one is some form of pundit or politician. 50 years ago a single income family being able to afford to own their home, at least one car in the driveway, school their children, and comfortably save for retirement was the generally accepted definition of \"middle class\". I honestly can't be bothered to even look up what passes for a more modern definition given regardless of where those goalposts get planted someone's going to argue anything north of abject poverty is \"middle class\". After having sat a few hundred iterations of that debate I think I can feel my soul trying to leave my body at the mere thought of doing another lap. One of the things that freaks me out the most about this kind of cognitive-dissonance-fueled shit flinging contest is I am deeply mystified by the notion that there's even anything controversial here. Rural America is not ok. The average cost of a house and a medical degree in the US are approaching parity. The current rise in populism also didn't spontaneously arise, it's a reaction to economic pressure (among other things).

Maybe. Here's a robot at Berkeley folding towels in 2010.[1] A Willow Garage robot folding jeans in 2012.[2] Foldimate in 2017.[3] Even boring old Chicago Dryer had this working by 2021.[4] They're all really slow. That's because they have no understanding of dynamics. The item has to come to a full stop between operations. Chicago Dryer got past that problem with a sequence of steps at different stations, each station taking about one second. That yields a useful commercial machine for large laundries. It's just a demo problem, though. The approach is interesting. They're trying to use LLM technology on a completely different kind of problem. For that, you need a lot of training data. If you're going to do things in this way, you need data from the inside of doing it. That's hard to acquire, but not impossible. They claim to use \"robotic training data\". Not sure if this is from robots being operated by humans as teleoperators. Others have tried that. There's a Stanford project that looks very similar. Something like this has been used to train quadrotor drone controllers. There's no obvious cheap way to acquire lots of data of this type, though. You have to run your own experimental setup and log. Motion tracking from vision on a squirrel colony would be interesting as a data source. Squirrels are very agile and easy to observe. Then run the skeleton movement data back through a simulator and try to extract the forces the muscles are exerting. Now you have something usable for training an agile robot.

I agree, and I think it will be even longer before people are comfortable with a clothes-folding robot in their home even if the capability is technically there. As much as I would love to never fold a t-shirt again, I’m also not willing to pay likely thousands of dollars to put a bulky set of robotic arms in my laundry room that moreover pose a non-zero risk of injuring somebody, particularly a child. If it’s skilled enough to turn things inside out with a sudden flick, it’s also skilled enough to poke your eyes out with a flick. I feel like if the goal is to simplify people’s lives, the entire process of laundry needs to be re-imagined, from the basket to the return to closet. It should essentially be a black box - I toss my dirty clothes in a hole, and behind the scenes the washer and dryer decide what to wash in what loads and when, fold or hang the dry clothes and return them to storage (drawer or closet). The home layout may need to be reimagined to place all of these unit operations in close proximity. Or, you reimagine washing/drying as more of a clean-in-place process - like the closet doubles as both storage and as washer/dryer and the robotics move the cleaning supplies to the clothes, rather than vice versa. The same could be applied to dishes - the dishwasher is the cabinet. Another interesting opportunity arises when you automate batch handling - you can spread out the cleaning process to be more continuous. Rather than do huge loads, you can soak each item as they become dirty and take more advantage of residence time, which will use the water and detergents more effectively. There are so many opportunities for reinvention of cleaning processes in the home, it feels like automating the way humans currently do it is inefficient for many reasons. reply smolder 16 hours agorootparentprev> industry heads predicting the timeline of “robots in every home”.

    "originBody": "Embeddings are underrated# Machine learning (ML) has the potential to advance the state of the art in technical writing. No, I’m not talking about text generation models like Claude, Gemini, LLaMa, GPT, etc. The ML technology that might end up having the biggest impact on technical writing is embeddings. Embeddings aren't exactly new, but they have become much more widely accessible in the last couple years. What embeddings offer to technical writers is the ability to discover connections between texts at previously impossible scales. Building intuition about embeddings# Here’s an overview of how you use embeddings and how they work. It’s geared towards technical writers who are learning about embeddings for the first time. Input and output# Someone asks you to “make some embeddings”. What do you input? You input text.1 You don’t need to provide the same amount of text every time. E.g. sometimes your input is a single paragraph while at other times it’s a few sections, an entire document, or even multiple documents. What do you get back? If you provide a single word as the input, the output will be an array of numbers like this: [-0.02387, -0.0353, 0.0456] Now suppose your input is an entire set of documents. The output turns into this: [0.0451, -0.0154, 0.0020] One input was drastically smaller than the other, yet they both produced an array of 3 numbers. Curiouser and curiouser. (When you work with real embeddings, the arrays will have hundreds or thousands of numbers, not 3. More on that later.) Here’s the first key insight. Because we always get back the same amount of numbers no matter how big or small the input text, we now have a way to mathematically compare any two pieces of arbitrary text to each other. But what do those numbers MEAN? 1 Some embedding models are “multimodal”, meaning you can also provide images, videos, and audio as input. This post focuses on text since that’s the medium that we work with the most as technical writers. Haven’t seen a multimodal model support taste, touch, or smell yet! First, how to literally make the embeddings# The big service providers have made it easy. Here’s how it’s done with Gemini: import google.generativeai as gemini gemini.configure(api_key='…') text = 'Hello, world!' response = gemini.embed_content( model='models/text-embedding-004', content=text, task_type='SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY' ) embedding = response['embedding'] The size of the array depends on what model you’re using. Gemini’s text-embedding-004 model returns an array of 768 numbers whereas Voyage AI’s voyage-3 model returns an array of 1024 numbers. This is one of the reasons why you can’t use embeddings from different providers interchangeably. (The main reason is that the numbers from one model mean something completely different than the numbers from another model.) Does it cost a lot of money?# No. Is it terrible for the environment?# I don’t know. After the model has been created (trained), I’m pretty sure that generating embeddings is much less computationally intensive than generating text. But it also seems to be the case that embedding models are trained in similar ways as text generation models2, with all the energy usage that implies. I’ll update this section when I find out more. 2 From You Should Probably Pay Attention to Tokenizers: “Embeddings are byproduct of transformer training and are actually trained on the heaps of tokenized texts. It gets better: embeddings are what is actually fed as the input to LLMs when we ask it to generate text.” What model is best?# Ideally, your embedding model can accept a huge amount of input text, so that you can generate embeddings for complete pages. If you try to provide more input than a model can handle, you usually get an error. As of October 2024 voyage-3 seems to the clear winner in terms of input size3: Organization Model name Input limit (tokens) Voyage AI voyage-3 32000 Nomic Embed 8192 OpenAI text-embedding-3-large 81914 Mistral Embed 8000 Google text-embedding-004 2048 Cohere embed-english-v3.0 512 For my particular use cases as a technical writer, large input size is an important factor. However, your use cases may not need large input size, or there may be other factors that are more important. See the Retrieval Average column of the MTEB leaderboard. 3 These input limits are based on tokens, and each service calculates tokens differently, so don’t put too much weight into these exact numbers. E.g. a token for one model may be approximately 3 characters, whereas for another one it may be approximately 4 characters. 4 Previously, I incorrectly listed this model’s input limit as 3072. Sorry for the mistake. Very weird multi-dimensional space# Back to the big mystery. What the hell do these numbers MEAN?!?!?! Let’s begin by thinking about coordinates on a map. Suppose I give you three points and their coordinates: Point X-Coordinate Y-Coordinate A 3 2 B 1 1 C -2 -2 There are 2 dimensions to this map: the X-Coordinate and the Y-Coordinate. Each point lives at the intersection of an X-Coordinate and a Y-Coordinate. Is A closer to B or C? A is much closer to B. Here’s the mental leap. Embeddings are similar to points on a map. Each number in the embedding array is a dimension, similar to the X-Coordinates and Y-Coordinates from earlier. When an embedding model sends you back an array of 1000 numbers, it’s telling you the point where that text semantically lives in its 1000-dimension space, relative to all other texts. When we compare the distance between two embeddings in this 1000-dimension space, what we’re really doing is figuring out how semantically close or far apart those two texts are from each other. The concept of positioning items in a multi-dimensional space like this, where related items are clustered near each other, goes by the wonderful name of latent space. The most famous example of the weird utility of this technology comes from the Word2vec paper, the foundational research that kickstarted interest in embeddings 11 years ago. In the paper they shared this anecdote: embedding(\"king\") - embedding(\"man\") + embedding(\"woman\") ≈ embedding(\"queen\") Starting with the embedding for king, subtract the embedding for man, then add the embedding for woman. When you look around this vicinity of the latent space, you find the embedding for queen nearby. In other words, embeddings can represent semantic relationships in ways that feel intuitive to us humans. If you asked a human “what’s the female equivalent of a king?” that human would probably answer “queen”, the same answer we get from embeddings. For more explanation of the underlying theories, see Distributional semantics. The 2D map analogy was a nice stepping stone for building intuition but now we need to cast it aside, because embeddings operate in hundreds or thousands of dimensions. It’s impossible for us lowly 3-dimensional creatures to visualize what “distance” looks like in 1000 dimensions. Also, we don’t know what each dimension represents, hence the section heading “Very weird multi-dimensional space”.5 One dimension might represent something close to color. The king - man + woman ≈ queen anecdote suggests that these models contain a dimension with some notion of gender. And so on. Well Dude, we just don’t know. The mechanics of converting text into very weird multi-dimensional space are complex, as you might imagine. They are teaching machines to LEARN, after all. The Illustrated Word2vec is a good way to start your journey down that rabbithole. 5 I borrowed this phrase from Embeddings: What they are and why they matter. Comparing embeddings# After you’ve generated your embeddings, you’ll need some kind of “database” to keep track of what text each embedding is associated to. In the experiment discussed later, I got by with just a local JSON file: { \"authors\": { \"embedding\": […] }, \"changes/0.1\": { \"embedding\": […] }, … } authors is the name of a page. embedding is the embedding for that page. Comparing embeddings involves a lot of linear algebra. I learned the basics from Linear Algebra for Machine Learning and Data Science. The big math and ML libraries like NumPy and scikit-learn can do the heavy lifting for you (i.e. very little math code on your end). Applications# I could tell you exactly how I think we might advance the state of the art in technical writing with embeddings, but where’s the fun in that? You now know why they’re such an interesting and useful new tool in the technical writer toolbox… go connect the rest of the dots yourself! Let’s cover a basic example to put the intuition-building ideas into practice and then wrap up this post. Related pages# Some docs sites have a recommendation system that makes you aware of other relevant docs. The system looks at whatever page you’re currently on, finds other pages related to this one, and then recommends other pages to visit. Embeddings provide a new way to support this feature, probably at a fraction of the cost of previous methods. Here’s how it works: Generate an embedding for each page on your docs site. For each page, compare its embedding against all other page embeddings. If the two embeddings are mathematically similar, then the contents on the two pages are probably related to each other. This can be done as a batch operation. A page’s embedding only needs to change when the page’s content changes. I ran this experiment on the Sphinx docs. The results were pretty good. Implementation and Results have the details. See Related content using embeddings for another example of this approach. Let a thousand embeddings bloom?# As docs site owners, I wonder if we should start freely providing embeddings for our content to anyone who wants them, via REST APIs or well-known URIs. Who knows what kinds of cool stuff our communities can build with this extra type of data about our docs? Parting words# Three years ago, if you had asked me what 768-dimensional space is, I would have told you that it’s just some abstract concept that physicists and mathematicians need for unfathomable reasons, probably something related to string theory. Embeddings gave me a reason to think about this idea more deeply, and actually apply it to my own work. I think that’s pretty cool. Order-of-magnitude improvements in our ability to maintain our docs may very well still be possible after all… perhaps we just need an order-of-magnitude-more dimensions!! Appendix# Implementation# I created a Sphinx extension to generate an embedding for each doc. Sphinx automatically invokes this extension as it builds the docs. import json import os import voyageai VOYAGE_API_KEY = os.getenv('VOYAGE_API_KEY') voyage = voyageai.Client(api_key=VOYAGE_API_KEY) def on_build_finished(app, exception): with open(srcpath, 'w') as f: json.dump(data, f, indent=4) def embed_with_voyage(text): try: embedding = voyage.embed([text], model='voyage-3', input_type='document').embeddings[0] return embedding except Exception as e: return None def on_doctree_resolved(app, doctree, docname): text = doctree.astext() embedding = embed_with_voyage(text) # Generate an embedding for each document! data[docname] = { 'embedding': embedding } # Use some globals because this is just an experiment and you can't stop me def init_globals(srcdir): global filename global srcpath global data filename = 'embeddings.json' srcpath = f'{srcdir}/{filename}' data = {} def setup(app): init_globals(app.srcdir) # https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/extdev/appapi.html#sphinx-core-events app.connect('doctree-resolved', on_doctree_resolved) # This event fires on every doc that's processed app.connect('build-finished', on_build_finished) return { 'version': '0.0.1', 'parallel_read_safe': True, 'parallel_write_safe': True, } When the build finishes, the embeddings data is stored in embeddings.json like this: { \"authors\": { \"embedding\": […] }, \"changes/0.1\": { \"embedding\": […] }, … } authors and changes/0.1 are docs. embedding contains the embedding for that doc. The last step is to find the closest neighbor for each doc. I.e. to find the other page that is considered relevant to the page you’re currently on. As mentioned earlier, Linear Algebra for Machine Learning and Data Science was the class that taught me the basics. import json import numpy as np from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity def find_docname(data, target): for docname in data: if data[docname]['embedding'] == target: return docname return None # Adapted from the Voyage AI docs # https://web.archive.org/web/20240923001107/https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/quickstart-tutorial def k_nearest_neighbors(target, embeddings, k=5): # Convert to numpy array target = np.array(target) embeddings = np.array(embeddings) # Reshape the query vector embedding to a matrix of shape (1, n) to make it # compatible with cosine_similarity target = target.reshape(1, -1) # Calculate the similarity for each item in data cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(target, embeddings) # Sort the data by similarity in descending order and take the top k items sorted_indices = np.argsort(cosine_sim[0])[::-1] # Take the top k related embeddings top_k_related_embeddings = embeddings[sorted_indices[:k]] top_k_related_embeddings = [ list(row[:]) for row in top_k_related_embeddings ] # convert to list return top_k_related_embeddings with open('doc/embeddings.json', 'r') as f: data = json.load(f) embeddings = [data[docname]['embedding'] for docname in data] print('.. csv-table::') print(' :header: \"Target\", \"Neighbor\"') print() for target in embeddings: dot_products = np.dot(embeddings, target) neighbors = k_nearest_neighbors(target, embeddings, k=3) # ignore neighbors[0] because that is always the target itself nearest_neighbor = neighbors[1] target_docname = find_docname(data, target) target_cell = f'`{target_docname} `_' neighbor_docname = find_docname(data, nearest_neighbor) neighbor_cell = f'`{neighbor_docname} `_' print(f' \"{target_cell}\", \"{neighbor_cell}\"') As you may have noticed, I did not actually implement the recommendation UI in this experiment. My main goal was to get basic data on whether the embeddings approach generates decent recommendations or not. Results# How to interpret the data: Target would be the page that you’re currently on.

    "commentBody": "Embeddings are underrated (technicalwriting.dev)253 points by misonic 15 hours agohidepastfavorite128 comments mrob 10 hours agoEmbeddings are the only aspect of modern AI I'm excited about because they're the only one that gives more power to humans instead of taking it away. They're the \"bicycle for our minds\" of Steve Jobs fame; intelligence amplification not intelligence replacement. IMO, the biggest improvement in computer usability in my lifetime was the introduction of fast and ubiquitous local search. I use Firefox's \"Find in Page\" feature probably 10 or more times per day. I use find and grep probably every day. When I read man pages or logs, I navigate by search. Git would be vastly less useful without git grep. Embeddings have the potential to solve the biggest weakness of search by giving us fuzzy search that's actually useful. reply inbread 2 hours agoparentI've been experimenting with using embeddings for finding the relevant git commits, as I often don't know or remember the exact word that was used. So I created my own little tool for embedding and finding commits by commit messages. Maybe you'll also find it useful: https://github.com/adrianmfi/git-semantic-similarity reply TeMPOraL 3 hours agoparentprevSo you're saying, embeddings are fine, as long as we refrain from making full use of their capabilities? We've hit on a mathematical construct that seems to be able to capture understanding, and you're saying that the biggest models are too big, we need to scale down, only use embeddings for surface-level basic similarities? I too think embeddings are vastly underutilized, and chat interface is not the be-all, end-all (not to mention, \"chat with your program/PDF/documentation\" just sounds plain stupid). However, whether current AI tools are replacing or amplifying your intelligence, is entirely down to how you use them. As for search, yes, that was a huge breakthrough and powerful amplifier. 2+ decades ago. At this point it's computer use 101 - which makes it sad when dealing with programs or websites that are opaque to search, and \"ubiquitous local search\" is still not here. Embeddings can and hopefully will give us better fuzzy/semantic searching, but if you push this far enough, you'll have to stop and ask - if the search tool is now capable to understand some aspects of my data, why not surface this understanding as a different view into data, instead of just invoking it in the background when user makes a search query? reply autokad 2 hours agorootparentI have found that embeddings + LLM is very successful. I'm going to make the words up as to not yield my work publicly, but I had to classify something into 3 categories.

When I gave gave the LLM the embedding prediction, the LLM was 98% accurate. There were issues an embedding model might not do well on where as the LLM could handle. for example: These were camel case words, like WoodPecker, AquafinaBottle, and WoodStock (I changed the words to not reveal private data).

Embeddings can only be compared to each other if they are in the same space (e.g., generated by the same model).

That is mostly just that we don’t want folks going up and doing a 30 minute demo of Sphinx or something :-) reply huijzer 5 hours agoprev> Is it terrible for the environment? > I don’t know. After the model has been created (trained), I’m pretty sure that generating embeddings is much less computationally intensive than generating text. But it also seems to be the case that embedding models are trained in similar ways as text generation models2, with all the energy usage that implies. I’ll update this section when I find out more. Although I do care about the environment, this question is completely the wrong one if you ask me. There is the public opinion (mainstream media?) some kind of idea that we should use less AI and somehow this would solve our climate problems. As a counterexample, let's go to the extreme. Let's ban Google Maps because it does take computational resources from the phone. As a result more people will take wrong routes, and thus use more petrol. Say you use one gallon of petrol extra, that then wastes 34 kWh. This is of course the equivalent of running 34 powerful vacuum cleaners on full power for an hour. In contrast, say you downloaded your map, then the total \"cost\" is only the power used by the phone. A mobile phone has a battery of about 4 mAh, so 0,004 Ah * 4.2 V = 0.168 W, or 0.000168 kW. This means that the phone is about 200 000 times as efficient! And then we didn't even consider the time-saving for the human. It's the same with running embeddings for doc generation. An Nvidia H100 consumes about 700 W, so say 1 kWh after an hour of running. 1 kWh should be enough to do a bunch of embedding runs. If this then saves, for example, one workday including the driving back and forth to the office, then again the tradeoff is highly in favor of the compute. reply dleeftink 4 hours agoparentLong-term, its not about barring progress, but to have progress and more energy efficient models. The sum-games we play in regard to energy usage, don't necessarily stack up in dynamic systems; the increased energy usage of generative models may very well lead to less compute hours spent behind the desk drafting, revising, redrafting and doing it all over again once the next project comes around. What remains though, is that increased productivity has rarely lead to a decrease in energy usage. Whether energy scarcity will drive model optimisation is anyone's guess, but it would be a differentiating feature on a market saturated with similarly capable offerings. reply archerx 5 hours agoparentprevIf people really cared about the environment then they would ban residential air conditioning, it’s a luxury.

Is there a method for dimensionality reduction of embeddings for different applications? Let's say I'm building a system to find similar tech support conversations and I am only interested in the content of the discussion, not the tone of it. How could I derive an embedding that represents only content and not tone? reply johndough 6 hours agoparentYou can do math with word embeddings. A famous example (which I now see has also been mentioned in the article) is to compute the \"woman vector\" by subtracting \"man\" from \"woman\". You can then add the \"woman vector\" to e.g. the \"king\" vector to obtain a vector which is somewhat close to \"queen\". To adapt this to your problem of ignoring writing style in queries, you could collect a few text samples with different writing styles but same content to compute a \"style direction\". Then when you do a query for some specific content, subtract the projection of your query embedding onto the style direction to eliminate the style: query_without_style = query - dot(query, style_direction) * style_direction I suspect this also works with text embeddings, but you might have to train the embedding network in some special way to maximize the effectiveness of embedding arithmetic. Vector normalization might also be important, or maybe not. Probably depends on the training. Another approach would be to compute a \"content direction\" instead of a \"style direction\" and eliminate every aspect of a query that is not content. Depending on what kind of texts you are working with, data collection for one or the other direction might be easier or have more/fewer biases. And if you feel especially lazy when collecting data to compute embedding directions, you can generate texts with different styles using e.g. ChatGPT. This will probably not work as well as carefully handpicked texts, but you can make up for it with volume to some degree. reply joerick 6 hours agorootparentInteresting, but your hypothesis assumes that 'tone' is one-dimensional, that there is a single axis you can remove. I think tone is very multidimensional, I'd expect to be removing multiple 'directions' from the embedding. reply jerf 4 hours agorootparentI would say rather that the \"standard example\" is simplified, but it does capture an essential truth about the vectors. The surprise is not that the real world is complicated and nothing is simply expressible as a vector and that treating it as such doesn't 100% work in every way in every circumstance all of the time. That's obvious. Everyone who might work with embeddings gets it, and if they don't, they soon will. The surprise is that it does work as well as it does and does seem to be capturing more than a naive skepticism would expect. reply mattnewton 4 hours agorootparentprevNo, I don’t think the author is saying one dimensional - the vectors are represented by magnitudes in almost all of the embedding dimensions. They are still a “direction” in the way that [0.5, 0.5] in x,y space is a 45 degree angle, and in that direction it has a magnitude of around 0.7 So of course you could probably define some other vector space where many of the different labeled vectors are translated to magnitudes in the original embedding space, letting you do things like have a “tone” slider. reply TeMPOraL 3 hours agorootparentI think GP is saying that GGP assumes \"tone\" is one direction, in the sense there exists a vector V representing \"tone direction\", and you can scale \"tone\" independently by multiplying that vector with a scalar - hence, 1 dimension. I'd say this assumption is both right and wrong. Wrong, because it's unlikely there's a direction in embedding space corresponding to a platonic ideal of \"tone\". Right, because I suspect that, for sufficiently large embedding space (on the order of what goes into current LLMs), any continuous concept we can articulate will have a corresponding direction in the embedding space, that's roughly as sharp as our ability to precisely define the concept. reply johndough 6 hours agorootparentprevYou could of course compute multiple \"tone\" directions for every \"tone\" you can identify and subtract all of them. It might work better, but it will definitely be more work. reply mrshu 6 hours agoparentprevThough not exactly what you are after, Contextual Document Embeddings (https://huggingface.co/jxm/cde-small-v1), which generate embeddings based on \"surrounding context\" might be of some interest.

If these access patterns are well known ahead of time, you can train subdomain behavior into the embedding models by using prefixing. E.g. content: fixing a broken printer, tone: frustration about broken printer, and \"fixing a broken printer\" can all be served by a single model. We have customers doing this in production in other contexts. If you have fundamentally different access patterns (e.g. doc -> doc retrieval instead of query -> doc retrieval) then it's often time to just maintain another embedding index with a different model. reply eproxus 27 minutes agoprevI wonder if this can be used to detect code similarity between e.g. function or files etc.? Or are the existing algorithms overly trained on written prose? reply quantadev 14 hours agoprevThat was a good post. Vector Embeddings are in some sense a summary of a doc that's unique similar to a hashcode of a doc. It makes me think it would be cool if there were some universal standard for generating embeddings, but I guess they'll be different for each AI model, so they can't have the same kind of \"permanence\" hash codes have. It definitely also seems like there should be lots of ways to utilize \"Cosine Similarity\" (or other closeness algos) in databases and other information processing apps that we haven't really exploited yet.

Yes, you can get similarity matches between job requirements and candidate resumes, but those matches are not useful for the task of finding an optimal candidate for a job. For example, say a job requires A and B. Candidate 1 is a junior who has done some work with A, B and C. Candidate 2 is a senior and knows A, B, C, D, E and F by heart. All are relevant to the job and would make 2 the optimal candidate, even though C–F are not explicitly stated in the job requirements. Candidate 1 would seem a much better candidate than 2, because 1’s embedding vector is closer to the job embedding vector. reply OutOfHere 1 hour agorootparentThe trick is evaluate the score for each skill, also weighing it by the years of experience with the skill, then sum the evaluations. This will address your problem 100%. Also, what a candidate claims as a skill is totally irrelevant and can be a lie. It is the work experience that matters, and skills can be extracted from it. reply coldtea 9 hours agorootparentprevEven that is just static information. We don't know if Candidate 2 really \"knows A, B, C, D, E and F by heart\", just that they claim to. They could be adding whatever to their skill list just, even though they hardly used it, just because it' a buzzword. So Candidate 1 could still blow them out of the water in performance, and even be able to trivially learn D, and E in a short while on the job if needed. The skill vector wont tell much by itself, and even prevent finding the better candidate if its used for screening. reply quantadev 2 hours agorootparentSo your point is that LLMs can't tell when job candidates are lying on their resume? Well that's true, but neither can humans. lol. reply quantadev 2 hours agorootparentprev> not useful for the task of finding an optimal candidate That statement is just flat out incorrect on it's face, however it did make me think of something I hadn't though of before, which is this: Embedding vectors can be made to have a \"scale\" (multiplier) on specific terms which represent the amount of \"weight\" to add to that term. For example if I have 10 years experience in Java Web Development, then we can take the actual components of that vector embedding (i.e. for string \"Java Web Development\") and multiply them by some proportionality of 10, and that results in a vector that is \"Further\" into that direction. This represents an \"amount\" of directional into the Java Web direction. So this means even with vector embeddings we can scale out to specific amounts of experience. Now here's the cool part. You can then take all THOSE scaled vectors (one for each individual job candidate skill) and average them to get a single point in space which CAN be compared as a single scalar distance from what the Job Requirements specify. reply nostrebored 2 hours agorootparentprevThat's not accurate. You can explicitly bake in these types of search behaviors with model training. People do this in ecommerce with the concept of user embeddings and product embeddings, where the result of personalized recommendations is just a user embedding search. reply kqr 12 hours agoparentprevFor one point of inspiration, see https://entropicthoughts.com/determining-tag-quality I really like the picture you are drawing with \"semantic hashes\"! reply quantadev 1 hour agorootparentYeah for \"Semantic Hashes\" (that's a good word for them!) we'd need some sort of \"Canonical LLM\" model that isn't necessarily used for inference, nor does it need to even be all that smart, but it just needs to be public for the world. It would need to be updated like every 2 to 5 years tho to account for new words or words changing meaning? ...but maybe could be updated in such a way as to not \"invalidate\" prior vectors, if that makes sense? For example \"ride a bicycle\" would still point in the same direction even after a refresh of the canonical model? It seems like feeding the same training set could replicate the same model values, but there are nonlinear instabilities which could make it disintegrate. reply helloplanets 11 hours agoparentprevI guess it might be possible to retroactively create an embeddings model which could take several different models' embeddings, and translate them into the same format. reply batch12 7 hours agorootparentThis is definitely possible.

You wouldn't be transplanting anything directly, you'd have a separate step in between, which would attempt to translate these action potentials. The point of the translating model in between would be that it would re weight each and every one of the values of the embedding, after being trained on a massive dataset of original text -> vector embedding for model A + vector embedding for model B. If you have billions of parameters trained to do this translation between just two specific models to start with, wouldn't this be in the realm of possible? reply quantadev 1 hour agorootparentA translation between models doesn't seem possible because there are actually no \"common dimensions\" at all between models. That is, each dimension has a completely different semantic meaning, in different models, but also it's the combination of dimension values that begin to impart real \"meaning\". For example, the number of different unit vector combinations in a 1500 dimensional space is like the number of different ways of \"ordering\" the components, which is 5^4114 . EDIT: And the point of that factorial is that even if the dimensions were \"identical\" across two different LLMs but merely \"scrambled\" (in ordering) there would be that large number to contend with to \"unscramble\". reply tempusalaria 9 hours agorootparentprevThis is very similar to how LLMs are taught to understand images in llava style models (the image embeddings are encoded into the existing language token stream) reply nostrebored 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is done with two models in most standard biencoder approaches.

For example, if you’re processing the raw file I expect you want to strip out a lot of markup before tokenization of the content.

Generate an embedding of some text, so that you have a known good embedding, this will be your target. 1. Generate an array of random tokens the length of the response you want. 2. Compute the embedding of this response. 3. Pick a random sub-section of the response and randomize the tokens in it again. 4. Compute the embedding of your new response. 5. If the embeddings are closer together, keep your random changes, otherwise discard them, go back to step 2. 6. Repeat this process until going back to step 2 stops improving your score. Also you'll probably want to shrink the size of the sub-section you're randomizing the closer your computed embedding is to your target embedding. Also you might be able to be cleverer by doing some kind of masking strategy? Like let's say the first half of your response text already was actually the true text of the target embedding. An ideal randomizer would see that randomizing the first half almost always makes the result worse, and so would target the 2nd half more often (I'm hoping that embeddings work like this?). 7. Do this N times and use an LLM to score and discard the worst N-1 results. I expect that 99.9% of the time you're basically producing adversarial examples w/ this strategy. 8. Feed this last result into an LLM and ask it to clean it up. reply kabla 4 hours agoparentprevIs it not possible? I'm not that familiar with the topic. Doing some sort of averaging over a large corpus of separate texts could be interesting and probably would also have a lot of applications.

I've been in the embeddings space since 2020 before the world of LLMs/GenAI. In principle, I agree with much of the sentiment here. Embeddings can get you pretty far. If the goal is to find information and citations/links, you can accomplish most of that with a simple embeddings/vector search. GenAI does have an upside in that it can distill and process those results into something more refined. One of the main production use cases is retrieval augmented generation (RAG). The \"R\" is usually a vector search but doesn't have to be. As we see with things like ChatGPT search and Perplexity, there is a push towards using LLMs to summarize the results but also linking to the results to increase user confidence. Even Google Search now has that GenAI section at the top. In general, users just aren't going to accept LLM responses without source citations at this point. The question is if the summary provides value or if the citations really provide the most value. If it's the later, then Embeddings will get the job done. reply OutOfHere 2 hours agoprev [–] This article shows the incorrect value for the OpenAI text-embedding-3-large Input Limit as 3072 which is actually its output limit [1].

    "originBody": "Tooth for a tooth A new dental scam is to pull healthy teeth to sell you expensive fake ones It turns out you may not have needed those implants after all. Brett Kelman and Anna Werner, KFF Health News – Nov 1, 2024 1:35 PM99 Digital generated image of installation process of artificial implant tooth. Credit: Andriy Onufriyenko via Getty Digital generated image of installation process of artificial implant tooth. Credit: Andriy Onufriyenko via Getty Text settings Becky Carroll was missing a few teeth, others were stained or crooked. Ashamed, she smiled with lips pressed closed. Her dentist offered to fix most of her teeth with root canals and crowns, Carroll said, but she was wary of traveling a long road of dental work. Then Carroll saw a TV commercial for another path: ClearChoice Dental Implant Centers. The company advertises that it can give patients “a new smile in as little as one day” by surgically replacing teeth instead of fixing them. So Carroll saved and borrowed for the surgery, she said. In an interview and a lawsuit, Carroll said that at a ClearChoice clinic in New Jersey in 2021, she agreed to pay $31,000 to replace all her natural upper teeth with pearly white prosthetic ones. What came next, Carroll said, was “like a horror movie.” Carroll alleged that her anesthesia wore off during implant surgery, so she became conscious as her teeth were removed and titanium screws were twisted into her jawbone. Afterward, Carroll’s prosthetic teeth were so misaligned that she was largely unable to chew for more than two years until she could afford corrective surgery at another clinic, according to a sworn deposition from her lawsuit. ClearChoice has denied Carroll’s claims of malpractice and negligence in court filings and did not respond to requests for comment on the ongoing case. “I thought implants would be easier, and all at once, so you didn’t have to keep going back to the dentist,” Carroll, 52, said in an interview. “But I should have asked more questions … like, Can they save these teeth?” Dental implants have been used for more than half a century to surgically replace missing or damaged teeth with artificial duplicates, often with picture-perfect results. While implant dentistry was once the domain of a small group of highly trained dentists and specialists, tens of thousands of dental providers now offer the surgery and place millions of implants each year in the US. Amid this booming industry, some implant experts worry that many dentists are losing sight of dentistry’s fundamental goal of preserving natural teeth and have become too willing to remove teeth to make room for expensive implants, according to a months-long investigation by KFF Health News and CBS News. In interviews, 10 experts said they had each given second opinions to multiple patients who had been recommended for mouths full of implants that the experts ultimately determined were not necessary. Separately, lawsuits filed across the country have alleged that implant patients like Carroll have experienced painful complications that have required corrective surgery, while other lawsuits alleged dentists at some implant clinics have persuaded, pressured, or forced patients to remove teeth unnecessarily. The experts warn that implants, for a single tooth or an entire mouth, expose patients to costs and surgery complications, plus a new risk of future dental problems with fewer treatment options because their natural teeth are forever gone. “There are many cases where teeth, they’re perfectly fine, and they’re being removed unnecessarily,” said William Giannobile, dean of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. “I really hate to say it, but many of them are doing it because these procedures, from a monetary standpoint, they’re much more beneficial to the practitioner.” Giannobile and nine other experts say they are combating a false public perception that implants are more durable and longer-lasting than natural teeth, which some believe stems in part from advertising on TV and social media. Implants require upkeep, and although they can’t get cavities, studies have shown that patients can be susceptible to infections in the gums and bone around their implants. “Just because somebody can afford implants doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re a good candidate,” said George Mandelaris, a Chicago-area periodontist and member of the American Academy of Periodontology Board of Trustees. “When an implant has infection, or when an implant has bone loss, an implant dies a much quicker death than do teeth.” In its simplest form, implant surgery involves extracting a single tooth and replacing it with a metal post that is screwed into the jaw and then affixed with a prosthetic tooth commonly made of porcelain, also known as a crown. Patients can also use “full-arch” or “All-on-4” implants to replace all their upper or lower teeth—or all their teeth. For this story, KFF Health News and CBS News sought interviews with large dental chains whose clinics offer implant surgery—ClearChoice, Aspen Dental, Affordable Care, and Dental Care Alliance—each of which declined to be interviewed or did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Association of Dental Support Organizations, which represents these companies and others like them, also declined an interview request. ClearChoice, which specializes in full-arch implants, did not answer more than two dozen questions submitted in writing. In an emailed statement, the company said full-arch implants “have become a well-accepted standard of care for patients with severe tooth loss and teeth with poor prognosis.” “The use of full-arch restorations reflects the evolution of modern dentistry, offering patients a solution that restores their ability to eat, speak, and live comfortably—far beyond what traditional dentures can provide,” the company said. Carroll said she regrets not letting her dentist try to fix her teeth and rushing to ClearChoice for implants. “Because it was a nightmare,” she said. “They are not teeth” Dental implant surgery can be a godsend for patients with unsalvageable teeth. Several experts said implants can be so transformative that their invention should have contended for a Nobel Prize. And yet, these experts still worry that implants are overused, because it is generally better for patients to have their natural teeth. Paul Rosen, a Pennsylvania periodontist who said he has worked with implants for more than three decades, said many patients believe a “fallacy” that implants are “bulletproof.” “You can’t just have an implant placed and go off riding into the sunset,” Rosen said. “In many instances, they need more care than teeth because they are not teeth.” Generally, a single implant costs a few thousand dollars while full-arch implants cost tens of thousands. Neither procedure is well covered by dental insurance, so many clinics partner with credit companies that offer loans for implant surgeries. At ClearChoice, for example, loans can be as large as $65,000 paid off over 10 years, according to the company’s website. Despite the price, implants are more popular than ever. Sales increased by more than 6 percent on average each year since 2010, culminating in more than 3.7 million implants sold in the US in 2022, according to a 2023 report produced by iData Research, a health care market research firm. Some worry implant dentistry has gone too far. In 10 interviews, dentists and dental specialists with expertise in implants said they had witnessed the overuse of implants firsthand. Each expert said they’d examined multiple patients in recent years who were recommended for full-arch implants by other dentists despite their teeth being treatable with conventional dentistry. Giannobile, the Harvard dean, said he had given second opinions to “dozens” of patients who were recommended for implants they did not need. “I see many of these patients now that are coming in and saying, ‘I’ve been seen, and they are telling me to get my entire dentition—all of my teeth—extracted.’ And then I’ll take a look at them and say that we can preserve most of your teeth,” Giannobile said. Tim Kosinski, who is a representative of the Academy of General Dentistry and said he has placed more than 19,000 implants, said he examines as many as five patients a month who have been recommended for full-arch implants that he deems unnecessary. “There is a push in the profession to remove teeth that could be saved,” Kosinski said. “But the public isn’t aware.” Luiz Gonzaga, a periodontist and prosthodontist at the University of Florida, said he, too, had turned away patients who wanted most or all their teeth extracted. Gonzaga said some had received implant recommendations that he considered “an atrocity.” “You don’t go to the hospital and tell them ‘I broke my finger a couple of times. This is bothering me. Can you please cut my finger off?’ No one will do that,” Gonzaga said. “Why would I extract your tooth because you need a root canal?” Jaime Lozada, director of an elite dental implant residency program at Loma Linda University, said he’d not only witnessed an increase in dentists extracting “perfectly healthy teeth” but also treated a rash of patients with mouths full of ill-fitting implants that had to be surgically replaced. Lozada said in August that he’d treated seven such patients in just three months. “When individuals just make a decision of extracting teeth to make it simple and make money quick, so to speak, that’s where I have a problem,” Lozada said. “And it happens quite often.” When full-arch implants fail, patients sometimes don’t have enough jawbone left to anchor another set. These patients have little choice but to get implants that reach into cheekbones, said Sohail Saghezchi, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of California-San Francisco. “It’s kind of like a last resort,” Saghezchi said. “If those fail, you don’t have anywhere else to go.” “It was horrendous dentistry” Most of the experts interviewed for this article said their rising alarm corresponded with big changes in the availability of dental implants. Implants are now offered by more than 70,000 dental providers nationwide, two-thirds of whom are general dentists, according to the iData Research report. Dentists are not required to learn how to place implants in dental school, nor are they required to complete implant training before performing the surgery in nearly all states. This year, Oregon started requiring dentists to complete 56 hours of hands-on training before placing any implants. Stephen Prisby, executive director of the Oregon Board of Dentistry, said the requirement—the first and only of its kind in the US—was a response to dozens of investigations in the state into botched surgeries and other implant failures, split evenly between general dentists and specialists. “I was frankly stunned at how bad some of these dentists were practicing,” Prisby said. “It was horrendous dentistry.” Many dental clinics that offer implants have consolidated into chains owned by private equity firms that have bought out much of implant dentistry. In health care, private equity investment is sometimes criticized for overtreatment and prioritizing short-term profit over patients. Private equity firms have spent about $5 billion in recent years to buy large dental chains that offer implants at hundreds of clinics owned by individual dentists and dental specialists. ClearChoice was bought for an estimated $1.1 billion in 2020 by Aspen Dental, which is owned by three private equity firms, according to PitchBook, a research firm focused on the private equity industry. Private equity firms also bought Affordable Care, whose largest clinic brand is Affordable Dentures & Implants, for an estimated $2.7 billion in 2021, according to PitchBook. And the private equity wing of the Abu Dhabi government bought Dental Care Alliance, which offers implants at many of its affiliated clinics, for an estimated $1 billion in 2022, according to PitchBook. ClearChoice and Aspen Dental each said in email statements that the companies’ private equity owners “do not have influence or control over treatment recommendations.” Both companies said dentists or dental specialists make all clinical decisions. Private equity deals involving dental practices increased ninefold from 2011 to 2021, according to an American Dental Association study published in August. The study also said investors showed an interest in oral surgery, possibly because of the “high prices” of implants. “Some argue this is a negative thing,” said Marko Vujicic, vice president of the association’s Health Policy Institute, who co-authored the study. “On the other hand, some would argue that involvement of private equity and outside capital brings economies of scale, it brings efficiency.” Edwin Zinman, a San Francisco dental malpractice attorney and former periodontist who has filed hundreds of dental lawsuits over four decades, said he believed many of the worst fears about private equity owners had already come true in implant dentistry. “They’ve sold a lot of [implants], and some of it unnecessarily, and too often done negligently, without having the dentists who are doing it have the necessary training and experience,” Zinman said. “It’s for five simple letters: M-O-N-E-Y.” Hundreds of implant clinics with no specialists For this article, journalists from KFF Health News and CBS News analyzed the webpages for more than 1,000 clinics in the nation’s largest private equity-owned dental chains, all of which offer some implants. The analysis found that more than 70 percent of those clinics listed only general dentists on their websites and did not appear to employ the specialists—oral surgeons, periodontists, or prosthodontists—who traditionally have more training with implants. Affordable Dentures & Implants listed specialists at fewer than 5 percent of its more than 400 clinics, according to the analysis. The rest were staffed by general dentists, most of whom did not list credentialing from implant training organizations, according to the analysis. ClearChoice, on the other hand, employs at least one oral surgeon or prosthodontist at each of its more than 100 centers, according to the analysis. But its new parent company, Aspen Dental, which offers implants in many of its more than 1,100 clinics, does not list any specialists at many of those locations. Not everyone is worried about private equity in implant dentistry. In interviews arranged by the American Academy of Implant Dentistry, which trains dentists to use implants, two other implant experts did not express concerns about private equity firms. Brian Jackson, a former academy president and implant specialist in New York, said he believed dentists are too ethical and patients are too smart to be pressured by private equity owners “who will never see a patient.” Jumoke Adedoyin, a chief clinical officer for Affordable Care, who has placed implants at an Affordable Dentures & Implants clinic in the Atlanta suburbs for 15 years, said she had never felt pressure from above to sell implants. “I’ve actually felt more pressure sometimes from patients who have gone around and been told they need to take their teeth out,” she said. “They come in and, honestly, taking a look at them, maybe they don’t need to take all their teeth out.” Still, lawsuits filed across the country have alleged that dentists at implant clinics have extracted patients’ teeth unnecessarily. For example, in Texas, a patient alleged in a 2020 lawsuit that an Affordable Care dentist removed “every single tooth from her mouth when such was not necessary,” then stuffed her mouth with gauze and left her waiting in the lobby as he and his staff left for lunch. In Maryland, a patient alleged in a 2021 lawsuit that ClearChoice “convinced” her to extract “eight healthy upper teeth,” by “greatly downplay[ing] the risks.” In Florida, a patient alleged in a 2023 lawsuit that ClearChoice provided her with no other treatment options before extracting all her teeth, “which was totally unnecessary.” ClearChoice and Affordable Care denied wrongdoing in their respective lawsuits, then privately settled out of court with each patient. ClearChoice and Affordable Care did not respond to requests for comment submitted to the companies or attorneys. Lawyers for all three plaintiffs declined to comment on these lawsuits or did not respond to requests for comment. Fred Goldberg, a Maryland dental malpractice attorney who said he has represented at least six clients who sued ClearChoice, said each of his clients agreed to get implants after meeting with a salesperson—not a dentist. “Every client I’ve had who has gone to ClearChoice has started off meeting a salesperson and actually signing up to get their financing through ClearChoice before they ever meet with a dentist,” Goldberg said. “You meet with a salesperson who sells you on what they like to present as the best choice, which is almost always that they’re going to take out all your natural teeth.” Becky Carroll, the ClearChoice patient from New Jersey, told a similar story. Carroll said in her lawsuit that she met first with a ClearChoice salesperson referred to as a “patient education consultant.” In an interview, Carroll said the salesperson encouraged her to borrow money from family members for the surgery and it was not until after she agreed to a loan and passed a credit check that a ClearChoice dentist peered into her mouth. “It seems way backwards,” Carroll said. “They just want to know you’re approved before you get to talk to a dentist.” CBS News producer Nicole Keller contributed to this report.

    "commentBody": "A new dental scam is to pull healthy teeth to sell you expensive fake ones (arstechnica.com)245 points by pjmlp 4 hours agohidepastfavorite230 comments hansonkd 3 hours agoThis might sound stupid but I refuse to go to dentists that have \"too nice\" of an office. Over the years I have lived in several places and had a variety of dentists and one common theme that sticks with me, the nicer and higher tech the office is, the more procedures they are going to recommend you. They need to pay for the equipment and office somehow. I've had one dentist say I need 3 cavities filled. That I needed laser treatments, extra cleanings, etc. They made it sound like my teeth were going to fall out of my head. I was going to Brazil in a few months and so i decided to wait until I was there to get the work done. The dentists there took xrays, etc and didn't find any problems. I even went to another dental clinic and the same thing. They had no idea what that dentist thought was wrong. When I came back to the states i went to another dentist. Instead of being on a top floor with an army of technicians and the fanciest machines like the first one, this dentist had a small older office. He did the cleanings himself and again he found no problems and told me I had very healthy mouth and gums. This has happened to me before when i went away to college my childhood dentist said I had cavities that I needed to fill. When i got to college and went to the dentist there, they couldn't find a problem. reply rootusrootus 1 hour agoparentI think there is some merit to that idea. It is not perfect, but it is a potential red flag. I experienced something similar a couple weeks ago when I went to a local dermatologist for a skin cancer screening. The office was gorgeous. Top of the line everything, spacious, just incredible. When the doctor came in, he was a whirlwind - he glanced at my back, the fronts of my arms, and my face ... then pronounced me in perfect health and \"see you again next year!\" He billed my insurance just under $300 for an exam that took under 5 minutes (including the consult with his nurse to point out anything I was worried about) and was worth almost nothing. A skin exam shouldn't take more than 20-30 minutes, but if the doc doesn't bother to look at your scalp, or the inside of your mouth, the soles of your feet, etc ... it is not really screening for much. $100/minute is why his office was magnificent. What a scam. reply burningChrome 1 hour agorootparent>> He billed my insurance just under $300 for an exam that took under 5 minutes. This is really common in health care. I injured my shoulder during hockey and went to the ER. The ER nurse told me to go to a specialty clinic that had offices all over town. Told me to bring a book since they do walk ins and it will be a while before I was seen. Brought a book and checked in. Three hours later, they took me back. I waited for about ten minutes and then the doctor came in. Same thing. He asked me to raise my arm in several different directions and then announced, \"Keep taking your anti-inflams, be about 6-8 weeks before it heals\" and walks out. On his way out he kind of hollered back, \"And do some stretching so you don't lose your range of motion!\" My insurance got billed $600 for a 2 min appointment. reply buffalobuffalo 19 minutes agorootparentprevI guess that's objectively worse since it results in false negatives as opposed to false positives. But personally I think it stings a bit more to get tricked into procedures you don't actually need. It's genuinely hard to identify dishonest practitioners. I think the best solution might be to convince the insurance companies to pay for second opinions. And then only to pay for the procedure if the two diagnoses agree. But I guess that's a tall ask. reply recursive 16 minutes agorootparentHow many false positives are worth a false negative?

A better way of judging is how much stuff your dentist places on 'watch' rather than recommending expensive treatments. As we get older our teeth become less perfect and there will always be some work that needs to be done.

That applies both to the US and Brazil (in fact, the dentist offices in Brazil seem to place even more effort in looking nice). My current dentist office (in the US) did show me exactly where in the x-rays they were seeing a cavity(it was a pretty large one, but hidden). It was pretty clear. I could feel the difference when the drill got to it. How do I know they weren't trying to sell me unecessary procedures? Because he told me that the cavity was quite large, and that I _might_ need a root canal, but he was going to do his best to avoid that. Procedure done, he told me to watch it for the next two weeks, and gave me a list of symptoms to watch for. Should I experience them, it would be a pretty good indication that it reached the nerve, and a root canal would be advised. Felt nothing. Subsequent visits and they tell me it is all fine. I also had to to deep cleaning once, on the account of having deep gum pockets. That was also necessary and I was starting to have problems with breath. Those two things happened because I spent 4 years without going to the dentist, so no checkups until things got bad. Oh, and I also had a spot that was demineralizing and could become a cavity. They decided to watch until my next appointment (and I redoubled my cleaning efforts since then). Next visit, they told me that it was fine.

While cleaning your teeth, obvious problems will be obvious, and non-obvious problems can wait until the next exam. At 3x a year it gets weird.

These types of relationships are the bullseye for deterrence through sever punishment; they are deliberative offenses against society, they has severe and compounding impacts, and they are a severe abuse of trust and asymmetric information.

There are extreme cases, but also a broad range of opinion in which professionals routinely disagree. The higher the stakes, the more ambiguous the problem: I’m reminded of lawyering. How do we know if a defense lawyer is “bad” or “dishonest”? If we look at their conviction ratio, then we might just be punishing the ones who tend to work the more hopeless cases—and a good lawyer is correct to behave as if even guilty people deserve a full defense. If we ask the customer/defendants, pretty much anybody who loses will loudly explain how they’re innocent and would have gotten off if it weren’t for that bad lawyer they had. The dentist who treats aggressively will explain how the “wait-and-see” dentist is neglecting problems, and the “wait-and-see” dentist will explain, like the tech people commenting here, that the aggressive dentists are doing stuff that’s unnecessary (or not necessary yet). I, a person who pays for my own dental care, will continue to prefer and seek out a conservative approach to treatment; an acquaintance of mine, who has dental insurance but gets it from a startup job that could evaporate tomorrow, will prefer to gather his implants while he may.

I say somewhat younger because solo dentists seem to mostly buy their equipment once, presumably mortgaging it over decades, and then retire when it's mostly used up. So a younger one is going to have the technical advantages that the older ones don't. I much prefer the newer ones that have digital xray systems and can show you the images on a giant monitor vs the ones that are developing xrays and looking at tiny images.

The one I'm at now is great, it's a solo female dentist and all of the support staff are relatively young women, they don't advertise as being specifically all women, I think it's just how it works out since most hygienists are women traditionally.

I asked if they were healthy for the teeth and how long they lasted. Not really and about 8 months. I defered. They then later tried to sell me on veneers. I asked if my teeth were healthy and they said \"very\". I then said \"it feels very shady and concerning that you are recommending that I grind off perfectly healthy teeth to replace them with veneers for around $30k.

It had always triggered her that I had a small gap in my front teeth (which I had because as soon I turned 18 I told the orthodontist to f*ck off once he said it would take some real pain and was purely cosmetic). I pointed out that it actually made Michael Strahan seem more authentic and no longer seemed problematic. At that point she acquiesced. But I also realized how she was affording such a nice office beyond her cleanings costing double what my insurance covered. After that she was excellent and didn't bother me with anything that was cosmetic.

A couple decades ago I went to a \"dental spa\", and they definitely over treated. They did this thing where they shined a laser at my teeth and said I had \"pre-cavities\", so I needed treatment (I think it was some sort of sealant). I went to another dentist who basically said this was all bullshit. He said the whole concept of \"pre-cavities\" wasn't really a useful diagnostic category for treatment in the first place. That is, I went to the dentist every six months, and if they saw, for example, any thinning of the enamel, they would just watch it (because proper care can often prevent it from getting worse), and if it did develop into a cavity, they would fill it. But there was absolutely no need to pre-treat if a cavity wasn't there, and since I saw the dentist every six months they would catch anything before it became severe. I'm so happy I've found a conservative but highly competent dentist. But it took a lot of looking. Dentists can essentially \"create their own demand\" if they need to, so I think one of the biggest risks in finding a dentist is that so many of them have a strong incentive to overtreat. reply PaulHoule 2 hours agorootparentWhen I first came to Ithaca I went to the dentist who came first in the phone book and found he wanted to do too much of everything including take pano X rays even though I had no problems.

With other crimes where \"sting operations\" work the situation is much more clear cut. The target of the drug sting is either selling drugs or not selling drugs. If you find drugs you can easily prosecute them. With the dental scam even if you manage to catch them red handed once, it is still a long and complicated process to prove it was a scam and not a mistake.

Over the past 20 years, I’ve seen more than ten dentists, and only one genuinely seemed to care about my dental health, doing everything necessary to save a tooth. She may have cared because we’re distantly related. Here are a few examples from my experiences: 1. I went in for a routine cleaning, but they recommended $2,500 worth of unnecessary procedures. When I declined and asked for just the cleaning, the dentist spent less than five minutes on it. 2. Dentists seem overly eager to drill and fill, often doing poor-quality work that requires repeated visits. I still have six fillings from when I was young, and they've lasted for over 30 years. 3. For a minor broken corner on a tooth, one dentist recommended a $2,500 procedure (above my insurance coverage) and insisted on treating all my teeth for better care. I declined, but still received a $250 bill for the consultation. My previous dentist fixed it for $120 in cash. 4.

I had a really bad experience once so the next time I was told I needed something I did exactly this and it was pretty discouraging - they all wanted to do work but there was no consistently in what. I'm pretty sure most are hacks at this point and if you aren't actually in pain, I'd be wary of any work. reply pphysch 3 hours agoparent> I'm pretty sure most are hacks at this point and if you aren't actually in pain, I'd be wary of any work. Even if you are in pain, as long as it's not severe/sharp, give it a couple days to see if it goes away permanently. A lot of \"tooth\" pain is just a bruised nerve from chewing something wrong, clenching, or other temporary things that do not warrant drilling into your teeth over. reply blululu 3 hours agoprevThis is an old scam, but I would strongly reemphasize that you should not just blindly trust your dentist. Vet them, push back on any operations and get a second opinion. reply cjbgkagh 2 hours agoprev~15 years ago I had a sequence of 4 scam dentists in a row before deciding never to do that again. Based on the other comments it appears that I was not the only one. The first visit felt like a scam so I got a second opinion which found a new completely different set of problems, so I got a third opinion and a fourth with absolutely no consistency and each recommending a completely different set of expensive treatments and all of them feeling like scams. I think I was luckly that I did at one point go to a good dentist who told me things like teeth can naturally have dimples which are generally nothing to worry about - so I was suspicious when a later dentist told me I really had to worry about them. The initial good dentist did recommend a sand blasting and sealant of the groves in molars as a long term preventative procedure. As he explained it fluoride hardens teeth and changes the wear patters causing these issues where pockets of bacteria are hard to get to and can later cause cavities. He didn't sell it as some sort of necessity but as something that he thought was generally a good idea to do and his explanation did convince me. It was a simple, inexpensive and painless procedure which I believe was effective and I think should be a widespread default. I don't know who I'd trust to do the science on that though. reply timbaboon 2 hours agoprevThis is exactly what a dentist tried to do to me! My normal dentist wasn’t available so I saw another one (she had great google reviews!). This dentist said I had a tooth that was bad and she would have to do an implant, but then I should do all the teeth around it because otherwise “it will look weird”. She told me it was urgent and had to be done in like a month. Quote was about $10k (I live in South Africa and this amount of money is even more ridiculous here). Then gave me all the info on how I could finance it. I went back to my normal dentist and she said yeah, just need one filling and we’re good. Saw another dentist too, and she also agreed I didn’t need a full set of new teeth. Anyway, I was chatting to a friend after this experience and it turned out this dentist had sexually harassed him in addition to doing a bunch of unneeded procedures (without telling him what she was doing). reply Havoc 3 hours agoprevProblem is it’s impossible to tell with dentists for the layman. If they say this has to happen what are you going to do? Google it? Go to dental school?

When I had to have a molar removed due to cracking the dentist referred me to a different dentist who specialized in removals. The removal was done and then I had to wait about 6 months before the implant was put in because the bone needed to fill in from the extraction - I think that's the normal way these things are done, not an all-in-one-day procedure. reply chasebank 2 hours agoprevHere's an article about a guy who went to 50 different dentists and had some wild diagnoses.

More recently, PE has taken a greater interest in acquiring dental practices, but few data exist about the scope of PE activity within dentistry. We analyzed dentist provider data for the period 2015-21 to examine trends in PE acquisition of dental practices. The percentage of dentists affiliated with PE increased from 6.6 percent in 2015 to 12.8 percent in 2021. During this period, PE affiliation increased particularly among larger dental practices and among dental specialists such as endodontists, oral surgeons, and pediatric dentists. PE-affiliated dental practices were more likely to participate in Medicaid than practices not affiliated with PE. Future research should investigate whether PE's role in dentistry affects the affordability and quality of dental services.\" The original article is paywalled - only the abstract is available - so here's an article which summarizes it: https://adanews.ada.org/ada-news/2024/august/private-equity-...

If I wanted to know about (say) SmileBuilderz, how could I find out? reply teeray 3 hours agoprevThis is my fear of the dentist. Not of the procedures themselves--I'm fine with that. It's not even the cost of those procedures. It's replacing perfectly good natural teeth with man-made facsimiles when it doesn't need to be done.

Then months late, the place I had gone that said I had eight fillings, one of the fillings I let them put in fell out after only ~1 year.

To reap the benefits of our society of specialists, we have to trust the specialists in our lives… reply karaterobot 2 hours agoparentI'd say we have to rely on the specialists in our lives, because we can't all do the same things they do, but not that we should trust them without any other reason. There are clearly people pulling scams—or simply making honest mistakes—so it would be irrational to blindly trust all specialists simply because they are specialists. That's especially true when they have a financial interest in taking a certain position. In a marketplace with many specialists who are able to offer the same service, it makes most sense to be skeptical, and I doubt you'd find many knowledgeable folks who don't advocate getting a second opinion when making a significant financial or health-related decision. reply hexator 3 hours agoparentprevBecause of the reasons outlined in the article?

[1]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10686905/ reply SoftTalker 3 hours agoprevIt's a bit off topic but I often wonder why dentistry is not a specialization of medicine (like e.g. dermatology) but is its own separate thing, with separate insurance, etc. Dental health is part of being healthy. A lot of dental work is surgery. To me, it should be part of regular medical care. reply aithrowawaycomm 3 hours agoparentTo be clear I agree that as a matter of policy dentistry and optometry should be treated the same as everything else. There is no historical or policy-based excuse for untreated tooth decay in developed economies. Dentistry is the earliest specialization of medicine and the first to be studied with modern scientific rigor - dental problems are universal in agricultural societies, and it's much easier to see what's going on without modern tech. So its separation from other branches of medicine is a natural historical accident. (Likewise with early optometrists being \"applied opticians\" vs early ophthalmologists guessing about the biology of the eye.) The fact that minor dental treatments are physically invasive compared to other branches of medicine means that dental training will always be different from other physicians, and this naturally extends to professional organizations. But it shouldn't extend to insurance companies. reply mankyd 3 hours agoparentprevThere is some history here, at least in the US. As I recall, when \"modern medicine\" was first forming, there was a push to make it part of what we would consider standard medical care, but another, more influential party decided (incorrectly) that teeth weren't living tissue and should be excluded. The divide took hold and we ended up with the system we have today, where teeth are independent of the rest of the medical field. It's especially noticeable when you have dentists, orthodontists, and oral surgeons, each separate specialties referring between each other, but only oral surgeons falling under medical insurance. reply MBCook 2 hours agorootparentYou’re right, there’s a history. The reason I remember (I don’t know which of us or both are right) is that modern doctors came out of the “medical”/healing specialty where as dentists came out of the barber/surgeon tradition. So I believe doctors didn’t want to admit their inferiors (barbers who pull teeth) to the profession and so that’s why dentists were kept out. Overtime they’ve both grown in parallel since they end up covering a lot of the same things. X-rays, infections, medications + dosages. but dentist still get different training than “real“ doctors. It does seem like dentistry should probably be a specialty of a normal doctor program at this point, but it’s not for some kind of historical reason as you mentioned. reply daft_pink 3 hours agoparentprevDentistry is not a specialization of medicine, because if it were the dentist would be required to go through a full medical doctor education including hospital residency and then become a dentist on top of this, so it wouldn’t benefit the consumer in that the current policy is fine and actually it might make more sense to break other specializations off from medicine so that you can get more affordable treatments from people with specialized skills without needing an entire set of generalized skills. Regarding funding, I agree that preventative care should be covered under health insurance like physical exams, because if you go for a cleaning twice a year you probably aren’t going to have many problems and if you don’t go for a cleaning twice a year you probably are going to have a lot of problems. But many dental treatments are cosmetic in nature and not medically necessary and probably would not be covered under the current health insurance regime in the United States, but are covered under the dental insurance regime. It’s important to note that dental coverage in the US is widely available as a separate part of “Obamacare” subsidized by the government and children’s coverage on the marketplace is even stronger without waiting periods and limits on max out of pockets in a way that is generous compared to most private offerings. reply RobotToaster 3 hours agoparentprevI kinda feel the opposite about some specializations in medicine.

Not \"doctors\" in the chiropractic sense, but actual doctors with residency requirements. reply chamakits 3 hours agorootparentI think the parent comment was referencing that, at least in the US, dentistry is treated differently in many ways. For example, it’s a different health insurance with its separe premiums and limits, and you’ll never find a dentist in a hospital; instead they have their own offices. reply TeaBrain 2 hours agorootparentprevIn the US, dentistry isn't a specialization of medicine. Medical specializations have to go to medical school then residency first before specializing. Dentists just go to dental school. Dentists in the US aren't medical doctors any more than JDs or PhDs are. reply queuebert 3 hours agoparentprevBeing separate, it seems distinctly less evidence based as well. reply jacobr1 3 hours agorootparentNot sure that is the case. The base science and recommended practices seems pretty much as a solid as any other speciality (imperfect as they all are). It really is the case that cavities are bad. We understand what causes them, how they grow, risk factors and how to treat them. But ... the business model and incentives are different. A general practice MD, doesn't get a cut of revenue when they write a prescription. The incentives are closer to a plastic surgeons.

I only scanned a few bits but I was surprised to see statements like \"the male skeleton had a knee injury, thus conclusively proving it was Philip\" and \"the female skeleton was 18 therefore proving it was Cleopatra since sources say she was young\". (Paraphrasing) Etc etc. Is that all it takes to \"prove\" something? Could it not just be coincidence and it was someone else with a knee injury and some other ~18 year old? Or is that as far as we need to go in archeology to prove something? Put 2 and 2 together and come up with Cleopatra? There also seems to be some sort of almost personal/ad hominem type stuff later on about other researchers who apparently criticised the author's work which surprised me (\"Prag, Musgrave, and Neave continue to argue that I remain silent about Cyna ... as if it is an important issue\"...) Is this legit research? reply sgc 4 hours agoparentApologies for the long response. I am only partially qualified in that I am not a professional archeologist, but I have done post-doctoral archeological studies and have read enough archeological studies to understand the larger academic context. It is not possible to present all the data informing a judgment in such a short work. Even in a book, it would not be possible. Thus it is common in archeology for papers to be written as part of an ongoing conversation / debate with the community - which would be defined as the small handful of other archeologists doing serious research on the same specific subject matter. Part of that context here is that these tombs are well-established to be the royal tombs of Alexander's family, spanning a few generations including his father and his son. This is one of the most heavily studied sites in Greece for obvious reasons, and that is not something anybody is trying to prove. In that context, his arguments are trying to identify any body as one among millions, but as one among a small handful of under ten possibilities. At the same time, the fact that he is not a native English speaker and general archeological style come into play. For example: \"the painter must have watched a Persian gazelle in Persia, since he painted it so naturalistically (contra Brecoulaki Citation2006). So the painter of Tomb II has to be Philoxenus of Eretria\" sounds like a massive leap, and it is. He continues: \"... Tomb I (Tomb of Persephone) must have been painted hastily by Nicomachus of Thebes (Andronikos Citation1984; Borza Citation1987; Brecoulaki et al. Citation2023, 100), who was a very fast painter (Saatsoglou-Paliadeli Citation2011, 286) and was famous for painting the Rape of Persephone (Pliny, N. H. 35.108–109), perhaps that of Tomb I.\" Another huge leap, both 'presented as conclusions'. However he then continues to indicate these are just hypotheses: \"These hypotheses are consistent with the dates of the tombs...\" So his English language use of presenting things factually does not indicate certainty in the way the words would be used in everyday speech. He seems to perhaps misunderstand the force of the terms, but also appears to be working within the context of the conversation with other archeologists I mentioned to start: They all know every affirmation is as \"probably\", rarely anything more. So it is relatively common shorthand of the craft in that sense. I believe you are overthinking his responses to other authors, although I understand the culture shock. It is an ongoing conversation and archeologists tend to be blunt in their assessments. Add Greek bluntness on top of this, and it does not seem to matter to the material. As to your last question, is this legitimate research? The answer overall appears to be yes, although I could see several points (such as the identification of artists I quoted above, and various items I noticed), which I would never have put into ink the way he did. Still, most of his arguments are compelling. It is a shame that the aggressiveness of a few affirmations detract from the overall value of his work. Archeology is not code nor is it physics. It does not pursue universal truths that are more easy to verify through repeated experiments, but unique historical ones which necessarily attempt to interweave physical details and ancient historical records. Each field has its own level of certainty, and the fact that we cannot establish these details with the same certainty as we can establish the chemical formula for water does not make them useless, or pure inventions.

Indeed, but after scanning this article that pulls in all those pieces of indirect evidence I wondered whether some type of structured knowledge database (that encodes the innumerable pieces of historical information that are known, tags them with confidence levels etc.) would not be useful to advance research in such domains. Something like a large collection of RDF triplets against which you could run a query like \"Given this new data point how (more)likely that Alexander the Great's tunic is identified in a royal tomb at Vergina?\" reply sgc 3 hours agorootparentTo me it sounds like it could (and likely would) backfire, by replacing judgment with numbers. Who is giving the confidence score? What confidence score does each confidence score receive? Why are those scores more valid than the expert in that very narrow domain? If that expert is the one giving the scores, are they not just gatekeeping? Et cetera. I don't want to see researchers rewriting their papers because their cumulative source score is 68.17, and it should be 72.5 or higher. reply openrisk 5 minutes agorootparent> replacing judgment with numbers I would phrase it otherwise: supporting judgement with numbers. Its not about altering conclusions, but making more transparent the factual basis and associated reasoning from which they are derived. The analogy would be trying some exotic food and having a list of ingredients. Yes, good to listen to a local as to how it tastes (and whether it cures all diseases), but if the indication is: 50% sugar, thats a data point worth knowing. reply mmooss 23 minutes agorootparentprevYou would attach names and dates to the numbers, as with any scientific publishing. reply bobthepanda 25 minutes agorootparentprevalso, there have been points in time where established archeology was wrong, and this seems like it would produce a bias towards what we currently think is true. for example, theories on how the Polynesian migration came to be are still in flux, to the point where one theory was attempted to be proven by actually sailing to the different islands using only traditional wayfinding. reply munk-a 2 hours agorootparentprevI think that, effectively, the corpus of research papers and citation links is this knowledge database. It isn't structured the way I would structure it in postgres but it seems to be working quite well for the professionals in this field. I know there have been some interesting finds when an archeologist has dug up a site report from the 1840s that had long laid ignored by academia but these are quite rare occurrences and the scale of people involved here (when we're talking about something hyper specific) is so small that they can probably just sort it out by talking to one another. For the outside public such a neatly tagged database might be helpful if someone outside of the circle wants to independently research a subject in depth but, honestly, these folks are pretty open to questions and discussions so if you're extremely interested in Gobekli Tepe or some such there's someone out there who is happy to start a conversation with you. reply mmooss 12 minutes agorootparent> it seems to be working quite well for the professionals in this field That is the universal response to new technology: What we're doing is working fine! What they are saying is, 'everything we've accomplished has been with the old technology'. I promise that was heard from engineers and architects encountering CAD, from cavalry asked to give up their horses (the conservative urge is so great, many died charging machine guns!), by literary scholars presented with computerized tools, .... it's always the same. One person who installed the first email systems for many businesses told me that, over and over, people would say 'our paper memos work fine - this is just technology for technology sake'. They meant, 'everything we've accomplished, we've done it with paper memos'. New technology lets you do old things much faster and/or lets you do new things you couldn't do before - new things you didn't dream of doing, and as people discover uses for it, new things you won't know about for years. reply openrisk 54 minutes agorootparentprev> the corpus of research papers and citation links is this knowledge database yes, I think so too.

In more quantitative fields people talk about reproducible research, here its more a question of whether similar fields would benefit from \"reproducible chains of reasoning\". reply GavinMcG 4 hours agorootparentprevSomething like this, perhaps? https://digitalculture.uchicago.edu/platforms/ochre-overview... reply pm3003 2 hours agoparentprevYes, in particular the points you cite have been widely discussed since the late 70s. The 'proofs' in question are not absolute mathematical proofs but strong hints around which cases have been made including a lot of elements. The cases are not that clearly cut,and there is not a lot of positive evidence for one thesis or the other but the phrasing here is good approximation. The research appears serious, but at first sight it doesn't seem to disprove any of the dominant thesis around Vergina. The question \"who is in tomb II?\" is still open. Though recent research has provided evidence against the occupant being Philip II (and being rather Philip III) there is still a good deal of evidence \"for\" Philip II. The case (for Philip II) made at the (very impressive) exhibition at the Vergina museum is well explained. The case for Cleopatra is even more tenuous but also very well explained. reply PaulRobinson 4 hours agoparentprevNot an academic, not an expert, but... The history of the elites in this period is quite well documented from multiple sources. There are some minor royals - third and fourth sons - where little is known other than some titles and lands granted, but the historical record is both comprehensive and considered accurate, particularly for those whose stories were quite shocking like the 7th wife of Philip II (Cleopatra Eurydice, the young woman whose remains are being discussed), whose death may have been suicide, or a murder made to look like suicide... The thread they're pulling on seems to start here, from the paper: > There is a unanimous agreement that Tomb III belongs to King Alexander IV, the son of the Great Alexander. This is important because it shows that the Great Tumulus belongs mainly to the Kings of the Argead dynasty, and this contributes significantly to the identification of Tombs I and II as belonging to either Philip II or Arrhidaeus If accept that unanimous agreement is well-founded, and it is beyond any reasonable doubt that Tomb III belongs to the son of the Great Alexander, then it seems very likely that Tombs I and II must belong to Philip II or Arrhidaeus. The paper seems to then try and work out which one belongs to who. Now you look through the historical record of each, and you identify that there are multiple sources indicating that Philip had a young wife (Cleopatra Eurydice), who had a young son who was murdered [1]. Then you find a tomb that along with a male, has a younger female with an infant son interred. There is no other known tomb that contains similar remains. That matches Philip II, but does not match Arrhidaeus. You then look at the other tomb, and realise those remains better matches Arrhidaeus. This is not proof in a scientific sense, it's not irrefutable, but you have to ask if the young woman and infant are not Cleopatra Eurydice and her son Caranus, who exactly are they? Which other persons match the known historical records? If they're people from outside of the known record, just how likely is it that they would be buried in this specific context of a tomb neighboring Alexander IV? Unless you then want to unpick that assumption of Alexander IV of course, which you're entitled to do, but you're now pushing back against a collective assumption with some significant weight (and I presume, evidence), behind it. The rest of the paper starts to pull at the logic of other papers published over the last 60 years or so to help develop the case further, but in reality without some better science that seems absent (radio carbon dating, DNA analysis to show familial relationships of remains, and so on), it might be hard to get it over the line from \"seems very likely to be the best explanation given what we know today\" into \"almost impossible to be explained any other way\".

History is built on stories, it's just story upon story. Licensed historians are able to augment the existing history. The stories need have nothing to do with the truth of whatever might (or might not) have happened. Whenever you try to find the sources for this or that claim, it is impossible to do so, especially with anything ancient.

Herodotus for example is filled with references to places and things that were later discovered. However there are still many examples of pretty credible places and objects that remain undiscovered. Also, fwiw, people for some reason think it’s ok or cool to criticize Herodotus’ history. It’s actually very good and he always says when he observed something for himself, or it’s something that is said by others and he felt it was important to document. However his assumptions and methods are always stated. I think honestly the main problem is it’s just a really long book so few ever read it. Thucydides is even better. It’s such a shame there is virtually nothing surviving from people who personally knew Alexander. His entire rise is foreshadowed all throughout Thucydides, which is amazing considering that it predates him considerably. reply gavindean90 3 hours agoparentI like the way Bob Briar describes Herodotus as an ancient tourist/journalist. reply troymc 5 hours agoprevMy summary: they claim (with evidence) that they found the sacred purple sarapis (tunic) of Alexander the Great, and possibly some of his other things. reply pluc 5 hours agoparentI'll go a bit further and say that they don't claim it's Alexander's tomb, but someone that was buried with Alexander's artifacts (namely, his brother) reply armitron 5 hours agorootparentThis is correct. Alexander is burried in Alexandria, Egypt. This discovery means that some of his artifacts were inherited by one of his siblings, moved back to Greece and burried with them. reply troymc 5 hours agorootparentAFAIK, the current location of Alexander's tomb is not known. reply armitron 4 hours agorootparentThe exact location is not known but there is strong consensus amongst historians that he's burried in Alexandria. reply rwl4 3 hours agoprevJust in case anybody is interested in a bit more of a casual format, I had NotebookLM create a podcast from the paper. https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/0bef03c4-3ed5-4b13-90... reply anoncow 2 hours agoparentThat was enjoyable.

What is more likely - that this is Alexander's sarapis itself or that a very rich guy had one made just like it? reply ericmay 4 hours agoparent> What is more likely - that this is Alexander's sarapis itself or that a very rich guy had one made just like it? I read through the original article though not very closely, and the authors wrote that the construction of the sarapis was unique in that nobody would have been allowed to construct one, and that the physical construction of the sarapis would have been profoundly expensive. It could be the case that another rich guy went and had one made, sure, but given the above two priors you'd have to answer: Who else at the time could afford to have such a sarapis constructed? Is there a record of anyone with a similarly designed and constructed sarapis? Historians seem to have a good idea of who was rich and/or noble in the area at the time. If someone at the time constructed a similarly designed sarapis in the region, who would have built it and why wouldn't have someone basically told on them for trying to copy the God King? I don't think your point is invalid, but it would raise more questions that as far as I'm aware there seems to be little evidence for and introduce impractical logistics for the time period. reply infecto 4 hours agorootparentI think people forget that in those times production was tightly controlled and most likely the construction of such a cloth without permissions would most likely be met with execution. reply ericmay 4 hours agorootparentI agree - thank you for writing that more pointedly than I did in my post. reply ipinak 4 hours agoparentprevA very rich guy made one and put it the tomb?

We've built an automated end-to-end insurance billing system for recurring care, starting with Autism clinics. At Juniper, we’ve built an end-to-end billing system. We’ve built something really good, something that clinicians really need and love. We automate and abstract the tedious, manual, repetitive work that goes into the administrative duties of running a clinic, so that clinicians can do what they do best — providing high quality care. It starts with ingesting clinic data, and then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections). We are a team of ~40 with strong product market fit — in Q4 last year we’ve had to push out onboarding because engineering can’t build quickly enough, something we’ve scaled out of and will hopefully not bottleneck growth again. You’ll be working with an engineering leadership team from AWS and Stripe to get clinicians back to work delivering care for kids.

Part of that is building a new frontend from the ground up, first to improve the existing features, and then to develop new features. We're not looking for a specific tech stack, but rather the right person to build a good foundation. You can \"bring your own tech stack\" – anything reasonably mainstream-y is fine. - Should have reasonable experience with the core of the selected tech stack. This is a small team with some deadlines, without a lot of room for experimentation with the latest greatest JavaScript thingy. - We want \"boring tech\"[2] that will still work in five years. - Reasonable dependency tree; in the dozens, not hundreds and certainly not thousands. It's not a crime to write 50 lines of code yourself if that saves adding a whole bunch of dependencies. - Good developer experience: changes should show up in hundreds of milliseconds, not seconds. Any competent developer should be able to start working on it with a relatively short lead time. The initial focus will mainly be on re-implementing the existing frontend, after which the focus will shift to new features. You will be working with a UX designer and we're not looking for a UX expert, but you should have familiarity with good UX design.

    "originBody": "October 31, 2024 Oasis: A Universe in a Transformer Decart, Etched Play demo Decart BlogView codeModel weightsEtched Blog We're excited to announce Oasis, the first playable, realtime, open-world AI model. It's a video game, but entirely generated by AI. Oasis is the first step in our research towards more complex interactive worlds. Oasis takes in user keyboard input and generates real-time gameplay, including physics, game rules, and graphics. You can move around, jump, pick up items, break blocks, and more. There is no game engine; just a foundation model. We believe fast transformer inference is the missing link to making generative video a reality. Using Decart's inference engine, we show that real-time video is possible. When Etched's transformer ASIC, Sohu, is released, we can run models like Oasis in 4K. Today, we're releasing Oasis's code, the weights of a 500M parameter model you can run locally, and a live playable demo of a larger checkpoint. Gameplay Results Previous slideNext slide Oasis understands complex game mechanics, such as building, lighting physics, inventory management, object understanding, and more. Placing non-cube blocks Model understands lighting physics Interacting with animals Recovering health when eating Shovel is faster than hands Previous slideNext slide Oasis outputs a diverse range of settings, locations, and objects. This versatility gives us confidence that Oasis can be adapted to generate a wide range of new maps, games, features, and modifications with limited additional training. Space-like dark location Oasis renders at night Placing a range of objects Oasis lets users open inventory chests Exciting animals and NPCs Previous slideNext slide Oasis is an impressive technical demo, but we believe this research will enable an exciting new generation of foundation models and consumer products. For example, rather than being controlled by actions, a game controlled completely by text, audio, or other modalities. Architecture The model is composed of two parts: a spatial autoencoder, and a latent diffusion backbone. Both are Transformer-based: the autoencoder is based on ViT[1], and the backbone is based on DiT[2]. Contrasting from recent action-conditioned world models such as GameNGen[3] and DIAMOND[4], we chose Transformers to ensure stable, predictable scaling, and fast inference on Etched's Transformer ASIC, Sohu. In contrast to bidirectional models such as Sora[5], Oasis generates frames autoregressively, with the ability to condition each frame on game input. This enables users to interact with the world in real-time. The model was trained using Diffusion Forcing[6], which denoises with independent per-token noise levels, and allows for novel decoding schemes such as ours. We train on a subset of open-source Minecraft video data collected by OpenAI[9]. One issue we focused on is temporal stability--making sure the model outputs make sense over long time horizons. In autoregressive models, errors compound, and small imperfections can quickly snowball into glitched frames. Solving this required innovations in long-context generation. We solved this by deploying dynamic noising, which adjusts inference-time noise on a schedule, injecting noise in the first diffusion forward passes to reduce error accumulation, and gradually removing noise in the later passes so the model can find and persist high-frequency details in previous frames for improved consistency. Since our model saw noise during training, it learned to successfully deal with noisy samples at inference. To learn more about the engineering underlying this model, and some of the specific optimizations in training and inference, check out the Decart blog post. Previous slideNext slide Performance Oasis generates real-time output in 20 frames per second. Current state-of-the-art text-to-video models with a similar DiT architecture (e.g. Sora[5], Mochi-1[7] and Runway[8]) can take 10-20 seconds to create just one second of video, even on multiple GPUs. In order to match the experience of playing a game, however, our model must generate a new frame every 0.04 seconds, which is over 100x faster. With Decart's inference stack, the model runs at playable framerates, unlocking real-time interactivity for the first time. Read more about it on Decart's blog. However, to make the model an additional order of magnitude faster, and make it cost-efficient to run at scale, new hardware is needed. Oasis is optimized for Sohu, the Transformer ASIC built by Etched. Sohu can scale to massive 100B+ next-generation models in 4K resolution. In addition, Oasis' end-to-end Transformer architecture makes it extremely efficient on Sohu, which can serve >10x more users even on 100B+ parameter models. We believe the price of serving models like Oasis is the hidden bottleneck to releasing generative video in production. See more performance figures and read more about Oasis and Sohu on Etched's blog. Future Explorations With the many exciting results, there come areas for future development in the model. There are difficulties with the sometimes fuzzy video in the distance, the temporal consistency of uncertain objects, domain generalization, precise control over inventories, and difficulties over long contexts. Struggles with domain generalization Limited memory over long horizons Difficulty with precise inventory control Difficulty with precise object control Fuzziness of distant sand Previous slideNext slide Following an in-depth sensitivity analysis on different configurations of the architecture alongside the data and model size, we hypothesize that the majority of these aspects may be addressed through scaling of the model and the datasets. Therefore, we are currently developing this direction alongside additional optimization techniques in order to enable such large-scale training efficiently. Further, once these larger models are developed, new breakthroughs in inferencing technology would be required in order to ensure a sustainable latency and cost trade-off.

You can't design a game by setting model weights directly. I do see how you might clone a game, eventually without all the missing things like object permanence and other long-term state. But the inference engine is probably more expensive to run than the game engine it (somewhat) emulates. What is this tech useful for? Genuine question from a long-time AI person. reply naed90 45 minutes agoparentYep! Which is why a key point for our next models is to get to a state that you can \"code\" a new world using \"prompting\". I agree that these tools become insanely useful only once there is a very good way for creators to \"develop\" new worlds/games on top of these systems and then users could interact with those worlds. At the end of the day, it should provide the same \"API\" as a game engine does: creators develop worlds, users interact with those worlds. The nice thing is that if AI can actually fill this role, then it would be: 1. Potentially much easier to create worlds/games (you could just \"talk\" to the AI -- \"add a flying pink elephant here\") 2. Users could interact with a world that could change to fit each game session -- this is truly infinite worlds Last point: are we there yet? Ofc not! Oasis v1 is a first POC.

They can't say \"Minecraft\" because that's a Microsoft trademark, but they can use Minecraft images as training data, because everyone (including Microsoft) is using proprietary data to train diffusion models. There's the issue that the outputs obviously resemble Minecraft, but Microsoft has its own problems with Bing and DALL-E generating images that obviously resemble trademarked things (despite guardrails). reply chefandy 4 hours agorootparentAvoiding legal and ethical issues. This stuff was made by a bunch of real people, and people still get their name in movie and game credits even if they got a paycheck from it. Microsoft shamelessly vacuuming up proprietary content didn't change the norms of the way people get credited in these mediums. It's sad to see how thoughtlessly so many people using generative AI disregard the models' source material as \"data\" while the models (and therefore their creators) almost always get prominently credited for putting in a tiny fraction of the effort. The dubious ethical defense against crediting source works— that models learn about media the same way humans do and adapt it to suit their purposes— is obliterated when it is trained on one work to reproduce that work. That this is equated to generating an image on Midjourney it's a blatant example of a common practice— people want to get credit for other people's work, but when it's time to take responsibility the way a human artist would have to, \"The machine did it!

Curious to see how it evolves.. seems like a portal into fully generated content, 0 applications. So exciting. Will it also be promptable at some point? reply blixt 8 hours agoprevSuper cool, and really nice to see the continuous rapid progress of these models! I have to wonder how long-term state (building a base and coming back later) as well as potentially guided state (e.g. game rules that are enforced in traditional code, or multiplayer, or loading saved games, etc) will work. It's probably not by just extending the context window or making the model larger, though that will of course help, because fundamentally external state and memory/simulation are two different things (right?). Either way it seems natural that these models will soon be used for goal-oriented imagination of a task – e.g. imagine a computer agent that needs to find a particular image on a computer, it would continuously imagine the path between what it currently sees and its desired state, and unlike this model which takes user input, it would imagine that too. In some ways, to the best of my understanding, this already happens with some robot control networks, except without pixels. reply aithrowawaycomm 5 hours agoparentThere's not even the slightest hint of state in this demo: if you hold \"turn left\" for a full rotation you don't end up where you started. After a few rotations the details disappear and you're left in the middle of a blank ocean. There's no way this tech will ever make a playable version of Mario, let alone Minecraft. reply blixt 5 hours agorootparentThere's plenty of evidence of state, just a very short-term memory. Examples: - The inventory bar is mostly consistent throughout the play - State transitions in response to key presses - Block breakage over time is mostly consistent - Toggling doors / hatches works as expected - Jumping progresses with correct physics Turning around and seeing approximately the same thing you saw a minute ago is probably just a matter of extending a context window, but it will inherently have limits when you get to the scale of an entire world even if we somehow can make context windows have excellent compression of redundant data (which would greatly help LLM transformers too). And I guess what I'm mostly wondering about is how would you synchronize this state with a ground truth so that it can be shared between different instances of the agent, or other non-agent entities. And again, I think it's important to remember games are just great for training this type of technology, but it's probably more useful in non-game fields such as computer automation, robot control, etc. reply naed90 40 minutes agorootparentHey, developer of Oasis here! You are very correct. Here are a few points: 1. We trained the model on a context window of even 30 sec. What's the problem? It barely pays any attention to frames beyond the past few ones. This certainly makes sense as it's a question of the loss function of the model during training. We are running now many different training runs to experiment with a better loss func (and datamix) to solve this issue. You'll see newer versions soon! 2. In the long term, we believe the \"ultimate\" solution is 2 models: 1 model that maintains game state + 1 model that turns that state into pixel. Think of it as having the first model be something resembling more of an LLM that gets the current state + user action and produces the new state, and then the second model being a diffusion model that takes from this state and maps to pixels. This would win the best of both worlds. reply throwaway314155 7 minutes agorootparentThis stuff is all fascinating to me from a computer vision perspective. I'm curious - if you have a second model tasked with learning just the game state - does that mean you would be using info from the game itself (say, via a mod or with the developer console) as training data? Or is the idea that the model somehow learns the state (and only the state) on its own as it does here? reply bongodongobob 5 hours agorootparentprevNah, it doesn't even track which direction you're looking. Looking straight ahead, walk into some sugar cane so your whole screen is green. Now look up. It thinks you were looking down. reply blixt 4 hours agorootparentI guess it comes down to your definition of state. I'm not saying there's enough state for this to be playable, but there is clearly state and I think it's important to point out how impressive the amount of temporal consistence and coherence this model is capable of, considering not long ago the state of the art here rapidly decohered into completely noisy pixels. reply FeepingCreature 1 hour agorootparentIn other words: there's enough state now that the lack of state stands out. It works well enough for its failures to be notable. reply bongodongobob 46 minutes agorootparentprevI guess if you consider knowing what color the pixels were in the last frame \"state\". That's not a definition anyone would use though. Spinning around and have the world continuously regenerate or looking at the sky and back down regenerating randomly is the opposite of state.

Curious to see if we continue to generate environments in this level or move more to generating the physics reply gessha 1 hour agoprevI find this extremely disappointing. A diffusion transformer trained on Minecraft frames and accelerated on an ASIC... Okay? From the demo(that doesn't work on Firefox) you can see that it's overfit to the training set and it doesn't have a consistent state transition. If you define it as a Markov decision process with states being images, actions being keyboard/mouse inputs, the probability transition being the transformer model, the model is a very poor one. Turning the mouse around shouldn't result in a completely different world, it should result in the exact same point of space from different camera orientation. You can fake it by fudging with the training data and augmenting with walking a bit, doing a 360 camera rotation and continuing the exploration but that will just overfit to that specific seed. The page says their ASICs model inference supports 60+ players. Where are they shown playing together? What's the point of touting multiplayer performance when realistically, the poor state transition will mean those 60+ players are playing single player DeepDream Minecraft? reply xyzal 4 hours agoprevMaybe we should train models on Mario games to make Nintendo fight for the \"Good Cause\". reply vannevar 5 hours agoprevIf anyone has ever read Tad Williams' Otherland series, this is basically the core idea. \"The dream that is dreaming us.\" reply brap 7 hours agoprevWaiting line is too long so I gave up.

Why is that interesting? It's a new interface for communication between humans and machines. It's like why LLMs are interesting for chat, because they provide humans and machines an ability to interact in a way humans are used to (chat) -- here, computers will be able to see the world as we do and show back stuff to us in a way we are used to.

This isn't. I don't want to be negative about someone else's project but I can completely understand why people are underwhelmed by this. What I think will be the real application for AI in gaming isn't creating poorer versions of native code, it will be creating virtual novels that evolve with the player. Where characters are actual AI rather than following a predefined script. Where you, as the player, can change and shape the story as you wish. Think Star Trek Holodeck \"holo-novels\" or MMORPGs but can be played fully offline. Rendering the pixels is possibly the worst application for AI at this stage because AI lacks reliable frame by frame continuity, rendering speed, nor an understanding of basic physics, which are all the bare minimum for any modern games engine. reply dartos 6 hours agorootparentprev> it appears to have a promise of promptable game worlds Is it a world if there’s no permanence? We’ve seen demos like this for a while now (granted not as fast) but the core problem is continuity. (Or some kind of object permanence) It’s a problem for image generators as well. I’d be more interesting if that was any closer to being solved than to have a real time Minecraft screenshot generator. I may have missed it, but I didn’t see anything about prompting.

    "originLink": "https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/what-is-the-point-of-an-online-conference/",
    "originBody": "I've been thinking a lot about this in preparation for the next HYTRADBOI. My experience of online conferences has mostly been underwhelming. They typically borrow the form and structure of an in-person conference without considering whether those still make sense online, and whether the goals of an online conference should even be the same as an in-person conference. The most important function of in-person conferences is meeting people. A regular conference can turn a collection of disparate groups into a community. I've met life-long friends at conferences, but never online, and I don't think online conferences can serve this function well. (You can make friends online, but it tends to happen through repeated interactions in a persistent scene rather than during a single ephemeral event.) Another important function is to keep up to date on developments in your field. This makes more sense in specialized conferences, especially academic ones, where everyone who works in the field will be in one place presenting their latest work. But for a more general conference like HYTRADBOI it's simply not possible to keep up on all the developments in such a wide range of topics. So if we can't fulfill those functions, why have a conference at all? The speakers could have just posted videos on their blogs. The attendees could have spent the day browsing hacker news or reading a textbook. What does an online conference add? the point After mulling this over for a few years I have a couple of answers: Coordination. The speakers put time into preparing their talks knowing that there will be an audience to watch it. The audience takes a day out of their lives knowing that there will be many high-quality talks to watch. Everyone can expect a high density of conversation, because everyone is thinking about the same problems at the same time. Solving coordination problems is under-rated! Distillation. The most experienced and knowledgable experts tend to also be the busiest. Transferring hard-won wisdom to the next generation takes a huge amount of work which few people find the time for. Preparing a short talk and answering questions is probably not as effective as, say, writing a book, but it is very time-efficient. Which means that a small nudge to a busy expert can create a lot of value. And I think this is something we can actually do slightly better than an in-person conference, because the combination of pre-recorded talks, asynchronous chat, and no travel requirements leads to a much smaller investment of time and effort. Serendipity. Often advancements in one field come from borrowing a tool from another. It might be possible to deliberately create the conditions for such happy accidents, by curating a selection of talks that appeal to multiple audiences, and that are aimed at explaining general ideas to outsiders rather than at explaining marginal improvements to existing experts. (Not that the latter isn't important, but it's more useful for a what-is-everyone-in-our-field-up-to kind of conference.) This can work just as well online as in-person, and maybe even better because we can have so many more attendees. Think about those purposes lead me to focus on curating a coherent selection of talks and optimizing for conversation and reach. curation Rather than holding a call for contributions I spent a lot of time reaching out to individual speakers, focusing on: Experts in subjects that are currently poorly documented, who might not otherwise have devoted time to distillation. Solutions that might transfer to a different field, or problems that someone in a different field might have a solution too. Unusual ideas that I want to direct attention to. Chasing serendipity also pushed me towards have more and shorter talks. HYTRADBOI 2022 had 34 ten-minute talks in one day, which went down well: HYTRADBOI is so addictive. I’m just clicking on every talk one-by-one and can’t stop. Lots of interesting material and perfect talk length (10 min each) https://t.co/6B6SUHoES6 — Никита Питонский (@nikitonsky) May 3, 2022 Indeed, it's amazing for learning about a bunch of new things in a short period of time. — Gunnar Morling 🌍 (@gunnarmorling) April 30, 2022 30-40 talks is probably as far as I can push it though. If I add too many more talks I'd need to spread it out over multiple days, which makes it harder for people to take time off to attend. In academic conferences one of the ancillary functions is career progression - you can't get promoted without publishing in a major venue, which typically includes giving a conference talk. Weirdly, this idea has carried over to industrial conferences. Even though giving talks is not actually that relevant to industry career progresssion, we still feel like junior engineers should have the opportunity to give talks. I spent a lot of time thinking back and forth over whether that actually makes sense. In the end I decided to focus only on inviting whoever I thought was the best person to give each talk, which often (but not always) skews towards more experienced speakers. But I'm also holding totally open submissions for lightning talks. I've tried to make the barrier to entry lower than any other conference, to balance out how picky I've been with invited speakers. No need for back-and-forth with abstracts - just upload a talk that is a) vaguely on topic and b) not just a blatant sales pitch for some product, and I'll show it at the conference. conversation There are many platforms that offer all-in-one conference hosting, but the chat tends to be an anaemic little sidebar that has few features (eg no threads) and that disappears once the conference is over. In conferences that use these platforms I've seen much less conversation than in conferences where the chat is the main focus of the UI. In HYTRADBOI 2022 the chat spawned myriad subthreads and continued for several days afterwards as people rolled in and out from various timezones. So for HYTRADBOI 2025 I'm using zulip, which has the best threading UX of any chat I've used, and I'll leave it running indefinitely. Last time I had a channel per track (~18 talks). This was chaotic, and the attendees quickly reorganized themselves into a channel per talk, allowing converations to extend much longer than the timeslot assigned to the talk. With zulip this will work even better, because each channel can contain multiple threads, each of which has it's own unread count and can be subscribed to or muted. Unlike many other conferences, this chat is the main focus of the event. The talks are pre-recorded and are presented as regular videos rather than broadcast live, so attendees can pause, rewind, watch later etc. This increases the number of people who actually see each talk (vs eg missing a talk when you eat lunch) and how much time they have to think about the contents and ask interesting questions. Zulip also has excellent moderation tools, beyond the regular mute/ban/delete options. My favourite is the ability to move messages to a different thread, which is nice for topics where I don't want to shut them down entirely, but I do want to prevent them from derailing an existing conversation. Eg I can move messages to a dedicated rust-vs-c++ thread with opt-in visibiilty, to keep it out of the way of people who are bored of the subject. advantages There are some axes on which an online conference can be more valuable than an in-person conference. I'm trying to lean into these strengths: Accessibility. For example, it's rare to see live transcription for an in-person talk (I've only ever seen this at bangbangcon). But with pre-recorded talks we can transcribe everything ahead of time (and I read and hand-correct all the machine transcriptions so that they are actually useful). This doesn't matter only to people who are deaf or blind, but also to people who aren't fluent in english, or for speakers with a heavy accent, or for people watching in loud environments (I used to watch talks during my commute on the london underground). Affordability. A ticket for SPLASH 2024 cost $545-$980. The venue hotel cost $275 per night. Add flights and food and you might be looking at around $2000 for a single conference. Not to mention the endless hassle of getting a US visitor visa, and maybe being rejected at the border. By comparison, in India the Ministry of Education recently increased the stipend for a junior research fellow to about $450 per month. For HYTRADBOI 2025 the cheapest ticket option is $0. All you need is an internet connection (and maybe a late night or early morning if you're east of UTC).",

(scattered-thoughts.net)129 points by jamii 15 hours agohidepastfavorite94 comments sklivvz1971 7 hours agoI have been speaking at about 50 conferences over the years and I refuse to do online ones. Why? - Conferences are usually not paid, except expenses. In fact the \"compensation\" for a speaker is to be able to travel and attend in person. Maybe for some this is a drawback, for me it's not. - In person conferences allow you to meet and network with other speakers. Online conferences do not (unless you count \"come to our discord\" as networking, I don't) - The value I get from conferences is also interacting with the public and listening to them, outside of the talks. - I also don't really get any of the promotion value for my company, which obviously I represent. In short, I understand they are cheaper to organize but the value is simply not there at all, so I will not speak at them, attend them, or sponsor them. reply johannes1234321 6 hours agoparentFor me giving a talk to a quite camera is also a lot more exhausting. Got to make sure I remain in focus of the cam, hope the audio works and get no feedback (did the joke work? Am I too fast or too slow?) And not being there also has the consequence that I do other things on the day and it's a lot more \"in between\" than focus. All that, I assume, also reflects to the experience for the audience. reply hinkley 54 minutes agorootparentI’ve only stood in front of more than a dozen people twice outside of college, and it’s definitely a vibe. At a conference or even just a presentation you get up that morning and you focus differently. You travel to the event and you psych yourself up for it. You mull over your talking points and lock them down more. Less extemporaneous speaking. I have never put that sort of energy and focus into a video call. reply tombert 2 hours agorootparentprev> did the joke work? Am I too fast or too slow? I gave a remote talk a bit earlier this year, and that was the hardest part for me. I didn't quite realize how much I adjusted my speaking based on how the room is reacting. Sometimes my sarcastic humor doesn't land, or it would have landed but I talk way too fast, or people just can't understand what I'm saying and I can see that by looking at peoples' facial expressions. Probably won't do it again unless there's some kind of emergency. I would have done it in person even this last time, but there was some scheduling conflicts on my end. It's just a lot more fun to do this stuff in person. reply hinkley 50 minutes agorootparentOne of the bigger meetups I used to go to would pull in speakers who used us as practice for a conference talk.

That said, it's not apples to apples. I spend like 60% of my day coding, which of course I can do from pretty much anywhere, and it doesn't really matter if my jokes land. When I do video calls, it's generally in relatively small meetings, and it actually is relatively easy to gauge reactions that way.

The article seems to be written from the standpoint of a conference organiser. Which is quite different than the perspective of a learner. As someone who hasn't attended a single tech conference in my life, yet watched hundreds of recorded talks, I think the point of an online conference is to create an occasion for people to produce high-quality content in their field that others will enjoy watching. I would, of course, prefer that these people created such content regularly, without needing to be prompted by the occasion of a conference, but very few do. reply SoftTalker 4 hours agoparentPerhaps there are some good conferences. I have yet to attend one. By good I mean value gained vs. cost and time spent. A typical conference will for me cost transportation, lodging, and meals for several days, in exchange for sitting through a lot of sessions that are poorly presented by poor or inexperienced public speakers, and one or two good ones where I do pick up a nugget or two of useful information. Generally the talks that are polished and well presented are by speakers who are somewhat well known and are really there to promote their latest book. As an introverted person, the social aspect of conferences is not an appeal. The last conference I attended, I bailed after the opening session on the last day and went to a local gym for a couple of hours, then headed to the airport. That was the best part of the whole experience.

What I realized is that the learning was supposed to come from talking to other people working on similar problems, as opposed to an earth shattering realization from the presentation itself. I remember one year when I compared notes with a few people on authorization approaches because we were getting ready to overhaul our authorization systems, and I found the random discussions very helpful. That said, I still dream about getting to do a stay-conference, analogous to a stay-cation, but for learning. reply alibarber 2 hours agorootparentWise words from my PhD supervisor (paraphrased): \"The presentation is supposed to get them to want to read the paper and talk to you about it\" - or basically, it's not a lecture. reply ghaff 2 hours agorootparentIf you're only going to a conference to attend breakout sessions as if they were lectures, you probably should just stay home. It's one reason I think sessions should generally be shorter; they're to pique your interest in a topic, not be a comprehensive tutorial (unless they're actually structured that way). I totally get that some people don't like the other aspects of conference-going and that's fine. They probably really are better off taking some days at home to read and watch videos. reply ryandrake 3 hours agorootparentprevI've always seen conferences (and other business travel events like trade shows) as 90% social events, 10% learning/business events. They've always struck me as a way for extroverted employees to travel somewhere and goof around / party in a way that was justifiable as a \"business expense.\" If they could go on a golf trip instead and be able to get it through the corporate expense report system, they'd do that instead. reply toast0 3 hours agorootparentprevDepending on where you live/work, there may be conferences you can attend that are local to you. Then you won't need lodging, and transportation is less, and maybe meals, depending on how far away. But, if you're not getting anything from the social aspect, and interactions before and after the talks or in the hallways; then conferences aren't a good use of your time. Mostly the talks get recorded and uploaded and are freely available. Sounds like, for you, spending a day reviewing those later is probably better than spending two or three days attending. But I think you get different presenters for an in-person conference vs a virtual conference vs a periodic video creator. So there's a point to these things even if they don't work for everyone. reply jamii 9 hours agoparentprev> I would, of course, prefer that these people created such content regularly, without needing to be prompted by the occasion of a conference, but very few do. That's more or less the first two points I mentioned - coordination and distillation.

I'm not saying it has to be a live meeting, but videos of execs talking about strategy often make their ideas much clearer than a written text. And live has the big advantage that it cannot be re-recorded, so it's more natural and not as rehearsed as a recorded video. reply vasco 10 hours agorootparentIf a strategy is clearer orally than on paper, something is very wrong.

It is also about trust. Are they presenting it in a way I trust they believe it? Is it just show? reply hnlmorg 10 hours agorootparentprev…or some people just prefer visual interactions to text only formats. This is very true in my case because I’m dyslexic so I ingest context more easily when heard vs when read. For other people, it might just be a personal preference. Just like you have the personal preference to read rather than watch. Arguing that the GP has some major character flaw because of their own personal preference really says more about your own character than it does theirs. reply vasco 9 hours agorootparentI said zero things about the GP. Also it's not personal preference. If you're an executive you need to know how to write properly. Execs rely on oral communication to use their charisma points on you, when you read the plans many times they have nothing to do with what was said or it's much simpler. Same with politicians. reply hnlmorg 2 hours agorootparentA good all hands meeting is about much more than just outlining company strategy. It’s about uniting everyone emotionally as well as academically. The emotional component is an absolutely a critical part. And this is one of the tells for a company that cares about staff moral verses those that don’t. One that care make their all hands about the employees too. reply TeMPOraL 10 hours agorootparentprevIt's not about interactions. Sure, some people prefer or respond better to talk than to reading, or video, etc. But if the execs can't articulate their plan in writing, and can only explain it over words, it's a good indication they don't understand it themselves and it's probably nonsense - for the same reason your exciting, beautiful solution to a programming problem falls apart when you're three lines into writing it down. Turns out, people have only so much working memory, but are good at covering for it with emotions. reply hnlmorg 2 hours agorootparentSure. But when all hands meetings are done well then they aren’t just about communicating company strategy. They’re about the employees too. You’ll see demos from colleagues in different departments who you might not normally work with. And individuals praised for specific wins. A good all hands should be for the staff, not for the execs. And that’s the harder skill execs need to learn: when to stfu and let their staff have screen time. If all hands is done well, it brings the business closer and motivates employees in ways that an email couldn’t. However this is lost on most execs and so all hands often ends up being an ego trip for themselves, and when that happens the thats when things need to be communicated via email. reply spicycode 5 hours agorootparentprevI'm not opposed to video, but if stuff gets lost in the written version that's more a statement on poor exec written communication skills than video being better than text. People ingest info differently, and being able to communicate the same info in multiple ways should be table stakes at that level. reply krageon 5 hours agorootparentprevThe video just gives execs more leverage to use the skills they use every day (people skills) to overwhelm the skills you use every day (charitably either the same skills or some sort of knowledge or physical skill). The more they're comfortable, the worse off you are. Their entire position within the company hinges on being able to exploit you for as much as you're willing to let them get away with, which hinges upon how well they're able to convince you you're worth less than they are (after all, you earn less). Giving them anything is the wrong move. If you think you are getting as much out of the video as they are getting out of you watching them speak, you are wrong. The degree of wrong depends on your affinity with their chosen craft (which is, to be clear, grifting you). reply georgeecollins 1 hour agorootparentprevTell me you don't manage a lot of people without telling me you don't manage a lot of people.

By far the best one of those I've had, so far, is at Functional Conf 2022 online edition (because of you know what), where I ended up hanging out for almost six hours with a bunch of APL nerds discussing APL, Life, The Universe and Everything in one of the \"breakout rooms\" of their conference software. Everybody had their favourite beverages coming to them and were in their favourite jammies at their favourite spot in their home city/country talking about their favourite things and demo-ing their favourite stuff. I do love in-person gatherings and online ones, when done right, both cases. Online can be serendipitous in ways that in person can't (and vice-versa). Next time I get a chance to organise an online conference, I'll steal from Jamie's playbook and invert the model.

In 2024, you also have to compare against podcasts & Youtube. Beyond simply starting your own content channels, there's a speaker circuit for interview format podcasts, who have the audience and logistics already nailed down. Using the author's own criteria: 1. Coordination. Podcasts solve this by fitting into various niches. Audiences self-select by topic pretty effectively. Expert speakers can easily see various proxies for audience: downloads, ratings, subscriptions, comments, etc, and review past guests and topics for matching suitability. Whereas with this conference you really have no idea about the audience size. 2. Distillation. Most podcasts I listen to are an interview between a host and a series of subject matter experts. This format substantially lowers the participation barrier for the expert: hop on a webex and chat for 60 minutes. On YouTube I think there's probably room for an \"invited talks\" format, like a tight ten - fifteen minutes on a topic, without the usual banter. Arguably HYTRADBOI is a concentrated version of that, but none of the videos are findable anywhere other than it's own site, and hasn't really seen traction on HN. Which brings up to... 3. Serendipity. YouTube kinda does this by default, though admittedly watching a KubeCon video is likely to recommend another KubeCon vid that was uploaded at the same time than something from a different tech conf. The author seems to lean heavily on the value of community chat but frankly, annual conference communities are kinda bad at it. Either there's too many people trying to talk to The Expert or not enough and the moderator has to beg for participation. I kinda prefer the discord / slack / IRC 24x7x365 community discussion model, where there's more incentives to help each other out versus the transactional conference window after which you will likely never see these people again. reply jamii 11 hours agoparentI agree with some of this. My experience of tech podcasts though has been that it's often the same old people being interviewed, and that a 60 minute interview is often less interesting than a 10 minute talk where the speaker spent a bunch of time thinking about how to explain a subject. The latter is definitely more work, but I've had no problem finding speakers. Outside of tech, I've seen a few podcasts avoid this pattern. The host of https://podcast.clearerthinking.org/ is really good at picking interesting speakers, preparing questions, ans gently but persistently pushing back when they try to gloss over a weak point in their argument. I'd love to listen to a tech version of that podcast. Not being on youtube might be a mistake. I definitely don't want to use youtube for the conference itself because I don't want attendees to have to sit through ads. But maybe I should mirror to youtube afterwards. I'll think about it. The chat at the last hytradboi was pretty dense. That may have been down to having quite a high ratio of experts in the audience though. I'm not sure if that will continue to be the case. I have mixed experiences with discords. The persistence is much better for community building, but in big discords it's rare to have an actual conversation because everyone is only half paying attention. The ones that do feel interesting are again the ones with a high ratio of experts who are actively engaged in the subject. Or small invite-only discords that also hold regular mini-confs, which is maybe a kind of sweet spot. I'm definitely not tied to running a conference. Last time was kind of a whim, but people enjoyed it and wanted to do it again. So this post is less an argument in favor of conferences and more me trying to figure out what I accidentally did right so I can do more of it. reply jldugger 1 hour agorootparent> I definitely don't want to use youtube for the conference itself because I don't want attendees to have to sit through ads. Does Youtube show ads if you disable monetization?

Often faculty from even developed countries do not have budgets to travel for conferences. For example, one professor from Italy told me that he had a travel budget of €400 per year. That would not even pay his conference registration for most conferences. The visa issue mentioned in the article is also quite real. Although the US visa is more difficult to get, it is usually for five to ten years for the citizens of most countries. In contrast, most European countries will issue Schengen visas for the duration of the conference! Online conferences avoid all these issues. reply tkgally 5 hours agoparentprevThat was my reaction back in 2020, too. It was exciting to meet and talk with people from many different countries without leaving home.

Meeting authors face to face and having conversations. Winding up at the diner with people you only just met. Any of those things from sf cons that tech cons don't have, that's unfortunate, but the principle still holds. None of that exists via zoom.

For every speaker the VR environment changed and you saw products and even avatars synced in 3D. So there was this attraction to the VR experience. reply dustedcodes 9 hours agoprevAs an attendee I can say that online conferences make absolutely no sense at all and I don't know a single co-worker or dev who actually likes them. Here are some of the reasons why online conferences are extremely shit: - Live streams often don't work reliably - If live streams work they have other issues, which make it pointless, like having the speaker in view but not the slides they share, so you don't see what they talk about, or they have zoom issues, or they have issues with the angle of the camera, or audio sync issues - Many online conferences use weird never-heard of software, which never works for all participants, have unintuitive UIs and chat functionalities, etc. - Zero community vibes - Despite it being online they still impose maximum limits on how many people can view a single session, like WTF? Unlike with a real conference where you just have to show up 5 minutes early to a talk you find yourself unable to view the online talk you wanted to see unless you start queueing in the virtual queue an hour or longer in advance - 0 networking opportunity, which is the main reason why people go to conferences - Tickets are still expensive even though you only get 1% value of the in-person equivalent and that 1% is still shit Overall online conferences are a complete waste of time and I will never attend one again. Most speakers don't give a complete new talk at big conferences either, so every single talk that people give were already given at smaller conferences, or tech meetups and you can find almost every talk on YouTube in a much better more convenient format so really the value of the online conference is near ZERO. Networking is the main reason and that is non existent online. Just my 2 cents reply eatonphil 7 hours agoparentFolks who run conferences like hytradboi and p99 were likely not going to run any in person conference at all.

I don't see how that's better personally. If you don't like online conferences that's totally cool. I think Jamie addressed most of your points too.

    "originLink": "https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/10/4.html",
    "originBody": "Previous: Apple rejected my Vision Pro app update Articles index Jeff Johnson (My apps, PayPal.Me, Mastodon) Apple silently uploads your passwords and keeps them October 31 2024 This is a follow-up to my blog post macOS Sonoma silently enabled iCloud Keychain despite my precautions from five months ago. The TL;DR of that blog post is that when you have iCloud enabled but not iCloud Keychain, updating from Ventura to Sonoma causes iCloud Keychain to be silently enabled. (I don't know yet whether that still occurs when updating from Sonoma to Sequoia.) What I didn't realize at the time, indeed didn't realize until now, is that iCloud Keychain already uploaded all of my passwords and kept them in iCloud even after I disabled iCloud Keychain. Let me start with some background. My main machine with all of my personal data including passwords is a MacBook Pro, which is still running Sonoma. It's logged into iCloud, but I don't use iCloud for anything personal. The only reason I enable iCloud is to work on sync features in my apps for my customers. Also for development purposes, I have an iPad and a Mac mini with macOS Big Sur through Sequoia installed on separate APFS volumes. Both devices are used only for software testing and contain no personal data. Finally, I have an iPhone, which I've never actually logged into iCloud. Today I was shocked to discover a bunch of my website passwords in Safari while booted into Sequoia on the Mac mini. There shouldn't be any personal data on the mini, and iCloud Keychain is disabled in its Sequoia volume. Incidentally, the reason I was looking at Safari passwords on the Mac mini is that I noticed on the MacBook Pro that Allow Automatic Passkey Upgrades was automatically, silently enabled in Safari, and I wanted to check whether that was also true on other devices. I looked around on other boot volumes on the Mac mini and other devices but didn't find my passwords anywhere else except in Sequoia. I was struggling to determine how my passwords got there when eventually I remembered my old blog post, which allowed me to reconstruct a plausible scenario. The key piece of evidence was that when I opened the Sequoia Passwords app and sorted by date edited, the most recent was May 25, 2024. Coincidentally, my old blog post, written when I updated the MacBook Pro to Sonoma, was on May 26, 2024. There aren't any more recent passwords on the Mac mini, yet there are more recent passwords on the MacBook Pro. Hence, my assumption about what happened is that when I updated the MacBook Pro to Sonoma, iCloud Keychain got silently enabled, and all of my passwords quickly got uploaded to iCloud, before I could disable it. When I disabled iCloud Keychain on the MacBook Pro, my passwords did not get removed from Apple's servers. They've been sitting up in iCloud all along. But I had no way of knowing that, because iCloud Keychain is not enabled on any of my devices. The only way to see the contents of iCloud Keychain is on an Apple device with iCloud Keychain enabled. You can't even see anything on the icloud.com website. WWDC 2024 was in June, the month after I updated the MacBook Pro to Sonoma. I installed the new Sequoia beta on the Mac mini and signed into iCloud. When I signed into iCloud for the first time, Sequoia must have automatically enabled iCloud Keychain, which caused my already synced passwords to be downloaded. These are what I see now in Safari and the Passwords app. Once again, when I disabled iCloud Keychain in Sequoia back in June, that didn't remove the passwords from either the Mac or from iCloud. The question is, how do you delete all data from iCloud Keychain? I found an old Apple support document from 2021 with the Wayback Machine: What happens when I turn off iCloud Keychain on a device? When you turn off iCloud Keychain for a device, you're asked to keep or delete the passwords and credit card information that you saved. If you choose to keep the information, it isn't deleted or updated when you make changes on other devices. If you don't choose to keep the information on at least one device, your Keychain data will be deleted from your device and the iCloud servers. However, the URL https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085 now redirects to https://support.apple.com/en-us/109016, which says nothing about deleting keychain data from iCloud servers: If you turn off iCloud Keychain When you turn off iCloud Keychain, password, passkey, and credit card information is stored locally on your device. When you sign out of iCloud on your device while iCloud Keychain is turned on, you're asked to keep or delete your Keychain information. If you choose to keep the information, your passwords and passkeys are stored locally on your device, but aren't deleted or updated when you make changes on other devices. If you don't keep the information, your passwords and passkeys aren't available on your device. An encrypted copy of your Keychain data is kept on iCloud servers. If you turn iCloud Keychain back on, your passwords and passkeys will sync to your device again. Apparently Apple now just keeps your iCloud Keychain data forever, whether you want them to or not? I didn't even want Apple to have my keychain data in the first place! As a workaround, I manually deleted all of my passwords in the Passwords app in Sequoia, enabled iCloud Keychain, and then disabled iCloud Keychain again. To verify the password deletion, I booted into Sonoma on the Mac mini and enabled iCloud Keychain there. Fortunately, no passwords were downloaded from iCloud. (As I mentioned in my old blog post, Sonoma System Settings still has the bug where it hangs and crashes when you disable iCloud Keychain. Apple software quality on exhibition.) I'm still concerned about other data that may still be in iCloud Keychain. For example, what about wifi passwords? I can't very well delete my wifi password on the Mac mini and then sync the deletion to iCloud Keychain, because of course I can't sync anything without wifi! And what else does iCloud Keychain store that I can't necessarily see in the user interface? Hopefully nothing else… By the way, after I published my old blog post about iCloud Keychain, I did ultimately find a solution to prevent iCloud Keychain from ever getting silently enabled: use a MDM profile.

The good news is that the device is owned by me and under my control. However, since it's just a test machine with no personal data—or so I believed—it's less protected than my other devices. For example, it has a weak login password, no Filevault, and no biometrics (Mac mini). In general, the presence of my passwords in the cloud is an unwanted and unnecessary liability for me. I understand that for other people, cloud storage is a benefit, and I don't wish to deprive them of that choice.

You can't even see anything on the icloud.com website. FYI this is because of all contents of iCloud Keychain are end-to-end encrypted, such that only your devices are able to decrypt the data. Apple’s servers do not have access to the contents of a user’s iCloud Keychain. You might find this article interesting: https://support.apple.com/guide/security/icloud-keychain-sec...

If you sign into any Google property, the browser will use that auth to log you in. Firefox does not, but it sure prompts the hell out of you to do so. reply lapcat 3 hours agorootparentIn Chrome Settings, You and Google, Sync and Google services, there's a toggle \"Allow Chrome sign-in\", which says \"By turning this off, you can sign in to Google sites like Gmail without signing in to Chrome\". reply falcolas 3 hours agorootparentSure. But it's on by default, isn't it? Just like Apple's upload is on by default. Also, chromebooks require such a sign-in as well, and I'll bet they enable that syncing by default as well. Singling out Apple here is kinda silly when they're encrypted (if you don't trust Apple to tell the truth there, running their OS at all is risky), and when the behavior is that which we'd expect. And at the end of the day, using Apple's password manager is mostly (exceptions including wifi passwords) optional. reply lapcat 3 hours agorootparent> Just like Apple's upload is on by default. The blog post is about how it was off and then got silently toggled on. > Singling out Apple here I'm not a journalist covering tech companies.

Does it matter tho. Like in general internet, once something is posted, it will not disappear with certainty. We can never be certain that there is a copy of the encrypted password on some log file when we have no visibility into that sytem. Since it is encrypted, it passes the regulation checks. That is just a UI bug if passwords keep coming back in the cloud/you still see them. Unless there is a system in place that can transparently verify that indeed, the passwords are deleted, does it matter? reply Gud 5 hours agorootparentSorry, this is false.

Why can’t the default state be that I can trust my vendors of software not to gobble up my most private information? OpenBSD has never sent my passwords to Theo’s basement. I trust them without regulations. But more importantly, there’s a crew of capable hackers dissecting the code. reply nicce 1 hour agorootparentI would like that default, but otherwise it is a bit silly assumption. 1. You can't demand something that cannot be enforced/monitored 2. You can't enforce/ push monitoring if there is no regulation in place, and systems are not transparent. 3. Enforcement/monitoring does not matter if there is no stick (fines) present In the case of OpenBSD, you are using open system that you can verify your self. That alone makes them less likely to do something malicious (since they might get caught more likely!) and changes the trust. There is no financial carrot to make Apple products visible, as most of the users don't understand a thing about the technology and marketing might be more efficient than opening technology, which might result in intellectual property theft and lose of market position. Since everything cannot be transparent in a competitive and commercial world, I think it would be okay to put at least 10 times bigger fines for those who do not have transparent systems and get caught on not following the regulations to get some balance. reply Gud 48 minutes agorootparentThat there isn’t an open, mobile hardware platform is a failure of the community, in my opinion.. although some have the right ideas, framework as an example of an open laptop platform. We desperately need a free hard- & software (*nix) mobile platform, that is not exclusively owned by a for profit mega corporation and somewhat mainstream amongst the hacker community. Even better would be competing systems. I imagine these systems to have a high degree of modularity, incl. battery, and memory upgrades. This is not an easy undertaking. I don’t think regulating the megacorps is the answer.

This is a pretty lame windmill to tilt at. reply nicce 6 hours agorootparentI think you misunderstood my comment. It is essentially about the trust. You either trust that they don't misuse the cloud-uploaded passwords or not. If you cannot trust that, you cannot trust the whole ecosystem as the same entity controls it and can misuse it in any imaginable way. So essentially, the issue of deletion is just about the visibility in the UI, if we trust their claim about the end-to-end encryption. reply krageon 6 hours agorootparentprevThe only person guaranteeing this is the case and will stay the case is the person keeping your passwords.

They really want to avoid the risk from anyone inside the company having access to your passwords and then doing anything with them. reply Sindisil 5 hours agorootparentIndeed, companies are not people. Compare the consequences for a large company vs an individual. For the individual, if caught, a debilitating fine and, depending upon damages, jail time. Probable end of career, if related. In short, life changing. For the company, possible fine almost certainly less than the revenue made. Small chance of larger civil suits, with legal costs and possible judgments. Depending upon visibility, perhaps some additional PR spend. Even if the sum total cost is greater than the associated revenue, those costs can be used to offset tax liability.

The big question here is whether there’s a reproducible way that the opt-in changes. iCloud Keychain has robust end to end encryption but it still needs to inform the user. reply hello0904 6 hours agoparentprevWell, the real problem is iCloud Keychain is essentially a \"black box\" system. Apple does use AES encryption in various parts of their security architecture, as documented in their security white papers. But we can't confirm the specific implementation details for iCloud Keychain. And you should also know... Best practices for password storage use one-way hash functions (like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2). reply chrisBob 6 hours agorootparent> Best practices for password storage use one-way hash functions (like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2) rather than encryption algorithms like AES. That is true if you are running a service that USES passwords. In that case you just need to confirm they match. That is not true if you are running a password manager where the user needs to be able to get their plain text password back out of the system. reply nicce 6 hours agorootparentprevThe whole OS is a blackbox. We trust that keyloggers are not everywhere. We need to trust completely or not at all. I think there is nothing between when the same vendor also supplying the underlying closed-source OS. reply hello0904 6 hours agorootparentAgreed. But we are talking encryption and why there isn't open source algorithms for iCloud. I find it funny as when you submit iOS apps to the App Store they specifically require encryption standards and no \"roll your own algos/cryptos\" but at the same time all their crypto is a black box. I'm a happy Apple user, love the OS...just saying. reply lapcat 6 hours agorootparent> when you submit iOS apps to the App Store they specifically require encryption standards and no \"roll your own algos/cryptos\" This is not true. reply threeseed 6 hours agorootparentprevKeychain is documented here and is encrypted using AES-256-GCM: https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/security/secb0694df1a/... It’s then stored in iCloud as a SQLite file and encrypted as it does for your other synced data. reply Veen 10 hours agoprevThis may be annoying, but it’s uploading encrypted versions of passwords, not passwords themselves. Keychain is end-to-end encrypted so no one else can read them. reply kevincox 8 hours agoparentEnd-to-end encrypted but Apple issues the keys when you log in and I don't think they offer any way to require explicit verification of new devices. reply mabedan 7 hours agorootparentWhen importing the passwords into a new devices you’re required to enter the device password of whatever device created the password initially. Still no proof that there’s no back door, but as far as the system on the surface goes, it does make sense. reply kevincox 7 hours agorootparentOh, I didn't notice that.

Next time you insult someone, better use your cognition powers to avoid looking like that which you call others reply threeseed 5 hours agorootparentprevNote that you have to break 3 independent levels of AES encryption. One for password key column, one for value column and one for the password file. reply hello0904 6 hours agorootparentprevBest practices for password storage use one-way hash functions (like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2) rather than encryption algorithms like AES. AES is not one way and in theory you can generate 2nd, 3rd, etc. master keys to decrypt. :) reply ethangk 6 hours agorootparentThat’s relevant when storing a users password to verify that they’ve entered the correct data, but password managers (which Keychain effectively is, I believe) need to be able to retrieve the original password reply hello0904 6 hours agorootparentFrankly, you're confusing hashing algorithms, encryption and \"IDs\". Authentication: \"Prove you are you\" (hash functions) Secure Storage: \"Keep this secret but let me get it back later\" (encryption) Identification: \"Track who/what this is\" (UUIDs/tokens) reply stouset 6 hours agorootparentYou are deeply confused as to how password managers work. Password managers—all password managers—require stored passwords to be encrypted such that they can be decrypted. Otherwise they would have no possibly way to retrieve the stored secret for the sake of submitting it to the verifying party. Best practice for verifiers is to use a one-way memory-hard password hash. Keychain is a password manager. reply ziddoap 6 hours agorootparentprev>Secure Storage: \"Keep this secret but let me get it back later\" (encryption) This is what keychain does. You retrieve the passwords later. So, no. It is not a one-way hash function as you stated. reply kstrauser 4 hours agorootparentprevA thought experiment: Use Argon2 to hash a password before storing it in the password manager. Now the user visits that website and wants to log in. What is it that the password manager pastes into the login form? Answer: the plaintext password. But how do you get that out of the hashed value you stored earlier? You don’t. Ergo, password managers cannot use hashing functions to store their contents. reply Veen 9 hours agorootparentprevThey say they can’t, but it’s impossible to be certain.

More insight is at the discussion on https://www.cableforum.uk/board/showthread.php?p=34430700 Briefly, when implementing file moving in (closed source) Finder code, someone at Apple who was apparently a beginner programmer or student intern made an elementary error that reliably destroyed files. The system already had a battle-tested mv command in its BSD subsystem, but they didn’t use that code. The point of this story (and, yes, there is a large handful of similar stories) is what it tells you about Apple’s culture and practices around testing, care, and concern for real soundness and quality (as opposed to appearance). reply acdha 1 hour agorootparentSo you’re saying that having a data loss condition 17 years ago which only affected a subset of users who lost their storage connection in the middle of a move operation tells us something about their products today? Does that also mean that I shouldn’t use Linux because ReiserFS lost data on local storage in some cases back then, or btrfs did so more recently? What policy are you saying we should use to evaluate software? In particular, what’s left if we’re saying it’s no longer good enough to have learned from mistakes? I supported a lab full of computational scientists who heavily used their Macs with external storage at that time and this caused no problems for anyone, so I also am looking for something more quantitative like whether a bug which only affected handful of users disqualifies usage for everyone. reply Klonoar 2 hours agorootparentprevSomething from almost 20 years ago doesn’t quite work the way you think it does.

So an encrypted password is not a password. An encrypted password is a string resulting from the application of an encryption algorithm and a key to a password. Uploading that string is not uploading the password. The fact that Apple's software can access the keys stored on the device to decrypt the password after you securely authenticate is neither here nor there. reply betimsl 6 hours agoprev [–] They probably encrypt the export with some kind of hash that is then securely transported to the new machine, decrypt it and import.

    "originBody": "Org Mode Syntax Cheat Sheet I’m a keen user of Emacs and Org mode for a variety of tasks, including note taking, generating documents for exporting to LaTeX, Word, or html. creating blog posts (notably for this blog, using Org2blog). Although Org mode is usually associated with Emacs, it is a markup language in its own right, and one that is far more powerful and more standardized than the Markdown language. I recently came across the excellent blog post Org-Mode Is One of the Most Reasonable Markup Language to Use for Text by Org enthusiast Karl Voit. In the post he includes a simple example displaying some of the most important aspects of Org syntax. I was struck by how much information can be conveyed in a short piece of Org code. I have adapted Karl’s example into this longer version: #+TITLE: Org Mode Syntax Cheat Sheet #+OPTIONS: toc:nil # Adapted from http://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/ * Top Level Heading ** Second Level Heading *** Third Level Heading # A comment line.

Enclose any term or phrase in >>, hit C-c C-c on it, and then any previous or further instance of it in the same buffer will be automatically linked to it from then on. Incredibly useful when you're wroting notes on a long book for example and want to keep track of the instance when a term was defined. Turns an org file into its own wiki. https://orgmode.org/manual/Radio-Targets.html reply setopt 7 hours agoparentIf you’re into this, you might also want to look at Howm-mode which offers such “comefrom links” also between files and it works well with Org-mode: https://github.com/kaorahi/howm reply jgoodhcg 7 hours agoparentprevThis is amazing. If anyone likes this kind of functionality and doesn’t mind expanding beyond vanilla org mode I recommend org-roam. https://www.orgroam.com/ Roam Research, what it’s based on, might also be of interest. reply setopt 4 hours agorootparentSee also Logseq, which is an open-source privacy-centric offline-first plaintext-based reimplementation of the UI/UX of Roam Research. The main author is an Emacs user, so obviously a lot of Org-mode influence too, and Org is a supported format. Basically, think Org Roam, just with Electron instead of Emacs. reply sli 5 hours agoparentprevThis is amusing to read because I just started learning org-mode the other day and ran into these immediately while trying to figure out how to link to a bulletpoint in a list later in the document (couldn't figure it out but it ended up being unnecessary in the end, so... progress). reply phforms 4 hours agorootparentTo quickly link to bullet points, just use [[*My bullet point]] (if you omit the *, it may still work but Org also finds non-heading elements like table names with the same text). Personally, I like to create custom ids for bullet points so that I can easily change the text in the bullet point later without breaking my links: * My bullet point :PROPERTIES: :CUSTOM_ID: foo :END: This is easier with C-c C-x p (org-set-property). Elsewhere, I can just write [[#foo]] to create a link to that bullet. reply budzynski 8 hours agoparentprevHi, the docs are quite brief about this. Would ratio targets allow you to create a link to a website to the word >> would always lead to a corresponding link? Do you have an example of radio targets? reply tetris11 8 hours agorootparentIt's more of a glosssary. My Glossary: - >>: Smart guy, gets bullied a lot Nelson Muntz - >>: Troubled guy, does a lot of bullying to Martin Prince. Watching the Simpsons, Martin Prince seems to get into a lot of altercations with Nelson Munz. Any reference of \"Martin Prince\" or \"Nelson Muntz\" will be highlighted (YES, even in the definitions themselves) due to the radio targets in the document (you may have C-c C-c the target first to initialise it). You can click on that highlighted text to jump to where it was first defined. reply nanna 7 hours agorootparentprevNo, that wouldn't work. Radio Targets are intended for the precise repetitions of the same characters. If you surround a regular org link in three angle brackets, eg >>, then the Radio link will clobber the web link on the target itself (ie C-c C-o won't take you anywhere), and it will only highlight repetitions of [[https://www.bbc.com][bbc]] rather than just bbc. For something similar to what you're asking, I would just go for something like... The >> ([[https://www.bbc.com][site]]) is the UK's state broadcasting company. Now when I write bbc (or BBC) these will be highlighted as links and will take you back to the Radio Target in the first sentence and I can then click on the link Also note that you can mark a word or region and then hit C-c n r (org-insert-radio-target-brackets) to surround it in angle brackets and enable it as a radio target. reply phforms 6 hours agorootparentI couldn’t find the command you mentioned “org-insert-radio-target-brackets” in my Emacs and it doesn’t appear to be in the manual[1] either. But of course it is very trivial to write, in case anyone else needs this: (defun org-insert-radio-target-brackets (start end) \"Wraps a region with angular brackets to create a radio target.\" (interactive \"r\") (save-excursion (goto-char end) (insert \">>>\") (goto-char start) (insert \">>) and then find and update all radio targets\" (interactive) (progn (insert-pair arg \">>\") (org-update-radio-target-regexp))) reply phforms 44 minutes agorootparentGood idea to update the radio targets along with the wrapping. Also, I didn’t know `insert-pair` exists, could have saved me some typing. :) reply canistel 14 hours agoprevIf there is one tool (if I can call it that) that changed my life, it is Org Mode. I was a Vim guy who in a desperate attempt to get digitally organised was forced to give Org Mode a try and got sucked into Emacs. I now live better organised, with far less anxiety and remain unfazed at the multi-tasking demands of the corporate world, all thanks to this major mode. reply noufalibrahim 12 hours agoparentI've been an Emacs user since 2000 or so. Got introduced to org when it first came out and it (along with ledger for accounts) have taken over my life. The phone did make it a little challenging but before that I used a notebook and dumped it into org at the end of the day. I've been doing something similar with my phone now. A lot of people refer to org-mode as the gateway drug for Emacs and it truly is that. reply wild_egg 13 hours agoparentprevI keep hearing anecdotes like this and truly want to give Emacs a shot. Do you use it exclusively on a PC? My big blocker is that a significant portion of my time is on a phone rather than a computer these days and I have to think that all the chording with Emacs would get impossibly cumbersome. Anyone here have a good way to leverage Emacs on the go? reply johnmw 32 minutes agorootparentIt doesn't look like anyone has mentioned Beorg yet? [1] I'm not an org power user (yet), but I find this iphone app works great to quickly add todos, view outlines, see my agenda, etc whilst I am out. I have it synced via Dropbox so when I get back to my desktop everything is waiting to be properly organized. [1] https://www.beorgapp.com/ reply regularfry 9 hours agorootparentprevI've had a stab at this. My requirements are pretty much: - Actual emacs as a client strongly preferred; don't assume anything else can correctly parse org-mode - Sync between Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Android - Don't force me to remember to sync, so `git commit`/`git pull` or `rsync` isn't viable unless it's completely hidden - Don't allow me to overwrite the file if the sync has failed - Work from an ssh terminal The closest I got was `crdt-mode.el`. That gives me real-time updates between connected clients. It needs some UI polish around connecting and disconnecting, but it's nothing unworkable. I can get to it on Android via termux ssh to emacs running in tmux on an always-on raspberry pi in my office. That's just about ok in terms of key chording for most things. You do lose some capabilities. I've contemplated getting a bluetooth keyboard for these situations but obviously that's not usable in a lot of situations you might want to be taking notes in. I got in the habit of using the very top of the file as a dumping-ground for one-liners from mobile because sometimes that was just easier than anything else. If I was feeling particularly keen I might try something in the spacemacs vein to make the key combinations work better on mobile. From memory org-agenda was fine, so I tended to use that as a default view for TODOs. What's annoyingly broken is having Windows in the mix. There's something not quite right about the way `crdt-mode` handles line endings which means updates from Windows mess up the other copies, and given how much org-mode relies on line endings it can completely break whole sections at a time. I ended up using the version running on SSH from Windows too, but there are a couple of chords which Windows Terminal mucks up. That bit's not great. Take Windows out and sshing to a shared terminal emacs instance running in `screen` is worth a try, with the caveat that you will have to rebuild the muscle memory for the chording on mobile. The termux keyboard has a couple of niceties that the default Android one doesn't, without which it would be a complete non-starter. reply canistel 13 hours agorootparentprevI faced this problem too. I am a Linux user personally, but use Windows at work. I am not a phone person, but do use it regularly. I sync org files to phone (using Syncthing) and use Orgzly to access these from Android. Although it is possible to install Emacs in Android as a terminal tool in Termux or even as a GUI tool, you need to connect a keyboard to do something sensible. Long story short, if your phone is your daily driver, Emacs may not be for you as it is keyboard oriented. But if you are a computer person who occasionally uses the phone, there are ways to get by. reply dotancohen 11 hours agorootparentI moved from Orgzly to Orgro. Now updating the files on the phone is exactly like any other note-taking phone application (for better or worse). It's not as good as experience as the Emacs desktop, but no worse than anything else on the phone. reply kreyenborgi 11 hours agorootparentI also use orgro, it's very nice for reading the headings and minor edits. For more complicated edits (date stuff, moving around trees) I use the organice build that works with SyncThing https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/issues/932#issuecomment... Neither are full org mode, but good enough for reading notes and minor edits/captures on the go. reply heehaw 12 hours agorootparentprevI have managed to get org mode working with emacs android port. big help was keyboard designer keyboard. I was able to set C-x and M-x for single touch. And added some keys as per requirements. https://www.keyboarddesigner.com/index.php?page=24 reply TeMPOraL 8 hours agorootparentprev> Although it is possible to install Emacs in Android as a terminal tool in Termux or even as a GUI tool FWIW, it seems Emacs can now be built for Android natively - there seem to be related files and documentation in the main Emacs repo, though I haven't actually built it myself, so I don't know how well it works. reply snthd 6 hours agorootparenthttps://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs... reply e3bc54b2 12 hours agorootparentprevLeader keys + Evil mode make the keybindings pretty much non-issue on mobile. Emacs also has native Android port now, I've found it work quite well. There are apps like orgro[0] that make dealing with org files a pleasure on mobile. That being said, it is not perfect. My ultimate (and imperfect) solution was to acquire a GPD Micro[1]. Now that thing makes up for all shortcomings of mobile devices, not just Emacs :) [0]: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.madlonkay.orgro/ [1]: https://gpd.hk/gpdmicropc reply epakai 11 hours agorootparentWhat sort of software setup do you use on the micro? I have one, but coming from a tiling wm, and Vim I have a hard time imagining using it productively. It is in my sell pile. reply e3bc54b2 11 hours agorootparentSame thing as my main laptop: NixOS + Plasma desktop. I barely see the desktop TBH. It is there just so I have convenient control of peripherals. 99% of my time is in Web browser or Emacsclient or Terminal. On GPD I use the browser even less, because its purpose is to be a lightweight mobile terminal. Graphical Emacs is just superset of terminal one, so it is preferred is all. reply correnos 12 hours agorootparentprevPersonally I use the emacs android port with org-roam, with syncthing for sync to back home. I've got ctrl and meta mapped to volume up and down. I don't know that I'd call it a good way, but it works well enough for me :). reply devsda 11 hours agorootparentprevEmacs org-mode is one of the better organization tools with batteries included. For someone who is disciplined, organized and feels limited by their current tooling, Emacs will probably work great like these anecdotes. If having the discipline itself is a problem then Emacs is probably not the right choice to start with because of the learning curve and the friction due to sub-optimal experience on phone. That said, I do recommend to give it a go. On Android, Orgzly + Syncthing is good enough to get started. reply jgoodhcg 7 hours agorootparentprevI’ve used org mode as a daily driver personally and at work for awhile but ultimately transitioned to Roam Research in part because the mobile experience is better. I still use org mode to write my blog and journal but my knowledge management is all in Roam. reply ews 2 hours agoparentprevorg is absolutely the gateway drug to the whole Emacs ecosystem. I started using org after 16 years on vim and slowly found myself replacing my entire text/code workflow with it. I stopped using vim at all about 5 years ago and I never looked back. reply agumonkey 9 hours agoparentprevI use org mode as simple outline or table but so far the organization part still evades me.. I guess I'm too chaotic still to understand how to make real good use of it. reply tetris11 8 hours agorootparentI've been using Org-Mode for over 10 years. There is no one way. You start off first writing simple outlines, and then you start creating todos, and then maybe you start to look at agendas to organize your todos (note: I rarely do this). The biggest game changer for me was org-roam. It's essentially a database of all my files where I can add snippets or link to other files, or whatnot. The TODO stuff I use a rough general guide of where I am, but I do not strictly adhere to it. Essentially: Make Org-Mode work for you and your mindset, don't feel the need to bend to it. reply agumonkey 7 hours agorootparentI should try roam, it might help with my scattered brain (or maybe it will make it worse :) do you know good videos of people demonstrating their workflow habits ? reply tetris11 7 hours agorootparentI don't know about videos, but here's my general workflow. 1. \"Huh, I wonder at what point SSDs of today are comparable to RAM speeds of yester-year?\" 2. `C-c n c` (create-node) \"ssd_ram_yearly\" (title) 3. (a document spawns) \"\\* SSD vs RAM comparison\" (I give it a better unofficial title) 4. I do googling, drag and drop images into the document (org-download is a must have) 5. Satisfied with the document, I decide to link it to a parent node 6. `C-c n i` (insert node) \"random_thoughts\" 7. If the random_thoughts node exists, it just links, if not, it creates a new document which I can fill out, and then `C-c C-c` to complete it, and then it links back to the ram document. 8. I finally do `C-c C-c` to complete the original ram document. Later on: 1. \"Huh, what was I thinking about again?\" 2. `C-c n f` (find node) \"random_thoughts\" 3. `C-c n l` (show backward links) a new buffer pops up showing all files that link to random_thoughts, and I click on the Ram ssd one. reply agumonkey 4 hours agorootparentGonna try.. it seems well suited to multiple contexts switches reply bananapub 8 hours agorootparentprevit's not very complicated - it's an outliner mashed into an ad-hoc wiki in your editor, and also lets you mark up things as \"tasks\" with optional \"scheduling\". you can just outline things in to it, then when an item congeals enough to become a task,on it to add a TODO tag and now org mode can be an organiser - put it in the agenda agenda, specify a workflow (TODO->PENDING->DONE; TODO->ABANDONED, etc), schedule it, emit it in to an ical file, etc etc. probably the nicest part of org is that you don't pay for things you don't use - using it as a just a nice way of organising bullet points works fine, and then there are a jillion optional features around it. reply agumonkey 7 hours agorootparentOh I've tuned the hell out of it, the issue lies above I guess, cause I keep accumulating tasks in various states, sometimes clocked or not.. and then it's hell to manage cleaning what's what. reply MarkMarine 13 hours agoparentprevI’m a recent convert to emacs, the experience with clojure is just so much better. The best experience I’ve ever had programming with a tool honestly. Org mode is a bit of a mystery to me thus far, collapsible sections are great but could you expand on what is so helpful to you and how you use it? reply canistel 13 hours agorootparentKeep track of all TODOs in one's life. You can create TODO items and schedule them. You tag them (similar to hashtags) too. Now, if I want to see the list to things to be done today (or any day for that matter), Org Mode will generate the agenda for you. You can filter your agenda/TODOs - for example, if you are getting into a call with Team X, you can filter with \"teamx\" to get the list of items marked against the team. You can of course add checklists under tasks (sub items), and notes too. Recurring schedule is supported. Keeping notes. Org Mode doubles up as an Outliner. You can keep hierarchical notes in a single large file. You can mix-in tables (with support for LISP formulae) for tabular data. You can embed images and LaTeX too. You can convert your notes to HTML or Markdown in a jiffy. There are shortcuts for instant note taking. You can archive sections that are no longer required. I have stopped using mindmaps and now rather rely on Org. It can handle tree-structured information very well. As a calendar. You can also add diary-remind reminders. Remember one's wedding anniversary (and Spouse's birthday) to save one's marriage. As with everything in Emacs, configurable and extensible (with ELisp). Almost every method and every variable is Global. This is of course crazy, but the power that this proffers is enormous. I learn something new about Org Mode every now and then. I do not consider myself as a power user, as I am sure there is still much left to be explored. https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/orgcard.pdf reply globular-toast 11 hours agorootparentGood summary. One thing to note about org is it's not opinionated. Even the word \"Todo\" is up to you, in fact you can just tell it a bunch of \"not done\" keywords and a bunch of \"done\" ones. Over the years I've tweaked these. For example I use STARTED for tasks that I've begun but not yet finished, because I hate starting things but but not finishing them. I've set my agenda views to display these right at the top. Similarly I've added more resolutions like DELEGATED. This flexibility means you can bend it to rather odd requirements. For example, in my current job I'm required to track time against project codes, but I have to scale the proportion against the hours I'm contracted for (it's a tax thing, I'm told). Org supports clocking in/out of things. It doesn't know what those things are, they are just items in the outline. So I structure my todos under the project codes then track time against those tasks or just directly to the project. Then I have an agenda view which shows me totals for each project and a column scaling the proportions to the total contracted hours over the period. But you might have completely different requirements. You might want a flat backlog and to \"refile\" tasks into \"sprints\" when they get properly defined then set a deadline on the whole sprint. Org supports it all because it doesn't really care that much. Seeing people struggle with the likes of Jira becomes rather comical. reply vim-guru 10 hours agorootparentprevYou might also like the org-babel features of creating executable code-blocks. You can even mix languages by using the output of one block as the input to another. Welcome to the future of 2012 ;) I made one such document a while back with mostly Clojure, if you want to have a look: https://github.com/dnv-opensource/reagent-flow/ reply sam29681749 7 hours agoparentprevWhat specifically about emacs org mode made you more organised? reply geokon 10 hours agoprevI used Orgmode for years, but I think fundamentally tieing your markup to your editor is kind of a bad sign... I'd be curious to hear counterarguments though. I think the primary reason it's tied is because you sort of can't make standalone ELisp apps (or at least nobody does). Otherwise you'd just have an `org2html` and `org2pdf` application at the command line. Alternatives like Asciidoc are not perfect, esp for literate programming, b/c it's also kinda complex and so it also only has one backend (that's runnable from Clojure through JRuby!). I imagine a simpler multi-backend solution like Djot will be the future most likely. Bloated underspeced markups are on the way out. reply natrys 10 hours agoparentWell if you don't do that, you would only have a lowest common denominator system with none of the advanced features, and the world has enough of those. If I wanted to emulate a fraction of org-mode features I use daily in markdown, I would have to use Obsidian with a bunch of plugins, and we would end up in same boat. I don't know the exact spec situation, but I know that comprehensive parsing libraries in modern non-elisp languages exist. An org-mode contributor has one in Julia[1], another in Dart[2] that powers a Flutter app, and there are many tree-sitter grammar based tools that are useable from neovim (e.g. [3]). The basic org2html or org2pdf CLI needs are already addressed by Pandoc. [1] https://github.com/tecosaur/Org.jl [2] https://github.com/amake/org_parser [3] https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode reply TeMPOraL 8 hours agorootparentThe format/spec isn't really the problem. It's just that parsing and rendering Org Mode files is like parsing and rendering .PSD files - getting your app to open and write PSDs alone does not turn your app into Photoshop; you're still missing 99% of the features. reply natrys 8 hours agorootparentRight but if you implement the rest of the features, you become an org-mode IDE anyway. I don't mean that's a bad thing, syntax is just bare minimum, most usefulness comes from interactive developer experience anyway. I was just addressing the point parent raised that marrying markup with IDE is a bad idea, and that when it comes to syntax org-mode is hardly underspecified compared to other markup languages. Would it be neat to have an alternate complete implementation of org-mode elsewhere? Sure. But unlike say Photoshop, Emacs is already open and extremely hackable. That mitigates most of the reasons you would want to. reply hatmatrix 8 hours agorootparentprevI can't imagine the use cases for parsing org-syntax in Julia - is it for textual analysis? reply kreyenborgi 9 hours agoparentprevWell, there's org-mode plugins for vim and vscode, github displays it just fine, pandoc processes it, there's a syntax specification at https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax-edited.html, a separate clojure implementation at https://github.com/200ok-ch/org-parser using EBNF, several Android and iOS apps. And Emacs has been around long enough that it's likely to keep being around for at least as long (see Lindy Effect). Org is hardly more tied up to the editor than any of the many other formats people use – all of these have more or less complete editor support depending on what features you need (e.g. if you start doing fancy literate programming in markdown, or azathoth forbid, try commenting out lines, you'll find spotty support in at least some of the existing implementations). And if you like the full combination of features that Emacs+Org gives you, you'll be hard pressed to find another environment to replace that, so ... why bother? (OTOH if you only need some minor part, like html export, and you have to work with people already using other formats, then those other formats might be better.) reply hitchdev 10 hours agoparentprev>you sort of can't make standalone ELisp apps (or at least nobody does). Otherwise you'd just have an `org2html` and `org2pdf` application at the command line. Because I don't like emacs and I wanted to lean on command line apps for getting data into and out of my orgzly org-mode electronic brain, I've been doing this by combining orgmode with jinja2 (I do this with a cli app I wrote called 'orji'). I think it's a very powerful combination. I use it to generate latex/html/whatever and short bash scripts which are then run. E.g. * Generate my CV using a latex CV template I found on overleaf that I converted into a jinja2 template. * Send the contents of a TODO note tagged 'sendemail' as an email with a tiny templated bash script. * Create jira ticket with the details of a note. * Generate reveal.js presentations. All from my phone, using orgzly and one big button which runs a single termux script that seeks out TODO notes with labels (e.g. cv/sendemail) that match the scripts in my library (cv.sh / sendemail.sh). jinja2 certainly has the capability to end up creating a huge old mess if you abuse it, especially to generate code, but I find that using it to template tiny 5-6 line bash scripts or a latex or an HTML file hits a sweet spot of usability and flexibility. reply JNRowe 7 hours agorootparentA link to the documentation¹ and repo² to save others a few steps.

Both are true but do not tell the whole story. Org is a plain text application framework built on top of Emacs platform. My favorite is Org Babel (jupyter notebooks on steroids) that can be used for literate programming that you mentioned (reproducible research, devops-y tasks). Publishing is just one of many applications. There are certainly cases where you might want a more specialized tool. reply adityaathalye 10 hours agoparentprevI daily-drive Emacs, and write my website/blog [1] in org-mode, but I use pandoc to compile org to HTML [2]... This choice was critical for me. I did not want my publishing workflow to depend on Emacs! It's true that Emacs is the canonical Org-Mode compiler, but there are many other compilers, including Github pages. If it's typesetting you want, the support is widely available.

I'd be curious to hear counterarguments though. For better or worse, Org Mode is a feature-rich application, and org mode format is markup tied to that application. Using it as general-purpose markup is kind of a nice side effect of it being plaintext, and that even the portable subset is more feature-rich than most markup alternatives. For full compatibility, you'd have to port Org Mode to different editors, in the same way you'd port a native app between OS-es. Org Mode is very much an application that's making full use of its platform's specific features and APIs, except here the platform isn't Windows/Win32 API, but Emacs/Elisp. reply f1shy 7 hours agoparentprevI did many applications, I just did not publish them. It is great when the applications need to generate reports, for that I used org mode and then exported in LaTeX, generating a PDF at the end. reply ipnon 13 hours agoprevMass availability of LLMs has made it much easier to adopt EMACS and Org Mode because you no longer need to read the docs to be a power user. I can ask an LLM how to do literally anything in EMACS and it will either tell me an existing function or show me how to write a new one. This is a feature that I haven’t seen still in the most popular editors.

This seems to be subtle but it results in many misunderstandings and unnecessary discussion issues. To \"solve\" this situation, I tried to coin the term \"Orgdown\" for the syntax alone: https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown/ and https://karl-voit.at/2021/11/27/orgdown/ There are many use-cases to use Orgdown outside of Emacs and there are many tools that support Orgdown already: https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown/-/blob/master/doc/Tool... Although I'm using Orgdown and Org-mode for over a decade, I do think that even with an objective point of view, Orgdown does have its benefits from a syntax definition point of view in comparison to Markdown and other lightweight markup languages (LML): https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/ Oh and btw, the linked cheat-sheet covers only the most basic Orgdown syntax elements. Within the Orgdown concept, I defined misc \"levels\" of syntax elements, starting with OD1: https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown/-/blob/master/doc/Orgd...

    "originBody": "Computer Science > Machine Learning arXiv:2410.23168 (cs) [Submitted on 30 Oct 2024] Title:TokenFormer: Rethinking Transformer Scaling with Tokenized Model Parameters Authors:Haiyang Wang, Yue Fan, Muhammad Ferjad Naeem, Yongqin Xian, Jan Eric Lenssen, Liwei Wang, Federico Tombari, Bernt Schiele View PDF HTML (experimental) Abstract:Transformers have become the predominant architecture in foundation models due to their excellent performance across various domains. However, the substantial cost of scaling these models remains a significant concern. This problem arises primarily from their dependence on a fixed number of parameters within linear projections. When architectural modifications (e.g., channel dimensions) are introduced, the entire model typically requires retraining from scratch. As model sizes continue growing, this strategy results in increasingly high computational costs and becomes unsustainable. To overcome this problem, we introduce TokenFormer, a natively scalable architecture that leverages the attention mechanism not only for computations among input tokens but also for interactions between tokens and model parameters, thereby enhancing architectural flexibility. By treating model parameters as tokens, we replace all the linear projections in Transformers with our token-parameter attention layer, where input tokens act as queries and model parameters as keys and values. This reformulation allows for progressive and efficient scaling without necessitating retraining from scratch. Our model scales from 124M to 1.4B parameters by incrementally adding new key-value parameter pairs, achieving performance comparable to Transformers trained from scratch while greatly reducing training costs.

In other words, they query weight_keys to fetch the weight_values, and mix them to compute each weight on the spot. Increasing model size becomes a matter of adding more weight_keys and weight_values, and incrementally training them. Simple, clever, and it seems to work well. Beautiful. reply szcs 3 hours agoparentThere is a particularly nice geometric interpretation of attention I just realised recently in a flash of enlightenment, best explained with an interactive Desmos plot (black dot is draggable): https://www.desmos.com/calculator/3rtqsyapxo The above assumes the columns of K are normalised but bear with me. K and V together form a vector database. V are the payloads, each row containing a vector of data. K describes the position of these points in space, on the surface of a hypershpere. The query vector describes the query into the database: the vector direction describes the point in space that's being queried, the vector magnitude describes the radius of the query. The result is the weighted average of vectors from V, weighted by their distance from the query vector scaled by the query radius (which has a smooth Gaussian falloff). A recent paper from Nvidia I recommend, which derives a significant speedup by normalising vectors to a hypershpere: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01131v1 reply liuliu 1 hour agorootparentYeah, I believe this intuition first introduced by the Neural Turing Machine line-of-work and later simplified into AIAYN paper (NTM maintains \"external memory\" a.k.a. weight_keys, weight_values here). Disclaimer: these are from my memory, which can be wrong entirely. reply anon291 3 hours agoparentprevI believe there have been studies showing that the attention mechanism allows estimation of gradients for one-shot learning (i.e, based on what you tell the model you want in the input, it will use attention to 'update' the weights of the linear layers to 'learn' new information). This seems to be taking that one step further and just using attention for the weight estimations itself. The key insight here is that by adding more tokens to the weight estimation calculation, you can get more degrees of freedom. Total aside, but imagining how many levels of functions are present in the calculation of each activation here, and thinking about how regular old differentiation and gradient descent actually work to train these nested parameters, is truly amazing, in my opinion. reply cs702 2 hours agorootparentYeah. This thing is \"assembling a different transformer\" on the spot for each token. If one thinks about it for more than a moment, it's kind of incredible that it works. reply 0-_-0 52 minutes agorootparentI think the same about regular neutral networks reply davesque 1 hour agoprevSeems like a big deal. I feel like this could enable a new level of modularity and compatibility between publicly available weight sets, assuming they use similar channel dimensions. Maybe it also provides a nice formalism for thinking about fine tuning, where you could adopt certain heuristics for adding/removing key-value pairs from the Pattention layers. One interesting thing to note: sounds like model scaling happens on the fly by adding key-value pairs as rows in the K and V matrices on the Pattention layer. That suggests that weights represented by tokens in the first rows may be more important than weights in later rows. There may be a lot you could do with that ordering of weights in terms of pruning and such. reply c0g 1 hour agoprevSurprised not to see a comparison to https://paperswithcode.com/paper/augmenting-self-attention-w... reply a_wild_dandan 44 minutes agoprev [–] This could be revolutionary.
