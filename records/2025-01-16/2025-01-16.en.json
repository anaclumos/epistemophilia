The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today. I write this from a place of joy. Building this has been a life’s dream. I did not know at the outset if it would be possible to find a fulfilling path. This wasn’t an easy option, but I was naïve to the danger and felt drawn to it magnetically. When I started this, I doubted I was capable. I didn’t have a traditional finance background. None of my relatives are in this field. I went to a state school. I’m not a slick salesperson. I don’t know any of the right clothes to wear. I can’t play golf. I’m not some superhuman that can function on 4 hours of sleep. In most of my jobs I was a good worker but mostly looked over. I had no money when I started—and after catching 3 lawsuits immediately out of the gate, I quickly had less than no money. I would have failed right at the starting line had it not been for the support of world-class whistleblower lawyer Bryan Wood, who took the cases on despite my lack of financial resources. I had a newborn child and was facing eviction at the time. I was terrified, but knew that if I stayed still I would crumble. The only option I had was to keep moving forward. It is very easy to succumb to negative thoughts and believe what others think of you, especially when things feel low. But it is possible to shatter all of that. I was passionate about this and I let that carry me forward despite my fears and insecurities. And then this slowly started to flourish. One at a time, and without a clear plan, we built a team of 11 incredible people. I hired each of them not because we needed workers, but because when our paths crossed and I could see who they were, I realized it was madness not to bring them on. They are all smart, focused, and fun to work with. Little to no ego. When you meet them, they are all very nice and polite. But when it comes to this field, they are ruthless assassins, capable of world-class work. Like me, our team didn’t come from traditional finance backgrounds. My first hire often describes himself as a former bartender. We all have a shared view of the world, a mostly calm exterior, and a similar burning underlying intensity. They are all family to me. We have all worked extremely hard, with a focus on precision and letting the evidence dictate our words. Sometimes this meant taking big swings and taking on fights that are much bigger than any of us as individuals. Fraud, corruption, and negativity often seem overwhelming. Early on, a sense of justice was usually elusive. When it happened, it was tremendously fulfilling. It kept us going when we needed it. And boy did we have an impact, eventually—more than I imagined was possible at the outset. Nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking. Over time, people began to see what I hoped we could show—that having an impact is possible, no matter who you are. It has also been rather intense, and at times, all-encompassing. I often wake up from my dreams because I’ve thought of a new investigative thread to pull on in my sleep, or an edit that clarifies a point I didn’t realize I was troubled by during the day. Or from the general pressure of it all. We are not fearless—we just have faith in the truth and hope it leads us down the right path. I’m grateful for all of it. We have days of bizarre, hilarious and ridiculous stories and we’ve had a lot of fun amidst the pressure and challenges. It has been the adventure of a lifetime. So, why disband now? There is not one specific thing—no particular threat, no health issue, and no big personal issue. Someone once told me that at a certain point a successful career becomes a selfish act. Early on, I felt I needed to prove some things to myself. I have now finally found some comfort with myself, probably for the first time in my life. I probably could have had it all along had I let myself, but I needed to put myself through a bit of hell first. The intensity and focus has come at the cost of missing a lot of the rest of the world and the people I care about. I now view Hindenburg as a chapter in my life, not a central thing that defines me. Beyond my own desire for relief, it also feels selfish to keep the knowledge we’ve accumulated trapped within our small team. I have more than enough. In the past several years we’ve been flooded with thousands of messages from many of you asking how we do what we do, or whether you can join the team. I read them all and I’ve been trying to figure out how to respond in a way that can answer everyone—so over the next 6 months or so I plan to work on a series of materials and videos to open-source every aspect of our model and how we conduct our investigations. My hope is that after we fully share our process, in a couple years I will get an unsolicited message from someone who reads this (maybe you), who embraces the same passion, learns the craft, and finds the confidence to shed some light on a subject that needs it, despite the obstacles in your way. That would make my day, even if I’m off trying to learn music or planting a garden or whatever I end up doing next. For now, I will be focused on making sure everyone on our team lands where they want to be next. Some are going to start their own research firm, which I will strongly and publicly encourage, even as I will have no personal involvement. There are others on our team who are now free agents—so feel free to reach out to me if you have a need for anyone who is brilliant, focused, and easy to work with, as they all are. It wasn’t always obvious to me, but I now view all of this as a love story. To my wife, you have been so patient with me. It has not been easy, to put it mildly, and I am forever grateful that you have sacrificed so much and pushed forward with me. And now, my dear, we get to enjoy it together for as long as this world will let us. To my family and friends, I’m sorry for the times I have ignored you while I let my attention be drawn away. I can’t wait to have more time to share with you together. Lastly, I want to express how grateful I am to our readers. Your messages of kindness and encouragement through the years have gone a long way to help give us the strength to continue. And it constantly reminds me that the world is filled with good. Thank you for all of it—I couldn’t ask for more. It is all a blessing. With unfathomable levels of gratitude, Nate Anderson (P.S. If you are chasing something you think you want or need, or are doubting whether you are enough, take a minute and give this a listen. It had a big impact on me at a pivotal time.) © 2025 Hindenburg Research. All Rights Reserved · Legal Disclaimer · Privacy Policy · Cookie Policy · Cookie Preferences",

The amount of deceit put out into the world and gobbled up, on purpose, in business is obscene and seriously depressing. The magnitude of damage to psyches and thus economies that anyone acting in a fraudulent manner in finance creates is far-reaching and immeasurable. Punishment for financial crimes should be calculated based on the average lifetime earnings of a citizen -- if your victims are folks earning at or below the average wage, and you've scammed 100 lifetimes worth of average earnings, it's as if you've murdered 100 people. Hindenburg's reports were a true pleasure to read, and their track record proves their positive contribution to society. Many self-important people online are quick to pounce on short sellers as being evil, and that will forever be a serious red flag to me thanks in no small part to Nate Anderson and the folks at Hindenburg Research. reply crayboff 3 hours agoparent> The amount of deceit put out into the world and gobbled up, on purpose, in business is obscene and seriously depressing. In business, politics, everything. It almost seems like everyone is quietly agreeing that \"if we pretend the pesky truth doesn't exist for long enough, we can literally change reality to be what we want\". I feel like I'm going crazy. There's no way that's how things can work for long, right? reply benreesman 1 hour agorootparentBy all accounts it was like this at the end in the USSR too: infinite nepotism, no accountability, crashing standard of living near the median, deaths of despair attached to crazy levels of dangerous substance use. This is what happens when bad people capture the levers of power. https://youtu.be/IUJMyTJ9gyI reply eltondegeneres 26 minutes agorootparentI didn't watch this talk but I read the article it's based on. When an Iraq War supporting Tory like Niall Ferguson criticizes the US military for being both bloated and stretched thin by underfunding, it gives away that the critique is just disingenuous contrarianism. reply ANewFormation 2 hours agorootparentprevYou're not going crazy, they are. But even once things start falling apart, inertia alone can give the appearance of productive movement for years to come. This is probably why when somebody looks to try to find the cause for e.g. the collapse of the Roman Empire there were a surprisingly large number of potentially serious issues all happening simultaneously. The reason is that the empire probably collapsed decades before its fall and so the stupid decisions and actions all continued to pile up, seemingly without consequence. All until the inertia finally ran out and suddenly the entire house of cards came crashing down. reply Herring 30 minutes agorootparentprevIt's not about pretending. Truth is the first casualty of war. If someone is trying to deceive you, they are actively exposing you to some kind of risk, usually for their own benefit, which is a hostile act. reply roymurdock 2 hours agorootparentprevWe've kicked the can down the road for a while, but no worries, we will pick it up soon and recycle it ;) reply WalterBright 15 hours agoparentprev> I've ironically lost more money the more closely I've paid attention to my investments Money Magazine a few years ago compared various investment strategies in stocks. The #2 best performing one was investing in the S&P 500. The #1 best performing strategy was the \"dead man strategy\". The dead man strategy comes into play when the investor dies, and his estate gets frozen until it winds its way through the courts. It turns out that doing nothing with your stock investments is (statistically) the best strategy. I know for a fact that when I do nothing with my stocks, they also perform better. reply Workaccount2 3 hours agorootparentJust yesterday it was announced that Bitfinex will be returned the 95,000 bitcoin that were lost in a 2016 hack. These coins will be returned to the account holders which were affected by the hack. At the time the bitcoins were lost, they were worth ~$575 each. Today those returned tokens are worth close to $100,0000 each. I doubt anyone who was affected by that hack realized they just got involuntarily forced into the best investment of their lives. reply fckgw 2 hours agorootparent> These coins will be returned to the account holders which were affected by the hack. I haven't seen any reporting on that. Bitfinex, the corporate entity, is receiving the coins recovered from the feds. It's up to Bitfinex how they device to dole out those funds, if at all. When these things happen, often times exchanges will make their customers whole by giving back the monetary value of the coins at time of loss. It's very rare they repay them 1:1 in bitcoin. reply ElevenLathe 35 minutes agorootparentIANAL but it seems like whoever is running Bitfinex should endeavour to make all the creditors whole in whatever medium their debt was denominated, according to seniority. So if they owe users X BTC and other creditors Y USD, and the BTC debts are senior, they should hand out the BTC to users regardless of its dollar value and, if there is any left, auction it off for the benefit of the (junior, in this scenario) USD creditors. reply chasebank 2 hours agorootparentprevInteresting part of the story is the hacker who stole them is a YC alumni, he founded mixrank. Kid only got 5 years in prison for stealing $1B. reply graemep 10 hours agorootparentprevDoing nothing saves trading costs which are a major drag. The standard advice for equities investors (at least in the UK) has been to invest in tracker funds for a very long time. it is possible to beat the market. Many years ago I double my money in approx an year - but I invested heavily in I had been covering as a analyst (one of my previous careers) until immediately before. I am more cautious now. reply matwood 10 hours agorootparentTrading fees are at or near zero in the US now unless you mean capital gains. reply WalterBright 52 minutes agorootparentThe explicit fees are near zero, but if you watch your trade you always get an adverse price. reply graemep 9 hours agorootparentprevNot what I meant, but capital gains are another issue, but I am not in the US. In the UK we pay a 0.5% tax on ever transaction and often around £10 per transaction, so its quite substantial. I should probably have said costs, not fees. How much are total costs in the US? If you trade frequently even low costs add up. If its 0.1% and you trade monthly it ends up being 1.2% over the course of an year. reply matwood 8 hours agorootparent10+/trade is going back to the early 2000s for the US. Now it's effectively 0 for most common trades. Here is Schwab for example: https://www.schwab.com/pricing If someone is a big options trader they can probably find a better per contract price out there. reply graemep 7 hours agorootparentHow do they profit? There must be a cost somewhere? Another reply mentioned spreads - still a cost (you lose money when you trade). reply matwood 6 hours agorootparentAUM, managing high wealth clients, running their own funds with expense ratios (also some of the lowest in the industry), uninvested cash, etc... Retail trading is commoditized now. Anyone who really cares about spreads will be using limit orders. Otherwise you're talking about pennies on highly liquid shares. The fact that we're even discussing the possible spread differences between market makers shows just how commoditized retail trading has become. reply thefreeman 5 hours agorootparentprevthe sell order flow to market makers who gobble up the other side of bad retail trades reply xen0 2 hours agorootparentI highly doubt market makers are in the business of betting against retail traders. I suspect they're in the business of collecting the spread on lots of small trades that they can assume are largely random. reply kortilla 38 minutes agorootparentWhat you described is how you bet against retail traders. The bet is that they have no edge so it’s safe to run tight spreads and nice pure market making algos that assume random behavior at volume. reply xen0 12 minutes agorootparentFeels weird to call it a 'bet against' when the other side can (potentially) benefit from the tighter spread you offer. But yes, the market maker doesn't run the risk of trading with someone with knowledge and a lot of capital to apply it. graemep 4 hours agorootparentprevWhich means that your cost is market maker's spreads instead of fees. Still a cost to you. reply kortilla 40 minutes agorootparentNope, this is one of the counterintuitive things about people paying RH for order flow. Market makers can offer tighter spreads when they know it’s a pool of dumb money. reply graemep 21 minutes agorootparenttighter spreads are not zero spreads wil421 8 hours agorootparentprevAll the major US brokers started doing free trades for stocks and etfs. For Vanguard, most of the index expense ratios are really low, like %.05 percent, but that’s not a trading fee. reply AdamN 7 hours agorootparentEven for paid transactions that typically give better pricing (IBKR Pro), the prices are extremely cheap. reply 4ndrewl 7 hours agorootparentprevHow do they make money from you as a customer? reply tim333 6 hours agorootparentQuite a lot of customers either have cash sitting in the account which they make interest on, or have margin debt which they charge for. reply 4ndrewl 6 hours agorootparentInteresting, thanks. For a minute I was expecting someone to say \"ads\" reply jkolio 2 hours agorootparentprevFront-running your trade. reply kortilla 37 minutes agorootparentThis is illegal and is absolutely the dumbest way to make money. reply valkmit 33 minutes agorootparentprevnice try buddy, that’s ILLEGAL reply matwood 6 hours agorootparentprevYou can Google it, but AUM at scale means .03% is a significant amount of money. There's also uninvested cash that the broker can invest in t-bills and take the spread. reply 4ndrewl 6 hours agorootparentThanks for the lmgtfy :) I bet the uninvested cash product drives some weird incentives - kpis around increasing ratio of sells to buys and increasing pain around removing cash. reply ifwinterco 8 hours agorootparentprevYou also pay a spread every time you trade, especially if you're using a retail brokerage like robin hood that sells order flow to market makers. It doesn't show up anywhere in your statement, but it's a real trading fee nonetheless, so it's still better not to trade too much reply kortilla 36 minutes agorootparentRetail is offered tighter spreads because it’s safe to assume they have no edge at scale. reply maest 6 hours agorootparentprevYou pay the spread and you also have impact in the market. reply intuitionist 6 hours agorootparentIf you’re trading US large-cap stocks at low frequency these are not really material costs for even a wealthy retail investor. Certainly not next to taxes. reply kqr 13 hours agorootparentprevA few years ago cost structures for managing one's investment portfolios were also significantly higher than today! There's an even better alternative for someone willing to put in the leg work: (1) Figure out your investment horizon. For many people, this is way shorter than suggested by generic advice, which makes some diversification beyond \"stonks go up\" meaningful. (2) Figure out what costs you'll incur by rebalancing etc. (3) Write a short script that optimises the amount of activity in portfolio management that improves performance over your investment horizon, given your costs. Unsurprisingly, the result can vary a lot between people. The result is most likely going to involve a very low level of activity, but the process of finding it out is very informative. What I've found out (and this is replicated also by more authoritative people like Carver) is that for almost everyone, mixing in some 10--20 % of a safer asset like 10 year bonds and rebalancing yearly outperforms a pure equity portfolio over most realistic investment horizons. reply Galanwe 12 hours agorootparentAgree with you 100%, I did the same simulations and found the same result. I would suggest a step beyond though, because rebalancing your portfolio is fun year 1-5, but not so fun year 5-20: have a look at e.g. Vanguard retirement target funds. Essentially, it's an ETF with a rebalancing rule included for a specific target date. For instance if you buy the target 2050 (your hypothetical retirement age), the ETF rebalances itself between bonds/monetary fund/stocks until it reaches that date, u til it's pretty much all cash in 2050. Lowest hassle diversified retirement scheme I found. reply sgerenser 5 hours agorootparentNope not all cash, it goes down to around 50% stocks at the target date (and actually continues to get slightly more conservative after). Just look at the current portfolio of the Vanguard 2025 fund: https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-fun... reply wil421 8 hours agorootparentprevMy target date 2050 funds have performed 50% less than my S&P 500 and like 30/40% less than my total stock market fund. reply jart 6 hours agorootparentYou mean VFIFX? What a disaster. My retirement plan put me in that until I realized investment advice for young people is a tax on the inexperienced and vulnerable. VFFSX (S&P 500) does 2x better returns every time. I feel guilty saying it on Hacker News. Like pension funds I bet Vanguard is one of these so-called LPs who give money to VCs like Y Combinator to help ivy league kids follow their dreams. Without these heroes I'm not sure there'd be a startup economy. I just don't want to be the one who pays for it. I think the future Wall-E predicted with Buy N' Large is probably closer to the truth. reply ac29 4 hours agorootparent> VFFSX (S&P 500) does 2x better returns every time US large cap has certainly recently outperformed the other parts of the target date fund (international stocks, bonds). But there is certainly no guarantee that it will happen \"every time\". In the last 10 years, US equity has been the best overall performing asset class for the past decade but 7 out of those 10 years at least one other category outperformed it: https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/insights/blackrock-inves... > Like pension funds I bet Vanguard is one of these so-called LPs who give money to VCs like Y Combinator to help ivy league kids follow their dreams. You can look up the holdings of VFIFX or any other Vanguard fund. There is no private equity or private credit. reply kqr 11 hours agorootparentprevThis is one of those things where again, one will have to weigh the costs of both alternatives. A rebalancing ETF usually has higher costs (management fees, but possibly also internal trading costs that show up as performance beneath benchmark index), but of course, manually rebalancing also has a cost – the cost of one's time and effort! reply agos 9 hours agorootparentVanguard's ETFs are really cheap. The retirement funds in question are like 0.24%, which is in the cheaper range for ETFs reply arpinum 8 hours agorootparentprevThere are scenarios where these target date funds are not good. Rebalancing into bonds and mmmfs is a form of insurance against catastrophic losses equities. But if you have a sufficiently large account then catastrophic losses that affect your life are extremely rare, if they do occur they will likely affect your bond portfolio as well, and the expected loss vs 100% equities over 15-20 years is significant, something like 10x the value of the insurance you are buying. If you want insurance for a large account then long-dated put options 20% of the money are much cheaper. reply youngtaff 10 hours agorootparentprevYou still need to be invested in equities at retirement otherwise inflation just eats away at the value of the cash reply sgerenser 4 hours agorootparentThat’s why these target funds go down to ~50% stocks [edit: at the target date] not 0. reply ac29 4 hours agorootparentAt least at Vanguard the final stage of target date funds is ~30% stocks: https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-fun... reply sgerenser 4 hours agorootparentThat fund is currently at 50% stocks. It does get more conservative as you get past the target date, but I was mainly referring to the stock percentage at target date, which the parent poster implied was almost zero. reply tminima 12 hours agorootparentprevI want to learn more about how to rebalance my portfolio. I started with ETFs and MFs and then bought some good stocks when they were low. But I have never rebalanced it. Would you be able to share some resources about it? Also, if possible, some pointers about your script. reply rokkamokka 11 hours agorootparentRebalancing is just selling the high performers and buying the low performers. In his example, you'd keep your \"safe asset\" allocation at say 15% - if your other stocks did well one year, you'd sell some and buy more \"safe assets\" so they again constitute 15% of your total value. If stocks tanked, you'd instead sell some \"safe assets\" and buy more stocks, again until your \"safe assets\" are back at 15% of total value. reply WalterBright 11 hours agorootparent> Rebalancing is just selling the high performers and buying the low performers. Guaranteeing mediocre performance. Not my cup a tea. reply kqr 10 hours agorootparentNot at all -- it uses volatility in one's favour, by cashing out on temporary peaks and buying in on temporary lows. What you describe sounds like a kind of momentum/market cap investing, which is favourable in the short term, but suffers a lot when things go bad. (This is assuming one cannot predict future returns better than the rest of the market. If you do that all the better!) Seems like there's a lot of confusion on this. I'll see if I can get a fuller article up. reply ozim 10 hours agorootparentprevMediocre performance is better than your top performers dropping 30% or 60%. I can point couple companies that suddenly dropped from $90 a share to below $10 and then they never got up “Just eat takeaway.com” between 2018 and 2022 it was looking like they would go to the moon. In 2022 you can see hell of a drop and it is not going back. If you would sell parts of it before 2022 you would lock at least some of the gains. But I think you know better when to switch companies ;) reply WalterBright 47 minutes agorootparentOh, I've had my portfolio drop 90% once. And drop 50% at other times, and 30% drops. It's not easy to suppress the panic. reply sotix 4 hours agorootparentprevI'd be interested in reading more literature (e.g. from Carver) if you have any links! reply kqr 2 hours agorootparentI have only read half of Carver's Smart Portfolios yet but I find myself agreeing with much of it. I have started writing up a review of it sometime soon, although I might not publish it for free in a while! reply tombert 14 hours agorootparentprevThis doesn’t surprise me in the slightest. Most of my investing is just in passive S&P index funds, but I do occasionally buy individual shares. Sometimes I make decent money, sometimes I lose money…turns out I consistently do worse than the S&P long term. I treat buying individual shares as yuppie gambling at this point. It can be fun, but it’s usually a bad strategy. reply Scoundreller 12 hours agorootparent> I treat buying individual shares as yuppie gambling at this point. It can be fun, but it’s usually a bad strategy. Naw, that's boomer gambling. Options are yuppie gambling. reply tonetegeatinst 11 hours agorootparentI thought that was shorting biotech stock days before clinical trial results get announced? reply Koffiepoeder 11 hours agorootparentFor extra flavour, also invest solely using loaned money, preferably a student loan that never goes away! reply fakedang 12 hours agorootparentprev> I treat buying individual shares as yuppie gambling at this point. It can be fun, but it’s usually a bad strategy. I would actually recommend the opposite - buy shares of a few companies that you know exceptionally well. That is, not just the companies, but also the market, the industry trends, etc. Charlie Munger recommends holding 5 stocks at max, while Peter Lynch suggests industries that are tangential to your work and daily life. Both solid advice. Revisit the list every year, and you'll already do better than most of the blind duds investing in the S&P500 (which arguably contains a lot of duds). The problem with most ETFs is that you'll still be investing in a bunch of dud companies, whose only reason for staying in the market is by virtue of being big (think HPs and IBMs, for example). reply Workaccount2 3 hours agorootparentThe problem with ETFs is that many of them have crazy management fees. Don't just blindly buy an ETF that fits your investment goals. Many of those bespoke ETFs have 1%+ management fees. You can look up how even a 1% fee can gobble up piles of money over years. reply tombert 3 hours agorootparentThat's why I am partial to the Vanguard funds. If you look at VUG and VTI and VOO, the fees are on the order of ~0.03-0.04%. I know that passively-managed ETFs aren't necessarily \"optimal\" (as your parent comment mentioned, there's a risk of them having a few duds there for legacy reasons), but I think the value that they provide come down to the fact that they're automatically rebalanced and diversified, and 0.04% seems like a pretty reasonable cut for them doing that for me. reply fakedang 2 hours agorootparentprevI didn't mean buy any ETFs either. I was making the case for individual stock holding, as a response to my parent comment. reply tombert 2 hours agorootparentTo your point though, even Berkshire Hathaway invests in VOO and SPY: https://www.morningstar.com/funds/spy-vs-voo-which-warren-bu... I think there's value in having things diversified and rebalanced automatically, especially if you don't have any confidence in your own ability to do so. Yes, you sometimes get stuff that's overvalued and thus over-represented, but in theory if the stock tanks the portfolio will be rebalanced and thus become a smaller percentage of the total holdings. reply yard2010 6 hours agorootparentprevThis reminds me of that Mythbusters episode in which they test what is the fastest strategy in a traffic jam or congestion - switching lanes or keeping your lane. IIRC the result was that it's the same, but zigzagging makes you feel it's faster reply WalterBright 15 hours agorootparentprevThe conventional wisdom is to sell your profitable stocks, to \"lock in your gains\", and sell your losers to \"cut your losses.\" I call that \"minimizing your gains\" and \"locking in your losses\", and just hold instead. If I \"locked in the gains\" I would have missed out on 10x returns. Of course, I did ride Enron all the way to zero (!), but it didn't matter. Think of it this way - buy 10 stocks. 3 go to zero. 6 have modest returns. 1 is a 10x winner, that more than makes up for the failures, and becomes the tentpole for your assets. reply WalterBright 14 hours agorootparentI have a friend who retired, and decided to go into day trading. He spent hours each day glued to the trading portal, making trades. After a year, he ruefully admitted that he'd have made significantly more money if he'd simply done nothing. reply jpcom 14 hours agorootparentSometimes I ask GPT to run Bayesian analyses on varying hypotheses. I just did that for the several parent comments to see if we could get some reasons as to \"why day trading doesn't work.\" Perhaps this will amuse you as well: https://chatgpt.com/share/67888cf4-1aa4-8011-b46b-77e5e9da12... reply semi-extrinsic 13 hours agorootparentIs there any reason to believe the probabilities involved in those computations are not just coming straight out of rand()? reply WalterBright 14 hours agorootparentprevYes, thanks for posting it! reply chii 14 hours agorootparentprev> 1 is a 10x winner out of 10 stocks, 1 being a 10x winner is an absolutely rarity and the fact that you would manage to pick it is pure luck tbh. reply chrismarlow9 13 hours agorootparentOh there's more luck required than that. You have to get lucky many times to win at a 10x stock. - You have to be lucky enough to find it when it's cheap. - You have to be lucky enough to hold on to it even if it loses money - You have to be lucky enough to not sell it when it's at only 5x and hold off for the top - you have to be lucky enough to have bought enough initially that the return is meaningful to you These are the thoughts that made me clean up how I invest and stop thinking I'll get lucky at some point just rolling the dice. It's way more luck required than just buying in early. reply sgerenser 4 hours agorootparentThe 4th point (bought enough that the return is meaningful) is the killer one. There’s always “that guy” that brags about buying TSLA or NVDA in 2015 and having 100x his money. Then it turns out he only bought like $500 worth. Sure, $50K isn’t nothing, but it’s not going to be meaningful to the retirement of someone making tech worker wages. Of course, the reason he didn’t buy more was because he knew it was a lottery ticket and putting most of his money in the S&P500 in his 401k was obviously more prudent. reply WalterBright 14 hours agorootparentprevQQQ is up 5x in 10 years.

The losers would be the Indian citizenry. The company isn't doing so well now possibly due to a culture of corruption, but that kind of long-term culture analysis is hard for traders.

A put option is a contract between buyer (me) and a seller of the option. The contract guarantees me a right to sell stock at a strike price to the seller of the option. If current stock price is lower than put contract strike price, I can exercise the contract and make money: I buy the stock from market at e.g. $78 (current price) and sell at e.g. $128 (strike price). If stock is delisted the contract is still valid and enforced by the clearing house. They'll just assume that current price is $0 and force the option seller to just fork me cash without receiving the (unavailable) shares. But it doesn't happen in practice because stocks are not just delisted without warning.

They invest because they are looking for a return. The mistake CrowdStrike made will likely have little to no effect on their revenue. Since the stock dropped a bit (emotional investors getting out) it became a good value proposition, so people bought it cheap. The reasons companies use CrowdStrike haven't gone away. Existing contracts can't just be terminated. By the time it comes up for renewal few will remember the incident, fewer still will care. What you see as \"levels of incompetence\" others see as \"made a mistake\". You don't fire suppliers for a mistake- that's experience to them, and they're unlikely to make that mistake again anytime soon. Plus of course, replacing anything like that at scale is a lot of work, expensive, and career-risky. Who, in the enterprise, is taking on that task? Who is advocating for it? The market is forgiving because the outlook remains strong. The outlook remains strong because the business fundamentals remain strong. reply manquer 14 hours agorootparentThere are consequences, with significant financial impact, not necessarily world ending for them. There are already lawsuits filed around this incident. If a court sides with the customers or if CrowdStrike settles them, it will not be cheap. Even if they don't end up loosing or settling, the lawyers will not be cheap with so many suits , I don't think there is a major class action, every contract is unique after all, customers can easily afford their own lawyers and don't need to share. Beyond that, in next renewal cycle, customers are likely to demand much stronger penalty clauses in the contract, they won't let the mistake of not putting strong financial penalties slide while they may not change the vendor. This will make insurance for CrowdStrike much more expensive, another mistake would be far more financially expensive even if this one doesn't turn out to be. The insurer will also want a stronger internal process controls and paperwork which also won't be cheap. Consequences in B2B are never immediate but over time they do happen, larger an org longer it takes, but eventually it does catches up, look at Intel or Boeing today. reply bruce511 14 hours agorootparentThere will absolutely be consequences. And that'll cost real money. But that is just a 'cost of doing business'. And ultimately will just work it's way into the price. Intel and Boeing are not \"one off mistakes\". The root problems there are structural, cultural and fundamental. If CrowdStrike have more issues this year, then that'll have an impact because it suggests there's a root problem. But a single bad rollout is just a bad rollout. reply manquer 11 hours agorootparentCrowdStrike problems are also structural the incident timeline hardly seemed like a fat finger mistake, but series of fundamental poor practices a org in their position should not have. We only get to see the one newsworthy incident like the door blowing off the airplane.

It is notoriously brutal for large organizations in tech to stay competitive over 20-30 years time horizon.

What you're saying makes no sense. There are many reasons this can make sense. In this case, the most likely reason is that the allegations called into question the integrity of the executives and the board. New executives would be hired and approved by the same group, and it would look strange for them to do that while under investigation. The most important finding from the investigation is neither management (executives) nor the board acted improperly, which led to them making the recommendation. reply gmd63 15 hours agorootparentWhy would an investigation committee need to recommend that a company fill vacant financial and accounting executive positions?

Especially in the era of anything being credibly fake-able with widely available AI tools, short-selling can look to criminals as a very profitable way to make money. Also, short-selling incentivizes large stock holders to be lazy and not do their jobs. Imagine a huge ass pension fund - they can (and do) make money as the counterparty in short-selling deals. Some see this as a necessary part of stocktrading life (because it provides liquidity), but personally I think that it removes incentives for the pension fund managers to do their job and audit the stock they hold for their shareholders in turn themselves. Besides: enforcing securities code and auditing companies should not be the job of vigilantes. I applaud the efforts of ethical short sellers, but in an ideal world, that job would be done by the authorities.

To the extent that it does happen it's a mere technicality and the borrow is found after a couple of days. 2. There is very little money in shorting. Pumping and dumping by making up positive news is much more lucrative. \"to the moon\" has been a trope for years, and there is no equivalent on the short side. Even the world's most successful short seller Jim Chanos was successful because the short portfolio functioned as a hedge that enabled a leveraged long position on broad indices. It's pretty hard make money net short when the market goes up for two straight decades. 3. The authorities don't have the resources nor the dogged inclination to hunt down fraudsters. The authorities can't and shouldn't base an exhaustive investigation on vaguely shifty CEO behavior. Short sellers can and do start their investigation based on gut feeling. reply lucianbr 9 hours agorootparent> The authorities can't and shouldn't base an exhaustive investigation on vaguely shifty CEO behavior. Moral hazard. We are in this thread, where many people complain about the irrationality of the market, of bad choices having no ill effects, and at the same time it is argued that authorities should prioritize and only investigate and prosecute large cases where the ROI is good. I think the ethical landscape created by this \"selective investigation and prosecution based on ROI\" is part of the problem. We officially abandon the concept that wrong-doing will get caught and punished as a rule and then we marvel that the markets are irrational and that bad actors profit and keep profiting over large time horizons. Who could have expected such? I think over a longer time period these effects will compound and there will be larger and larger problems. You can't just abandon the rules because enforcing them is not cost-efficient and hope everything will be alright. But it does take time to see the effects so who knows when the larger problems will show up. reply gizmo 7 hours agorootparentI broadly agree, except I think the greater moral hazard is in failing to prosecute the plain-as-day cases of fraud (regardless of size). I'm not arguing in favor of abandoning rules but given limited resources you have to prioritize somehow, and every prosecution strategy has significant externalities like those you touched on. reply weard_beard 15 hours agorootparentprev1.

And nothing had to be restated to the SEC, nor has the SEC asked for any changes. Basically the big 4 auditor jumped off the ship, based on allegations and potential issues and nothing concrete, and they did not stick around to do the actual work they should’ve done.

Shorting tends to be intrinsically harder because the market goes up over time and Americans are generally optimists. Plus the last 2 years we've seen 20+% market moves upwards. Despite it being a necessity for functioning markets, when you are short, seemingly everyone is against you - business management, regulators, media, etc. Not surprised to see them bow out. Chanos did so last year. This is one of the reasons frauds go on so much longer than you'd expect - no one wants to hear the truth. reply tart-lemonade 19 hours agorootparentPeople have this idea that short sellers are market manipulators who conspire to wipe out innocent day traders' life savings and trigger mass layoffs with the stroke of a pen (hence the term \"financial terrorism,\" which is absolutely comical in its hyperbole but used with complete sincerity by the anti-short crowd), but like tines said, it's a risky business that requires lots of research that frequently goes nowhere with limited upside and uncapped potential losses. The amount of times they and other short sellers publish damning evidence on a company only for the stock to shoot back as soon as the company releases a \"nothing to see here\" non-response really shows the difficulty in making money in the space (and how much people want to bury their heads in the sand). Given the regulatory environment we are heading into, I expect short selling will become an even riskier business since the SEC isn't going to be prosecuting fraud anymore (or rather, they'll be doing even less than they are now), making it much easier to sic the lawyers on firms like Hindenburg. Even though this isn't their stated reason for bowing out, I wouldn't be surprised or hold it against them if it was a factor. reply Over2Chars 18 hours agorootparentI think the prospect of an impending SEC or other investigation is only one factor in stocks losing value. They highlight inflated sales and financial irregularities like a chain of companies that engage in self-dealing, but are portrayed as independent to hide their real ownership, and so on. If you believe what they say, your faith in the company is shaken because they're pulling a con job on you to invest in them and believe their story. If the SEC investigates that just supports the claim that it's a con. If they don't investigate - for whatever reason - it doesn't mean that it's not a con and you won't lose all of your money believing it. So a change in the regulatory environment is only one element. For example, the Modhi/Adani thing is outside the reach of the SEC. And after watching a piece on it, apparently shorting it was amazingly tricky, and they had to go through some Singaporean markets to arrange a short position. reply jonstewart 17 hours agorootparentprevSEC Commissioners turn over slowly.

The profile that discussed the idea that the real sort of 'secret sauce' was that the combination of Chanos' main funds were like 190% long, and then 90% the short stuff he wan known for. On its surface, nothing crazy for long/short funds, the notable part was that basically all the effort was on the short side, and the long side was implied to be very humdrum. And the short book had like negative returns over a long period. It just struck me as a really elegant (if extreme) example of what uncorrelated returns can do if you do somehow have some edge over time. And I'm not sure what Hindenburg's holistic picture is, but whether rightly or wrongly now I usually assume most of the kind of very public shorts operate similarly. I was never really on board with the \"short sellers are evil\" train of thought, but I did believe, \"oh these very public short sellers only short things, they just go around all the time thinking everything is awful\". And my assumption now is that they are like, kind of really theatric long/short funds. Matt had some line like if you extremely good at something, you can get rich doing it, even if it loses money. As long as it's not correlated. reply cushychicken 19 hours agorootparentprevI’d wager a big part of how they make money is as SEC whistleblowers. It’s not as huge of money as shorting is - but it’s typically a single digit percentage of the recovered fines. Considering these guys nailed a company that defrauded people of $3 BILLION dollars, they’d net $30 mil from turning that company in even if the payout is only 1%. The SEC has a policy of paying out part of recovered fines as bounties to whistleblowers to align incentives. If your company is doing something sketchy, you get a payout by doing the right thing. I’m not a lawyer but I think that mechanism works just as well if you’re an external reporter of fraud.

The way shorting works is you borrow a stock (and keep paying premium for the duration) and sell it Premiums are usually small, so you can make many multiples of paid premium And since their business model is releasing the findings, which in turn makes the stock drop, they can time their short position very well and don't need to pay premiums for long reply tines 18 hours agorootparentI think you misunderstood what I meant by \"your money\" in \"double your money\" (and I was unclear). You can only earn the value of the stocks you borrow. When trading long, the gain is unlimited. According to Investopedia, \"the Federal Reserve Board requires all short sale accounts to have 150% of the value of the short sale at the time the sale is initiated\" so it's the same principle as going long with margin. You can leverage yourself but there's a limit. reply dgacmu 18 hours agorootparentYes, but borrowing short is fundamentally leveraged. As long as the stock doesn't increase in value, you don't need much of your own cash to secure it - because you're holding the cash from selling it. But, of course, that gets ugly when the stock goes up; that's when you have to start putting your own money in against the borrow. reply BeetleB 18 hours agorootparentprevYou borrow 10 shares that are currently worth $10 each. You immediately sell and get $100. The price drops to $1 per share. You spend $10 to buy those shares and return your loan. So you spent $10 and made $90. That's a 9x gain. Yes you cannot make more than $100. But of course you can! Do the short on 1000 shares instead of 10. The more confident you are of the share price going down, the more shares you borrow. Unlimited upside. reply tines 18 hours agorootparentIsn't this a bit like arguing that you can make infinite money by borrowing infinite money and going long? You have to maintain margin requirements which limits how many shares you can borrow so again, you can really only double your money (not even double, iiuc your account has to have 150% of the value of your short), unless there's something I'm not seeing. reply chii 14 hours agorootparent> your account has to have 150% of the value of your short yep, people who aren't professional traders, and don't actually have an account with a broker to do shorting with, and dont know the margin requirements. The thing is, a broker will _never_ put themselves at risk of losing money. If they offer you a shorting service, they require a method to make themselves whole. If you short, they will guess some sort of margin of safety for said short (calculated based on the liquidity of the stock) - if it's very liquid, the margin could be lower, but for illiquid stocks, it's even higher. This margin of safety is what the broker will use to close your short position if the market moves against you - you don't get a choice in the matter. You don't even have access to those funds from the sale of the short - the broker holds onto it until the short is closed. reply sidewndr46 14 hours agorootparentprevThe same argument can be made with roulette.

Right now, Walmart is at $91.34, and you can buy a put at $88 expiring on 24th January for $0.18 [1]. If you buy one, and the stock goes to zero by then, you spent $0.18 and gained $88, a 488x return. January 2026 at $86.67 is $5.35 - a mere 16x return. [1] https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/wmt/option-cha... reply NickC25 3 hours agorootparentYou'd spend $0.18 per share, yes, but the option's price is $18, not $0.18. So your return would be roughly 4.1x, not 488x. Remember options contracts are counted in hundreds, so $0.18 is the price per share, not per contract. reply twic 1 hour agorootparentIf you're going to work it out per options contract, then you spend $18, and get to sell 100 shares at $88. 100 * $88 / $18 is still 488x. (This number is large because Walmart is not going to go bust in the next few days! It serves to illustrate the arithmetic, but maybe it's not the most realistic example.) reply 1024core 19 hours agorootparentprev> Shorting tends to be intrinsically harder because the market goes up over time and Americans are generally optimists. ... and the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. I remember once I tried shorting a stock, of a market leader in my area.

But sadly the market didn't see this and the stock went up. E*Trade started pushing me to cover my positions, and eventually I ended up losing a 5-figure sum (nothing earth-shattering, but still a good chunk of my cash). After I had bought it all back, slowly the market realized what I had seen and the stock dropped as I had expected.

    "title": "No Calls",
    "originLink": "https://keygen.sh/blog/no-calls/",
    "originBody": "No calls Thursday, January 16th 2025Zeke Gabrielse, Founder of Keygen When I first started Keygen, I had this idea in my head that I could create a company where I never had to get on a sales call — or any call. Being an introvert, I absolutely hated calls. They're not only awkward, but a 30 minute call takes up hours of my headspace. I quickly learned that I didn't want to do them, and so I decided that I wouldn't. I instituted a bonkers 'no calls' policy at work. (Even I thought I was being crazy.) However, as Keygen grew, I wanted to start to move more up-market. I wanted larger customers, because the bigger a customer got, the less support they typically needed, and of course, the more they paid me. And the bigger logos help gain trust in a market. The first thing I tried was taking sales calls. I threw up a big 'book a call' button on my enterprise pricing page — but I obviously hated it. (What about for non-enterprise leads? Well, I can't justify a call for $49/mo, I'll tell you that much, especially when they may not buy.) I felt like I was wasting my time, the lead's time, and I could never close a sale. It felt awkward. I tried for months. I never felt prepared. I felt like I was constantly talking to the wrong people, slowly climbing the ladder to an actual stakeholder, repeating myself over and over every call — and then repeating myself again in a summary email. \"Couldn't this have all been an email?\" (Yes, it could — and should — have been.) \"This would be easier if it was async so I could think about my answer.\" \"This person isn't somebody that has the authority to even close.\" \"Is this person even involved in the project?\" \"How do I talk to engineering?\" \"Why am I talking to this person again?\" One day, I woke up and out of frustration, I nuked the 'book a call' button from my pricing page. When the next person asked for a call, I responded with a simple \"No, we don't do calls, but happy to help via email. Feel free to CC any relevant team members onto this thread.\" Their response was surprising. They actually did what I suggested — they CC'd the engineering department onto the email, they asked their questions, and we started chatting integration strategies. Instead of speaking with somebody who was multiple positions removed from the project, I was speaking with the actual people who could champion Keygen within the organization — the people who're directly involved — the right people. I thought to myself, \"did I just bypass all of the red tape?\" That month, I closed my first enterprise sale. It was an F1000 company. \"Maybe it was a fluke?\" But it wasn't. Nearly everybody I sent that to wanted to skip the calls too. (I've even had people literally say that to me in their response!) Sometimes, it didn't work out, and that's okay. I don't expect Keygen to be a fit for everybody; and not everybody is a fit for Keygen. Am I leaving money on the table? Maybe? But I personally don't feel like I am. I feel like I get to wake up every morning and do the kind of work that I love to do. And I feel like I have the freedom to avoid the type of work that I hate to do. I think about it like this: I don't provide white-glove integration or consulting services, even though I might be able to earn more money if I did. (And lots of people ask for it!) But that's not what I want to do. That's not why I built Keygen. In the same way, I don't want to do calls. So, in enterprise sales, why do calls happen? Enterprises often default to calls for these 4 totally-solvable reasons: They don't understand what you offer. They don't know how to use it. They don't know your price. They don't trust you. If you want to try #nocalls, you need to solve these problems. 1. They don't understand what you offer This comes down to messaging. If your messaging is vague, people will need to get on a call to understand what you actually offer. If your product offering is too wide (i.e. you do too much), people will feel like they need to get on a call just to understand if your product is a good fit for their much more narrow use-case. But if you narrow down your focus, and really nail your messaging — make it clear what you actually do — you can eliminate the question entirely. Drop the \"We Make Work Happen\" taglines and actually sell the product. (And now, it might be easier to see why some companies use these taglines — it's like a sales call siren song!) 2. They don't know how to use it If your product isn't self-serve, and if your onboarding sucks, people will feel like have they to book a call in order to get started. If you don't provide enough information on your website to scope a POC or an integration, they're going to need to somehow obtain that information. And that typically requires a call. e.g. if you don't have public documentation, you guessed it — call. (And why would you not have public documentation?) 3. They don't know your price Price is the big one. Enterprises are used to the dance. You book a call, size each other up, and then come up with a b.s. price. It's all so tiring. And if you want to skip calls, you have to dip out of the dance. You can do this by putting enterprise pricing up front and center. I don't care how large the number is — put it on your pricing page. If you feel like you're giving up too much money, maybe #nocalls isn't for you. When somebody asks for a call to discuss pricing, all you have to do is say something simple like, \"Our enterprise pricing is available here. Let me know if you have any questions.\" 4. They don't trust you Last, but most certainly not least, is trust. If an enterprise doesn't trust you, they will not buy from you — period. How do you gain trust? Well, first off, don't die. Trust is a function of time — i.e. the longer you exist, the more people will trust that you'll continue to exist. But there are other facets of trust as well, and enterprises will send you huge time-consuming questionnaires to alleviate all of their concerns. They might even want to jump on a call. All they're trying to do is be compliant, and you can help them be compliant without calls. You can do that by clearly articulating how your company handles data, how you handle security, and how you handle incidents. I'm sure SOC2, HIPAA, and PCI certifications would help, too, but we don't hold those yet (but our infrastructure providers do). (At Keygen, we have a security page that outlines all of this, and essentially answers the questions that are in most security questionnaires we've seen.) Conclusion It may be controversial (I'm almost sure of it), but here's my philosophy on enterprise sales while avoiding sales calls entirely: No sales calls, except for a short 'discovery call' if absolutely needed. Discovery calls are just a formality. Use email. Ask leads to CC relevant teammates (e.g. engineering). Explain your value clearly. Don't muddy the waters by doing too much. Avoid vague messaging that prompts more questions. Build trust. (Step one: don't die.) Focus on security, and spell it out in public docs. Document every problem to avoid repeating answers (i.e. allow them to easily find the answers themselves). Use fixed- or transparent-pricing. (If you like calls, ignore this.) Make onboarding self-serve. I'm sure some people will scoff at some or all of this, but maybe others who are like myself will read this and realize they don't have to do sales like everybody else. Enterprise sales don't have to be crazy. If you want to go #nocalls, maybe try out some of the things above. If you want to do calls, do the opposite of all of these things. Until next time. Edit: some readers have (rightfully) pointed out that we do indeed have a 'book a call' button on our enterprise pricing page, and so there seems to be a disconnect. I briefly touched on this in the conclusion, but this call is a short 15 min 'discovery call', not a sales call. It's essentially a formality to intro each other, make sure we're human, and move onto email for any further discussion. Essentially, over the years, I discovered that not all enterprises will shoot you a cold email to start the conversation, so this call is to capture those leads, with the end-goal of having all real discussion in email. tl;dr: some enterprises will bounce if they don't see a 'book a call' button.",

But large organizations wanting licenses for each user will want a discount, will want finer details about contracts, and often some kind of unique adaptations to the product for their use case. The selling company needs to know if its worth the effort, in which case you have requirements gathering and negotiations. Of course there will be differential pricing depending on what the buyer company wants (cost goes up) and if it's a whale of a deal that the seller really wants (cost goes down) So... schedule a call? reply wil421 42 minutes agorootparentprevHave you ever done enterprise contracts?

The hacker news crowd is asking \"What have you built?\", and intend to work out whether they think it's worth it once they know what you made, while reddit users go \"How can this help me?\".

Because historically and even presently to a distressing degree, sales is not about communication, it's not amount mutuality of purpose, and it's not about explaining what the product is. If you have a product that does it's job and does it well, and solves a problem for a person or a business, you don't need a sales call because a sales email is more effective. You need a sales call (and arguably, a salesperson) when the value proposition isn't remotely that clear. Most salespeople when you're on the phone with them do not care about you as a customer. They care about making their quota and/or getting their commission. I appreciate at my current employer that while we offer bonuses for sales folks that really go above an beyond, like scoring a large account or solving a large problem, we don't do commissions, we just pay good salaries. That means the sales person as they're working is not incentivized to sell as much as possible, they're incentivized to figure out the (potential) client's needs, and how we can best meet them, irrespective of what they end up paying. reply karatinversion 2 hours agorootparent> we don't do commissions, we just pay good salaries The semi-joke I always heard about this was that if you don't pay commissions, you'll hire a sales team who are good at selling you that they are doing a good job, rather than selling the prodct. reply koolba 2 hours agorootparentSales has to be commission based and you always hire at least two salesman.

Sales seems to attract folks who are highly 'coin operated'. The large majority (yes...always with the exceptions) really, deep down, don't care about how cool the tech is, or how it's going to change the world...they care about the game of sales and you keep score in the game by how much commission you earn. You really want the salesthing that comes in with \"Forget about the salary or draw, I want a 100% commission comp plan\" because that's someone who is confident enough in their ability to sell that they aren't worried about paying the mortgage or buying groceries. Tangentially, one of the worst things I've seen a sales org do is cap commissions. All that incentivizes is \"I hit my cap...ima gonna go hang out on my boat until next quarter because why work for sales I'm not going to get comp'ed on\". reply sim7c00 17 minutes agorootparent'coin operated' people. thank you for that. :) reply Levitz 2 hours agorootparentprev>Most salespeople when you're on the phone with them do not care about you as a customer.

It's one thing to look at a few service and compare pricing and product, it's a whole different thing to book 5 different calls with 5 different companies before you can even begin to decide what to do, it gets extra bad when you have questions they can't answer, so you book an additional call in which you are informed that some important feature is out of the question and tadaa, you just wasted a whole lot of time for a bunch of people with nothing to show for it.

I was raised to be a people-pleaser and no matter how many times I read \"When I say no, I feel guilty\" my gut instinct during conversations in which I have to think on my feet is to do whatever is necessary to avoid conflict with the person with whom I'm speaking.

Talking to them means entering negotiations on their terms. Unless you're well-versed in dealing with salespeople, they will play you like a fiddle. The business of their company relies on clients clueless enough, or big enough to not be sensitive to losses at this scale. It's plain stupid to engage from a severely disadvantaged position if you have any alternative available. This applies doubly if they're cold-calling you.

There are numerous products I likely would have purchased, but I either find a substitute or just go without because I won't play the stupid \"let's get on a call\" game. If your website doesn't give me enough information to: 1. Know enough about your product to know that it will (generally speaking) meet my needs/requirements. 2. Know that the pricing is within the ballpark of reasonable given what your product does. Then I will move on (unless I'm really desparate, which I assure you is rarely the case). I've rolled-my-own solution more than once as well when there were no other good competitors. That's not to say that calls never work or don't have a place, because they definitely do. The key to using the call successfully (with me at least) is to use the call to get into true details about my needs, after I know that you're at least in the ballpark. Additionally, the call should be done efficiently. We don't need a 15 minute introduction and overview about you. We don't need a bunch of small talk about weather or sports. 2 minutes of that is ok, or when waiting for additional people to join the call, but beyond that I have things to do. I know what my needs are. I understand you need some context on my company and needs in order to push useful information forward, and I also understand that many potential customers will not take the lead in asking questions and providing that context, but the sooner you take the temperature and adjust, the better. Also, you can get pretty far as a salesperson if you just spend 5 minutes looking at our website before the call! Then you don't have to ask basic questions about what we do. If you're willing to invest in the time to get on a call, then it's worth a few minutes of time before-hand to look at our website. reply freedomben 1 hour agoparentOh I might add another huge thing: Have a way to justify/explain your pricing and how you came to that number. When you have to \"learn about my company\" in order to give me pricing info, I know you're just making the price up based on what you think I can pay. That's going to backfire on you because after you send me pricing, I'm going to ask you how you arrived at those numbers. Is it by vCPU? by vRAM? by number of instances? by number of API calls per month? by number of employees? by number of \"seats\"? If you don't have some objective way of determining the price you want to charge me, you're going to feel really stupid and embarrassed when I drill into the details. reply Eridrus 3 hours agoprevThis only works if your sales strategy is all about inbound sales, i.e. content marketing (like this article)/ads. But if you're an enterprise b2b company and want to grow quickly rather than taking 8 years to go beyond 1 solopreneur like this guy you're going to want to do outbound sales. It's also worth noting that this guys is mostly doing small deals. The literal largest price he has on his pricing page is 72k/yr, which isn't tiny, but his typical deal size is likely much smaller, so it makes total sense for him not to get on a call for $49/month, because that is not a scalable strategy. But many enterprise b2b companies have a more complicated product than Keygen and charge orders of magnitude more than they do. Which is not to say that he is wrong, it's just that this is the correct strategy for scaling a low ACV product, rather than a high ACV product. And a low ACV product has to have much broader demand. reply cainxinth 2 hours agoparentIt also only works if your product is quite good. I think we can assume a fairly normal distribution for the quality of products where the vast majority are neither very good or bad. An average company with average products will be more inclined to try aggressive sales and marketing tactics because they don't have a great product to help motivate sales. reply duxup 3 hours agoprevOne thing I find with enterprise is your call sometimes isn't entirely about you selling them on your product. It's about learning about the enterprise, from them. It's about feeling out their organization, their issues, and the dynamics between different departments at that company. Even issues they don't realize they have that are solvable. I find none of that comes out very clearly in emails that tend to be bullet point style focused but don't reveal the nature of the issue. I don't like calls either, but they are useful. reply WaitWaitWha 3 hours agoparentI do understand what you are writing.

But when it comes to something complex, something someone hasn't used before, and all the options and dynamics between enterprise departments that might not be pulling in the same direction, an email almost never covers it and often enterprises aren't aware of it to put it in an email. If you don't address / discover those things it is potentially a recipient for disaster for everyone. I've been on numerous calls where a potential customer is on the call and even asking about basic features, then one department head explains to the other \"Well we can't do that because X,Y,Z and our other systems A,B,C.\" and it's the first those two departments REALLY heard each other talk about that. Then we find ways to sort it out. I've even been on calls where for most of it I'm just there, not doing anything, it's the customer discovering their own processes and working it out internally. In email that's almost always \"we can't do that\" because of course not, they're alone with their email, nobody is explaining or offering solutions. Right or wrong it's just human nature and email doesn't work for some things. reply madars 1 hour agorootparentprevMany organizations have a shadow org chart that you won't learn from the website but will get some sense of that structure in human interactions like calls. reply ezekg 3 hours agoparentprevI agree with this.

After almost a year of using their product (on a month to month plan), they wanted to check-in and see what features we were using, what we liked, didn't like and show us the new stuff they'd released etc. And then in the last 10 minutes of an hour long call, they dropped a little \"we just need to go over some administrative details\" bomb where they started negotiations to get us on a year long contract. I will never accept another discovery call from this vendor again. It was such a huge piss off. reply duxup 2 hours agorootparentYeah that's terrible. I'd be all \"not today man, talk about the other stuff\". If they didn't take that, I'd be done with the call. reply slama 3 hours agoprevMy understanding is that enterprise purchasing teams are often evaluated based on their ability to secure discounts compared to the initial sticker price of the software. Therefore, having a firm sticker price might make them less incentivized to purchase your SaaS.

It also relieves you from the burden of having a response ready in seconds.

Why, it's a tool that will unlock the value of my business and allow unparalleled visibility into my business to connect with my customers and brings highly-available best-of-breed services to us to secure and empower our business, which has up to this point just been businessin' along without the full power of businessy business that we could have been businessing if we just businessed this business product earlier.

These are all very basic questions that are only the very beginning of understanding of what the product actually is, and I frequently can't even guess based on the home page. I have more than once been told we're using one of these products and linked to the homepage in question, and still had to come back and ask the person \"Yes, but what is it?\" The best thing you can do is hit the developer docs page, if there is one, but even then it's fairly rare for there to be a clear answer. You have to poke through frequently disorganized, task-based documents with no clear progression as to \"here's where to start with our product\" and frankly some products have defeated me even so. I can get as far as \"Ah, you have some sort of web interface\" and probably some clue about what it actually is, but that hardly nails it down. You'd think I could juts derive the answer almost immediately. So glad it's not my job to poke through these things.

Iterating instead of throwing out everything with each new version. There is a part of me that is going to miss the, do weird shit and see what works, Nintendo that brought us some really fun ideas. But a stable Nintendo just being able to continue putting out great games has its advantages. I am curious about the specs, but honestly don't care much. The only real issue the Switch had was being able to keep up with some of the games put on it with FPS but it still had beautiful games (like Tears of the Kingdom). So as long as it is actually a decent spec bump I am happy and have zero care to compare it to the other consoles (but I am sure people are going too and scream that it is \"underpowered\"). The biggest thing I am curious about, will it be OLED since that will be disappointing to go back to non OLED from the OLED Switch. And Price. reply bargainbin 2 hours agoparentThey’ve got the weird shit covered still, apparently the joy cons in this gen can be used as mice. Was heavily rumoured/leaked and this teaser video literally shows them gliding along a surface. How Nintendo will leverage that functionality, who could honestly say, but that’s the genius of keeping a toy company mindset in an industry full of sports car company mindsets. reply adamc 2 hours agorootparentThat last sentence is worth an essay of its own. Everyone else keeps pumping resources into being photo-realistic blah-blah-blah without nearly enough attention to \"is this fun\"? reply ecliptik 2 hours agorootparentOne of my favorite video essay's on this is \"Nintendo - Putting Play First\" by Game Makers Toolkit [1]. It goes into when making a game, Nintendo first determines the mechanic they want to focus on; jumping, throwing a hat, shooting paint, etc and finding out how to make it fun, then building and iterating on the idea. It's how they can keep putting out essentially the same games but are completely different. 1. https://youtu.be/2u6HTG8LuXQ reply m_fayer 2 hours agorootparentprevStrongly agreed. When I think of the best Nintendo products the words “fun” and “play” spring to mind. AAA gaming on the other hand, either resembles sports, shallow short-form media, or Oscar-bait melodrama. Very little fun to be had. What ever happened to fun and play? reply CobrastanJorji 21 minutes agorootparentMoney happened. The gaming industry produces more revenue than the movie industry and the music industry combined. Making a AAA is a $50-$100 million endeavor. At that scale, doing weird stuff because maybe it'll pay off is almost unconscionably risky. It's the same problem movies have, and it's the reason why indy films and indy games are so much more interesting. reply 01HNNWZ0MV43FF 1 hour agorootparentprevFun doesn't map 1:1 into a trailer or a screenshot. Graphics do, voice acting, cutscenes, and big set pieces do. reply piva00 1 hour agorootparentprevSingleplayer AAA gaming on top of all that feels like work, the older I got the less those games kept me playing because I don't want to spend 3 hours running errands to be rewarded with an item/spell/skill. The melodramatic storylines are also pretty grating, there are a few games with good storytelling but most are some rehash of \"this world has been destroyed/is in the process of being destroyed, in the aftermath a hero is about to rise and save it\" so if the mechanics don't feel fun right from the get-go I lose interest completely. The most fun I have with games are the ones with a very iterative game loop (roguelikes for example), or social/multiplayer games, anything with a lot of replayability, and the constant feeling of improvement is like crack to me. A surprising example I re-discovered last year after only playing it for a while some 15 years ago is Trackmania, got even some friends hooked on it to play hot seating trying to beat each others time. The game loop is short and intense (about 1-2 minutes max), has a high skill ceiling, and you feel yourself getting better at a track each time you play it, nailing some very tricky part that felt impossible 30 min before is absurdly satisfying. reply danudey 1 hour agorootparentprevI saw an interesting analysis years ago about whether or not the most powerful console 'won' in each generation (i.e. whether or not being the most powerful console of your generation leads to success). Generally speaking, no, it doesn't actually affect things, and in several cases (e.g. the Game Boy, the Wii, and the Switch come to mind) the objectively 'worse' console (from a tech perspective) was more successful by a country mile. reply basfo 1 hour agorootparentIt's interesting how many people see the Switch as being in its own category rather than acknowledging it as the winner of this console generation (which I completely agree it is). Most people think the “console” battle is between PlayStation and Xbox, and that PlayStation is the winner.

As soon as I read this, it clicked for me. I have two teenagers (15 & 17) and this is exactly right. My son plays games all the time and although he's played Elden Ring and GTA and other games of that sort, over the years I would say 80% of his time has been Minecraft and this other 2D game with a platformer vibe whose name I forget that has procedurally generated maps. He's frequently calling me over to his computer to check out his latest architectural creation in Minecraft. I know it's not just him, because he plays multiplayer with his buddies as well, and again, a lot of it is these games with quite frankly primitive graphics.

It was one of my favorite things about the platform, but it always felt like this was partially thanks to the older hardware still getting games well into the new hardware's life in many cases. Major games, I believe Pokemon has done this a few times? Most of their home consoles were complete departures from previous hardware. NES, SNES, N64, Gamecube all did not work with prior games were fairly different (ok admittedly the outward difference between the NES and the SNES were minimal but still no compatability). So honestly I think it was more notable that the Wii could play Gamecube games than the other way around as far as Nintendo's track record goes. reply la6776 2 hours agorootparentfor what it's worth Nintendo had planned to make the SNES backward compatible and that intention influenced design choices, particularly the very similar CPU. reply chungy 11 minutes agorootparentYeah, the SNES uses a 65816, which is pretty much a backwards-compatible and 16-bit extension of the 6502, used in the NES. The SPC is likewise capable of nearly perfectly reproducing the NES's audio capabilities, and the PPU has the same background and sprite layering as the NES as a foundation. reply larusso 54 minutes agorootparentprevFirst Wii was able to play Game Cube Games. WiiU was backwards compatible to Wii. All theses consoles used nearly the same chipset anyways. reply lotsoweiners 28 minutes agorootparentI was always amazed the Wii with its full size discs could play the GameCube mini discs. reply TuxSH 4 hours agorootparentprev3DS has hardware support for GBA games too, actually, though these only got distributed via the Ambassador program. Also had VC for most of Nintendo's platform. reply chungy 4 hours agorootparentI know, and you can basically restore full GameCube compatibility on the Wii U via Nintendont. Neither of them let you use the actual physical games from the old system, and needing to perform jailbreak hacks to use them and load ROMs on anyway doesn't count as much as out-of-the-box compatibility. reply TuxSH 3 hours agorootparentFair. A shame, still, especially for GC compat on WiiU. reply Wowfunhappy 3 hours agorootparentThe problem in both cases is that the consoles were actually missing a key piece of hardware: the ability to read the disc or cartridge. If you're a hacker-type person who has already digitized your gamecube collection (or, let's be honest, downloaded the games illegally) then this doesn't matter. But for regular consumers, there needs to be a way to verify ownership. Nintendo could have made some titles available digitally (which is what I wish they'd done), but that requires getting content rights sorted out for games that have never been sold digitally before, so the full catalog would not have been available. Also, there would have been a ton of hemming and hawing about \"Nintendo is making me buy my Gamecube games again?!?\" No comment on whether such complaints would have been reasonable. reply chungy 7 minutes agorootparentThe problem is deliberate hardware choices. They may be reasonable choices, but if Nintendo wanted to prioritize forever backwards compatibility, we could still have a GameCube-compatible disc drive and GBA and DS compatible catridge slots. bdhcuidbebe 3 hours agorootparentprevDownloading roms is all it takes to be regarded a hacker-type these days?

Lots of people held onto their old hardware; probably wasn't worth excluding them. The biggest advantage of owning a New 3DS turned out to be the huge performance uplift. A fair number of games ran at double the framerate or only supported 3D mode on the newer hardware.

Tears of the Kingdom looks just awful to me. My kids played Breath of the Wild and when they got Tears of the Kingdom I walked in and was astonished at the graphic quality. I think I had just finished Doom 2016 at the time and I felt like I was rewinding the clock 15 years in graphical quality. I've heard literally zero other people have this complaint, so I suspect it's just my take on the aesthetics of the game. I think the state-of-the-art on Switch is really Panic Button's work on the Doom and Doom Eternal ports, but those are frame locked at 30 FPS, so I think getting a spec bump in Switch 2 would certainly help the demographic that plays games like that. My family has left the Switch ecosystem for Steam Deck, and that does a lot better.

On one hand, the base architecture is Ampere, but it's been repeatedly rumored that there are various backports from Lovelace. It's a weird mixture of the two, alone with some unique parts never seen elsewhere (a file decompression engine that accelerates LZMA, according to kernel commits). It's hard to say then how powerful these raytracing cores are, or how many are even necessary for simple but beautiful effects. It's also worth remembering that the Switch bakes the graphics drivers into the game itself, uses data structures and shaders more native to the GPU without compilation, and has a custom low level graphics API called NVN (and NVN2), so performance is not necessarily linear compared to a PC. reply FractalHQ 2 hours agoparentprevThe games are crippled by how archaic and underpowered the hardware is.

They haven't competed on processing power since the Gamecube. After the Gamecube generation, you bought a Nintendo for the exclusive games and that was it. Mario, Pokemon, Zelda, and others. Nintendo knows that their draw is just the games, and uses a lot of lawyers to make sure that normal gamers can't play those games on the Steam Deck. If you want to play what Nintendo has to offer on the Steam Deck you have to install an emulator and Nintendo has made sure that normal people would rather drop $300 on a Switch instead of risk legal issues. Edit: I suppose that some people would also say the intuitive controls (motion control introduced on the Wii, dual screens (and touchscreen) on DS and WiiU, and detachable controllers on the Switch) have some draw, but those features have often been under-utilized except on a few titles. reply joshstrange 3 hours agorootparentI agree with you, for most people the Switch is the better/easier option if they are just looking to play a Nintendo-exclusive.

They rely on the fact that fun is pretty much orthogonal to bleeding edge graphics. They use that awareness and take advantage of simpler graphics to trade off processing power for features (portability, novelty) and profit (60>=usd games).

Sure, you can emulate on the Steam Deck, but it's a chore and far from perfect, and for most people who do it that is piracy. - The Switch is far less bulky, and has better battery life, less noise. ARM architecture is very well-suited to mobile gaming. - The docking mechanism is seamless and the dock is included with the device. Games are designed around that functionality specifically, e.g., you won't have controller or display configuration issues on a Switch because it's all pre-configured. - The price is almost certainly lower. - You can buy physical game cartridges and resell them, which is a big advantage for fans of physical media. - The Steam Deck does rely on a lot on its compatibility software with PC games, and while it's mostly a non-issue there it's not by any means a perfect catalog. If you get a Switch, all Switch software is going to work and was made for and tested on a Switch. reply 3vidence 54 minutes agorootparentI think there's also a certain amount of \"jank\" to the Steam Deck. Don't get me wrong it is a super cool console and pushes a lot of boundaries, but you don't really 100% know whether a title is going to run the way you want it to on the steam deck.

I even use it in the \"docked\" way where it is both driving the family TV but can also be taken out and used directly. And they've clearly put so, so much quality work into the Steam Deck. It's absolutely amazing considering the source material. But it's also hobbled by so much of its library assuming it was built for a desktop PC or a notebook that could pretend to be a desktop. Some of my games react to being docked properly, some do not. Some can handle switching from the integrated controls to an external controller live, some do not. Some can handle switching resolutions, some do not. Some respond well to using the integrated controls to manipulate how much computing power you allocate to the games in real time, some do not. Some games work perfectly with multiple controllers, a couple freak out unless the stars align. The Switch just works. But I will say that even as someone who is generally not a graphics snob, the Switch is definitely not just aging, but aged.

The series X and series S are the same generation. Wherever it was smart to start into this generation with a 3+ yrs old underperforming el-cheapo chipset is another question... But for what it's worth, Nintendo has done the same decision according to the hardware leaks, they're just missing the equivalent to the Series X. (Which makes sense as it's a mobile device, so they don't want to gobble up electricity) I personally agree that it was/is a terrible idea to start into a new generation with differently performing systems though. You can definitely release a \"pro\" version later for extra performance - but with the baseline being so underperforming as the series S...

I'm considering anything that isn't a traditional stationary control (keyboard + mouse or controller) as \"gimmicky\" or out of the ordinary. In terms of sales, you're absolutely right - the Wii crushed it. I'd be curious to know about usage and software sales though. Maybe I'm wrong (very possible), but almost everyone I knew had a Wii at some point, but they didn't use it outside of a family toy with a few games when they first got it. I'd still consider that a win for Nintendo compared to less sales, but I'd imagine the average Xbox 360 or PS3 had a lot more software sales per console. reply bsimpson 4 hours agorootparentThe Wiimotes were a clear influence on the Joy-Cons.

In many games that do offer gyro support, it's usually able to be toggled off.

Minus the dual screen of the Wii U, which was awesome. It'd be cool if the Switch 2's dock could work independently of the console, so that you could have a reverse Wii U- experience with it. The dual screen setup can be a neat gimmick for gameplay, but it's biggest strength is the convenience that comes from having a second screen closer to your face. You can have less visual clutter on the main screen, and reduce the amount of menus players need to click through. reply ARandumGuy 4 hours agorootparentTBH other then a few neat local multiplayer stuff in NintendoLand, there really wasn't much that actually utilized the dual screen in a way that actually enhanced the game. You couldn't quickly swap between the screens like you could on the DS, because the screens were different distances away and required re-focusing your eyes. This meant that most gamepad usages played the same as if you just pressed a button to bring up your inventory or switch views or whatever. And that's before you take into account the fact that the biggest titles on the Wii U (Mario Kart and Smash Bros) didn't use the second screen at all. The second screen was a gimmick, and a gimmick that was exhausted pretty quickly. reply jncfhnb 3 hours agorootparentprevI’m fairly certain I remember them suggesting that the original switch was capable of doing this but then they either never granted access to it in the dev kit or they just never had it end up getting used in any noteworthy games.

What's the gimmicky part of this that caught your eye you feel like they found in Switch 2? reply jjice 4 hours agorootparentMy words definitely could've been better. I was referring to \"portability\" as the gimmick here since it's not the norm in the industry for primary console. Nintendo did handhelds for years, but that was also a secondary thing to their primary consoles. Having their only console also be handheld was what I was referring to as the gimmick here, but I understand the argument that that's not a gimmick. As for naming, I think it'll be fine since they're using numbers. I'm not in the position of a middle aged parent who's getting a gift for a child, but the fact that Sony has successfully done it for this long makes me feel that it'll work. Add a letter to the end is awful though. It took me a bit to nail down the Series X vs Series S Xboxs (granted, I haven't owned an Xbox in over a decade). The Wii U definitely confused people as well. reply bombcar 2 hours agorootparentThe portability was amusing but then turned out to be absolutely phenomenal (and likely resulted in multiple sales to individual households). It both saved them from having to work out what to do with the handhelds, and introduced parents to \"the kids can just bring it with them\".

But after that it all fell apart -- they had no good options. They still couldn't jump to \"Xbox 4\". Maybe \"720\" would have worked.

This looks nice, for sure. But it’s really more of the same. Not surprising. It does surprise me that there’s such emphasis on it, though. There’s the name, of course, and then the entire video is based around “it’s the same thing but a little better.” Game console updates used to be big deals. The SNES was a revolution. PS2 was huge. Now… PS5? What’s different from PS4, again? Is there a 6? What’s different about that? I don’t blame Nintendo or the others. I have no idea what they could do here they would be revolutionary. I think the design space has just been thoroughly explored by now and that’s where we are. This pattern repeats all over the place. TVs are maxed out, with better visual quality than people care about, and size limited by wall space. Computers get a little faster every year. This year’s phones are last year’s phones with a minor performance bump and slightly better cameras. And again, I don’t see what they can do better, and that’s probably how it has to be at this point. But it’s still a little shocking to see a company lean so far into the theme of “we made incremental improvements to this thing we released 8 years ago.” reply isk517 2 hours agoparent>The SNES was a revolution Nintendo has actually stated they view the SNES as a evolution of the NES. They have directly stated their hardware development cycle goes Revolution>Evolution>Revolution. Considering that the Switch was considered one of their revolutionary leap (their first hybrid console) it is no surprise the Switch 2 is a simple evolution of that concept. If their next console is another iteration of the Switch THEN it is safe to say they are no longer aiming to revolutionize their hardware. Edit: After tons of searching I am starting to think that I am misremembering thing. I think this idea came about from the Wii's 'Revolution' code name and I Mandela Effected myself into think there was a interview we're either Miyamoto or Iwata talked about this being there philosophy when designing system. reply staticman2 53 minutes agorootparentThat really sounds like something someone made up in marketing. The Wii came about because an independent company pitched motion control technology to Nintendo and they liked it and licensed it. Not because of the 3d chess game of going from \"evolutions\" to \"revolutions\". The Switch came about because it's less expensive to make software for a single hardware unit than a separate handheld and console and this became an issue as games got more expensive to make. reply hedora 2 hours agorootparentprevI’d be curious to know when they said that. It sounds like revisionist history to me. Based on the switch launch video, the delta between the NES and SNES was much higher than Switch -> Switch 2. Here’s an analogous snes ad, which spends most of its time showing off 3d and increased sprite counts: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eSBFw93V3Rg reply isk517 1 hour agorootparentSorry, tried to find the interview and failed.

Feel free to not take my word that this was actually stated. reply MetaWhirledPeas 4 hours agoparentprev> Game console updates used to be big deals. The SNES was a revolution. PS2 was huge. There are two categories of \"big deal\". The SNES and PS2 were big deals simply because game graphics had so much headroom for improvement. Now that the low-hanging fruits of color palette, resolution, frame rate, texture quality, animation quality, and geometric complexity have all been squeezed, the improvements are more asymptotic. The other \"big deal\" category is gimmicks. I would argue that while it is a hallmark of Nintendo, the gimmicks have flopped as often as not. Most of Nintendo's big sellers were fairly conventional. (The most glaring exceptions being the original Game Boy, the Wii, and the Switch.) I'm glad they do the gimmicks, but I'm also glad they don't only do the gimmicks. reply wat10000 58 minutes agorootparentExactly. For a while you could have huge improvements from better hardware. Then there were some cool new gimmicks. Now both of those seem to be played out. And that’s happening across the board. All the stuff I’d go ogle in Best Buy as a teenager is now basically maxed out both in terms of hardware and gimmicks. reply Al-Khwarizmi 3 hours agorootparentprevBut those are three hells of exceptions (can you actually do that in English? I was trying to pluralize \"a hell of an exception\"). They are the 3rd, 4th and 7th best selling consoles of all time. And you forgot the dual screen in the DS (2nd best selling of all time). Maybe many of the gimmicks flopped, but others wildly succeeded and Nintendo wouldn't be what it is without them. In fact, it probably wouldn't even make consoles by now, following the fate of Sega. reply LZ_Khan 43 minutes agoparentprevHold up, what's the \"revolution\" between the PS1 and PS2? More processing power? You could argue that no consoles in the Xbox or Playstation line are revolutionary, as they're the same format as the original SNES just with more buttons and processing power. I would say the major shifts in controller type is simply a much rarer change than simple spec upgrades. reply oneeyedpigeon 4 hours agoparentprev> But it’s still a little shocking to see a company lean so far into the theme of “we made incremental improvements to this thing we released 8 years ago.” It's certainly more 'shocking' to see Nintendo do it than, say, Microsoft or Sony. But Nintendo hasn't always introduced huge new changes with a console bump — NES->SNES wasn't particularly revolutionary, and there were certainly no gimmicks there. I think it's a very understandable reaction to a) the Wii U b) the enormous success of the Switch reply wat10000 4 hours agorootparentNES->SNES didn’t do much with the form factor or the controls, but technologically it was an enormous leap. That’s the sort of thing that just can’t happen anymore, since video game technology is pretty much maxed out. You can always make things a little bit prettier, or have a little better framerate, but nothing too interesting. I suppose VR/AR is the one area where something big could still happen. The current state of the art there is far from the “mostly limited by the size of your wall” stage. reply corytheboyd 2 hours agorootparentI feel like VR would have “happened with the masses” by now given that the quest is wireless, excellent quality, and cheap. Personally I think it did, and it’s a success, it’s just that it has a lower ceiling because it’s an awkward rectangle that you strap to your face. There is also, IMO, a huge software quality problem with VR. I am baffled as to why all the first person games don’t copy Alyx’s control scheme, it’s the only one that feels correct to use. The rest of the first person games feel awful to play, once you get past the gimmick of “wow cool”. Music/rhythm games work really well for VR, but that’s always going to be a niche market. I play beat saber all the time, it’s fantastic. Everything else seems to be sandbox games. Fucking sandbox games. They’re funny the first time, but you can only throw objects so many times before the magic is lost, you just wish there was an actual game there to play. I love VR, and I hope developers continue to innovate with it, but it’s never going to overtake console gaming, it’s just too different. I don’t get why we think AR is going to be any different for games. Why would I want to see my living room while playing a game? VR puts you in whole other worlds. It’s… that simple, I think. reply wat10000 1 hour agorootparentThose limitations provide room for something revolutionary. Figure out how to do VR without a giant rectangle strapped to your face, figure out better controls, figure out motion sickness, and you’ll have a revolutionary device. For AR, I’m not thinking games, but computing in general. Glasses (or better yet, contacts) that can overlay things on your field of view could be huge. That could be the thing to displace smartphones once this becomes possible and actually good. reply oneeyedpigeon 4 hours agorootparentprevVR and, at some point, 3D. reply xnx 4 hours agorootparentElaborate.

NES was only side loading because in the US Nintendo was trying to distance itself from the consoles that came before. reply mcphage 4 hours agorootparentprevThey did release a top-loading NES as well, although it came out after the SNES. reply hibikir 3 hours agoparentprevThis all comes down to what the hardware improvements can mean in practice. It's not as if hardware isn't moving up, but that the new kinds of things double the hardware unlocks are much smaller than they used to be. This is best seen on the PC market. What a gaming desktop today has running on it is, compute wise, unimaginably stronger than the best available 10-20 years ago. The increases in hardware just keep coming. But there's limits on how much more you can get out of being able to push more polygons, or to put more pixels on screen. We can do all kinds of extra photorealistic things in real time that before would have to be done only in movies, and rendered in server farms for weeks at a time. But the increased difficulty doesn't quite match how impressive the extra effects are. You can also notice this by just playing old games, and seeing how they hold up. We can make 2d pixel art games that are much better than what a SNES could do, but many of those games still hold up just fine. Meanwhile most 3d games of the Playstation and even the PS2 era are downright painful, because the increases in power between generations back then lead to big practical differences in capability. A ps5 is much stronger than a ps4, hardware wise, but it didn't unlock much at all. All the extra power can get you cooler reflections on cyberpunk, and you can go even further with a PC that has over $1000 in video cards in it. But those reflections and atmospheric effects are eating up as much hardware as the rest of the game. reply wat10000 56 minutes agorootparentIt’s some of each. Hardware is improving substantially slower than it used to. And at the same time, what you get out of better hardware has hit steeply diminishing returns. reply surgical_fire 4 hours agoparentprev> PS2 was huge PS2 was literally just an iteration on the PS1. More powerful console, DVD instead of CD, and that was it. Nothing really new there. Hell, the Switch 2 is more innovative than the PS2 was in terms of iteration on a previous console. reply wat10000 4 hours agorootparent“More powerful” was enough to be a step change at the time. You’d get huge improvements in image quality, realism, and immersion. Now, compare a new game with one from ten years ago. The new one looks a little better. Not much. reply kypro 3 hours agorootparentThe graphics bump you'd see from next gen systems prior 2010 was massive. So big in fact that it would unlock new genres of games which weren't previously possible. ps1 > ps2 was pretty huge too because I'd argue the ps2 marked the first generation of consoles where games could move away from pixelated cartoony characters and into photo-realistic graphics and just about pull it off. Today you get better lighting and shadows, or slightly higher FPS which is nice, but it doesn't really change the types of games you can make in the way the ps2 did. reply staticman2 34 minutes agorootparentprevPS1 launched without analog controls.

I just fear this will cause western media and politicians to and declare the crisis to be over (after it had began on Oct. 7, of course absolutely out of the blue and without any context...) and go back to pretending everything is back to normal. Never mind that Gaza is still in ruins, the west bank is still being annexed, Israel still has the dual role of \"all authority, no obligations\" over the Palestinians, while making it pretty clear they have no vision for them at all, apart from \"maybe they just vanish into thin air tomorrow\". And never mind that Israel still has a fundamentalist, authoritarian government that is actively at work undermining democratic structures and civil rights even inside the state - that too with no word of objection from its allies. We'll see where all of that goes. I also found Trump's signalling in the whole issue odd. His base and his cabinet is full of the most hard-line pro-israel figures imaginable, but then he goes forward and quotes Jeffrey Sachs and ostensibly pressures Netanyahu into accepting the ceasefire. Is this just his usual \"appear unpredictable by all means\" spiel or does he have a strategy there? reply macspoofing 5 hours agoparentThis is a one-sided description of the conflict. I am empathetic to Israel, because they also do not have a lot options. Israel, as it it currently constituted (based on 1967 borders) is not a viable state if the West Bank is a hostile entity with a standing army, and funded to a similar extent as Hezbollah. The West Bank bulges into Israel and effectively cuts the country in half and places all strategic targets within shelling distance. The Palestinian position seems to be \"trust us that if you give us full, un-fettered independence, then we will not be a hostile entity\" - but that's asking for Israel to place an enormous amount of trust in present and future Palestinian people and leaders, without any historical reasons to base this on, and highlighted by the worst case scenario of Hezbollah in the north, a foreign-controlled militia funded to the tune of 1 billion / year, and potential a hostile party in the West Bank (and Gaza) - effectively surrounding the country. And it is more than just demilitarization. A demilitarized Palestine is not enough if, for example, Iran funnels hundreds of millions of dollars in arms to militia groups. Hence we are where we are .. with Israel unable to disengage because doing so presents an existential risk to their nation. reply pjc50 4 hours agorootparent> Israel, as it it currently constituted (based on 1967 borders) is not a viable state if the West Bank is a hostile entity with a standing army, and funded to a similar extent as Hezbollah.

This is exactly the same argument that Russia has been using to annex territories such as Crimea; \"it's strategically important for us\" isn't really sufficient justification for mass murder, and - on a purely geographic point - talking about the West Bank doesn't justify anything to do with Gaza, which is geographically separate. And why the 1967 borders rather than the 1948 ones? > Iran funnels hundreds of millions of dollars in arms to militia groups. This is the side that's not really been raised enough in this whole discussion. If Israel's war is with Iran, why is that war not being carried out in Iran?

Russia is the largest country on earth, whereas the distance from the West Bank to Tel-Aviv is like 5 miles. This roughly like arguing that owning a personal nuke is no different from owning a firecracker. The scale of the threats are separated by several orders of magnitude. >And why the 1967 borders rather than the 1948 ones? Because the Palestinians rejected the 1948 borders, started a war, and then lost.

The Russian state is not under an existential threat in the same way that Israel would be with Hezbollah in the north, and a similar entity in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel is a tiny nation with a tiny population. Russian and Israel's security issues are simply not comparable. >talking about the West Bank doesn't justify anything to do with Gaza, which is geographically separate They are linked, and highlight the core problem to Israel - namely - disengagement does not work with a hostile entity. Israel in 2005 disengaged from Gaza. It wasn't a full disengagement as Israel still exerted control over the airspace and territorial water, but it also wasn't nothing and it was an olive-branch and a big opportunity. Instead it resulted in a Hamas electoral victory, and rocket attacks, and a circle of retaliatory actions from Israel and Hamas. Imagine a world, where post-disengagement there were no attacks from Gaza, no preparation for war and smuggling of weapons into Gaza by Hamas - by this point, where would we be? Would Israel still maintain the same kind of blockade? I just don't think so. I truly believe it would be a model for permanent peace and Palestinian statehood. >And why the 1967 borders rather than the 1948 ones? I mentioned 1967 borders, because as best as I can gather, that is the current Palestinian position. Although it isn't clear exactly what the Palestinian position is as Palestinians do tend to maintain some level of ambiguity on this point. > If Israel's war is with Iran, why is that war not being carried out in Iran?

It didn't come from nowhere. Then that was followed up by yet another war against Israel in 1973. reply hylaride 4 hours agorootparentprevI don't disagree with you, but will comment. There is a justifiable argument for Israel to occupy the west bank and/or the Gaza strip (whether one agrees or not is another matter that I will not get into). Settling it is another matter entirely, and this action is what causes so much grief. But what Palestinian supporters continuously fail to grasp is that every time Israel has tried to give (and there were many attempts in the 1980s and 1990s), bad actors have caused violence. This violence was a huge cause in support shifting to right-wing parties in Israel. The tragedy is that a plurality of Palestinians would otherwise love to have a peaceful (two state or otherwise) solution, but the \"bad\" ones are well funded by outsiders, in particular Iran. If a Gandhi/Martin Luther King/Nelson Mandela figure emerged, they'd almost certainly be killed by Hamas,Hezbollah,etc. But at the end of the day, there's no way the extreme elements of either side will agree to a permanent and dignified peace, because even if it would work it would mean the end of either of them (and Israeli PM was assassinated by a far-right Jewish nationalist). I'm sympathetic to both sides myself. I'm sympathetic to Israel's position, need for security, and the fact that hostility against them is a given. I'm also sympathetic to the fact that the Palestinian people were pushed off their land, often with violence to a level that can fit the definition of genocide, during Israel's independence and subsequent annexations. But there will never be a true peace so long as the extremists on both sides have as much power as they do. I know most Iranians are fed up with their government. My Iranian colleagues all are commenting that even devoutly religious Iranians back home are getting fed up. A lot of this is a house of cards, so I guess we'll see. reply mapt 3 hours agorootparentThe fact that we use the term \"Settling\" and \"Settlers\" is kind of grotesque. These places are occupied, by Palestinians, who have to be ethnically cleansed (with varying degrees of violence) in order to establish new Israeli Jewish settlements. This is done with Israeli Jewish soldiers, a hundred thousand of whom now patrol hundreds of enclaves and all major routes through the West Bank. Isreali and US right-wing leaders find a hostile Iran to be extremely politically convenient, and the military-industrial complex that they share with each other and with centrist parties just wants a reason to keep existing. People talk about a potential \"War with Iran\", but in reality we've given them maybe a dozen different diplomatic casus belli in the past decade, in part to deter them from political moderation. reply troyvit 2 hours agorootparentThat's how the term is used in the U.S. as well, when history classes describe \"settlers\" who wiped out the Native Americans who lived here through genocide, germ warfare, regular ol' warfare and displacement.

Smuggled arms, terrorism, eventual war, carpet bombing. The essential geopolitical issue is that the Palestinians have never functionally accepted being defeated.

All roads lead to devastating military defeat politically. The economic basis of their existence (oil money) is rapidly fading. Old allies are now aligned with Israel (Sunni Arabs), impotent (Russia/Syria), or regionally deflated (Iran). Global warming is worsening.

What? They should just go back to Poland! /s reply pron 7 hours agorootparentprevEthnocentric racism is never good and it is, indeed, rampant in Israel, but it's hard to compare European colonialism to Zionism for a few reasons. The cultural and historical affinity of Jews, including Jews residing in Europe, was nothing like that of Europeans to the Americas, Africa, or East Asia. For well over a millennium Jews were praying for a return to Zion three times a day, even after the collapse of the Roman Empire and its later conquest (from the Byzantine Empire) by the Arab Islamic Empire, there have been many (small) migrations of Jews to the area [1], there has been an uninterrupted (small) presence of Jews there, and Jews in Europe were considered \"racially\" oriental \"semites\". Unlike European-style settler- or exploitation colonialism, there wasn't any metropole to Zionism, in the name of which colonisation was taking place. Finally, the bigger migration by modern Zionism in the time of the Ottoman Empire (that is when this conflict started, not under the Brits, who came into the picture -- after Tel Aviv was a city), came as a result of difficulties the Jews experienced in Europe and the Russian Empire, and certainly not on behalf of those powers. That's not to say that Israel (like all countries in North and South America, Australia, and New Zealand) isn't a form of settler colonialism [1], sometimes openly and consciously so, but it is different from European colonialism (and in some respects it can be different for the worse, at least compared to some specific European colonies). So yes, some things are simple, but your comparisons to things that were quite different actually shows how other things are not so simple. But it is precisely because history is often complex and almost never easily generalisable that I hate using it either as moral justification or condemnation of present events. I don't think that the fact both Arabs and Jews came to the Levant through migration and conquest (even according to both culture's own national mythology) has any bearing on present moral responsibility. In the end, as you say, ethnocentric nationalism is just wrong. [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_and_Judais...

Even from this population, there is a bottleneck around 600 to 800 years ago where the population was down to 350 individuals [1]. By and large very very few Jews in Palestine/Israel are able to claim Levantine/Semitic genetic ancestry. Many Palestinians and other Levantine people in Palestine who now practice Islam are far more likely have to have ancestors that were once Jewish that actually lived in historical kingdom of Israel prior to 70 AD when Titus and Vespasian crushed a revolt there. The ancestors of these folks that today practice Islam in Palestine likely converted to Islam sometime after 637 AD when Arabs started to settle in Palestine. It's pretty commonly accepted all over the world since basically forever that ownership is bequeathed from parents to children. This means that those who are Islamic today but whose genetic ancestors practiced Judaism in the past and lived in the historical kingdom of Israel have far greater claim to the land than folks who have no genetic ancestry to the Kingdom of Israel and instead have ancestry with no genetic relationship that converted to Judaism about 1105 to 1285 years ago.

There are no human races, though, at least not ones based on phenotypical traits. Genetic analysis can reveal indications of regions and ethnic origins but these are barely linked to phenotypical traits and cannot be inferred from the latter. Linguistic communities are the bearers of a shared culture, not anything related to the bogus and outdated concept of \"human races.\" It's also worth pointing out that the claim that \"racial migration is wrong\" does not follow from any of the other considerations, nor is it needed to support them in any way.

The evidence simply does not support that. Sholomo Sand is not a geneticist nor was his hypothesis based on genetics. The fact that he's a Israeli history professor doesn't mean much here. The man didn't want to be a Jew, religiously or ethnically, and found the most complete way to accomplish it. reply SurgicalDoc_UK 8 hours agorootparentprevGenealogical research shows the strongest link between the ancient Canaanites and the current middle east population is with the Palestinians and Lebanese. There are some genetic links between Palestinians and the ancient Israelites with this theory that many converted to Islam after the invasion. However, you are correct in that many historians describe the population was added to, and never replaced. Supporting the DNA links. From this I would conclude that the Palestinians are indigenous through the pre-colonial link. Most Jews in Israel are not indigenous but they share cultural links and lets not forget the wars they won in 1948 and 1967. What is bizarre, is the ban on genetic testing for Palestinians and this pseudo-history in Israel that Palestinians never existed. Something distorted is being taught in Israel at many levels. reply woodruffw 5 hours agorootparentprevYou’re conflating two theories: one widespread, and one fringe. The theory that the Ashkenazi population experienced a bottleneck is widely accepted; claiming that Ashkenazim are actually a remnant of the Khazar Khanganate[1] is both fringe and typically associated with antisemitic conspiracies. (Note that I say antisemitic, and not in a manner that involves conflation with Zionism: going against the overwhelming majority of generic evidence to make a claim about a Jewish ethnic group that doesn’t even majority reside in Israel reeks of a blood-and-boden anger against Jews because of who they are.)

Countries were established and fought for in blood all thorough history, and the winners kept their land. End of story. Unless we are talking about some remote village, every single country was funded on blood and violence, and after a certain point it just makes no sense to track it. reply weatherlite 4 hours agorootparentprev> In 1872, less than 4% of Palestine was Jewish.

Only through the lens of ethnocentric histories is any distinction made. reply slt2021 13 hours agorootparentprevthere are several flaws in your typical zionist argument: 1. jews as a minority have lived in the lands of Filistine and Jerusalem peacefully and coexisted just fine for millennia, before the zionist project. 2. the fact that small minority of jews lived there does not give an excuse to ethnically cleanse the local population of arabs. 3. the claim that modern european jews from Rhine and pale of settlement (AshkeNazi) have any connection to ancient Israelites from 2000+ years ago is laughable. Most genetic analysis proved that it is Palestinians, Jordanian Christians are native to the land, not european settlers from Poland, Lithuania, Belorussia, Ukraine with last names like Mileikowsky (Bibi's actual name), Mabovitch (golda's name) etc. 4. Filistine and Jerusalem did not have a problem with antisemitism and jew hate, UNTIL european settlers showed up. Antisemitism is purely european concept imported into Middle East. 5. All studies have shown that Israel/zionism is a colonial settler project created by Brits to secure Suez Canal from the ottomans.

Iraqi jews did not even want to migrate to Israel and leave Iraq.

That part of the peninsula was fully invaded and governed by muslims. Already for two centuries. The massacre perpetrators were a muslim mob. You're being presented with perfectly valid arguments, clearly proving that your point is false, and still insisting on ignoring them because they don't agree with your narrative. You're in bad faith. reply slt2021 10 hours agorootparentThe grand point still stands: when compared to Europe, Arab world largely coexisted and lived peacefully with jewish community. Until zionist settlers showed up. Antisemitism is purely european concept, and some might argue that expulsion of jewish people from Europe to Middle East was the original Final Solution by Hitler (before he decided to just kill everyone).

Ashkenazi just means “someone from Ashkenaz,” which is what early medieval Jews called Germany. (It’s almost impossible to engage with this comment, because of how ridiculous it is: for one, the majority of Ashkenazi Jews don’t even live in Israel. For another, intentionally using an ethnic identity as a stand-in for Nazism is cartoonishly offensive.) reply bawolff 12 hours agorootparentprev> ICC and ICJ's accusations of genocide by israel The ICC has not accused Israel (or any Israeli leader) of criminal genocide. They have accused them of some other things, many serious,but not genocide. The ICJ hasn't ruled on the south africa case, so i think its wrong to say they have accused Israel. South Africa has accused, the ICJ is in the process of deciding if their accusation has merit but hasn't ruled yet. reply klipt 11 hours agorootparentprevArabs like Syria's Assad have murdered half a million people but it would still be incredibly racist to call all Arabs \"ArabNazis\" on that basis. reply sudosysgen 13 hours agorootparentprevArab is not a race. Most Arabs never arrived from anywhere, they were locals who adopted (often violently, sometimes not) large parts of Arab culture for long enough to consider themselves Arabs. The Arabians never had the resources or population to engage in settler colonialism you are thinking of. Even if they wanted to (and perhaps they did), they just couldn't go around replacing anyone. So from the start the conception of Arab is about peoples slowly becoming Arab, not being replaced by arriving Arabs, in large part. reply seventhtiger 11 hours agorootparentThis is true of most old empires. Romans, Persians, Arabs, Mongols, early Ottomans generally don't setttle areas they conquer. They don't engage in industrial extraction either. They form a ruling class and collect taxes. Any cultural influence that have was because of longevity rather than any interest in forced conversion. People project their impressions of more modern empires to pre-industrial ones that didn't have the same aspirations or even institutions to accomplish those aspirations. reply shenberg 6 hours agorootparentThat's really not true, e.g. the wikipedia page on population transfer in the Ottoman empire[1]. This dates way back to the Assyrian and Persian empries explicitly moving conquered peoples around in their empires in order to safeguard their rule. This book on population transfer in the Ottoman empire[2] explicitly states, with references, that the Ottomans habits were inherited from the steppe Turks, the Byzantines (=the Romans) and the Arabs.

Is that \"importation\" also a \"deliberate provocation\"? reply redmajor12 10 hours agorootparentprevTrue, but Israel could be seen as just the latest Crusade. reply raxxor 9 hours agorootparentprevThat is wrong. There were conflicts before, the Hebron massacre (1929) for example. There was an Arab nationalism and the Mufti of Jerusalem met with Hitler and planned a middle-eastern Holocaust. Also, Jews were expelled from surrounding nations when Israel was founded, even more than Palestinians were driven from what now is Israel. There never was any compensation or talk about their right to return and these are not Jews with European ancestry. Frankly, I think not a single statement of yours is true. reply awaywithcovid 8 hours agorootparentprev\"The current conflict isn't some thousand year old feud\" Well, actually, it is. There were 1200 years of war, conquest, slavery, ethnic cleansing, genocide and apartheid up until the caliphate was defeated and broken up in 1920/1924. For 1200 years, non-muslims lived under apartheid (Dhimmi). Up until that point, Islamic supremacism was as firmly established as white supremacism was in America. I suppose if America (which itself was built on war, conquest, slavery, ethnic cleansing, genocide, and apartheid) was defeated in WWI, broken up into various nations, and some land was made available to the Native Americans to build their own sovereign nation, you would be against that ? After all, at that time, Native Americans accounted for only .25% of the population. Since there were so few of them it would make no sense for them to have their own nation. Wars have consequences. Many ethnic groups lost their lands due to the expansion of the caliphate over 1200 years. The caliphate was then defeated, and things have changed. \"... ethno-centric racism are never good\". While in no way saying that this supports the idea that \"ethno-centric racism\" is good, you should read the constitutions of the 22 Arab countries in the Arab League. They have, as their basic principals that they are Arab/Muslim countries, and have Islam/Sharia as their law. So, are all of these countries also illegitimate ? Or, just Israel ? Or maybe America should change its constitution to declare that America is a white European country based on Christian law ? reply shprd 6 hours agorootparent> some land was made available to the Native Americans to build their own sovereign nation, you would be against that ? You know that would have been great. But who are the native Americans in your example? Majority of Zionists that established Israel and their groups arrived by ships from Europe. Wouldn't that more resemble England and Spain colonization expeditions in your example? Weird.. like the story almost matches exactly to the how colonies were established Such an ironic example to give voluntarily. Let's take a look at the background of Israel's founding fathers and where did they came from: - David Ben-Gurion - Poland - Aharon Zisling - Belarus - David Remez - Russia - Pinchas Rosen - Germany - Moshe Sharett - Ukraine - Haim-Moshe Shapira - Belarus - Yehuda Leib Maimon - Moldova - Mordechai Bentov - Russia - ... Case in point, most weren't natives who lived there under \"apartheid\" but actually left Europe looking for a new land, backed by... England and the US (Sorry Spain, not this time). If you're struggling to use the real events in history and have to resort to a \"hypothesis\", it's a sign something is off and you're twisting history a bit too much. At least make sure it's not ironic, next time. reply dralley 20 minutes agorootparentIf you were a European Jew in the late 1940s after the fall of the Nazis, you were still faced with the prospect of living under the local governance of Nazi collaborators, continued pogroms [0] and antisemitism, and potentially Joseph Stalin's USSR. It's not like everything immediately went back to normal, either in real terms or psychological ones. Even if you survived your friends, family and neighbors are GONE. It's unsurprising that many wouldn't want to reintegrate with that society after what they experienced, even if they managed to avoid the camps (and especially if they didn't). It is ridiculous to just throw them into the same category with the English and Spanish colonists searching for riches in the New World. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kielce_pogrom reply awaywithcovid 5 hours agorootparentprevThere is nothing made up about 1200 years of oppression by an empire that was built on conquest, numerous forms of slavers, ethnic cleaning, and genocide. This is not something that happened thousands of years ago, it ended 100 years ago, and is directly relevant to what is going on today. The fact that some of the founders of Israel were the descendants of those who fled their native lands due to oppression does not change anything, any more than Palestinians who are born in different countries would no longer have ties to their homeland in the Middle East. And yes, I firmly believe that the Palestinians have a right to a country of their own, but not at the cost of eliminating Israel and imposing sharia law reply shprd 3 hours agorootparent> The fact that some of the founders of Israel were the descendants of those who fled their native lands Only some founders were foreigners?

    "commentBody": "Sweden brings more books and handwriting practice back to its schools (2023) (apnews.com)415 points by redbell 23 hours agohidepastfavorite305 comments submeta 22 hours agoI went fully digital some years ago, gave away most of my printed books and bought ebooks only. Now I have my whole library in Calibre and on my Kindle. Why? Because I have my whole library with me. And I can download my highlights and process them. Into notes in Obsidian, that I can link to in my study notes. Recently I started buying paper based books again. Man, I missed holding physical books in my hands. And I start to regret having gotten rid of my physical library. There were so many memories I had with most of these books. I remember their covers, and instantly my emotions , thoughts, feelings are triggered. I don’t have these emotions when I think of my digital books. My spouse has books that she was gifted when she was a child. Still in our kids shelf. I cannot give her my digital books. I regret the decision having gone fully digital, which can only be a complement to physical books. Printed books are a physical experience. Something that allows me to attach thoughts, emotions, feelings to it. And they can become part of my life. Like a good friend. reply NoboruWataya 21 hours agoparentAnd let's be honest, a good book collection is a great addition to a room, aesthetically. People tend not to talk about that aspect, I think they worry about being seen as pretentious showing off their books. But I think a book collection can be a great decoration, just as flowers or a painting can be. And if you have family or friends over and one of them sees something they like, you can lend it to them there and then (if you are so inclined). Some of my earliest reading-related memories are being in an uncle's or neighbour's house and being fascinated by a book on a shelf that they kindly let me take home to read. reply illiac786 8 hours agorootparentI actually made the opposite experience. Books nowadays have so many different format and colors, it’s really hard to make it esthetically pleasing, I have multiple walls full of books and they look like a mess, I dislike it. Even if I could make it look nice, it would then be an intellectual mess, it wouldn’t be organised properly, I would struggle to find anything. Actually, good question, how do you people organise your books? (Full disclosure, I’m messy) reply duckmysick 7 hours agorootparentI organize them by the color, either rainbow-style or from darker to brighter. > it wouldn’t be organised properly, I would struggle to find anything. Libraries solve this with the Dewey Decimal Classification. Most people don't have enough books for it make sense though. For me, I don't have that many paper books and the ones I own I know by the side and the color. I keep the books that I reference often in a separate place. I noticed I don't need to find all of the books, all of the time. So organize most of your books to look pretty. You can also group similar books together on a single shelf and then order them by color. For example I have a dozen of cookbooks and those go on a separate shelf, arranged in a rainbow. I also have a book series that goes neatly together, so I keep them it grouped too. I also organize my clothes like that too. By general category first (t-shirts, pants, socks, jackets), and then by color. I used to be extremely messy too (piles of clothes and documents, cardboard boxes, you know the deal). I turned it around after I read the Marie Kondo book \"The life-changing Magic of Tidying up\". Then after I got the mess under control I look at the pictures for inspiration how to make it aesthetically pleasing. I got a lot of ideas from Pinterest (I know, I know), but you can do an image search or check the organization subreddits too. reply sateesh 4 hours agorootparentOrganizing books by colour, couldn't resist the link to Two Ronnies :) https://youtu.be/AYxmPHLU9oA?si=n8OACTqPyZ12oWeA reply iamacyborg 7 hours agorootparentprevLearn French and then you can have a wall of books with white spines. reply internet_points 7 hours agorootparentprevPut them backwards in the shelves – now everything is calm and paper-coloured. reply mrweasel 5 hours agorootparentDoesn't that make it exceedingly hard to locate specific books? One thing I have notices about modern books is that they are a freaking huge. I have a large number of novels from the 1970s. Their are all 250 - 400 pages, about the the same as my wife's moderns books about people getting murdered. The 50 year old books are less than half the size. Why is there a need to make modern books into tomes? reply wholinator2 5 hours agorootparentProbably makes it feel more legitimate and \"booky\". Some young people i know got obsessed with the idea they should read more because it makes people more intelligent. Then they choose the murder of the week to read. If it's the same size as Anna Karenina and The Brothers Karamazov it feels much weightier and important. In addition to flashy colorful covers, I'd imagine it's just an effective marketing choice reply mrweasel 5 hours agorootparentProbably right about the \"booky\"-ness. Sadly I really like the older sizes much better, but very little is published in that \"form factor\". reply djhn 20 hours agorootparentprevAnd they improve room acoustics a decent amount, making the space that much more pleasant. reply Obscurity4340 20 hours agorootparentAre books like a natural version of those fancy futuristic sound panels in recording studios? reply bongodongobob 18 hours agorootparentYeah, diffusers. Smears first reflection time. Probably some low end absorbtion too. reply freehorse 9 hours agorootparentThat would require quite a lot of books. reply bongodongobob 3 hours agorootparentWhat would? A bookshelf is literally a diffuser and bass traps are all about mass. reply knighthack 18 hours agorootparentprevWhile I agree with the sentiment, I have hesitation in letting people see what I read. In a way, you're letting people see the nature of things that you read - from which they might glean the nature of your thoughts, and privacy is something we all value. For that reason (and since I don't have any particular sentimental value for books, only their contents) I've long since preferred a digital library. As a minimalist, having a single Kindle on the table is aesthetics enough for me, which is complementary of the minimalist viewpoint as well. However, I completely agree with the fact that having a physical library is a very conducive environment for kids to grow up with. I remember fun memories of my childhood reading from the home library, and thinking how pretty and colourful the shelves were too. But I think there should be a distinction between cultivating a library for your kids, versus that for the observation and assessment of strangers. reply dbtc 16 hours agorootparentThat, to me, is closer to a policy of isolation than privacy, which sounds unhealthy to me, unless maybe you're some kind professional spy or military strategist. Privacy is good; so are water and salt. We also value connection. Minimalism is secretly about maximizing something, perhaps empty space and silence, or perhaps something else that you love. Finally, life is layered on as we live it - that kid is still in there somewhere ;) I'm not trying to prescribe necessarily, just giving a different point of view. reply baq 10 hours agorootparentprev> While I agree with the sentiment, I have hesitation in letting people see what I read. Woah there. Nobody* is showing off their playboy collection either. The visible bookshelf is just what you want others to see. You don’t even have to read those books. It’s like your Facebook wall - a facade of yourself. * of course there are people proud of their playboy collection and showing it off reply Saigonautica 15 hours agorootparentprevI've been thinking about this a lot lately. I share what I read, but only with very close friends. I'm hesitant to lend books out -- people are not great at returning them (partly my fault, I'm also bad at tracking the loans). I also have a hard time finding my books, as I live in a very small house (bookshelves are out of the question, it's numbered bins). I am also wary of most of the cloud services in this domain. So I wrote a little software to manage the situation -- just a simple CRUD thing that lets me manage a small personal library, or a small shared library between friends. It's not a \"social network for books\" or something grand like that. Just a simple self-hosted thing with minimal system requirements. There were some existing solutions, but none that really felt right. It's published (open source) and has a few users, but I don't think I'll be able to manage it, if it receives a giant burst of attention. On github it's called 'ubiblio'. Perhaps I'll be ready to share it more generally in a few months. Not sure if it's useful to you, but I hope it is! reply Loughla 17 hours agorootparentprevDo you not have human conversations with your friends and family? That's also a way for them to learn about you. I like your view in this because it's just so different than anything I've thought before. Having books in common areas sparks conversation, real, substantive conversation with family, friends, and acquaintances. It's one of my favorite things to talk about at get togethers. reply michaelt 8 hours agorootparentprev> I have hesitation in letting people see what I read [...] privacy is something we all value. Other people are replying to you acting like this is strange, but it's actually something normal people do all the time. Every politician being interviewed from their home for TV news, every professor recording video lectures, every remote working CEO, and every twitch streamer has considered what is on display behind them. If I choose shelves as my background, do I want eagle-eyed viewers to see my copies of playboy, my figurines of naked anime ladies, and my copies of the communist manifesto and mein kampf? As a matter of fact I don't. reply kristiandupont 7 hours agorootparentI get that sentiment, it's not like I would put everything on display indiscriminately. However, a statement like this \"they might glean the nature of your thoughts\", strikes me as .. lonely, if nothing else. I want privacy from Facebook and the general public, etc. But people that I invite into my house are people I am going to have conversations with and I want them to know the \"real me\", whatever that means, or at least a closer approximation of it. I certainly wouldn't want them to think that my political beliefs are something completely different from what they actually are. reply tolerance 17 hours agorootparentprevHow do you get along with communicating to others? reply brador 15 hours agorootparentprevAmazon through the kindle is storing massive amounts of data about your reading habits. Statistically, and inevitably, this information will be used against your best interests. Maybe simply to sell you something you don’t need, to price up your insurance, or as a layup to a precrime you have yet to commit. If reading privacy matter a kindle isn’t it. Imho. reply bnetd 14 hours agorootparentprev>In a way, you're letting people see the nature of things that you read - from which they might glean the nature of your thoughts Nobody cares what you think. But if there are state-sponsored actors that do, they have way more insight into your life than the _nature of things that you read_ from physical texts you own. Digital library gives off a much resonant footprint in this regard. reply Clubber 16 hours agorootparentprev>from which they might glean the nature of your thoughts, and privacy is something we all value. I mean you let them into your house, privacy kinda goes out the window when you do that. You can always put books you don't want people to know you read in your bedroom or something. reply eleveriven 11 hours agorootparentprevIt’s a window into your interests, personality reply graemep 22 hours agoparentprevI will not buy DRMed ebooks. I hate the idea that someone can delete a book I bought. Once I have a book, I want to keep it. I have quite a lot of books that belong to be grandfather, and lots that belonged to my parents.

If you live in the USA you're violating the DMCA, if you live in the EU it is the EUCD which you'll be breaking, elsewhere there may be similar directives. That 'they get their money' does not make any difference here, it is the 'circumvention of technological protection measures' which makes you into a law breaker. reply op00to 18 hours agorootparentOh well.

Still trivial to remove DRM from Kobo, Google Play, any place that uses Adobe DRM. reply EA-3167 21 hours agorootparentprevUnless latest means \"In the last few months\" then no it's still trivial. I buy a lot of \"Kindle\" books, but I always rip the DRM and make an ebook version I actually use and archive. My attitude is that once I pay for a song/game/book/etc... it's no one's business, but my own how I use it (for myself I mean, obviously uploading it to others is a different issue). reply NoboruWataya 19 hours agorootparentprevI think it's easier with some providers than others. I bought an Amazon ebook that I was really struggling to de-DRM (so I promptly returned it and have only bought books with Adobe DRM since). reply seszett 11 hours agorootparentprevIt's probably even easier to download them from Z-Library after having bought them on whatever legal platform. reply nottorp 10 hours agorootparentErm, i have a \"friend\" that has a few fancy signed physical hard covers that were never opened... because they took their sweet time to arrive so said \"friend\" downloaded the epub... Also back in the day when games came on discs, they used to download the no cd crack before opening the shrink wrapped box. reply loughnane 5 hours agorootparentI think we have the same friend. He told me he likes to download a book to get a feel for it… like thumbing through a book in a bookshop. If it’s good, he goes ahead and buys it. reply bluGill 22 hours agorootparentprevOn that note, does anyone have a copy of \"The C programing language\" (first edition) that isn't falling apart because the acid paper is decaying? I was referring to my copy the other day and it is clear the days I own that book are numbered because of planned obsolesce in the 1970s. I never bought the second edition, but if I did I'm sure it too would be falling apart from age before my likely death. reply dokyun 21 hours agorootparentI got a lightly used copy off Amazon, along with \"The UNIX programming environment\" a year or two ago, probably. They're both fine with only a bit of wear, but I don't think they were ever of a super sturdy binding that would hold up well under heavy abuse. reply bluGill 4 hours agorootparentThe binding isn't great, but on my copy the pages themselves are getting brittle. In a few more years if I touch them they will fall to little pieces. reply tartoran 21 hours agorootparentprevFirst edition may be collectible regardless of condition. And as well as newer editions it is resalable. Can you sell an used ebook you bought?

Gosh reply amonith 5 hours agorootparentHonestly probably yes to all of those. Except for small children the dreams are probably also non-visual like in the case of blind people. They probably dream about \"weird feelings\" (chills, shivers, cold, heat etc) and smells and sounds and whatnot. The TST also assumes that some of the instincts are inherited from our ancestors (e.g. that uneasy feeling when you walk alone through the forest at night - because for thousands of years predators could kill you in that exact scenario) so a baby's brain might dream about those feelings too (probably without visuals, just chemically induced feeling of uneasyness). And back to the screen scenario: To the brain \"excitement\" is also \"stressful\" from a chemical PoV. So if you really really enjoyed some game (as a kid or whatnot) you probably dreamt about it too. reply fsiefken 7 hours agorootparentprevthat's interesting, i don't remember my dreams often but I do remember books and comics - I even distinctly remember being lucid, reading a really good comic - but not my screen work or apps.

But about maybe 15 years ago, I stopped buying printed books because I felt guilty - they took up too much space, and it was running scarce. And surely ebooks were superior - no space wasted, I could take an entire library with me, etc. It was just a matter of getting used to them, and abandoning the impractical romanticism of fetishizing the printed page. At that time, I pretty much stopped reading. Now it's obvious why that happened, but at that point I didn't really connect the dots. I thought that I ran into a bad streak of books that just didn't hook me much, and then I was very busy, I always seemed to have something else to do rather than continue reading. So for those hypothetical reasons I went from reading several books per month to one per year, or even less. At some point, I read a printed book and it hooked me like in the old times. And then, it dawned on me that the books being bad, or me being busy, were just excuses. The real reason is that I didn't like electronic reading. I wasn't proud of this. It wasn't a rational attitude. Electronic reading was clearly superior (less space, more flexibility and so on), and the content was exactly the same. I was actually quite ashamed of myself: was I such a shallow person that I didn't appreciate the contents of the literature enough to abstract away from purely materialistic concerns? What kind of person can't appreciate culture or art just because they don't like the medium used to transmit it? But be that as it may, the plain truth was that ebooks didn't hook me, and physical books did, so I admitted it and started buying printed books again. And once again, I'm an avid reader. In the last few years, papers and studies have started to appear saying that with paper reading we retain more, we concentrate more, we learn more, etc... so I have started to reconcile with myself. Maybe I'm not a shallow materialistic asshole after all, and it's just human nature. reply the_af 18 hours agorootparentIt's weird, but I find myself abandoning ebooks much easier than printed books.

I get decision paralysis really quickly because of all the content available at a finger press, but the note taking and accessibility of it all are really nice. But after a while I grow tired of this and buy some hardcover books again and really enjoy that. This cycle has been repeating for me for a long time, I wonder if I'll find a good balance eventually.

And it's actually somewhat surprising how efficient a physical book is! Sure, there's a lot of efficiency to Ctrl-F a text string and just find all the places in a document. I won't deny that it takes me longer to pull up the index, search for the function name in the index, then flip to the page. But then I can just leave the book open at that page on the desk (or my lap). I never have to Alt-Tab, or fiddle with the location of windows to switch between looking at documentation and looking at the code I'm working on. This difference was more stark when I was trying to close-read a different specification to ensure that I understood it well enough to make sure a PR implemented it correctly. I needed to have three different parts of the specification open simultaneously to bounce between all of them. With physical paper, that's just a swish of a hand away. With a PDF reader, well, goto that other section, scroll down to the piece I wanted, now goto the first section again and scroll down again and wait what was that back thing again goto and scroll and scroll and goto and descent into insanity.

The only real difference I've noticed with epubs is they require some annoying software to open and may have DRM. Can't just open it in Preview or the iPhone PDF viewer like normal. reply dredmorbius 1 hour agorootparentprevYes and no. PDF's work well for a sufficiently large e-book reader. Full-sized isn't essential, though I find the 13.3\" display I use is quite pleasant to read --- roughly equivalent to a large iMac Retina display for reading ease (less overall real estate, but more comfortable to hold in one's hands, and of course, read under bright light / direct sunlight), and vastly superior to a typical smartphone. Smaller displays of 8--10\" should work in most cases and are far more affordable. The exceptions are typically scans from print, especially of small-font and tightly-rendered journal articles, or works with extensive graphics and diagrams. Those with young eyes can probably manage better than the olds. ePub fits any sized display, but there are times when fixed layout truly is preferable for reading, context, understanding, and juxtaposition of text and graphics, etc. With a fixed layout and a competent layout engine or editor this can be optimised. With a flexible layout* (HTML, ePub, etc.) the dynamic element pretty much always leads to compromises or gaffes in layout and positioning. Fixed-layout also means that spatial memory of where within a document, chapter, and/or page specific elements / contents are. Dynamic layout greatly reduces the ability of those who have strong spatial memory of written materials. reply iforgot22 32 minutes agorootparentYeah, there's a reason why Word docs etc all used fixed layouts. Easy to underestimate the complexity of a reactive layout. reply Suppafly 20 hours agorootparentprev>Physical books are still better than e-readers because you can put sticky notes on the pages, jump back and forth between pages quickly, and even start to know where pages are simply based on how many leaves/pages are split between your left and right hand.

There are clear studies that show reading a physical book (versus a screen) and using and physical pen or pencil on a piece of paper, versus typing or drawing on a screen, leads to higher comprehension and retention of information... and thus much better overall learning outcomes. This doesn't even consider the fact that youtube, discord, and a bunch of other apps are a swipe away on an iPad. A common solution to the \"carrying books around problem\" used to be there was the copy you were issued (and mostly stayed at home) and there was a shared classroom copy. Carrying around 2-3 books plus a binder is not a big deal (and is not a 30lb backpack... more like 10-15 lbs)... we act like this is some sort of massive hardship yet so many of us did this for over a decade of our childhood with no ill effect. reply chrisco255 22 hours agoparentprevCarrying weight from books is good for you.

You made my point in that European school books are a lot less heavy and also less physically voluminous. The theory behind American books being that more spacing and less information per page makes learning easier, even though all the evidence clearly indicates that is very likely inaccurate. Even though you are clearly one of those necessarily contrarian types for reasons that are your own, my point still stands that even if you had lockers for other reasons, the fact that school books in most European countries in which I have visited schools, utilize books that are a lot less heavy and are more information dense and can easily be carried around.

There is a lot of overlap in these criticisms with common core ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Core ) which isn't particularly related. reply tombert 16 hours agorootparentMy parents did New Math, and I always thought it sounded pretty cool. My elementary school math pretty much completely boiled down to doing arithmetic. A useful thing to know, obviously, but I always felt too much emphasis was placed on arithmetic when calculators are cheap and readily available. It always seemed like planting the seeds of some more advanced math concepts would make math a lot more approachable. reply bluGill 4 hours agorootparent> too much emphasis was placed on arithmetic when calculators are cheap and readily available. I felt the same for a while. Until I realized my college math problems were all selected to make the arithmetic easy. Thus by doing all the arithmetic in my head I had a quick cheat on if I was right or not - wrong answers made for hard math and so I'd start over and thus fix the mistake. The trick only worked for math though. Physics and chemistry often required harder math and so a calculator was needed to finish on time even when you did the problem right (which wasn't always a given) reply tombert 2 hours agorootparentI'm not saying that we stop teaching arithmetic, and I'm not even saying that we stop spending a majority of our time on teaching arithmetic, but I think that introducing more advanced concepts early could be a good use of time.

What happens with young people (based on what teachers in my kids school said) is that they abandon cursive for handwriting the moment they can - and everyone basically invents own way of writing letters. End result is worst then if they were taught handwriting that is not cursive, looks more like printed text and is easier to read and write. reply lawn 22 hours agorootparentprevI write cursive all the time and I've never had a problem with any pen, new or old. reply cyberax 17 hours agorootparentprevIt's mostly an issue with English cursive. A lot of styles are just not great. In Eastern Slavic countries, you are expected to learn to write in cursive and use it in typical writing. Writing in block letters (outside of official forms) is considered to be a sign of illiteracy. And it really is faster, once you get some practice. reply impossiblefork 22 hours agoprevI didn't actually know we'd switched to computers.

Tactile thinking remains quite useful and having the basic motor skills translates into manufacturing, the arts, and more of life than many may realize.

It has paid off in manufacturing and prototyping more times than I can count. This all starts with the basics: Read it, hear it, see it, feel it, do it, say it.

Maybe annotatable (and erasable too) ? reply kragen 5 hours agorootparentYes, it's called \"stone paper\" or sometimes \"rich mineral paper\". It's a resin (typically high-density polyethylene) that's filled with, typically, calcite, with very high filler loadings up to 80%, then coated to provide the writing surface: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370899755_Biodegrad... https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/1176... This is causing problems in Australia (where the product is widely used) because confused people put the \"stone paper\" in the paper recycling, falsely believing it to be paper. If you wanted to minimize the thickness, you'd probably want to change the formula in several ways: - use a higher-strength plastic like polyimide; - include some kind of high-strength fibrous, acicular, or platy reinforcing filler; - use a more powerful opacifier than calcite, such as rutile, enabling you to use a lower filler loading and thinner layers. Talc, mullite, fiberglass, and bentonite come to mind as candidate reinforcing fillers, and rutile microcrystals can also be grown in an acicular morphology. If you really wanted to minimize the thickness and weight, maybe there's some way you could use metal instead of plastic. reply AcerbicZero 20 hours agoprevI'm 95% sure my college would have just handed me a degree after the first quarter if they'd let me type my essays instead of writing them by hand. reply willy_k 15 hours agoparentAs a college student who writes digital essays but was not handed a degree my first semester, I’m curious what you mean? reply illwrks 22 hours agoprevI can't speak for everyone else, but in the same vein I've dusted off my old iPod as well... no distractions, popups or subscriptions - divine. reply MathMonkeyMan 20 hours agoparentI replaced the battery in my second hand first generation iPod maybe three times over ten years.

Except for PDF viewing. When it comes to PDFs, it sometimes really struggles. I think that the device can handle them, but I'm pretty sure that the PDFs themselves are often a collection of scanned images and not text. Once she has more than a few tabs open, it takes longer and longer to switch between them and she ends up using a desktop to complete her work. In this case, the school provides the tools for her to do her assignments but we have the means to provide better ones at home and not every child will have this advantage.

The parent post to yours makes me think that a large e-ink display would be useful in a school setting. Rather than carry around a backpack of enormous overpriced textbooks that we might use 30% of in a semester, just have one large ereader that you can use from 1st grade through your PhD.

Nokia had a lot of good software and software engineers but not the management structure to do anything good with that. Nokia was huge as an organization and parts of that organization recognized the threat early on. The problem was at the board and executive level. These people had a blind spot for software. They thought they were still in the electronics business. Lots of people with an electronics and radio background. Not a lot of people with software competence. And they had bought into the notion that Symbian was going to magically fix all their problems. A lot of effort was spent on looking for other solutions. And one of the things that was good (Linux) around 2005 was actually quite close to displacing Symbian as the key future proof replacement for their legacy platforms. Symbian was just rolling out for a few years and they had made a big investment in that. And management (those same people with a huge blind spot for software) backed the wrong horse. Linux never really died in Nokia but it wasn't allowed to prosper either. Devices were cancelled or repurposed for Symbian. This happened to the N8, for example. By the time they switched to windows phone, they actually had two Linux platforms (Meego and Meltemi) and an Android phone in the works as well. Meego had one last product phone launch and the team and platform were killed in the same week. Any devices for that platform were labeled as developer phones. Nokia never marketed them as a consumer phone. Meltemi never saw any product launch at all; it was aimed at feature phones. Both were good ideas but poorly executed. Nokia killed them along with Symbian in order to back windows phone. Classic baby and bathwater situation. And MS ended up killing the one Nokia Android phone that was launched shortly before they acquired the whole phone division. Kind of a desperate/ballsy move. I suspect Nokia did this as a stick to ensure MS followed through with the acquisition. That was their \"oh we could just switch from windows phone to Android unless.. \" move. Nokia was at point the only OEM that still believed in Windows Phone. MS killed the whole division shortly after Satya Nadella took over and was sorting out the mess left by Steve Ballmer. The iphone was solidly in charge by then and the rest of the market was Android. Courtesy of lots of Linux contributions by the Meego and Maemo team. reply masom 4 hours agoparentNokia also had a ex-Microsoft exec (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Elop) that had the goal of ensuring Windows Phone would succeed, and tanked Nokia with it. I was on the DVLUP project where Nokia and Microsoft attempted to inject energy into windows phone app development. We could see the tension between the two companies as we were a 3rd party contracted by Nokia to build the platform. The Nokia exec we were in contact with was fantastic, and really tried to make Windows Phone a success. Unfortunately the Nokia IT teams we worked with were not happy and essentially tried to sabotage through inactions (we just needed OAuth / SSO to link accounts and track app installs, it took over 3 months of email chains within Nokia). reply jillesvangurp 2 hours agorootparentPeople blame Stephen Elop. But the person in control of the Nokia board was former CEO Jorma Ollila who headed Nokia through its glory days and had a lot of power. Nothing happened in Nokia without his approval during that period. The board recruited and invited Stephen Elop. Part of his appointment was the board handing over the company on a silver platter to the new CEO. Negotiations for the acquisition started almost right away in secret. And most likely there were high level discussions ongoing with Microsoft and Steve Ballmer before Elop's appointment. Jorma Ollila retired as a CEO around 2006; he wasn't really pushed out and Nokia was still performing well. He handed the keys to the company to a non technical CEO with a financial background (Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, aka, OPK internally). That was the first mistake. OPK was a bit hands off throughout the Iphone and Android rollout. There was no vision, no leadership, just a lot of infighting between heads of various units. The second mistake was selling out to Microsoft and all the share value implosion that came with that. Microsoft bought several companies over the years. Nokia was one of the smaller ones. That's how bad it had gotten. At the peak Nokia was worth 150 billion or so. MS bought the phone unit for 5 billion. The later Linkedin and Github acquisitions were worth more. By the time Stephen Elop was brought in (by the board, headed by Ollila) to fix things, it was too late. There were a lot of internal battles as well between the big business units. A whole string of CTOs with no power whatsoever that were appointed and let go. Including Scott McNealy who never really made any impact and was there only briefly. reply bombcar 4 hours agorootparentprevWas this around the time Microsoft kept switching what \"windows phone\" was? I remember that the one friend who got into it loved it, and then they released something completely incompatible and he abandoned the platform. reply asveikau 2 hours agorootparent2009 and earlier: Windows Mobile was based on WinCE. The UI was garbage but the innards were pretty functional, and there was desktop-like multitasking. Unpopular opinion: they should have just done a UI refresh of that thing and moved it to an NT kernel. There were a lot of cool third party hacks on this platform. 2010: Windows Phone 7 was still WinCE, but they removed full access to WinCE APIs, and got rid of PC style multitasking. They had a new UI framework for first party apps. Then for third party apps they had a port of Silverlight that imitated the new UI style. The latter had really terrible performance. They had to base this release on WinCE because the NT kernel port to ARM wasn't ready yet. Blocking access to \"good\" APIs could be seen as a way to ensure app compatibility for the next release. 2012: Windows Phone 8 had the NT kernel. Also, windows 8 and windows RT shipped. But the silverlight-inspired UI framework of Windows 8 was different from the Silverlight fork from Phone 7. So you had yet another UI framework rewrite to cope with. reply jandrese 1 hour agorootparentAt the time Steve Jobs was putting his foot down against allowing Flash on the iPhone because the performance was so pants, Microsoft was going all in on Silverlight which had exactly the same problem. reply scarface_74 1 hour agorootparentThat’s a popular misconception. The first iPhone had a 400Mhz processor and 128MB of RAM. It was so resource constrained that you couldn’t put a picture on your home screen because it would have taken too much memory. It could barely run Safari. If you scrolled too fast, you would see checker boxes while trying to render the screen. When Flash did finally come to mobile on Android, it required a 1Ghz processor and 1GB RAM. The first iPhone with those specs didn’t come out until 2011. Even then on Android, Flash ran horribly and killed your battery. I had a high end Android phone on Sprint back then. reply asveikau 43 minutes agorootparentIt's easy to forget how popular flash was in that decade. A lot of us found it annoying on desktops too. Not to mention Linux, where we'd deal with binary blobs that were pretty unstable, not because we liked it but because you needed it to interact with the world. I have not so pleasant memories of having a few different versions of their plugin and I'd try to figure out which one worked for a given website, symlink the right one and restart the browser.

Clearly you drank the Apple koolaid that later artificially limited wallpapers to 3GS (or 3G?) and above when they introduced the feature in later iPhone OS updates. We had wallpapers and great homescreen and dock themes on jailbroken iPhones without a significant perf impact. P.S. Contemporary Windows Mobile phones had Texas Instruments OMAP ~200MHz processor IIRC with less RAM and iPhone (2G) was comparatively great. jandrese 28 minutes agorootparentprevAnd yet Microsoft figured they could make Silverlight work on devices with even less impressive specs. reply 7thaccount 3 hours agorootparentprevI had the original iPhone, then swapped it for a flagship android and hated it. I tried Windows Phone out a few years later and loved it and had two of them over the years.

It was a reasonable platform. But Microsoft was too greedy with their licensing schemes and demanding too much adaptation from the hardware and chip manufacturers. You’d think they would adapt their OS and drivers, but no, you had to tape out new silicon for them. So they’ve lost the mobile OS market. It feels like something like this may happen with the AI OS now. They are pushing hardware manufacturers to conform to their standards while Linux is adapting to what is available and working already. reply masom 4 hours agorootparentprevYes... If I remember we were aiming for the newly released \"Windows 8\"-based Phone OS, and the previous version was fully incompatible with it so all apps had to be redone. Tiles were the new thing to build for. reply jandrese 1 hour agorootparentMicrosoft tried to do the same thing on the Desktop side too, but on the desktop they were forced to keep the backwards compatibility in place so it didn't finish off the platform the way it did on the Phone side. Amusingly Microsoft is still trying to make the walled garden happen. Lots of cheap Windows laptops and Desktops ship in what is called \"Windows S\" mode where only Microsoft Store apps are allowed to run. But again because PC owners don't abide that kind of bullcrap they also have to supply a way to tear down the walls (it's surprisingly easy, albeit permanent: just download and run a free app from the Windows store) if you want to use the machine in a normal way. reply jorvi 3 hours agorootparentprevIf memory serves, it was a custom kernel and OS, then a semi-custom kernel with a few OS components shared with Windows 8, and then the Windows 10 'core' kernel (same as on the Xbox One?) with many shared OS components. At each step they left the majority of devices behind. What was equally worse was the triple (quadruple?) switch of app frameworks. If I remember correctly it was a dotnet abomination, then ?? then WPF and finally Xamarin. Good luck convincing your platform 3rd party developers to entirely relearn and rebuild their app four times over in the span of a few years.

At one point they were trying to pitch running the same app on mobile and on desktop, and it .. kind of worked, although obviously very sandboxed and restricted in APIs. reply delusional 3 hours agorootparentprevAs I recall it, calling Windows Phone \"buttery smooth\" is quite an overstatement. I remember it looking drab dull and cheap at the time. reply rescbr 1 hour agorootparentI had two Lumia flagship phones - Lumia 800 with Windows Phone 7 and Lumia 930 with Windows Phone 8 (which I later upgraded to 10). Both look and feel awesome, not cheap at all. At the time, Microsoft were paying developers to port apps to Windows Phone. There were developers who took the effort to make their app look native, and I'd say Windows Phone 7 had the best UX to this day. reply spiralpolitik 31 minutes agorootparentprevNokia was dead company walking before Stephen Elop. Elop saw the writing on the wall and made one of the choices available. A different CEO would have made a different choice but ultimately at that point it would still have been too late to save Nokia. Nokia was a great hardware company that missed the boat when the market changed to be based around software. When the market changed again to be based around ecosystems then Nokia was beyond saving. reply tgma 10 minutes agorootparent> made a different choice but ultimately at that point it would still have been too late to save Nokia. You think if they made just a single decision different and bet on Android instead of Windows, they would be in the same spot today? I wouldn't be so sure. Samsung hedged their bets across both and succeeded. Both weren't great at in-house software and Nokia made better hardware. reply Tommix11 3 hours agorootparentprevI couldn't believe my eyes when I read that they had hired Elop and was concentrating on Windows phones.

The PPT was supposedly about the iPhone but the (well put together) slides for that don't start until page 14. Credit was given to Timo Partanen, along with contributions from Scott Cooper, Gordon Murray-Smith and Sanna Puha. Pages 3 through 11 were market analysis. Boring and irrelevant. The only message that should have been given is that iPhone will disrupt the market and Nokia desperately needs to create a competitive \"cool\" product. The presentation said several times the iPhone was \"cool\" because of its UI and touch interface versus \"buttons\". But I think they missed the point. The iPhone was a new category i.e. it was more of a computer than a phone with some computing abilities. The \"recommended\" actions slide is on page 12 & 13. I assume this was created by Peter Bryer as his name was listed on top of the first page. It lists 10 recommendations along with sub recommendations. For a large bureaucratic company, good luck getting one recommendation executed. Besides, all ten recommendations missed the point. This was the automobile replacing the horse and buggy. Nokia wanted to tweak their way through. They eventually tried to partner with a \"software\" company in Microsoft; but Microsoft at that time was the geriatric helping the geriatric. I would argue Nokia would have given themselves a better chance of success by creating a \"skunk works\". Assemble their best engineers and designers into one team and free from interference from all the internal politics. Their goal would be to create a POC that could rival the iPhone's \"cool factor\".

These have always been the real crimes in my mind. Ballmer wasn't an idea guy, he was a top-tier salesman / cheerleader, and he definitely \"understood\" what actually made Microsoft successful (put out a product, then allow third-party developers and support to extend it / support / learn it inside out and be a VAR). Ballmer made the same mistake a lot of people in that era made, which is that they didn't realize the software was the most important component. The era of \"killer hardware\" never actually existed in the smartphone space, because you had a limited form factor to begin with. You couldn't cram an NVIDIA GeForce 8800 Ultra in your phone, so your software had to be useful and on-point. I think Satya saw the entire Windows Phone debacle as a failed experiment and probably looked at Apple / Google and just threw his hands up in frustration. Getting developers onboard for Windows Phone was critical and not enough time, money, and attention was spent doing that. I think there was a degree of Microsoft arrogance there, along the lines of, \"We're Microsoft, of course they're going to develop for our platform...\" Meanwhile, in 2024, the Windows App Store is still a barren hellscape compared to even the App Store for OS X and you don't even want to talk about Google Play Store and iOS App Store vs Windows Store.

Also, they put plenty of effort into getting developers to onboard windows phone.

We certainly would have loved to have launched Palm Treo phones with WiFi radios, but our carrier partners wanted the only way to get data in and out of the devices to be through their monetized data plans. They also wanted to control what you did with that data so they could charge for their own email or messaging systems or web portals. The same applied to app stores. Palm OS didn't have a unified app store at that time, just sideloading and some third-party methods, and some carriers had started making their own stores where you could buy apps billed through your cell phone bill. They hated the idea of a platform owning that, and I expect that was part of the reason Apple originally released it with no app store. They needed the phone to be a massive hit in order to gain the power to also bypass that wall that the cell companies put up. Palm did benefit from the iPhone launch -- it had us uplevel our efforts away from the post-Palm OS phones that we were in the middle of developing that were aimed at the RIM market and instead try something radical with webOS, and when the Pre launched, it actually had WiFi on board, although the Sprint-exclusive Pixi phone lacked WiFi due to carrier request. There was some momentum there for a while, but then HP bought us, hit its own set of brick walls with carriers, and ditched the hardware business shortly after Apple started launching on other carriers. reply jandrese 1 hour agoparentI read that as a failure of Palm's management, notably the ones that were negotiating with phone carriers. Jobs isn't the only guy who could have negotiated that kind of deal. Apple was a second run computer company that had almost no previous phone experience. They were not exactly negotiating from a position of strength, and the fact that only one carrier took them up on the offer shows just how tough it was. It sounds like they really needed to say \"Stop. We are the ones building the phone, you are the ones providing the service.

This guy was on a crack team of engineers a VP assembled to create a competing product. 9 months later, they demo a fully digital copy machine, working, ready to go, with competitive pricing and features. But the higher ups at Kodak were incensed. They told the product needs a redesign, because Kodak was a film company, so the product needed to use film for copying. The revised product was a complete failure, and was the reason said engineer left Kodak shortly thereafter. My take is devotion to brand identity is death during these critical inflection points.

When it launched it only worked on Macs with a FireWire port, meaningSince we're American, we're hoping Tesla, (or one of the big three), gets it first. But that's more of a hope, not necessarily the way things will pan out. And in the FSD space I don’t think there is much first mover advantage anyway. The iPhone came out of left field. The path to FSD has been highly iterative with many steps taken by a bunch of different players. Even if Tesla gets FSD first, it won’t be much longer before others get it to and they’ll all be roughly the same interface and feature set. iPhone was significantly different than what was there before and as you or somebody said, nobody else was working on anything similar. It was a different business model—one that took away substantial power from the cell phone carriers and turned the phone into a software platform on par with a regular computer. It turned carriers into dumb pipes and they hated that! FSD doesn’t really change the fundamental business model of any car manufacturers out there. It’s just another feature for the same familiar players to sell. What would throw a wrench in the existing crop of manufacturers would be street legal FSD cars you could order on Amazon for a fraction of the cost or something.

VW, Renault, Nissan, Stellantis, Toyota can change fast enough before BEVs are the only thing on the market.

We should remember the original iPhone was more a tech demonstrator than anything else. It had the revolutionary touch screen, yes, but you couldn't really DO that much with it. There wasn't even an app store! You still needed to buy a digital camera and a garmin GPS and so on. This was a telephone in the old sense of the word (For younger readers, \"telephone\" used to mean a thing you made calls with). The fact we pay 2-3 times as much now for premium smartphones is no wonder. Now it's a PC power thing with a better camera. By the time the iPhone 3G arrived it was a marvel. It had ironed out most of the kinks of the early versions, added the GPS, App Store etc. But by then, the other dinosaurs were already dying. They murdered them with the initial versions of the iPhone, which really weren't even that impressive. The presentation shows they were aware of what was happening.

You can update software. Lack of copy & paste was a software feature that was no doubt in some product backlog for a while before getting picked up. And once it got picked up and shipped, suddenly every device people bought had that feature. I don’t recall any of my older phones having software updates that had major new features. Any update would have been some esoteric bug fixes or something. The idea that the phone was just another general purpose computer with an operating system that could be updated to a significantly changed interface was not a concept that existed in the mainstream at the time. All the players before were hardware manufacturers who were deeply in bed with the carriers. Phones were locked with whatever software happened to be installed at the time. Each phone had very different software that was fixed and unchanging.

They just weren’t able to pivot to the touchscreen form factor, largely due to betting on Symbian – I can see how writing an entirely new OS userland from scratch wasn’t a terribly attractive idea. In the end they did that too, of course, and the N9 was an astonishingly good phone, with a slick zero-button interface and silky smooth scrolling and multitouch gestures.

Before, Lazaridis had waved them off. Carriers wouldn’t allow RIM to include more than a simple browser because it would crash their networks.

If consumers and carriers continued to embrace the iPhone, BlackBerry would need more than its efficient e-mail and battery to lead the market. “If this thing catches on, we’re competing with a Mac, not a Nokia,” he said. The new battleground was mobile computing. Lazaridis figured RIM’s core corporate market was safe because the iPhone couldn’t match BlackBerry’s reliable keyboard and in-house network delivery of secure e-mails. But in the consumer market, where the Pearl phone was competing, RIM needed a full Web browser. BlackBerry was a sensation because it put e-mail in people’s pockets.

Yet it was the most important component of the iphone ecosystem). reply jjmarr 4 hours agorootparentThe App Store didn't exist for the first iPhone. It launched with the iPhone 3G. The original plan was for everyone to develop web apps; the SDK was added due to external developer demand. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(Apple)#History Not denying how important it was, but the App Store wasn't \"invented\". It was created because Apple listened to what developers wanted. reply danillonunes 3 hours agorootparentI don't think developers wanted App Store, they wanted to build native apps. Has Apple just allowed them to ship their own .dmg files from their website, as they used to do in MacOS, they would be happy. I can't tell for sure, but I would bet the app store concept was inspired from Cydia for jailbroken iPhones that used APT to download apps from a central software repository, which was already common in the Linux world at the time. App Store as a central place to download apps was a really important concept for the iPhone ecosystem because it was a distribution and a marketing channel. Developers didn't asked for that and, for the better and the worst, we can give Apple some credit for building it that way. reply jjmarr 2 hours agorootparentI suppose the tricky thing is knowing when to listen to others and when you know more than everyone else. reply kalaksi 4 hours agorootparentprevAs a Linux user, it just felt like a locked-down package repository to me. reply Nursie 4 hours agorootparentprevPretty sure there was some sort of App Store.

Would Nokia have wound up as a solid android phone producer somewhere similar to where Samsung are now?

The market was changing to one where hardware was produced in asia and phones are loaded with ecosystem-centric software from Google or Apple (the real game changer, the app store, was launched next year).

Any folks from Nokia in this time care to shed more light on that? I always felt the N9 was a beautiful piece of design and implementation - just late and under-supported. reply finaard 5 hours agoparentN9 was very close to launch when Elop came, so that went ahead, but the rest of the development got cancelled immediately to focus on Windows phone: N9 would've otherwise been the first in a series of devices to slowly take over from Symbian. Until Elop canceled everything Symbian was still selling - declining sales, but still millions of units. So while the situation was bad slowly phasing out Symbian for taking all the money you could make with that, while hoping N9 software stack sticks sounded like a more sensible approach than \"cancel everything, go for Windows\". Elop did respond to criticism from Developers (including a mail I've sent him with colleagues), but had made up his mind. This blog post is a byproduct of that discussion, and was referenced by Felipe in internal mailing lists back then: https://felipec.wordpress.com/2011/02/22/meego-scales-becaus...

From the report: > \"Higher markups can also result in larger internal transfer payments from health plans to affiliated pharmacies, which may allow vertically integrated PBM-pharmacy-insurer entities to retain revenue and profits while formally satisfying the insurers' medical loss ratio (\"MLR\" ) requirements, but without providing the clinical care and quality improvements that the MLR rule seeks to promote. In addition, higher markups can result in significant patient cost sharing requirements because reimbursement rates are often correlated with point-of-sale prices, which can influence how much patients are required to pay.\" In other words. Health insurance firms have capped profits in the US. But in this case one conglomerate can own both an insurer and a PBM, so it can just overcharge consumers for insurance and then launder its profits through the PBM. reply NickC25 21 hours agoparent>In other words.

Payers (insurers) have been merging to gain more negotiating power over provider rates and hold down medical costs. So provider organizations have reacted by consolidating themselves to maintain their negotiating power and keep rates high. Increased costs to comply with federal and state rules around security and interoperability also drive provider consolidation to achieve economy of scale. Many areas are now dominated by only one or two large health systems. So, the logical next step is for payers to vertically integrate and bring more care in house where they can better control cost and quality. UnitedHealth Group is hardly unique in this regard. They're the largest but all the major commercial payers (including the non-profit ones) are pursuing similar strategies. Essentially they're copying the existing Kaiser-Permanente model of having a payer and provider organization under one roof. I'm not defending this system, just explaining why the current structure exists. Any major improvements will require an Act of Congress to better align the incentives with the interests of patients / consumers / taxpayers. reply franktankbank 16 hours agorootparentWhy does it need an act of congress? Isn't this clearly in need of trust bust? reply nradov 15 hours agorootparentFrom a strict legal perspective it's not at all clear that UHG or any of the other large payers meets the definition of a trust. Any attempt to apply antitrust law would likely be tied up in the courts for many years, and even if UHG were eventually forced to divest some parts of their Optum business it wouldn't solve any of the systemic problems. If we want to bring down costs and improve access to care it will require a major realignment of incentives that impact all the participants. reply bugglebeetle 17 hours agorootparentprev>the logical next step is for payers to vertically integrate and bring more care in house where they can better control cost and quality. …except you skipped over the part where UHC billed at higher rates for the clinics they own so they could screw customers with premium hikes, take a bigger percentage of of the inflated bills, as well as profit from whatever costs they didn’t cover and people were forced to pay. reply cameldrv 18 hours agoparentprevYes.

Is that shitty? Yes. Does it violate a social contract? I think so. But tell me how much the right amount to charge is first. Is that cost? Cost+percentage? They've chosen their percentage.

For example UHC offers insurance for IVF including a separate cap for medications, but if you use their insurance you have to order through their subsidiary Optum Specialty Pharmacy and the prices triple or quadruple over MSRP if you buy from OSP using insurance versus if you pay cash. They also won't tell you this until you're in the middle of a cycle and an order gets held up because you're out of insurance, but since they billed insurance you're on the hook for the remaining several-thousand dollars because if you stop the drugs you're just out the money and the medication and have to wait another month. I don't know if I can give them the benefit of the doubt on the cancer drugs because of this. reply chinathrow 21 hours agorootparent> subsidiary Optum Specialty Pharmacy and the prices triple or quadruple over MSRP if you buy from OSP using insurance versus if you pay cash. As an European, this is mind boggling. reply BugsJustFindMe 22 hours agorootparentprevI don't want you to give them the benefit of the doubt. I certainly don't think they deserve it. I do think, however, that a conversation about \"overcharging\" goes nowhere until people talk about exactly where charging ends and overcharging begins. reply throwway120385 22 hours agorootparentI'd be fine with a 20-50% markup on MSRP to cover billing and administration costs but when the insurer owns the pharmacy they can \"negotiate\" whatever rate they want and you have to pay it. I don't see it directly in the article, but I suspect they do the same thing with cancer drugs as with IVF drugs and require you to go through their pharmacy for insurance coverage. Insurance plans often have lifetime maximums, and when they set their own prices and collect money from themselves for the medication they sell you they can basically dictate how much actual coverage you get versus someone paying cash. And because you chose \"bill insurance\" when you ordered the medication, you're now on the hook for whatever additional cost there was versus the cash price. And also they won't tell you what the cost is until after the medication has already shipped. So it's at least plausible that they're abusing their position as the company that owns the pharmacy and the insurance plan to charge you a lot of money and provide very little coverage and also to gouge you at the very end of your coverage, because that's exactly what they did to my partner and I. reply BugsJustFindMe 21 hours agorootparentYeah, we need to be careful with using something like MSRP because of what that S means. I would rather we find a different baseline more fundamental to the cost of production than something that essentially amounts to \"the price is the price\". But I'm right there with you, and I think it's a good start. reply plagiarist 19 hours agorootparentprevIMO a functioning government would have trust busted an insurer with such strong collusion with a pharmacy. reply antisthenes 21 hours agorootparentprevAnything above what Medicaid pays for drugs/procedures (and maybe a few % over to account for health insurance salaries) is overcharging.

Unlike private insurance, this is publicly available. 2. If anything, it's a bit stingy. The negotiating power of government (and the predictability of it) helps keep reimbursements down here. 3.

Both UnitedHealthcare (UHC) and Optum are subsidiaries of UnitedHealth Group (UHG). UHC never bought Optum. Some parts of Optum were spun out of UHC's IT department so that they could commercialize software they had developed for internal use and sell it to other customers (including some of UHC's competitors in the commercial payer space). Other parts of Optum were acquired or created internally. What is now OptumRx (the PBM) was originally PacifiCare Health Systems. UHG acquired that business way back in 2005 before the Optum brand even existed.

Doesn't matter when or if we start to agree that $5, $6, or even $10 is reasonable (and yes, these are all pretty high markups to begin with compared to typical markups for stores).

Is there any benefit to the overall populace for us in HN to debate what we feel is \"overcharged\"? ---- But to go along with your exercise, I take a look at current market dynamics and compare it from there. Apparently, the typical wholesale markup is 20-40%, and stores will typically markup another 20-50% on top of that. So we're talking roughly a 125% markup on the higher ends from the factory into the consumer's hands as a very rough average (VERY rough, markups vary a lot per product and industry). That's with two chains of markup, so clearly 1000% feels absurd from one part of such a chain. Outside of factors like drinks (which are easy to scale and can have markups well into the hundreds), it's pretty hard to find any part of the chain as not \"overcharged\" once we go past 100% markups in any given place. on the most generous side, Costco famously has markups limited to 14% (albeit they rely on bulk purchases to mitigate that). and subsidized vehicles used to generally be a 10-15% markup price. So I'd say 15% is about the bare bottom of what to expect markups without some kind of twist. e.g. printers selling at a loss, making up for it with high markups for ink (another product that's easy to scale and marked up into the hundreds). or previously, a video game console in order to sell games (software, whose markup is hard to really determine since it's infinitely scalable and costs are more to make up for R&D). reply BugsJustFindMe 13 hours agorootparent> Is there any benefit I perceive that one of the reasons that people who want change in the devastatingly perverted system are repeatedly plowed over, cheated, and ignored when it comes to making actual policy is that as a group those with the most reason to be upset are easily swindled into engaging only vague moans about some miniscule ignorable example being bad but not being ready to articulate what should be done instead as a set of categorical rules.

I know that there are some (probably easily manipulated) laws stating that X% of premiums have to be \"spent on care\" and if they get too high overall margins on your group, they have to give your employer a rebate. Of course, who knows whether you'll see that money. If we just say \"maximize your profits\" (and indeed, shareholders 'should' sue them if they don't) then it's obvious that morally bankrupt scum that runs all these insurers would 100% extort people for 1000% profits on lifesaving drugs. It's the most logical course of action! People will pay infinity dollars to save their own lives/their loved ones, so let's soak them!

If it were more like auto insurance where I can fire my insurance company and receive a pro-rated refund or renegotiate coverage in the middle of the year then it would be more free. But my employer negotiates for me on my behalf, and their needs are often at odds with my needs. And the whole \"open enrollment\" period thing creates a situation where the insurance company gets to be absolutely terrible for an entire year and there's no recourse. And especially there's no recourse if my employer is generally satisfied, because my alternative is to take a massive pay cut to get good coverage. reply mattgreenrocks 21 hours agorootparentI never understood why health care had to be so tightly coupled to employment. All it does is tie people down, obfuscate costs, and give insurance companies more leverage over everyone, companies and employees alike. reply johnnyanmac 14 hours agorootparentVery long history I suggest you look into, because it's very interesting, but the oversimplified explaination: after WW2, there was very obviously inflation. It was crazy in the EU and Japan, but the US still experienced some too. To fight this, the government made a then-common tactic of wage controls: basically cap off the maximum amount an employer can compensate workers, in order to fight the inflation spiral. But there was an imporant exemption. This was only on wages and not any benefits given to employees in order to try and quell the inevitably angry employees. So when companies couldn't attract talent with more money, they offered more benefits. including employer sponsored healthcare. Perfect since these contributions were free from income tax. And the modeled spiraled from there. a tax code passed in 1954 to let these contributions be business expenses, Medicaid came in the 60's, etc. It was great back then, but it was getting more expensive to navigate and companies started compromising to manage it. up to our favorite healthcare starting its vertical integration 20 years ago to come into what we know them for today. reply nradov 18 hours agorootparentprevThis is an example of what economists call path dependence. In principle there's no good reason for access to health care to be coupled to employment and we wouldn't design the system that way if we were starting from scratch. Originally it started during WW2 when the federal government imposed wage controls to hold down inflation, so employers took advantage of a legal loophole to offer free employee benefits such as health insurance in order to attract workers. At that time healthcare was pretty cheap because it couldn't really do much. That system stayed after the war ended largely due to inertia. It probably benefits large employers because it gives them a cost advantage over smaller competitors but overall it's a terrible burden on the country. A better approach would be to mandate that everyone purchase individual or family policies directly from insurers on open exchanges using pre-tax dollars, with subsidies for low-income consumers. reply franktankbank 15 hours agorootparentWhy mandate it at all? reply nradov 15 hours agorootparentIt's essentially the free rider problem. If we want to make affordable healthcare available to everyone then we have to force everyone to pay into the system to spread the risk around and get the healthy to subsidize the sick. It kind of has to work that way regardless of whether we have a single public payer funded by taxes or multiple private payers funded by insurance premiums; in the end the money has to come from everyone. reply itishappy 22 hours agorootparentprevI agree as well, just drawing some lines! reply slumpt_ 19 hours agorootparentprevThis is semantic nitting and wastes time when for all practical intents and purposes humans understand the assertion being made and find it agreeable. reply swatcoder 21 hours agoparentprevThe article is about UnitedHealth's PBM, which negotiates rates and then earns revenue from drug manufacturers through rebates.

In other similar situations this would spur competition, which would ultimately drive down prices to a reasonable level.

In proper capitalism, that just means any competitor worth a dime can massively cut you with a 300% markup that is insane but a steal in comparison. Then it just stabilizes to some point between where competitors need more saavy to compete and more than some minimum markup to function.

Perhaps we need antitrust action in healthcare. reply hn_throwaway_99 21 hours agoprevI think one of the things that deserves discussion here is the whole concept of pharmacy benefit managers in the first place. To start, can anyone give some good resources that really explain clearly what the role is that PBMs actually serve, and how the whole system even functions? I've tried to understand in the past but have always thought \"Why do you exist???\". Like the whole way companies like GoodRX can have a viable business: if I don't use you, my prescription medication is, say, $1000, but if I do use you, it's $60. One of the pharmacies I used to go to even had a keychain with random prescription discount codes on it that the cashier would scan. I.e. I'd go to check out, and the cashier would scan the price and it would come up as $X, then she'd say \"Hold on a sec\", and scan the discount code on her keychain and then would say \"That's better, your price is now $0.1*X\". Like how can any of that possibly make any sense? reply anthuswilliams 13 hours agoparentTheoretically the role they serve is that they can negotiate with pharmacies and develop a formulary which insurers package into their various offerings. PBMs can negotiate with pharmacies by sending them lots of customers in exchange for negotiating for a discount (or, more likely, a rebate) on their \"usual and customary\" price. (Pharmacies know they do this, and thus they charge very prices to the uninsured, to ensure their U&C is high enough that they can still make a profit after applying the PBM discounts). Insurers are not experts in the local pharmacy markets of particular geographies, so in essence they outsource this negotiation and craft plans with formularies prepared by PBMs. GoodRX and other discount providers generally work in one of two ways: 1) They have relationships with multiple PBMs, allowing you to choose the one who has negotiated the cheapest rate with the pharmacy for the drug in question. This is why it might be cheaper than your insurance: another PBM has negotiated a better deal. 2) The discounts come from patient assistance programs run by the manufacturers intended to reduce patient co-pays. Lately insurance companies have started to add clauses to their plans (called copay accumulators or copay maximizers) so that these discounts don't count as part of your copay or your deductible. So these types of discounts are going to be harder to get. This all stems from a time when pharmacies were much less consolidated and vertically integrated than they are today. One of the frustrations of the current system is that incentivizes sky-high drug prices. PBMs like high drug prices because they negotiate rebates (some of which they keep, but most they pay back to the insurer) and because the fees they charge to insurers are a percentage of the claims that go through. Pharmacies like high drug prices because they get more money paid them in reimbursements, and because the PBMs send them most of their customers. Manufacturers like high drug prices because they net more revenue, even if they later have to pay it back in the form of rebates, and in any case being on the formulary of major insurers is an existential issue for them. And insurers like high drug prices because they can max out patient co-pays, as the money returned to them in the form of rebates gets kicked into the general fund, thus allowing them to lower premiums, which is their primary axis of competition with other insurers. The net effect is that you have sick people maxing out their deductibles in order to lower the premiums paid by healthy people--the exact opposite of how insurance is supposed to work. If I could wave a magic wand in Congress and make only a single surgical change to healthcare markets, the change I would make is banning rebates. They were anti-customer when John D Rockefeller used them to obtain a monopoly on oil, and they are anti-customer today. A good place to read about these dynamics in American healthcare is drugchannels.net. The author is super well informed on how these plans are implemented. Source: ran a startup targeting pharmacies (which failed) and currently work in a starup focused on discovering and developing new drugs. reply nradov 15 hours agoparentprevThe PBM industry originally started with noble intentions, even if some of them have now morphed into something closer to parasites. They helped to hold down drug costs for consumers and employers by negotiating with pharmaceutical companies and retail pharmacies on behalf of multiple buyers. And they created formularies and clinical guidelines to encourage use of most cost effective drugs (generics and step therapy). A lot of doctors tend to write prescriptions for certain drugs out of habit without carefully considering what's best for and individual patient, both clinically and financially. And before federal laws were tightened up, it was common for drug companies to essentially bribe doctors to prescribe their expensive branded products through loopholes like paying them \"speaking fees\" to show up at company meetings held at 5-star resorts. So PBMs were a way to counteract that. But then some of the PBMs started taking kickbacks themselves and making money on pharmacy price spreads so it has all become a big mess. reply mattgreenrocks 21 hours agoparentprevOr the fact that you can mail order some name brand prescription drugs from Canada for a fraction of what you'd pay here. Grift all the way down. reply hn_throwaway_99 20 hours agorootparentWell, at least that one I understand. That is, other countries have much stricter pricing controls on medications, while the US does not. So pharmaceutical companies argue that it's essentially the US that makes drug discovery worth it - they basically say that if the US had strict price controls too, then it means that drugs research wouldn't be viable to invest in in the first place. Not at all arguing that's true (I don't know), and even if it is true it just means the American customer for those medications is carrying the load for everyone else, which besides just being unfair doesn't seem sustainable in the long term. But again, at least that one I theoretically understand. PBMs make no sense to me whatsoever. reply yalogin 22 hours agoprevI don’t understand how an insurance company can overcharge consumers.

I think there are different values implicated in our system, in a system like the UK NHS, and a system like Australia's (for the record: I'd take Australia's over ours). The UK does a good job of hiding economic concerns from its users, at a cost in availability of services, especially high-end and experimental interventions. The UK makes these rationing decisions knowing that some people are going to be denied life-saving care, but in exchange for that everybody else in the system will get predictable access to their care. The American system does a good job of getting services delivered to customers; it does a better job of that than the NHS does, if you measure in interventions performed; it does such a better job at that that it's a real problem in our system: we overprescribe and overdeliver interventions that drive costs and decrease certainty as payers work out which things to cover and which not. The flip side of that is that everyone in that system can tell themselves that the system is doing what it can to gate delivery on whether care is truly needed and will be effective, and that it's not categorically denying care because of top-down mandates.

For-profit insurance companies are incentivized to drive up the cost of care because of the cap on their profit margins. More expensive care equals more profits as a bigger pie means a bigger profit even if the percentage remains the same. Medicare's rates are about a half to a third of what private insurers have managed to negotiate. Funny how that works.

Adding dependents will absolutely drive up cost here. reply Aurornis 21 hours agorootparentprevI haven't seen any defenses of insurance companies lately. In fact, it seems like insurance companies are the only safe target for criticism of US healthcare problems right now. > Virtually every insurance provider is going up 15-20% / year to the point that it’s completely unsustainable. The elephant in the room is that healthcare costs are going up. Even if we waved a magic wand and eliminated health insurance overhead, profits, and executive pay, your rates would still be going up that same 15-20% per year. This is the part that seems to confuse everyone. There's a common misconception that insurance companies are raking in huge profits and that prices would plummet if we could just eliminate those profits. You see it throughout this thread with phrases like \"dancing on the graves all the way to the bank\" and blaming \"capitalism\" or \"corporate greed\" with the implication that insurance companies are the purveyors of this greed. Yet we have non-profit insurance companies. They're not appreciably cheaper. If you look at insurance company profits, they're actually relatively low for companies that large. If you map healthcare spending on a big pie chart, the slice that goes to insurance company administrative overhead and profits is not that big. Single digit percentage. Even companies with socialized medicine have some overhead in this same slice. The problem is multifactorial. The challenge is that it's not politically safe to touch on some of the drivers of US healthcare costs. Everyone loves to point at insurance companies and drug pricing because it's easy, but things get much quieter when you point out that our doctors, surgeons, and providers are paid substantially more than their peers in other countries. Americans also love to consume more healthcare and many would be very upset if they were forced to accept the level of allowed care and delays in other countries. It's not just insurance companies who have decision trees about when and what care is allowed. Americans also consume medications at an extremely high rate. Again, they don't take kindly to suggestions that we limit prescribing or drug prescriptions (see outrage over the DEA limits on amphetamine production or complaints about hesitancy to prescribe opioids, even though we already consume far more opioids than most countries). Many Americans also live unhealthy lifestyles which contribute greatly to healthcare costs, but it's taboo to mention that. Everyone has seen the life expectancy charts showing US lagging international peers, but fewer people have seen the per-state version that shows that life expectancy depends heavily on where you live (and therefore what you eat, how active you are, and the local culture). Instead, the only acceptable target of blame is our food. While we have some room for improvement, we're not going to solve the obesity epidemic and lifespan problems by banning red dyes. Lifestyles and diets need to change, but that's a difficult topic. Much easier to point the finger at insurance companies, \"CEOs\", and the food industry and pretend that those cover all that is wrong with healthcare. This is why it's politically difficult to accomplish anything in the United States. If anyone tried to copy and paste the health care system of a European country, from doctor pay to allowed procedures to more limited prescribing practices, there would be riots. People want all the healthcare, they want it now, they want it how they decide, and they want someone else to pay for it. reply awongh 21 hours agorootparentI was shocked to hear from an anesthesiologist friend of mine in Germany that an American salary could be 10x higher. reply jjk166 19 hours agorootparentprevThe medical costs are skyrocketing because insurance companies inflate the price of medicine. The slice of the pie that goes to the insurance company is small compared to the pie, so they make the pie bigger to make their slice bigger. The other parts of the pie, many of whom are owned by the same insurance company, aren't complaining. They are horribly inefficient. The cost of hospitals processing payments to insurance companies alone (and note this is typically one company sending itself a bill) is nearly $400 Billion per year. That's about 8% of all US healthcare spending, and it generates no value. What isn't happening is increasing cost because of either more or improved care. As time goes on it should be easier to make drugs, meaning that prices should go down. Instead the cost per gram of even very simple drugs like epinephrine and insulin are going through the roof. Doctors are paid well, but they've always been paid well, and in fact while physician pay over the past 70 years has kept pace with inflation, it has been far outstripped by the price of education needed to achieve that salary, meaning doctors today are generally worse off financially than they used to be. other medical professionals like nurses are seeing increasing workloads without commensurate increase in pay. American life expectancy is decreasing, as are numerous other measures of healthcare efficacy. While we are paying more, we are getting less than we used to. Then there is the common argument - our high drug prices subsidize new drug development. Only issue is that new drug development has been steadily slowing down. Most drug development is in the form of minor changes to existing drugs that serve little purpose beyond resetting the clock so cheap generics don't come on the market. Where new drugs are developed, they tend to be focused on profits, for example new pills to help people maintain erections rather than treat rare diseases. When the stars align and a new drug is developed that genuinely helps people, it tends to be insanely expensive, such as the cancer drugs TFA is talking about. This is not to say that nothing at all gets done, but it's less than it used to be. Is insurance the only problem in America? No, obviously not. But at the same time, healthcare prices dramatically higher than anywhere else in the world that are also rapidly increasing is not an inescapable fact of life. Our healthcare can be both substantially cheaper and higher quality than it currently is by eliminating purposefully inefficient systems that use anticompetitive practices to jack up prices. When the dust settles US healthcare might remain a bit pricy per capita - part of having a country with very high wealth per capita is that everything is expensive per capita - but our money will be going towards paying skilled people to do useful work for our benefit. reply this_weekend 21 hours agorootparentprevnext [8 more] [flagged] gruez 21 hours agorootparent>but the greater public ultimately felt he went too easy on them.

For example, I have a CPAP and went through surgery for sleep apnea. 50 years ago, who knows what would have happened to me? Medical providers are incentivized to \"find\" things to bill for.

Yes, there needs to be financial incentives for the private sector to find promising work, and funding the next steps once it escapes the University ecosystem. I'm all for that.

Maybe it'd be better to have governments buying the research and bringing it to market, but as this subthread hints at, profit is one of the big motivations for researchers to do what they do.

And as a sibling commented, a lot of unreproducible research comes out of academia. Also, there are spinoffs from academia regularly that allow the original researchers to profit directly from their efforts.

Not defending them but I do think that people hear $10 million but don’t quite realize how huge the pie is. I don’t think healthcare should be for-profit, but since we do have that system, what do people expect the ceo of a company (any company) that grosses $370b to earn? It’s a bit reductive to just say something like “he makes $10 million dollars a year denying patient life-saving treatment”, just like saying the ceo of ratheon makes money from the killing of innocent Palestinians.

I don't know, people who talk about profit margins as if they mean anything in this context are either financially naive or are trying to muddy the water. I'm not sure a low profit margin is indicative of a company providing a moral degree of service to their insured. Certainly naive profit margin percentages don't show the terptitude of overcharging cancer patients. For someone who doesn't get this, if a company like UHC buys an entire hospital group they can use that expenditure to legally \"hide\" profits by reducing their \"profit margin\" short term while decreasing competition in the space. If a company acquires enough debt in a given year they can \"hide\" nearly unlimited profit margins legally. On a larger scale, a company (UHC) can dump money into \"external\" money losing ventures that just serve to hold wealth and take that money off their balance sheet, once that entity takes on enough debt the same company (UHC) can acquire it taking on that debt and reducing their profit margin yet again.

There’s a lot more to medicine than emergencies and lifesaving treatments. But I think those are the original sin from which the rest flows. The basic question is this: should people be left to die if they have a sudden life-threatening event (heart attack, hit by a bus, shot) and they can’t demonstrate an ability to pay for treatment? (Note, not the same as not being able to pay for treatment. This would potentially apply to a rich person who got mugged and left for dead, for example.) Few will answer “yes.” And everything else flows from the “no.” The US’s universal health care system is built around it. We pretend we don’t have universal health care, but we do. It’s just tremendously shoddy and weird. The one place with universal care is the hospital emergency room. Those have been required to treat everyone regardless of ability to pay since 1986. Once you start doing that, the rest flows from there. People start saying, what if it’s not critical to survival but they’ll be crippled without it? What if it’s life critical but there’s time to verify payment? Can we do better without removing that? No doubt. But we’ll have a hard time getting to a proper competitive market. Other industries with these characteristics (police, firefighting, rescue, ambulance if you count that separately from medicine) are usually handled by the government or at least contracted by them. reply mindslight 19 hours agorootparent> Few will answer “yes.” And everything else flows from the \"no.\" Everything else has flowed from the \"no\", but I do not think it needs to have. Imagine the government being a definitive payer of last resort, instead of this unfunded mandate where hospitals have to provide emergency service for free but then receive a bunch of regulatory capture to make up for it. That still leaves an avenue for hospitals to defraud the government about how much providing that care cost, and emergency care has that dynamic intrinsically regardless of who is paying. But that's still leaps ahead of basing the entire industry on a foundation of billing fraud shakedowns. And it would be a lot harder for emergency departments to claim exaggerated fraudulent costs when the rest of the hospital is charging much less. The vast majority of care is not life saving emergency treatment, and this is where the brokenness of the current system gets really galling. For example I just had a specialist declare that the proper course of treatment is to follow up in 12 months. I nudged them that 12 months seemed like an awful long time, but they held fast. I would happily pay for another check in 6 months if the system would let me. But instead, the concept of patient agency has been completely scrapped in favor of top down \"necessary\" and \"not necessary\". reply wat10000 19 hours agorootparentI think there are two paths. Having the government be a payer of last resort for emergency services starts you down the road of paying for more and more things. You’ll start asking questions like, why are we paying massive amounts to stabilize a poor, terminal cancer patient who collapsed when we could have paid 10x less on screening and early treatment? Why aren’t we paying for procedures that allow people to work and bring in more taxes than the procedure costs? Why are we ok with paying to save someone’s life when they’re hours away from death but not when it’s weeks away? Eventually you’ll get something like the systems you see in most wealthy countries. Or you can go the way we did, which is enact universal care in the dumbest way and pretend we didn’t. reply mindslight 18 hours agorootparentI don't agree with this dichotomy. It asserts a monolithic top-down perspective, making it completely inapplicable to the dynamic I described in my last paragraph. It's \"universal care\" only in the sense that its universe has been defined to exclude most patient agency. Divergence from other possible patient-desired choices then tends to get rationalized away. For example, perhaps having a follow up after 6 months only increases the expected value of the outcome by 0.1% and then multiplied/integrated by expected lifetime earnings it's not worth the economic cost of the system paying for that earlier follow up. But being my life, I should be able to spend my resources (including my time, which this current top-down model certainly doesn't account for) to achieve an outcome with much more utility to me personally than simply how much income (/taxes) I'm expected to produce. reply wat10000 17 hours agorootparentIt sounds like you’re talking about what you want, and I’m talking about how I think things are. I don’t see a wealthy country being able to do anything other than some form of universal care with heavy government involvement in the industry to make it happen. There’s nothing preventing it in terms of economics or technology, I just don’t think people will accept it. Most of these systems do allow that sort of patient agency for those who can afford it, though. Maybe you had a weird specialist who didn’t want to see you earlier, but there are plenty of doctors who will go beyond your insurance coverage in exchange for cash. reply baq 21 hours agoparentprevIt shows that the US never had a world war on the continent.

DIRECT health care labor costs (doctor's, nurses, etc) are ~40-60% of TOTAL healthcare spending. Smart people try to figure out ways to make our system better every day. If there was a silver bullet, we'd have already taken it. Health insurance profits are ~1.2% of total health care spending, the cost of running it is approximately ~4% more. It's always going to cost SOMETHING to run - whether you move it to the private or public sector is largely a rounding error. If you take all those insurance jobs and pop them into the Federal Government - you're unlikely to see much efficiency gains (the most pro-medicare articles state it's 37% more efficient - that's an improvement of ~1.5% in total spending). UHC had a net margin of 6.1% in 2024. Sure, if all 6.1% of that went to spending instead of profits - health care would be slightly better. But it's mostly a rounding error. Private health insurance profits are only ~1.2% of total spending. Maybe you're focused on a ~6.1% margin, or ~$60B in total profits. You're not going to get substantially better outcomes by simply having ~1.2%-2.7% more money to spend. You'd need to bring down the actual cost of healthcare substantially - which isn't going to happen unless you pay doctor's and nurses way less money. Pharmaceuticals are only about 9% of total US healthcare spending - even if you nationalize that (never going to happen) - you're still not getting substantially better / cheaper outcomes. Profits on pharmaceuticals is 10%. While what you're saying on the surface may be true from the numbers you are comparing, the fact of the matter is that healthcare costs are becoming more and more expensive during a time when many are experiencing a cost of living crisis. The US gets a bum deal on costs and outcomes and while we can argue on which specific changes will move which specific needle I think it's clear that one of the major differences compared to the rest of the world is that running healthcare as a for profit enterprise has failed to deliver on the promise of good outcomes for as affordable a price as possible both on an individual and country wide level.

Instead, because despite data linked in this thread that profit margins are only a few percentage points, Healthcare is an incredibly lucrative field that extracts a lot of money into the private market without delivering results commensurate with the cost to the public.

Eric Berger – Jan 16, 2025 7:51 AM232 After 14 seconds, New Glenn was still working on clearing the launch tower. Credit: Blue Origin After 14 seconds, New Glenn was still working on clearing the launch tower. Credit: Blue Origin Text settings Early on Thursday morning, a Saturn V-sized rocket ignited its seven main engines, a prelude to lifting off from Earth. But then, the New Glenn rocket didn't move. And still, the engines produced their blue flame, furiously burning away methane. The thrust-to-weight ratio of the rocket must have been in the vicinity of 1.0 to 1.2, so the booster had to burn a little liquid methane and oxygen before it could begin to climb appreciably. But finally, seconds into the mission, New Glenn began to climb. It was slow, ever so slow. But it flew true. Flying safe After that the vehicle performed like a champion. The first stage burned for more than three minutes before the second stage separated at an altitude of 70 km. Then, the upper stage's two BE-3U engines appeared to perform flawlessly, pushing the Blue Ring pathfinder payload toward orbit. These engines burned very nearly for 10 minutes before shutting down, having reached an orbital velocity of 28,800 kph. For the first time since its founding, nearly a quarter of a century ago, Blue Origin had reached orbit. The long-awaited debut launch of the New Glenn rocket, a super-heavy lift vehicle developed largely with private funding, had come. And it was a smashing success. ARS VIDEO The only downer came a little bit later when Blue Origin's Ariane Cornell confirmed that the first stage did not successfully return to Earth. \"We did in fact lose the booster,\" Cornell said during the company's webcast. Far below in the Atlantic Ocean the drone ship Jacklyn awaited, a lone and lonely sentinel, with no rocket to catch. But no one who really understands the difficulties of launching and landing rockets believed that Blue Origin would succeed in catching its first orbital booster. SpaceX required 19 launches before it finally landed an orbital rocket for the first time, back in December 2015. Blue Origin deserves credit for making the attempt, rather than criticism for failing to stick the landing. Two causes of delay The launch occurred a little more than one hour into Thursday morning's launch window. Liftoff was delayed, at first, by an unspecified issue with properly chilling the BE-4 engines ahead of launch. They were much warmer than observed during the previous launch attempt on Monday morning. Then, as Blue Origin got deeper into the countdown, a wayward boat strayed into the keep-out zone around the launch site. These areas are cleared during launches to protect anyone below in case of a failure. But finally, the boat was cleared, and so was New Glenn, for its date with destiny. The time was 2:03 am ET (07:03 UTC). Although it was early in the day, it already was a great day for Blue Origin and its founder, Jeff Bezos, who has poured billions into the company and this rocket. Maybe the greatest one to date.

The digital cameras used on these launches basically show a white blob with no detail due to digital cameras having such low dynamic range compared to film. And this is made worse with the night launches that Blue Origin are doing. In Saturn V launches you could see see detail in the bright flame structures along with background detail. Maybe some of the upcoming digital cameras chips will have higher dynamic range eventually. I know Nikon has a paper talking about stacked sensors that are trading off high frame rate for high dynamic range: https://youtu.be/jcc1CvqCTeU?si=DuIu4BK48iZTlyB2 reply throw0101a 7 hours agoparent> The digital cameras used on these launches basically show a white blob with no detail due to digital cameras having such low dynamic range compared to film. Film negatives have a dynamic range of between 12 to 15 stops, but a whole bunch can be lost when transferred to optical print (perhaps less if digitally scanned). The Arri ALEXA Mini LF has 14.5 stops of dynamic range, and the ALEXA 35 has 17 (Table 2): * https://www.arri.com/resource/blob/295460/e10ff8a5b3abf26c33... reply zipy124 4 hours agorootparentI believe it's possible to get higher than that, this work by kodak for examples shows 20!! stops on film[1]. I seem to remember reading somewhere that for example Kodak TMax 100 can be pushed up to 18 stops, maybe higher. The limitation is not usually the film itself but the development process' used I think? Its also crucial to note at what SNR they use for their cutoff when stating their dynamic range in stops, in addition to their tone curve. I'm only a hobbyist though, perhaps someone else can enlighten me further. Digital is mostly limited by bits, since a 14 bit image with a linear tone curve will have at most 14 stops of info right? So we won't expect to see values pushing higher until camera manufacturers leave behind 14 bit as a standard and go higher, as in the arri cameras. They use a 16 bit sensor, and squeeze the last stop out by using a more gradual tone curve in their shadows. This means technically the shadow stops contain less information than the highlight stops, thus meaning not all stops are equal I believe (quite confusing).

The dynamic range is due to the electron well size. Each pixel has a diode that stores typically between 10,000-100,000 electrons in them. When the shutter is open, each photon that arrives pushes out an electron across the diode. When the shutter closes, sensors count how many electrons remain. This is how they calculate how much light each pixel received. The well size itself is usually a function of the pixel size. A larger pixel means a larger diode that can store more electrons, and hence a larger range of light that can be measured - dynamic range. reply mapt 4 hours agorootparentprevWhat we're doing here to get higher SNR, generally, is growing the CMOS sensors larger and larger. The limitation is ultimately either depth of field or IC manufacturing issues. A hypothetical meter-wide sensor could be manufactured to combine with a catadioptric lense of extreme cost, but you'd expect most of a scene to be bokeh, like in macro or microscope lenses. In reality there are limits imposed by manufacturing. At the extreme, we have wafer-scale sensors used in, eg, night-time wildlife videography - https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11497922/ . Anything larger than that is typically a not-perfectly-contiguous array of smaller chips. You can also cryocool the camera, at the expense of weight, versatility, and complexity. Most astrophotography is collected with cryocooled CCD or cryocooled CMOS sensors. This helps much more with long exposures than it does with video, but it does help. reply aziaziazi 3 hours agorootparentprev> The limitation is not usually the film itself but the development process' used I respectfully doubt that, development process is a combinaison of techniques that lets you do many thinks with your row data and the line between that and special effects is quite blurry (joke intended). One way to make HDR-like with films and cheap-not-advanced material is to do a several development of the same film to the same paper, with different exposures parameters. That way you combine different ranges of the image (eg stop 1-4 + stop 4-10 + stop 10-18) to produce you final image. This is a great craft workship. The only limit is the chemistry of the films used (giving grains at almost nano scale), multiplied by the size of the film. Side note: development is basically a picture of a picture (usually) done with different chemicals and photographic setup. reply yourapostasy 3 hours agorootparentprev20 stops dynamic range is about the human eye's range.

The developer job is to fine tune the parameters to print the infos you’re seeking, and that include adjusting white and black points thresholds (range). You can also do several print if you want to extract more infos, and print it so large you see the grain shapes! If there’s is something lost it’s when the picture is taken, after that it’s up to you to exploit it the way you need. It’s very similar to a numeric device capturing RAWs and the developer finishing the picture on a software like Camera Raw, or what some modern phone does automatically for you. 0 not English native, perhaps this is a synonym of developement? reply ArnoVW 7 hours agoparentprevthose engineering cameras were not your regular run-of-the mill cameras neither.

Accident investigations would have taken ten times as long without that footage. reply nickff 53 minutes agorootparentI absolutely love that beautiful film footage, particularly well-exhibited in one of my favorite documentaries, the spectacular \"When We Left Earth\" (a lovely and lengthy series). That said... Modern rockets have the ability to stream a great deal more data, including live camera streams, than the Mercury/Gemini/Apollo or Space Shuttle could. This increased real-time data bandwidth is probably much more valuable than high-dynamic-range cameras were. reply bell-cot 5 hours agorootparentprevI'd assume that BO has plenty of high-res/high-contrast-range imagery - that's just too useful for engineering analysis, post-launch. What they release to the public is a separate issue. reply tambourine_man 6 hours agoparentprevIt could be an exposure issue. Film has a response curve with a big “shoulder” in the highest values. It makes it really hard to blow out highlights. Digital sensors have a linear response to light, so if the highlights are a bit over a threshold, they are gone. If you’re willing to tolerate more noise and shoot RAW, you could underexpose, perhaps by as much as 4 stops, and apply a strong curve in post. It would pretty much guarantee no blown out highlights. Most people find luminance noise aesthetically pleasing up to a point and digital is already much cleaner than film ever was, so it’s a worthy trade off, if you ask me. But “Expose To The Left/Right” is a heated topic among photographers. reply shagie 4 hours agorootparentSpitballing, but a HDR digital camera could be designed with a beamsplitter similar to that of the 3CCD ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-CCD_camera ) designs that projects to an assembly with only a sensor behind it, another to an assembly that has a 4 stop neutral density and sensor, and another to an assembly that has an 8 stop neutral density and and sensor. This way it wouldn't suffer from any parallax issues and sensor images should then also line up to allow it to be reconstructed from the multiple sources. That said... HDR images can be \"bland\" with it being washed out. It would probably take a bit more post processing work to get the image both high dynamic range and providing the dynamism of what those old Saturn V launches showed. reply numpad0 2 hours agorootparentI think what you need is a plain old half-silvered beam splitter, not the 3CCD prism. The dichroic prism uses combinations of coatings to separate RGB into different optical paths. You don't need that. reply shagie 1 hour agorootparentHalf silvered would work too. I was using the 3CCD prism as an example of splitting an image into multiple parts and avoiding issues with parallax. If you stacked cameras on top of each other with their own lenses, you'd inevitably get slightly different focal lengths, focal distances, and camera positions. Aside with the dichotic filter... there was a neat trick that was lost (and refound) with a sodium 589nm dichromic (notch) prism. https://youtu.be/UQuIVsNzqDk reply johnp314 4 hours agoparentprevWhat am I missing?

I’m doing a PPL in Europe and we, like everybody, use feet and knots/mph. I believe this is because the US have been on the forefront of aerospace regulation (a set of rules called the chicago convention is the basis of all air law) and aircraft manufacturing. reply raverbashing 8 hours agorootparentNot for aerospace no And knots are not mph, they're \"nautical miles per hour\" which are a different measure (1nm is 1.8km, not 1.6km as the regular mile\") reply Tankenstein 7 hours agorootparentSorry, not a native speaker, I was under the impression that aerospace means air and space. I guess i meant aviation. I didn’t imply knots are mph, I used the slash to signify “or”. They are completely different units, but both are used. Sometimes the airspeed indicator even has two scales, one for kt and one for mph. reply throw5959 8 hours agorootparentprevCan confirm, all aviation worldwide deals in feet and knots. It's also because it's much easier to do calculations on the fly (literally) - in your head. Metric is precise and logical but harder to use in stressful situations. reply curl-up 8 hours agorootparentCan you please give some real-world example of why it's easier to do calculations? Not disputing what you say, just hard for me to imagine why it would be so. reply HPsquared 8 hours agorootparent1 knot is about 100 ft/min which is very convenient for descent at a specific glide slope (i.e. for 100 knots ground speed at 5% slope you want 500 ft/min descent rate). Standard is 3° which is about 5%. Knots are also handy for navigation as 1 nautical mile equals 1 minute of latitude. And of course a knot is 1 nautical mile per hour. So if you're doing 300 knots, that's 5 degrees of latitude per hour. The units fit together nicely as a system. reply Ringz 6 hours agorootparentThe calculation in the metric system would not necessarily be more complicated, but it would be different because the reference points in the metric system are not directly aligned with the geography of the Earth. \"1 knot is about 100 ft/min which is very convenient for descent at a specific glide slope (i.e. for 100 knots ground speed at 5% slope you want 500 ft/min descent rate). Standard is 3° which is about 5%.\" You are right. It's an easy calculation. But I would say its easy because its historically based on imperial units. Its easy to think about easy calculations like this in metric units like: A 5% slope means descending 1 meter vertically for every 20 meters horizontally. reply HPsquared 5 hours agorootparentThe gradient thing would work if ground speed and vertical speed were both in m/s, but km/h is more common in metric for a ground speed. You don't usually think in terms of hours during a climb/descent! Glide slope of 3.6% would fit nicely though. Then, 100 km/h ground speed goes with vertical speed 1 m/s. Metric navigation would use the fact 90 degrees of latitude is 10,000 km. reply jaggederest 7 hours agorootparentprevI suspect that the math is even easier using meters, meters, and meters per second than nautical miles, feet, and knots. I'll eat my hat if you can tell me the conversion from feet or inches to nautical miles without looking it up reply dullcrisp 6 hours agorootparentWell if what they say is true then 100ft/min = 1 nautical mile/60min, so one nautical mile is 6000ft.

Metric is nice and clean tenths, but the real world is seldomly easily expressed in clean tenths. Another example: The feet is cleanly divisible in thirds, quarters, and twelfths, which is greatly appreciated in industry and particularly construction. Also to be bluntly mundane, almost everyone can just look down and have a rough measure of a foot which is good enough for daily use.

To approximate the length of a field, you just walk along it with big steps and count. It will not be correct, but pretty close. A cm is a little bit smaller than the width of your index finger. It's all bout what you are used to. Metric doesn't \"fly over people's head\" where metric is the standard way to measure things, but inches, feet, gallons, pounds, miles fly over our head because we are not used to it so don't have any frame of reference. reply plantain 8 hours agorootparentprevCertainly not \"worldwide\".

And it's hard to find out how much money Blue Origin has burnt but it seems to be largely supported by Bezos who years ago pledged to fund it to the tune of $1 billion a year. Allegedly BO has >11K employees and payroll alone is estimated to exceed $2B a year with little revenue to pay for it. Bezos may well be $10-20B+ in the hole. Now consider the market for the New Glenn. It seems to have a payload capacity around 3x that of Falcon 9 and 2/3 that of Falcon Heavy. As we know, there's not a lot of demand for Falcon Heavy, there having been 11 launches (compared to 439 for Falcon 9). SpaceX also has created demand through Starlink. For anyone launching a satellite, the Falcon 9 has an impressive track record. It's unclear how much SpaceX saves by reusing first stage boosters but it certainly increases their potential launch cadence and there were close to 150 launches in 2024 alone. So I'm happy to see competition in this field but it's unclear to me what market there is for New Glenn (or even Starship for that matter, but that's a separate story) but Falcon 9 seems to have saturated the launch market.

Only after 5 years did they transition to becoming a rocket company, having decided that lowering the cost of access to space was the most important first step to realizing O'Neill's vision. And they were right, it's just that SpaceX realized the same thing at about the same time and were much more successful at it.

However, without being able to recover a rocket, it's actually quite difficult to figure out just how much corners you can cut, while remaining reliable. Since blowing up revenue payload is an awful way to optimize this, I think this means that disposal rockets will be inefficient in a different way - there will be excess safety margin in the wrong areas. Reliable re-use also changes the operating model of the company. Since each rocket in stock represents many customers over time, you don't need to be nearly as stressed about exactly matching your manufacturing pipeline to predicted demand. This likely also enables generally faster turn around time (as in from cheque signed to launch). Finally, as it turns out, it's not unreasonable to expect a rocket to be reused like 20+ times. I think you're point would be reasonable if it turned out that reusing a rocket more than ~3-5 times was difficult. But like... it's REALLY hard to do disposal anything better than something that can be reused 20+ times. reply sebzim4500 3 hours agoparentprevThis was the argument a decade ago when SpaceX was the only one seriously talking about reuse.

The shuttle SRB thing was a wasteful farce meant to pay lip service to the loftier goals set by earlier Shuttle proposals (such as real flyback boosters.) A far better example, although still not exactly the same sort of thing, would be landing the SSMEs with every orbiter landing. They obviously required refurbishment (as all Falcon 9 Merlin engines do too) and the propellant tanks were expended, but the engineering that went into the SSMEs is a much better example of precedent to Falcon 9 than dropping spent SRBs on parachutes. SLS/Artemis is actually using some of the specific SSMEs that have flown before on Shuttles. Veteran engines, but they will be discarded this time, no more refurbing.

If this were a SpaceX launch of a brand new rocket we'd be calling this a success and noting how they'd almost certainly achieve the secondary goal soon. I think the question is how well and quickly Blue Origin can iterate to achieve first stage reuse.

    "title": "100x defect tolerance: How we solved the yield problem",
    "originLink": "https://cerebras.ai/blog/100x-defect-tolerance-how-cerebras-solved-the-yield-problem",
    "originBody": "Conventional wisdom in semiconductor manufacturing has long held that bigger chips mean worse yields. Yet at Cerebras, we’ve successfully built and commercialized a chip 50x larger than the largest computer chips – and achieved comparable yields. This seeming paradox is one of our most frequently asked questions: how do we achieve a usable yield with a wafer-scale processor? The answer lies in rethinking the relationship between chip size and fault tolerance. This article will provide a detailed, apples-to-apples comparison of manufacturing yields between the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine and an H100-sized chip, both manufactured at 5nm. By examining the interplay between defect rates, core size, and fault tolerance, we’ll show how we achieve wafer scale integration with equal or better yields vs. reticle limited GPUs. What determines yield Like any manufacturing process, computer chips are prone to defects. Larger chips are more likely to encounter defects, thus as chips grow in size, yields fall exponentially with increasing die area. Even though larger chips generally run faster, early microprocessors were built to a modest size to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields and profit margins. In the early 2000s, this started to change. As transistor budgets grew to over 100 million, it became the norm to build processors with multiple independent cores per chip. Since all the cores were identical and independent, chip designers built-in core-level fault tolerance so that if one core suffered a defect, the remaining cores could still operate. For example in 2006 Intel released the Intel Core Duo – a chip with two CPU cores. If one core was faulty, it was disabled and the product was sold as an Intel Core Solo. Nvidia, AMD, and others all embraced this core-level redundancy in the coming years. Today, fault tolerance is widely used by high performance processors and it’s perfectly normal to sell chips with some cores disabled. AMD and Intel CPUs generally ship a flagship version with all cores enabled and a lower end version with a portion of cores disabled. Nvidia’s data center GPUs are substantially larger than CPU dies and as a result even its flagship models have some portion of cores disabled. Take the Nvidia H100 – a massive GPU weighing in at 814mm2. Traditionally this chip would be very difficult to yield economically. But since its cores (SMs) are fault tolerant, a manufacturing defect does not knock out the entire product. The chip physically has 144 SMs but the commercialized product only has 132 SMs active. This means the chip could suffer numerous defects across 12 SMs and still be sold as a flagship part. Defect tolerance is the key to yield Traditionally, chip size directly dictated chip yields. In the modern era, yield is a function of both chip size and defect tolerance. 800mm2 chips were once thought infeasible to commercialize due to yield, but by using defect tolerant design, they are now mainstream products. The degree of defect tolerance can be measured by the amount of chip area that is lost when a defect occurs. For multi-core chips, this means the smaller the core, the greater the defect tolerance. If individual cores are small enough, it may be possible to build a very large chip. Wafer Scale Engine Cores At Cerebras, before committing to build a wafer-scale chip, we first designed a very small core. Each AI core in the Wafer Scale Engine 3 is approximately 0.05mm2 or about 1% the size of an H100 SM core. Both core designs are fault tolerant. This means a defect in a WSE core would disable 0.05mm2 of silicon while the same defect in an H100 disables ~6mm2. To a first order of approximation, the wafer scale engine is ~100x more fault tolerant than a GPU when considering the silicon area affected by each defect. The Routing Architecture But small cores alone aren’t enough. We developed a sophisticated routing architecture that allows us to dynamically reconfigure connections between cores. When a defect is detected, the system can automatically route around it using redundant communication pathways, preserving the chip’s overall computational capabilities by leveraging nearby cores. This routing system works in concert with a small reserve of spare cores that can be used to replace defective units. Unlike previous approaches that required massive redundancy overhead, our architecture achieves high yield with minimal spare capacity through intelligent routing. A wafer scale walkthrough Defect tolerance at a chip level is fairly clear. Let’s now compare how a traditional GPU and a wafer-scale chip would yield using TSMC 5nm’s 300mm wafer: On the left is a H100-like GPU: it is 814mm2, it has 144 fault tolerant cores, and a single 300mm wafer yields 72 full die chips. On the right we have the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine 3. It’s one giant square measuring 46,225mm2. It has 970,000 fault tolerant cores. One wafer yields one chip. At the current TSMC 5nm node, TSMC’s process reportedly has ~0.001 defect per mm2. 72 GPU dies have total die area of 58,608mm2. Applying this defect density, this area would see a total of 59 defects. For simplicity, let’s assume each defect lands on a separate core. At 6.2mm2 per core, this means 361mm2 of die space would be lost of defects. On the Cerebras side, the effective die size is a bit smaller at 46,225mm2. Applying the same defect rate, the WSE-3 would see 46 defects. Each core is 0.05mm2. This means 2.2mm2 in total would be lost to defects. Measuring the total area lost, the GPU in this case loses 164x more silicon area than the Wafer Scale Engine on an apple-to-apples basis on the same manufacturing node and defect rate. The above makes a high-level point but simplifies a few details. First, not all areas of the chip are taken by the compute cores. Caches, memory controllers, and on-chip fabric take up a substantial amount of die size, perhaps up to 50%. However, these components can be designed to be fault tolerant in their own way. An H100 SM is likely smaller than 6.2mm2 due to these components, though not by an order of magnitude. Second, a cluster of defects could overwhelm fault tolerant areas and disable the whole chip. In practice, even fault tolerant chips will not yield close to 100%. These caveats aside, the general rule that smaller cores make for greater fault tolerance still holds. Putting Cerebras in the Table Let’s revisit the first table, now with the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine added. Like Nvidia’s data center GPUs, the WSE-3 is designed to be fault-tolerant and disables a portion of its cores to manage yield. Because our cores are so tiny, the number of cores is so much larger – 970,000 physical cores with 900,000 active on our current shipping product. This provides tremendous, fine grained, defect tolerance. Despite having built the world’s largest chip, we enable 93% of our silicon area, which is higher than the leading GPU today. To summarize, Cerebras resolved the wafer scale manufacturing challenge by designing a small fault-tolerant core in combination with a fault tolerant on-chip fabric. While total chip area increased by ~50x compared to conventional GPUs, we reduced individual core size by ~100x. As a result, defects are far less damaging to the WSE than conventional multi-core processors. The third generation WSE engine achieves 93% silicon utilization – the highest among leading AI accelerators – demonstrating that wafer-scale computing is not just possible, but commercially viable at scale.

This is exactly analogous to using bits in your storage for error correcting vs storing data. That said, I think they do a great job of exploiting this technique to create a \"larger\"[1] chip. And like storage it benefits from every core is the same and you don't need to get to every core directly (pin limiting). In the early 2000's I was looking at a wafer scale startup that had the same idea but they were applying it to an FPGA architecture rather than a set of tensor units for LLMs. Nearly the exact same pitch, \"we don't have to have all of our GLUs[2] work because the built in routing only uses the ones that are qualified.\" Xilinx was still aggressively suing people who put SERDES ports on FPGAs so they were pin limited overall but the idea is sound. While I continue to believe that many people are going to collectively lose trillions of dollars ultimately pursuing \"AI\" at this stage. I appreciate the the amount of money people are willing to put at risk here allow for folks to try these \"out of the box\" kinds of ideas.

The crypto crashes were bad enough but at least gamers got some very cheap GPUs out of all the failed crypto farms back then, but this time so much more money, particularly institutional money, is flowing around AI that we're looking at a repeat of Lehman's once people wake up and realize they've been scammed. reply dsign 11 hours agorootparentThose glorified token predictors are the missing piece in the puzzle of general intelligence. There is a long way to go still in putting all those pieces together, but I don't think any of the steps left are in the same order of \"we need a miracle breakthrough\". That said, I believe that this is going one of two ways: we use AI to make things materially harder for humans, in a scale from \"you don't get this job\" to \"oops, this is Skynet\", with many unpleasant stops in the middle. By the amount of money going into AI right now and most of the applications I'm seeing being hyped, I don't think we have have any scruples with this direction. The other way this can go, and Cerebras is a good example, is that we increase our compute capability and our AI-usefulness to a point where we can fight cancer and stop/revert aging, both being a computational problem at this point. Even if most people don't realize it, or most people have strong moral objections to this outcome and don't even want to talk about it, so it probably won't happen. In simpler words, I think we want to use AI to commit species suicide :-) reply Shorel 6 hours agorootparentI'm sure there are more missing pieces. We are more than Broca's areas. Our intelligence is much more than linguistic intelligence. However, and this is also an important point, we have built language models far more capable than any language model a single human brain can have. Makes me shudder in awe of what's going to happen when we add the missing pieces. reply idiotsecant 5 hours agorootparentYes, I sometimes wonder if what we're witnessing in our lifetimes is the next stage of the 'bootstrapping' of life into a more complex form. If we might be the mitochondria contributing our little piece to the cell that comes after. reply Shorel 6 hours agorootparentprevWhile I basically agree with everything you say, I have to add some caveats: ChatGPT, while being as far from true AGI as the Elisa chatbot written in Lisp, is extraordinarily more useful, and being used for many things that previously required humans to write the bullshit, like lobbying and propaganda. And Crypto... right now BTC is at an historical highest. It could even go higher. And it will eventually crash again. It's the nature of that beast. reply KronisLV 15 hours agorootparentprev> And just as every other hype cycle, this one will crash down hard. Isn't that an inherent problem with pretty much everything nowadays: crypto, blockchain, AI, even the likes of serverless and Kubernetes, or cloud and microservices in general. There's always some hype cycle where the people who are early benefit and a lot of people chasing the hype later lose when the reality of the actual limitations and the real non-inflated utility of each technology hits. And then, a while later, it all settles down. I don't think the current \"AI\" is special in any way, it's just that everyone tries to get rich (or benefit in other ways, as in the microservices example, where you still very much had a hype cycle) quick without caring about the actual details. reply anon373839 14 hours agorootparent> I don't think the current \"AI\" is special in any way As someone who loves to pour ice water on AI hype, I have to say: you can't be serious.

The US is notoriously ‘clean’ compared to most (probably top 10). Even in the US, if you suddenly stopped 10-12% of GDP we’re talking ‘great depression’ levels of economic pain. Honestly, the only reason Crypto isn’t bigger IMO is because there is such a large and established set of folks doing laundering in the ‘normal’ system, and those work well enough there is not nearly as much demand as you’d expect. reply KronisLV 9 hours agorootparentprev> The current AI tech has opened up paths to develop applications that were impossible just a few years ago. My argument is that if it's advertised as a direct precursor to AGI based on wishful thinking and people don't know any better, then it's no different to claims about how putting blockchain technology in X industry will solve all of its problems. I use LLMs daily and don't scoff at AI generated imagery or use cases like agentic systems, but there absolutely is a similar hype cycle to every other innovation out there where people are borderline delusional in the initial stages (Kubernetes will solve all of our issues, moving to cloud and microservices will solve all of our issues, the blockchain will...), before the limitations crystallize and we know what each technology is good or bad at. Though maybe that says more about human nature than the technology itself. > It's very different from crypto, the main use case for which appears to be money laundering. That's akin to saying \"The main use case for AI appears to be stealing people's art and even for writers and others it seems to be firing people to replace them with soulless AI generated slop.\" I'd even argue that there's nothing wrong with the technologies themselves, be it LLMs, AI for image, video, audio generation, blockchain and crypto, or whatever. The problems arise based on how the technologies are used, or in my argument above - how they're touted as the solution to all the problems. Some people profit a lot, others collide with reality and their limitations at speed. In other words, if the technology will generate 100 billion USD of actual value but people are betting on 500 billion USD, then clearly we have a bit of an issue. reply carlhjerpe 10 hours agorootparentprevBoth Kubernetes and serverless (FaaS) is here to stay.

They are beginning to incorporate memory, chain of thought, and other architectural tricks that use the token predictor in novel ways to produce some startlingly useful output. It's certainly the case that an LLM alone cannot achieve AGI. As a component of a larger system though? That remains to be seen. Maybe all we need to do is duct tape a limbic system and memory onto an LLM and the result is something sort of like an AGI. It's a little bit like saying that a ball bearing can't possibly ever be an internal combustion engine. While true, it's sidestepping the point a little bit. reply immibis 8 hours agorootparentprevWhy do you think that an AGI can't be a token predictor? reply Shorel 6 hours agorootparentBy analogy with human brains: Because our own brains are far more than the Broca's areas in them. Evolution selects for efficiency. If token prediction could work for everything, our brains would also do nothing else but token prediction. Even the brains of fishes and insects would work like that. The human brain has dedicated clusters of neurons for several different cognitive abilities, including face recognition, line detection, body parts self perception, 3D spatial orientation, and so on. reply myrmidon 4 hours agorootparent> Evolution selects for efficiency. I think this is a poor argument here. From an evolutionary point of view, our brains are optimized to: - Provide fine-motor control to craft weapons and tools (enhancing adaptibility and enabling us to hunt way outside our weight class) - Communicate/coordinate effectively in small groups - Do sensor processing and the above with a low energy budget Our brains are *not* selected to be minimum-complexity intelligences, and a lot of what our brain does is completely useless for AGI building (motor control, sensor processing, ...). Furthermore, the cost/complexity (from a evolutionary PoV) is a totally different beast from what complexity means to us. Just consider flight as an example: A fruitfly is an insanely simple and straightforward beast, but to us, a biochemically fuelled, beating-wing design is still infeasibly complicated. If our approach to flight had been to ape after how nature does it in detail, we likely still would not have planes. I do agree that todays LLMs still have clear architectural flaws that we need to overcome (online learning being a very glaring one), but, to pick up the flight analogy, we might well have the main wing structure already down, and we won't necessarily have to make those wings beat to get into the air... reply Shorel 2 hours agorootparentJust because there are some parts of our brains that are not needed for an AGI... Doesn't mean that there aren't some part of our brains that are needed for an AGI, and are not present in the current crop of LLM. reply immibis 4 hours agorootparentprevWhat do our brains do that isn't token prediction?

How could it possibly do that without an implicit awareness of all aspects of language, including grammar and parts of speech? That implicit awareness is indistinguishable from knowledge, at least to the extent it yields correct results. And the fact that it was inferred from examples rather than taught explicitly is indistinguishable from intelligence. reply kragen 6 hours agorootparentprevI did eventually get an LLM to produce what seems to be a correct diagram of a sentence it had never seen, but it took about ten tries. Grammatical analysis seems to have happened correctly every time, but getting to a usable diagram was difficult. (I know that it's generally rude to include LLM output in HN comments, but in this case I think it's essential supporting material to elevate the discussion of LLM capabilities above \"yes it is\", \"no it isn't\".) First, I just asked ChatGPT (GPT-4o mini, what they offer anonymous free users): > Please diagram the sentence, \"If my mother's road had been cultural, my uncle's sloth squad residue would have compiled a periodic meadow of night.\" I just invented that sentence, picking several words with a random number generator, but of course I can't prove to you that I didn't copy it from some book you haven't seen. (For that, you'd have to invent a sentence yourself, or at least provide me with some words to include in it.) I hope you can at least agree that it's a highly unlikely sentence for anyone ever to have uttered before! After talking to itself for a few paragraphs, it arrived at the following grammatical analysis: Step 4: Diagramming the sentence Main Clause: Subject: \"my uncle's sloth squad residue\" Verb: \"would have compiled\" Direct Object: \"a periodic meadow of night\" \"a periodic meadow\" (noun phrase) \"of night\" (prepositional phrase modifying \"meadow\") Conditional Clause: Subject: \"my mother's road\" Verb: \"had been\" (linking verb) Predicate Adjective: \"cultural\" This is exactly correct. From that it produced the following ASCII art \"diagram\", which looks like nonsense to me, but maybe it's in some kind of sentence-diagramming formalism I haven't seen: If ______/______| my mother's had been roadcultural my uncle's sloth squad residuewould have compileda periodic meadow of nightof night I told it the diagram looked like nonsense, and it produced this one, which looks worse: If _______/______| my mother's road had been| cultural (Main Clause)my uncle's sloth squad residuewould have compileda periodic meadowof night I asked GPT-4 (paid) the same question, and it gave me another exactly correct grammatical analysis in words: 1. **Identify the main clauses**: - \"If my mother's road had been cultural\" is a dependent clause (specifically, a conditional clause). - \"my uncle's sloth squad residue would have compiled a periodic meadow of night\" is the main clause. 2. **Start with the main clause**: - Subject: \"my uncle's sloth squad residue\" - \"my uncle's\" modifies \"sloth squad,\" which in turn modifies \"residue.\" - Predicate: \"would have compiled\" - This includes the modal auxiliary verb (\"would\"), perfect auxiliary (\"have\"), and main verb (\"compiled\"). - Direct object: \"a periodic meadow of night\" - “a” is an article modifying “meadow,” - “periodic” modifies “meadow,” - “of night” is a prepositional phrase modifying “meadow.” 3. **Diagram the dependent clause**: - Subject: \"road\" - Modified by possessive noun phrase “my mother’s” - Predicate: \"had been\" - Complement/Adjective: \"cultural\" (I feel like this is definitely \"a level that you'd assume to be competitive to a human\", in mschuster91's phrase; most native English speakers can't do that.) But then it came up with the following incorrect diagram: +---------------------------------------------------+Main Clause+---------------------------------------------------+/\\/\\/\\ [My uncle's] [sloth squad] [residue] \\ / / \\ / / \\ / /would have compiled -------------------\\\\\\[a periodic meadow of night]/\\/\\a periodic [of night] +---------------------+Dependent Clause+---------------------+ Ifroad ___|_____| my mother's had been cultural Telling it the diagram was nonsense didn't help. But my conclusion from this is not that GPT-4 can't analyze the grammatical structure of sentences it had never seen. It's that GPT-4 gets \"confused\" when it tries to draw ASCII art, like a person trying to tell you how to draw it over the telephone, but not quite as bad. I've seen similarly abominable results when it tried to draw circuit schematics and guitar tablatures as ASCII art. I tried asking it for a graphviz diagram, which was syntactically correct graphviz code but didn't express the sentence structure properly. I tried simplifying the problem with the prompt, 'Please provide a syntactic tree showing the syntactic derivation of the sentence, \"My uncle's sloth squad residue would have compiled a periodic meadow of night,\" using graphviz syntax and with individual words at the leaf nodes of the tree.' which yielded a slightly incorrect diagram. (I'm still sure nobody has ever uttered this sentence before.) On being told, \"This diagram is not quite right.\", GPT-4 produced the following diagram, which I believe is correct except for an extra \"s\" on \"uncle\" (you can see this in your browser at https://is.gd/Axufjx): digraph G { node [shape=plaintext]; S [label=\"S\"]; NP [label=\"NP\"]; VP [label=\"VP\"]; S -> NP; S -> VP; // Noun Phrase breakdown DP_my [label=\"DP\"]; DP_my -> My; UnclePossessive [label=\"NP\"]; UnclePossessive -> Uncles; UnclePossessive -> ApostropheS; NP -> DP_my; NP -> UncleCompound; UncleCompound [label=\"NP\"]; SlothSquadResidue[label = \"N'\"]; SlothSquadResidue-> Sloth; SlothSquadResidue-> SquadResidue; SquadResidue[label = \"N'\"] SquadResidue-> Squad; SquadResidue-> Residue; UncleCompound-> UnclePossessive; UncleCompound-> SlothSquadResidue; // Verb Phrase breakdown ModalWould[label = \"Modal\"]; ModalWould-> Would; AuxHave[label = \"Aux\"]; AuxHave-> Have; VCompiled[label = \"V\"]; VCompiled-> Compiled; ObjectNP[label = \"NP\"]; // Direct object noun phrase ArticleA[label = \"D\"]; ArticleA-> A; MeadowPhrase[label = \"N'\"]; // 'Meadow' modified by 'periodic' AdjPeriodic[label = \"Adj\"]; AdjPeriodic-> Periodic; MeadowWord[label = N]; MeadowWord -> Meadow; MeadowPhrase -> AdjPeriodic; MeadowPhrase -> MeadowWord; PPofNight[label = PP]; // Prepositional phrase 'of night' PrepOf[label=P] PrepOf-> Of; NightNounPhrase[label=N] NightNounPhrase-> Night; PPofNight -> PrepOf; PPofNight -> NightNounPhrase; ObjectNP -> ArticleA; ObjectNP -> MeadowPhrase; ObjectNP -> PPofNight; VP -> ModalWould; VP -> AuxHave; VP -> VCompiled VP -> ObjectNP } Claude produced a reasonably serviceable diagram on the first try with that prompt: digraph SyntacticTree { node [shape=plaintext]; S -> NP1; S -> VP; NP1 -> DET1 [label=\"Det\"]; NP1 -> NP2 [label=\"NP\"]; NP2 -> NP3 [label=\"NP\"]; NP2 -> N1 [label=\"N\"]; NP3 -> N2 [label=\"N\"]; NP3 -> POS [label=\"Pos\"]; VP -> AUX1 [label=\"Aux\"]; VP -> AUX2 [label=\"Aux\"]; VP -> V [label=\"V\"]; VP -> NP4 [label=\"NP\"]; NP4 -> DET2 [label=\"Det\"]; NP4 -> ADJ [label=\"Adj\"]; NP4 -> N3 [label=\"N\"]; NP4 -> PP [label=\"PP\"]; PP -> P [label=\"P\"]; PP -> NP5 [label=\"NP\"]; NP5 -> N4 [label=\"N\"]; DET1 -> \"My\"; N2 -> \"uncle\"; POS -> \"'s\"; N1 -> \"sloth\"; N1 -> \"squad\"; N1 -> \"residue\"; AUX1 -> \"would\"; AUX2 -> \"have\"; V -> \"compiled\"; DET2 -> \"a\"; ADJ -> \"periodic\"; N3 -> \"meadow\"; P -> \"of\"; N4 -> \"night\"; } On being told, I think incorrectly, \"This diagram is not quite right.\", it produced a worse diagram.

It did considerably better with Graphviz than with ASCII art, but it still had trouble with the transition from a perfectly correct and highly nuanced verbal grammatical analysis to Graphviz. I think this is pretty convincing evidence against ChuckMcM's implicit position. It's weaker evidence against mschuster91's explicit position because parsing is something computers have been doing for a long time, so it doesn't imply any new capabilities. I'm pretty sure there are part-of-speech tagging parsers using fairly shallow statistics that could also have produced an equivalently good sentence diagram. https://corenlp.run/ seems to produce a correct parse, though in a different format. reply CamperBob2 1 hour agorootparentprev(I know that it's generally rude to include LLM output in HN comments, but in this case I think it's essential supporting material to elevate the discussion of LLM capabilities above \"yes it is\", \"no it isn't\".)

The audience here does not consist largely of 'hackers', but seems to skew toward the sort of fearful, resentful reactionaries that hacker culture traditionally opposes. I will say I wouldn't peg ChuckMcM as being one of the reactionaries, though. That would be an unpleasant surprise. As far as the diagram goes, my guess is that sentence diagrams were underrepresented in the training corpus. Diagramming sentences was already out of fashion when I was in school in the 1980s -- in fact, I don't recall ever having done it. The model is struggling much the same way you'd expect a grade-school student (or me, I guess) to struggle upon being asked to perform the task for the first time. Knowing when to say \"I don't know how to do that\" is still a foundational weakness of LLMs, but I don't expect it to remain unaddressed for long. We will see improvement in that area, sooner or later.

But from the figures in this blog, this is massively outweighed by the fact that they only get 46222 sq mm useable area out of the wafer, as opposed to 56247 that the H100 gets - because they are using a single square die instead of filling the circular wafer with smaller square dies, they lose 10,025 sq mm! Not sure how that's a win. Unless the rest of the wafer is useable for some other customer? reply nine_k 20 hours agoparentIt's a win because they have to test one chip, and don't have to spend resources on connecting the chiplets. The latter costs a lot (though it has other advantages). I suspect that a chiplet-based device with total 900k cores would just be not viable due to the size constraints. If their routing around the defects is automated enough (given the highly regular structure), it may be a massive economy of efforts on testing and packaging the chip. reply ungreased0675 19 hours agoparentprevWhy does it have to be a square?

I think the proposal you're responding to is \"just use the whole circular wafer without cutting out a square\". reply axus 19 hours agorootparentprevMight be jumping in without reading, but the chips you cut out of the wafer have to be delivered to physically different locations. reply ajb 19 hours agorootparentNormally yes. But they're using a whole wafer for a single chip! So it's actually a good idea. I guess the issue is how do you design your routing fabric to work in the edge regions. Actually I wonder how they are exposing this wafer. Normal chips are exposed in a rectangular batch called a reticle. The reticle mask has repeated patterns across it, and it is then exposed repeatedly across the wafer. So either they have to make a reticle mask the full size of the wafer, which sounds expensive, or they somehow have to precisely align reticle exposures so that the joined edges form valid circuits. reply yannyu 19 hours agorootparentprevThe cost driver for fabbing out wafers is the number of layers and the number of usable devices per wafer. Higher layer count increases cost and tends to decrease yield, and more robust designs with higher yields increase usable devices per wafer. If circles or other shapes could help with either of those, they would likely be used. Generally the end goal is to have the most usable devices per wafer, so they'll be packed as tightly as possible on the wafer so as to have the highest potential output. reply Scaevolus 15 hours agorootparentRight, but they're making just one usable device per wafer already. reply olejorgenb 20 hours agoparentprevIs the wafer itself so expensive? I assume they don't pattern the unused area, so the process should be quicker? reply addaon 19 hours agorootparent> I assume they don't pattern the unused area I’m out of date on this stuff, so it’s possible things have changed, but I wouldn’t make that assumption. It is (used to be?) standard to pattern the entire wafer, with partially-off-the-wafer dice around the edges of the circle. The reason for this is that etching behavior depends heavily on the surrounding area — the amount of silicon or copper whatever etched in your neighborhood affects the speed of etching for you, which effects line width, and (for a single mask used for the whole wafer) thus either means you need to have more margin on your parameters (equivalent to running on an old process) or have a higher defect right near the edge of the die (which you do anyway, since you can only take “similar neighborhood” so far). This goes as far as, for hyper-optimized things like SRAM arrays, leaving an unused row and column at each border of the array. reply kurthr 15 hours agorootparentAll the process steps are limited by wafers for hour. Lithography (esp EUV) might be slightly faster, but that's not 30% of total steps, since you generally have deposit and etch/implant for every lithography step. It's close to a dead loss in process cost. reply yannyu 20 hours agorootparentprev> I assume they don't pattern the unused area, so the process should be quicker? The primary driver of time and cost in the fabrication process is the number of layers for the wafers, not the surface area, since all wafers going through a given process are the same size. So you generally want to maximize the number of devices per wafer, because a large part of your costs will be calculated at the per-wafer level, not a per-device level. reply mattashii 19 hours agorootparentYes, but isn't a big driver of layer costs the cost of the machines to build those layers? For patterning, a single iteration could be (example values, no actual values used, probably only ballpark accuracy) on a 300M$ EUV machine with 5-year write off cycle, patterns on average 180 full wafers /hour. Excluding energy usage and service time, each wafer that needs full patterning would cost ~38$. If each wafer only needed half the area patterned, the lithography machine might only spend half its usual time on such a wafer, and that could double the throughput of the EUV machine, halving the write-off based cost component of such a patterning step. Given that each layer generally consists of multiple patterning steps, a 10-20% reduction in those steps could give a meaningful reduction in time spent in the machines whose time spend on the wafer depends on the used wafer area. This of course doesn't help reduce time in polishing or etching (and other steps that happen with whole wafers at a time), so it won't be as straightforward as % reduction in wafer area usage == % reduction in cost, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was a meaningful percentage. reply yannyu 19 hours agorootparent> Yes, but isn't a big driver of layer costs the cost of the machines to build those layers? Let's say the time spent in lithography step is linear the way you're describing. Even with that, the deposition step beforehand is surface area independent and would be applied across the entire wafer, and takes just as long if not longer than the lithography. Additionally, if you were going to build a fab ground up for some specific purpose, then you might optimize the fab for those specific devices as you lay out. But most of these companies are not doing that and are simply going through TSMC or a similar subcontractor. So you've got an additional question of how far TSMC will go to accommodate customers who only want to use half a wafer, and whether that's the kind of project they could profitably cater to. reply olejorgenb 19 hours agorootparentprevYes, but my understanding is that the wafer is exposed in multiple steps, so there would still be less exposure steps? Probably insignificant compared to all the rest though. (Etching, moving the wafer, etc.) EDIT: to clarify - I mean the exposure of one single pattern/layer is done in multiple steps. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography#Projection) reply yannyu 19 hours agorootparentThe number of exposure steps would be unrelated to the (surface area) size of die/device that you're making. In fact, in semiconductor manufacturing you're typically trying to maximize the number of devices per wafer because it costs the same to manufacture 1 device with 10 layers vs 100 devices with 10 layers on the same wafer. This goes so far as to have companies or business units share wafers for prototyping runs so as to minimize cost per device (by maximizing output per wafer). Also, etching, moving, etc is all done on the entire wafer at the same time generally, via masks and baths. It's less of a pencil/stylus process, and more of a t-shirt silk-screening process. reply gpm 18 hours agorootparent> This goes so far as to have companies or business units share wafers for prototyping runs so as to minimize cost per device Can this be done in production? Is there a chance that the portion of the wafer cerebras.ai can't fit their giant square in is being used for production of some other companies chips? reply pulvinar 19 hours agorootparentprevThere's also no reason they couldn't pattern that area with some other suitable commodity chips. Like how sawmills and butchers put all cuts to use. reply sitkack 18 hours agorootparentOften those areas are used for test chips and structures for the next version. They are effectively free, so you can use them to test out ideas. reply ajb 20 hours agorootparentprevGood question. I think the wafer has a cost per area which is fairly significant, but I don't have any figures. There has historically been a push to utilise them more efficiently, eg by building fabs that can process larger wafers. Although mask exposure would be per processed area, I think that there are also some proportion of processing time which is per wafer, so the unprocessed area would have an opportunity cost relating to that. reply kristjansson 19 hours agorootparentprevAIUI Wafer marginal cost is lower than you'd expect.

Analogous to a conglomerate wrapping each business vertical in a limited liability veil so that lawsuits and bankruptcy do not bring down the whole company. The smaller the subsidiaries, the less defect contamination but also the less scope for frictionless resource and information sharing. reply bee_rider 20 hours agoprev> Second, a cluster of defects could overwhelm fault tolerant areas and disable the whole chip. That’s an interesting point. In architecture class (which was basic and abstract so I’m sure Cerebras is doing something much more clever), we learned that defects cluster, but this is a good thing. A bunch of defects clustering on one core takes out the core, a bunch of defects not clustering could take out… a bunch of cores, maybe rendering the whole chip useless. I wonder why they don’t like clustering. I could imagine in a network of little cores, maybe enough defects clustered on the network could… sort of overwhelm it, maybe? Also I wonder how much they benefit from being on one giant wafer. It is definitely cool as hell. But could chiplets eat away at their advantage? reply IshKebab 20 hours agoprevTSMC also have a manufacturing process used by Tesla's Dojo where you can cut up the chips, throw away the defective ones, and then reassemble working ones into a sort of wafer scale device (5x5 chips for Dojo).

If you told me you had an 8% core defect rate reduced 100x, I'd assume you got to close to 99% enablement. The table at the end shows... Otherwise. They also keep flipping between cores, SMs, dies, and maybe other block sizes. At the end of the day I'm not very impressed. They seemingly have marginally better yields despite all that effort. reply sfink 17 hours agoparentI think you're missing the point. The comparison is not between 93% and 92%. The comparison is between what they're getting (93%) and what you'd get if you scaled up the usual process to the core size they're using (0%). They are doing something different (namely: a ~whole wafer chip) that isn't possible without massively boosting the intra-chip redundancy. (The usual process stops working once you no longer have any extra dies to discard.) > Despite having built the world’s largest chip, we enable 93% of our silicon area, which is higher than the leading GPU today. The important part is building the largest chip. The icing on the top is that the enablement is not lower. Which it would be without the routing-to-spare-cores magic sauce. And the differing terminology is because they're talking about differing things? You could call an SM a core, but it kind of contains (heterogeneous) cores itself. (I've no idea whether intra-SM cores can be redundant to boost yield.) A die is the part you break off and build a computer out of, it may contain a bunch of cores, a wafer can be broken up into multiple dies but for Cerebras it isn't. If NVIDIA were to go and build a whole-wafer die, they'd do something similar. But Cerebras did it and got it to work. NVIDIA hasn't gotten into that space yet, so there's no point in building a product that you can't sell to a consumer or even a data center that isn't built around that exact product (or to contain a Balrog). reply Neywiny 6 hours agorootparentI think I'll still stand by my viewpoint. They said: > On the Cerebras side, the effective die size is a bit smaller at 46,225mm2. Applying the same defect rate, the WSE-3 would see 46 defects. Each core is 0.05mm2. This means 2.2mm2 in total would be lost to defects. So ok they claim that they should see (46225-2.2)/46225 = 99.995%. Doing the same math for their Nvidia numbers it's 99.4%. And yet in practice neither approach got to these numbers. Nowhere near it. I just feel like the whole article talks about all this theory and numbers and math of how they're so much better but in practice it's meaningless. So what I'm not seeing is why it'd be impossible for all the H100s on a wafer to be interconnected and call it a day. You'd presumably get 92/93 = 98.9% of the performance and, here's the kicker, no need to switch to another architecture. I didn't know where your 0% number came from. Nothing about this article says that a competitor doing the same scaling to wafer scale would get 0%, just a marginal decrease in how many cores made it through fab. Fundamentally I am not convinced from this article that Cerebras has done something in their design that makes this possible. All I'm seeing is that it'd perform 1% faster. Edit: thinking a bit more on it, to me it's like they said TSMC has a guy with a sledgehammer who smashes all the wafers and their architecture snaps a tiny bit cleaner. But they haven't said anything about firing the guy with the sledgehammer. Their paragraph before the final table says that this whole exercise is pretty much meaningless because their numbers are made up about competitors and they aren't even the right numbers to be using. Then the table backs up my paraphrase. reply fspeech 13 hours agorootparentprevThere is nothing inherently good about wafer scale. It's actually harder to dissipate heat and enable hybrid bonding with DRAM.

    "title": "Nepenthes is a tarpit to catch AI web crawlers",
    "originLink": "https://zadzmo.org/code/nepenthes/",
    "originBody": "Nepenthes This is a tarpit intended to catch web crawlers. Specifically, it's targetting crawlers that scrape data for LLM's - but really, like the plants it is named after, it'll eat just about anything that finds it's way inside. It works by generating an endless sequences of pages, each of which with dozens of links, that simply go back into a the tarpit. Pages are randomly generated, but in a deterministic way, causing them to appear to be flat files that never change. Intentional delay is added to prevent crawlers from bogging down your server, in addition to wasting their time. Lastly, optional Markov-babble can be added to the pages, to give the crawlers something to scrape up and train their LLMs on, hopefully accelerating model collapse. You can take a look at what this looks like, here. (Note: VERY slow page loads!) WARNING THIS IS DELIBERATELY MALICIOUS SOFTWARE INTENDED TO CAUSE HARMFUL ACTIVITY. DO NOT DEPLOY IF YOU AREN'T FULLY COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT YOU ARE DOING. ANOTHER WARNING LLM scrapers are relentless and brutual. You may be able to keep them at bay with this software - but it works by providing them with a neverending stream of exactly what they are looking for. YOU ARE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT CONTINUOUS CPU LOAD, ESPECIALLY WITH THE MARKOV MODULE ENABLED. YET ANOTHER WARNING There is not currently a way to differentiate between web crawlers that are indexing sites for search purposes, vs crawlers that are training AI models. ANY SITE THIS SOFTWARE IS APPLIED TO WILL LIKELY DISAPPEAR FROM ALL SEARCH RESULTS. Latest Version Nepenthes 1.0 All downloads Usage Expected usage is to hide the tarpit behind nginx or Apache, or whatever else you have implemented your site in. Directly exposing it to the internet is ill advised. We want it to look as innocent and normal as possible; in addition HTTP headers are used to configure the tarpit. I'll be using nginx configurations for examples. Here's a real world snippet for the demo above: location /nepenthes-demo/ { proxy_pass http://localhost:8893; proxy_set_header X-Prefix '/nepenthes-demo'; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr; proxy_buffering off; } You'll see several headers are added here: \"X-Prefix\" tells the tarpit that all links should go to that path. Make this match what is in the 'location' directive. X-Forwarded-For is optional, but will make any statistics gathered significantly more useful. The proxy_buffering directive is important. LLM crawlers typically disconnect if not given a response within a few seconds; Nepenthes counters this by drip-feeding a few bytes at a time. Buffering breaks this workaround. You can have multiple proxies to an individual Nepenthes instance; simply set the X-Prefix header accordingly. Installation You can use Docker, or install manually. A Dockerfile and compose.yaml is provided in the /docker directory. Simply tweak the configuration file to your preferences, 'docker compose up'. You will still need to bootstrap a Markov corpus if you enable the feature (see next section.) For Manual installation, you'll need to install Lua (5.4 preferred), SQLite (if using Markov), and OpenSSL. The following Lua modules need to be installed - if they are all present in your package manager, use that; otherwise you will need to install Luarocks and use it to install the following: cqueues ossl (aka luaossl) lpeg lzlib (or lua-zlib, only one of the two needed) dbi-sqlite3 (aka luadbi-sqlite3) unix (aka lunix) Create a nepenthes user (you REALLY don't want this running as root.) Let's assume the user's home directory is also your install directory. useradd -m nepenthes Unpack the tarball: cd scratch/ tar -xvzf nepenthes-1.0.tar.gz cp -r nepenthes-1.0/* /home/nepenthes/ Tweak config.yml as you prefer (see below for documentation.) Then you're ready to start: su -l -u nepenthes /home/nepenthes/nepenthes /home/nepenthes/config.yml Sending SIGTERM or SIGINT will shut the process down. Bootstrapping the Markov Babbler The Markov feature requires a trained corpus to babble from. One was intentionally omitted because, ideally, everyone's tarpits should look different to evade detection. Find a source of text in whatever language you prefer; there's lots of research corpuses out there, or possibly pull in some very long Wikipedia articles, maybe grab some books from Project Gutenberg, the Unix fortune file, it really doesn't matter at all. Be creative! Training is accomplished by sending data to a POST endpoint. This only needs to be done once. Sending training data more than once cumulatively adds to the existing corpus, allowing you to mix different texts - or train in chunks. Once you have your body of text, assuming it's called corpus.txt, in your working directory, and you're running with the default port: curl -XPOST -d ./@corpus.txt -H'Content-type: text/plain' http://localhost:8893/train This could take a very, VERY long time - possibly hours. curl may potentially time out. See load.sh in the nepenthes distribution for a script that incrementally loads training data. The Markov module returns an empt string if there is no corpus. Thus, the tarpit will continue to function as a tarpit without a corpus loaded. The extra CPU consumed for this check is almost nothing. Statistics Want to see what prey you've caught? There are several statistics endpoints, all returning JSON. To see everything: http://{http_host:http_port}/stats To see user agent strings only: http://{http_host:http_port}/stats/agents Or IP addresses only: 3 http://{http_host:http_port}/stats/ips/ These can get quite big; so it's possible to filter both 'agents' and 'ips', simply add a minimum hit count to the URL. For example, to see a list of all IPs that have visted more than 100 times: http://{http_host:http_port}/stats/ips/100 Simply curl the URLs, pipe into 'jq' to pretty-print as desired. Script away! Nepenthes used Defensively A link to a Nepenthes location from your site will flood out valid URLs within your site's domain name, making it unlikely the crawler will access real content. In addition, the aggregated statistics will provide a list of IP addresses that are almost certainly crawlers and not real users. Use this list to create ACLs that block those IPs from reaching your content - either return 403, 404, or just block at the firewall level. Integration with fail2ban or blocklistd (or similar) is a future possibility, allowing realtime reactions to crawlers, but not currently implemented. Using Nepenthes defensively, it would be ideal to turn off the Markov module, and set both max_delay and min_delay to something large, as a way to conserve your CPU. Nepenthes used Offensively Let's say you've got horsepower and bandwidth to burn, and just want to see these AI models burn. Nepenthes has what you need: Don't make any attempt to block crawlers with the IP stats. Put the delay times as low as you are comfortable with. Train a big Markov corpus and leave the Markov module enabled, set the maximum babble size to something big. In short, let them suck down as much bullshit as they have diskspace for and choke on it. Configuration File All possible directives in config.yaml: http_host : sets the host that Nepenthes will listen on; default is localhost only. http_port : sets the listening port number; default 8893 prefix: Prefix all generated links should be given. Can be overriden with the X-Prefix HTTP header. Defaults to nothing. templates: Path to the template files. This should be the '/templates' directory inside your Nepenthes installation. detach: If true, Nepenthes will fork into the background and redirect logging output to Syslog. pidfile: Path to drop a pid file after daemonization. If empty, no pid file is created. max_wait: Longest amount of delay to add to every request. Increase to slow down crawlers; too slow they might not come back. min_wait: The smallest amount of delay to add to every request. A random value is chosen between max_wait and min_wait. real_ip_header: Changes the name of the X-Forwarded-For header that communicates the actual client IP address for statistics gathering. prefix_header: Changes the name of the X-Prefix header that overrides the prefix configuration variable. forget_time: length of time, in seconds, that a given user-agent can go missing before being deleted from the statistics table. forget_hits: A user-agent that generates more than this number of requests will not be deleted from the statistics table. persist_stats: A path to write a JSON file to, that allows statistics to survive across crashes/restarts, etc seed_file: Specifies location of persistent unique instance identifier. This allows two instances with the same corpus to have different looking tarpits. words: path to a dictionary file, usually '/usr/share/dict/words', but could vary depending on your OS. markov: Path to a SQLite database containing a Markov corpus. If not specified, the Markov feature is disabled. markov_min: Minimum number of words to babble on a page. markov_max: Maximum number of words to babble on a page. Very large values can cause serious CPU load. History Version numbers use a simple process: If the only changes are fully backwards compatible, the minor number changes. If the user/administrator needs to change anything after or part of the upgrade, the major number changes and the minor number resets to zero. v1.0: Initial release Site Information",

Basically a single HTTP Request to ChatGPT API can trigger 5000 HTTP requests by ChatGPT crawler to a website. The vulnerability is/was thoroughly ignored by OpenAI/Microsoft/BugCrowd but I really wonder what would happen when ChatGPT crawler interacts with this tarpit several times per second. As ChatGPT crawler is using various Azure IP ranges I actually think the tarpit would crash first. The vulnerability reporting experience with OpenAI / BugCrowd was really horrific. It's always difficult to get attention for DOS/DDOS vulnerabilities and companies always act like they are not a problem. But if their system goes dark and the CEO calls then suddenly they accept it as a security vulnerability. I spent a week trying to reach OpenAI/Microsoft to get this fixed, but I gave up and just published the writeup. I don't recommend you to exploit this vulnerability due to legal reasons.

BugCrowd staff is unwilling (or too incompetent) to run a bash curl command to reproduce the issue, while also refusing to forward it to OpenAI. The support@openai.com waits an hour before answering with ChatGPT answer. Issues raised on GitHub directly towards their engineers were not answered. Also Microsoft CERT & Azure security team do not reply or care respond to such things (maybe due to lack of demonstrated impact). reply permo-w 22 minutes agorootparentwhy try this hard for a private company that doesn't employ you? reply inetknght 1 minute agorootparentSome people have passion. JohnMakin 2 hours agoparentprevNice find, I think one of my sites actually got recently hit by something like this. And yea, this kind of thing should be trivially preventable if they cared at all. reply dewey 1 hour agorootparent> And yea, this kind of thing should be trivially preventable if they cared at all. Most of the time when someone says something is \"trivial\" without knowing anything about the internals, it's never trivial. As someone working close to the b2c side of a business, I can’t count the amount of times I've heard that something should be trivial while it's something we've thought about for years. reply bflesch 1 hour agorootparentThe technical flaws are quite trivial to spot, if you have the relevant experience: - urls[] parameter has no size limit - urls[] parameter is not deduplicated (but their cache is deduplicating, so this security control was there at some point but is ineffective now) - their requests to same website / DNS / victim IP address rotate through all available Azure IPs, which gives them risk of being blocked by other hosters. They should come from the same IP address. I noticed them changing to other Azure IP ranges several times, most likely because they got blocked/rate limited by Hetzner or other counterparties from which I was playing around with this vulnerabilities. But if their team is too limited to recognize security risks, there is nothing one can do. Maybe they were occupied last week with the office gossip around the sexual assault lawsuit against Sam Altman. Maybe they still had holidays or there was another, higher-risk security vulnerability. Having interacted with several bug bounties in the past, it feels OpenAI is not very mature in that regard. Also why do they choose BugCrowd when HackerOne is much better in my experience. reply grahamj 1 hour agorootparentprevIf you’re unable to throttle your own outgoing requests you shouldn’t be making any reply bflesch 1 hour agorootparentI assume it'll be hard for them to notice because it's all coming from Azure IP ranges. OpenAI has very big credit card behind this Azure account so this vulnerability might only be limited by Azure capacity. I noticed they switched their crawler to new IP ranges several times, but unfortunately Microsoft CERT / Azure security team didn't answer to my reports. If this vulnerability is exploited, it hits your server with MANY requests per second, right from the hearts of Azure cloud. reply grahamj 1 hour agorootparentNote I said outgoing, as in the crawlers should be throttling themselves reply bflesch 1 hour agorootparentSorry for misunderstanding your point. I agree it should be throttled. Maybe they don't need to throttle because they don't care about cost. Funny thing is that servers from AWS were trying to connect to my system when I played around with this - I assume OpenAI has not moved away from AWS yet. Also many different security scanners hitting my IP after every burst of incoming requests from the ChatGPT crawler Azure IP ranges. Quite interesting to see that there are some proper network admins out there. reply michaelbuckbee 2 hours agoparentprevWhat is the https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/attributions endpoint doing (or responsible for when not crushing websites). reply bflesch 2 hours agorootparentWhen ChatGPT cites web sources in it's output to the user, it will call `backend-api/attributions` with the URL and the API will return what the website is about. Basically it does HTTP request to fetch HTML `` tag. They don't check length of supplied `urls[]` array and also don't check if it contains the same URL over and over again (with minor variations). It's just bad engineering all around. reply soupfordummies 2 hours agoparentprevTry it and let us know :) reply hartator 4 hours agoprevThere are already “infinite” websites like these on the Internet. Crawlers (both AI and regular search) have a set number of pages they want to crawl per domain. This number is usually determined by the popularity of the domain. Unknown websites will get very few crawls per day whereas popular sites millions.

They don't provide a list of IPs to verify if it is actually them. Anyway, just for anyone with PerplexityBot in their user agent, they can get increasingly bad responses until the abuse stops. reply dawnerd 43 minutes agorootparentPerplexity is exceptionally bad because they say they respect the robots.txt but clearly don't. When pressed on it they basically shrug and say too bad not put stuff in public if you don't want it crawled. They got a UA block in cloudflare and seems like that did the trick. reply Dwedit 16 minutes agorootparentUser Agent block just means they'd spoof their user agent. reply hartator 36 minutes agorootparentprevWhat do you mean by many, many times? reply palmfacehn 2 hours agoparentprevEven a brand new site will get hit heavily by crawlers. Amazonbot, Applebot, LLM bots, scrapers abusing FB's link preview bot, SEO metric bots and more than a few crawlers out of China. The desirable, well behaved crawlers are the only ones who might lose interest. The typical entry point is a sitemap or RSS feed. Overall I think the author is misguided in using the tarpit approach. Slow sites get less crawls. I would suggest using easily GZIP'd content and deeply nested tags instead. There are also tricks with XSL, but I doubt many mature crawlers will fall for that one. reply marginalia_nu 3 hours agoparentprevYeah, I agree with this. These types of roach motels have been around for decades and are at this point well understood and not much of a problem for anyone. You basically need to be able to deal with them to do any sort of large scale crawling. The reality of web crawling is that the web is already extremely adversarial and any crawler will get every imaginable nonsense thrown at it, ranging from various TCP tar pits, compression and XML bombs, really there's no end to what people will put online. A more resource effective technique to block misbehaving crawlers is to have a hidden link on each page, to some path forbidden via robots.txt, randomly generated perhaps so they're always unique. When that link is fetched, the server immediately drops the connection and blocks the IP for some time period. reply pilif 3 hours agoparentprev> Unknown websites will get very few crawls per day whereas popular sites millions. we're hosting some pretty unknown very domain specific sites and are getting hammered by Claude and others who, compared to old-school search engine bots also get caught up in the weeds and request the same pages all over. They also seem to not care about response time of the page they are fetching, because when they are caught in the weeds and hit some super bad performing edge-cases, they do not seem to throttle at all and continue to request at 30+ requests per second even when a page takes more than a second to be returned. We can of course handle this and make them go away, but in the end, this behavior will only hurt them both because they will face more and more opposition by web masters and because they are wasting their resources. For decades, our solution for search engine bots was basically an empty robots.txt and have the bots deal with our sites. Bots behaved reasonably and intelligently enough that this was a working strategy. Now in light of the current AI bots which from an outsider observer's viewpoint look like they were cobbled together with the least effort possible, this strategy is no longer viable and we would have to resort to provide a meticulously crafted robots.txt to help each hacked-up AI bot individually to not get lost in the weeds. Or, you know, we just blanket ban them. reply kccqzy 1 hour agorootparentThe fact that AI bots seem like they were cobbled together with the least effort possible might be related. The people responsible for these bots might have zero experience writing an old school search engine bot and have no idea of the kind of edge cases that would be encountered. They might just turn to LLMs to write their bot code which is not exactly a recipe for success. reply diggan 4 hours agoparentprev> There are already “infinite” websites like these on the Internet.

Your site will be assigned a thread or two at most and the rest of the crawling machine resources will be off scanning other sites. There will be timeouts to stop a particular site even keeping a couple of cheap threads busy for long. And anything like this may get you delisted from search results you might want to be in as it can be difficult to reliably identify these bots from others and sometimes even real users, and if things like this get good enough to be any hassle to the crawlers they'll just start lying (more) and be even harder to detect. People scraping for nefarious reasons have had decades of other people trying to stop them, so mitigation techniques are well known unless you can come up with something truly unique. I don't think random Markov chain based text generators are going to pose much of a problem to LLM training scrapers either. They'll have rate limits and vast attention spreading too. Also I suspect that random pollution isn't going to have as much effect as people think because of the way the inputs are tokenised. It will have an effect, but this will be massively dulled by the randomness – statistically relatively unique information and common (non random) combinations will still bubble up obviously in the process. I think better would be to have less random pollution: use a small set of common text to pollute the model. Something like “this was a common problem with Napoleonic genetic analysis due to the pre-frontal nature of the ongoing stream process, as is well documented in the grimoire of saint Churchill the III, 4th edition, 1969”, in fact these snippets could be Markov generated, but use the same few repeatedly. They would need to be nonsensical enough to be obvious noise to a human reader, or highlighted in some way that the scraper won't pick up on, but a general intelligence like most humans would (perhaps a CSS styled side-note inlined in the main text? — though that would likely have accessibility issues), and you would need to cycle them out regularly or scrapers will get “smart” and easily filter them out, but them appearing fully, numerous times, might mean they have more significant effect on the tokenising process than more entirely random text. reply taikahessu 3 hours agoprevWe had our non-profit website drained out of bandwidth and site closed temporarily (!!) from our hosting deal because of Amazon bot aggressively crawling like ?page=21454 ... etc. Gladly Siteground restored our site without any repercussions as it was not our fault.

And furthermore, since this antagonizes billion-dollar companies that can spin up teams doing nothing but browse Github and HN for software like this to prevent polluting their datalakes, I wonder whether this is a very efficient approach. reply btilly 4 hours agoparentIt would be more efficient for them to spin up a team to study this robots.txt thing. They've ignored that low hanging fruit, so they won't do the more sophisticated thing any time soon. reply tgv 3 hours agorootparentYou can't make money out of studying robots.txt, but you can avoid costs skipping bad web sites. reply marcus0x62 3 hours agoparentprevAuthor of a similar tool here[0]. There are a few implementations of this sort of thing that I know of. Mine is different in that the primary purpose is to slightly alter content statically using a Markov generator, mainly to make it useless for content reposters, secondarily to make it useless to LLM crawlers that ignore my robots.txt file[1]. I assume the generated text is bad enough that the LLM crawlers just throw the result out. Other than the extremely poor quality of the text, my tool doesn't leave any fingerprints (like recursive non-sense links.) In any case, it can be run on static sites with no server-side dependencies so long as you have a way to do content redirection based on User-Agent, IP, etc. My tool does have a second component - linkmaze - which generates a bunch of nonsense text with a Markov generator, and serves infinite links (like Nepthenes does) but I generally only throw incorrigible bots at it (and, at others have noted in-thread, most crawlers already set some kind of limit on how many requests they'll send to a given site, especially a small site.) I do use it for PHP-exploit crawlers as well, though I've seen no evidence those fall into the maze -- I think they mostly just look for some string indicating a successful exploit and move on if whatever they're looking for isn't present. But, for my use case, I don't really care if someone fingerprints content generated by my tool and avoids it. That's the point: I've set robots.txt to tell these people not to crawl my site. In addition to Quixotic (my tool) and Napthenes, I know of: * https://github.com/Fingel/django-llm-poison * https://codeberg.org/MikeCoats/poison-the-wellms * https://codeberg.org/timmc/marko/ 0 - https://marcusb.org/hacks/quixotic.html 1 - I use the ai.robots.txt user agent list from https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt reply iugtmkbdfil834 37 minutes agoparentprevI forget which fiction book covered this phenomenon ( Rainbow's End? ), but the moment it becomes the basic default install ( ala adblocker in browsers for people ), it does not matter what the bigger players want to do ; they are not actively fighting against determined and possibly radicalized users. reply reedf1 3 hours agoparentprevThe idea is that you place this in parallel to the rest of your website routes, that way your entire server might get blacklisted by the bot. reply WD-42 2 hours agoparentprevDoes it need to be efficient if it’s easy?

As mentioned by others, such tarpits are easily mitigated by using a priority queue. For instance, crawlers can prioritize external links over internal links, which means if your blog post makes it to HN, it'll get crawled ahead of the tarpit. If it's discoverable and readable by actual humans, AI bots will be able to scrape it. reply TeMPOraL 2 hours agorootparentprevnext [2 more] [flagged] Blackthorn 1 hour agorootparentYou've got to be seriously AI-drunk to equate letting your site be crawled by commercial scrapers with \"contributing to humanity\". Maybe you don't want your your stuff to get thrown into the latest silicon valley commercial operation without getting paid for it. That seems like a valid position to take. Or maybe you just don't want Claude's ridiculously badly behaved scraper to chew through your entire budget. Regardless, scrapers that don't follow the rules like robots.txt pretty quickly will discover why those rules exist in the first place as they receive increasing amounts of garbage. reply NathanKP 2 hours agoprevThis looks extremely easy to detect and filter out. For example: https://i.imgur.com/hpMrLFT.png In short, if the creator of this thinks that it will actually trick AI web crawlers, in reality it would take about 5 mins of time to write a simple check that filters out and bans the site from crawling. With modern LLM workflows its actually fairly simple and cheap to burn just a little bit of GPU time to check if the data you are crawling is decent. Only a really, really bad crawl bot would fall for this. The funny thing is that in order to make something that an AI crawler bot would actually fall for you'd have to use LLM's to generate realistic enough looking content.

They were/are(?) hot linking logo images of third-party plugins. When you open their plugin store it loads a couple dozen of them instantly. This allows those plugin developers (of which there are many) to track the IP addresses and possibly more of who made these requests. It’s straight forward to become a plugin developer and get included. IP tracking is invisible to the user and OpenAI.

Make sure there is some kind of token payment to get to the content. Then seed the site with a few instances of hapax legomenon.

For example, a EULA might have buried in it that by agreeing, you will become their slave for the next 10 years of your life (or something equally ridiculous). Were it to actually go to court for \"violating the agreement\", it would be obvious that no rational person would ever actually agree to such an agreement. It basically boiled down to a claim that the entire process of EULAs are (mostly) pointless because it's understood that no one reads them, but companies insist upon them because a false sense of protection, and the ability to threaten violators of (whatever activity) is better than nothing. A kind of \"paper threat\". As it's coming back to me, I think one of the real world examples they used was something like this: If you go to a golf course and see a sign that says, \"The golf course is not responsible for damage to your car from golf balls.\" The sign is essentially meant as false deterrent - It's there to keep people from complaining by, \"informing them of the risk\", and make it seem official, so employees will insist it's true if anyone complains, but if you were actually to take it to court, the golf course might still be found culpable because they theoretically could have done something to prevent damage to customers cars and they were aware of the damage that could be caused.

You can't have the benefits of a public site and try to impose your own terms and conditions. This is why LinkedIn had to go private and require logins; the public internet operates by technical protocols, and by serving content, you expressly grant permission to receive the content, without restriction or qualification. It's a proactive transaction on the part of the server operator. If you want to serve to any old person or system or software on the internet, and your server is configured to do so, you cannot impose arbitrary additional rules after the fact. You expressly consent to the user's interactions with your server by setting it up to serve content to whoever connects. If you want ToS or rules of conduct or any other constraints on interactions with your server or content, you have to engage the user in a legally binding contract. The technical mechanisms to do so require authenticating the user, requiring identification and segregation of individuals, each requiring separate, documented consent and agreement. Once there's a login, or unique session, you can impose whatever conditions you want, and you should. Interacting in public comes with certain expectations and limitations. This should be communicated more clearly; the general public should know what it means to publish to a platform open to the public, for example. reply jsheard 2 hours agorootparent> No, put up a loginwall or paywall, authenticate users, and go private.

He is offering links. You can follow them or not, entirely at your own discretion. Those links load slowly. You can wait for them to complete or not, entirely at your own discretion. The crawler's normal operation is not interfered with in any way: the crawler does exactly what it's programmed to do. If its programmers decided it should exhaustively follow links, he's not preventing it from doing that operation. Legally, at best you'd be looking to warp the concept of attractive nuisance to apply to a crawler.

Laws are published, and discussed by specialist lawyers, who, like every other type of nerd, love to geek out about their specialties and discuss the case law and precedents. Blogs like https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2023/03/after-hiq-labs... , and all sorts of discussions on HN and other forums are available and cover the topic frequently and thoroughly. The civics surrounding the rights and responsibilities of website and server operators really should be communicated better; a more informed general public would allow better regulation and legislation to be created. Robots.txt should have the legal standing of a No Trespassing sign. You should be able to dictate terms to a reasonable degree on a public site; it shouldn't be legal to effectively DOS someone endlessly and repeatedly without recourse. As it stands, though, there's not a lot of protections for little guys. You have to implement a login mechanism, or some way of identifying unique visitors and requiring authentication, in order to impose your own rules on a site. reply jazzyjackson 3 minutes agorootparent [–] I broadly agree with what you're trying to get across here, but I don't see why I can't set my own standards for what use of my server is authorized or not. If I publish content at my domain, I can set up blocklists to refuse access to IP ranges I consider more likely to be malicious than not. Is that not already breaking the social contract you're pointing to wrt serving content public ? picking and choosing which parts of the public will get a response from my server ? (I would also be interested to know if there is actual law vs social contracts around behavior) So why shouldn't I be able enforce expectations on how my server is used? The vigilantism aspect of harming the person breaking the rules is another matter, I'm on the fence. Consider the standard warning posted to most government sites, which is more or less a \"no trespassing sign\" [0] informing anyone accessing the system what their expectations should be and what counts as authorized use. I suppose it's not a legally binding contract to say \"you agree to these terms by requesting this url\" but I'm pretty sure convictions have happened with hackers who did not have a contract with the service provider.

    "originBody": "I Ditched the Algorithm for RSS—and You Should Too I waste too much time scrolling through social media. It's bad for my health, so why do I keep doing it? Because once in a while, I'll find a post so good that it teaches me something I never knew before, and all the scrolling feels worth it. But I've stumbled upon an old piece of free and open source tech, relatively unknown today, which is THE solution of solving the problems with modern media without sacrificing accessible, good content: RSS. Reddit, Facebook, Twitter — platforms built for engagement, not efficiency. Instead of showing you high-quality posts upfront, they pad your feed with memes, spam, and astroturfing. There is only so much 'good' content created in a day. By padding your feed with trash, they make the limited amount of good posts \"last longer\". These sites want you to spend more time scrolling on their website, so they feed you scraps which makes the occasional great post feels like a jackpot. This concept, operant conditioning, was developed by B.F. Skinner — Yes, the mind behind the Skinnerbox. While some sites offer filtering or sorting options, manually settings these options every time you want to access a subreddit is just not doable. You could, of course, stop consuming content from these websites. However, this would mean potentially missing really good content; content you'd learn from, interesting ideas, and more. But it doesn't have to be this way. You can reclaim your attention span while still having access to the same quality content as before. Enter: RSS¶ RSS is like your youtube subscription feed in hyperdrive. Subscribe to sites you love and decide what shows up — no exploitative social media algorithm needed. No more ads or algorithms deciding how to keep you doomscrolling. This 1999 tech actually solves a lot of 2025 problems. Here's the kicker: Most websites, even social media, quietly support RSS feeds. You can filter out keywords, set minimum upvotes or like counts, and much more! Modern RSS clients allow you to make filters using Regex, and there are a lot of software and services you can use to tune up your filtering to 11. TL;DR: Never see noise, and never miss hidden gems again! But how do you get started with RSS? It's easier than you think! Setup¶ I personally self-host an open source RSS reader: Tiny Tiny RSS If you don't want to host it yourself, you can google for companies offering easy and accessible RSS readers. To make it easier, let's differentiate between three levels of ease when it comes to adding a website to RSS: Easy, medium, and hard. I'll be going over how to add several popular sites to your feed. Easy 1: Youtube¶ Want a youtube channel in your RSS feed? Just copy the channel's URL and subscribe to it in your reader. Done. Easy 2: IGN¶ If you like games, you might want to subscribe to IGN. There's no clear RSS button, so the best course of action would be to google \"IGN RSS\". This leads to a nice IGN RSS Feeds page with multiple categorized feeds for you to pick from. If you wanted to subscribe to \"Game Articles\", you'd right-click on the game articles link, press \"copy link\", go to your RSS reader of choice and subscribe to the link you copied. Now all IGN Game Articles will show up in your RSS feed as they are published! Tip Some websites don't have a dedicated RSS button, but still support RSS. You can discover their RSS urls by adding .rss, atom.xml, feed, etc. at the end of the site's URL, for example https://website.com/atom.xml. Almost all RSS readers support Atom feeds. For more examples, check this Reddit comment. Medium 1: HackerNews¶ Some sites like HackerNews have RSS support. However, this RSS can be extremely limited if you want to filter posts so your feed isn't spammed by low effort content. Some people are nice enough to set up a \"middleman\" between your RSS feed and the website, so you can pull the RSS feed through the middleman while doing actions like filtering it. For example, if you wanted to subscribe to HackerNews but filter out low upvote count posts, you could subscribe to HNRSS instead of through HN directly. For example, I filter out posts below 150 upvotes by to this url: https://hnrss.org/newest?points=150 Sometimes these services open-source their code so you can self-host the 'middleman'. Medium 2: Reddit¶ Warning When removing the optional search term from a reddit search URL, don't forget to remove the + When removing the sort options If adding more search terms, add a + between them! I love managing my homelab. I follow /r/homelab. Some posts are really good and teach me a lot. However, there's a lot of noise posted to that subreddit; I do not want to see memes, and pictures of people's hardware setup gets boring quick. I'm interested in hidden gems, threads where a lot of interesting info is explained, things I can really learn a lot from. Step 1: Filter out picture posts.¶ Reddit hack: Filter out picture posts by searching for 'self:true' in a subreddit. Bonus: You can subscribe to that specific search query as a RSS feed for text posts only. So instead of subscribing to a subreddit's RSS directly, you do a search for posts in that subreddit and then subscribe to that RSS feed. The RSS link you should subscribe to should look someting like this: https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/search.rss?q=self%3Atrue&restrict_sr=on You can change 'homelab' to your subreddit of choice. Note The restrict_sr=on parameter in the URL (probably) means \"Restrict_subreddit\". Removing this from the search will yield results from different subreddits than the one you're searching in. If you think that parameter is redundant, I agree. There are a lot of text-only submissions on /r/homelab. Gems are relatively sparce. Lots of low quality content. It's not the subreddit's fault; this is standard across Reddit. Step 2: Filter for quality¶ Seems easy; let's add a 'minimal upvotes' query to the search, right? Sadly, Reddit doesn't support that.. a shame, really. However, a workaround is sorting by 'Top' and asking the search to show us the 'top posts of this week'. Note: 'This week' would mean 'past 7 days' instead of 'posted this week'. Filtering by 'Top of ...' always returns 25 items. This means that if you sort by 'top of this week', on average of 25/7=3,57 NEW posts get added to your feed each day! This is a great way to only see the highest scoring posts of each day. Adding this sort on top of the RSS feed from step 1 results in an URL like this: https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/search.rss?q=self%3Atrue&restrict_sr=on&sort=top&t=year Bug If you don't care about only seeing text posts, removing self%3Atrue does NOT work for RSS feeds, even though it does work for direct searches. Instead, subscribe to the subreddit's \"top\" RSS and filter by time. For example: https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/top.rss?t=month For reference, here is how many posts you would get in your RSS feed, depening on your reddit sorting: And just like that, we converted a high-noise subreddit to an RSS feed which only gives us the best the subreddit has to offer. Tip If you wanted to subscribe to all new posts in a subreddit, you would subscribe to an url like https://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT_NAME/new/.rss?sort=new. For a more extensive Reddit RSS guide, see this post Hard:¶ Some sites might not have support for an RSS feed. Sometimes you can get away with a neat google trick: Most of the time you'd need something to generate the RSS for you. You could use one of many RSS feed generators available online, or host one yourself. Most of these feed generators have enhanced filtering tools as well. I haven't had to do this yet, however I've heard really good things about the open source RSS-Bridge How you'd set up a feed generator depends on the software, so I won't expand upon that here. Conclusion¶ Separating yourself from the algorithmic whims of social media platform is easier than ever. With RSS, you can stay informed, save time, and never miss the content that truly matters.

You discover the old content by reading it. reply bsnnkv 2 hours agoprevI am a big proponent of RSS, but I think that it suffers from a lack of imagination these days, for example, the \"quality filter\" approach mentioned in this article is not very useful imo. The biggest cost of RSS feed items as a consumer is figuring out whether something is worth reading. A lot of feeds these days don't provide anything useful in the body to make a determination on this, and others just dump the entire contents in the body, which means you're wasting a bunch of time reading N% of something until you realize you're not interested in it and it can be skipped. In addition to this, RSS feeds tend to be structured to just throw everything at you, regardless of the topics you are interested in. For a few years I have been publishing my own topic-specific feeds[1] for others to consume where I fill the body with my own personal highlights from the source, with a link through to the source (ie. the things I found interesting, the \"hooks\" that give a quick signal to a consumer if this might be something they want to invest time in reading). They have a couple of die-hard consumers, but ultimately this really a case of a niche within a niche. I wish there were more feeds like this for me as a consumer, but unfortunately I get the feeling that this idea will never really become popular enough to catch on widely as RSS becomes less and less relevant to the mainstream.

I think a big problem with this is that commercial websites believe that they have to update a million times a day to Feed the Algorithm™, which bloats their RSS feeds and any RSS reader you might have checking on it.

BlueSky kinda addresses this issue with Feeds. I follow the people that post at a frequency that I know won't flood my main feed, then I have pinned a separate feed for news, another for photos of foxes and one for photos of cats. The app randomly inserts posts from those feeds into the main one (if you have enbaled \"Show samples from your saved feeds\" in https://bsky.app/settings/following-feed), so as I'm scrolling my \"Following\" feed, I also get some of that content, while keeping the main usable. reply Klonoar 31 minutes agoprevThis is tangential but maybe some of the crowd here has wisdom: are there any apps (iOS or Android) that are built for RSS but have a good experience for just photos? What I mean by this is an app that is more or less Instagram-esque in browsing behavior, but just backed by RSS feeds with no comments/likes/etc. I've been meaning to write about this but I recently found that I missed having one central place to share photos with people when I travel/build things/etc. When I thought about it further, I realized that I don't want the social media bits there - I just wanted the photos, self hosted, in something I could brand myself. This also solved for another problem I had, which is that I wanted to share my stuff across n platforms and got very tired of having to constantly provide any text context when doing so. Open graph tags work really well for \"write once, share anywhere\". I have a working prototype up at https://photos.rymc.io/ and so far it's been great. I'll probably open source the stuff this year. It's not necessarily groundbreaking but I do think it's a decent approach; uploading auto-scrubs specific metadata, handles generating various previews, etc. Very easy to customize and just tries to do one thing well. Notably, any page on it can be \"followed\" via RSS by just requesting it in the right format, e.g: JSONFeed: https://photos.rymc.io/?format=json Atom: https://photos.rymc.io/?format=atom RSS: https://photos.rymc.io/?format=rss It can be tag-specific too, so if someone's only interested in my travel photos, e.g: JSONFeed: https://photos.rymc.io/tag/travel/?format=json Back to the original point of the comment though: I'd like to find an app that I could give to e.g my dad and just let him browse things and see what I'm up to. None of the RSS apps I've tried fit well here though, with ReadKit on iOS coming somewhat close but it's a clunky experience.

Back in the day, you had to dig through a bunch of stuff that was bad to get to the \"comedy gold\". But even the bad stuff was sometimes comically bad. On Reddit, all the \"gold\" was always at the top, so there's always something \"good\", but it was generally lackluster and not quite it. Still it made me lazy and I switched (not that I read Reddit today). reply dsiemon 3 hours agoprevDitch the algorithm by using or building a custom feed in BlueSky.

RSS worked for me in 2000s, because more or less, there were less interesting content/people writing things for public. Most decent things would get into people’s feeds, and generally everyone was happy. I can’t really see it being feasible nowadays, unless something (reads: algo) filters things that I’m definitely not interested in. Which, obviously, creates a whole different problem of siloed echo chambers. It becomes even a bigger problem when you try to move the conversations to the real world, because your friends wouldn’t have read the same things as your tailored algo recommended to you. There’s also assumed-financial-incentives, which ruins most of blogs/content for me. That’s probably my cynicism, and maybe I just grew up, but every time I see any write up, my first question is how this person gets financial benefits from it. I just never thought that far until 2015. Sorry for ranting, and obviously I have no solution to this problem. reply hprotagonist 1 hour agoprevI started using RSS in ~2007, and I haven't stopped.

    "originBody": "OpenAI Fails to Deliver Opt-Out System for Photographers JAN 06, 2025 MATT GROWCOOT OpenAI has missed its own 2025 deadline on a tool it said would allow photographers to exclude their work from the company’s training data. Back in May, OpenAI revealed it was working on a tool called Media Manager that would “identify copyrighted text, images, audio, and video.” The proposed program was intended to quell some of the company’s criticisms and potentially shield it from its many copyright disputes. But news about Media Manager is non-existent with one former OpenAI employee telling TechCrunch they don’t believe it was a priority for the company. “To be honest, I don’t remember anyone working on it,” the anonymous employee says. After DALL-E 3 was announced, OpenAI’s image generator, the company announced that photographers could opt out of AI training data. “We understand that some content owners may not want their publicly available works used to help teach our models,” OpenAI said at the time. But photographers had to submit each piece of work they wanted excluding along with detailed descriptions, a cumbersome process. Similarly, Media Manager would also put the onus on creators to remove their work, something that Ed Newton-Rex, the founder of Fairly Trade, says is unfair. “Most creators will never even hear about it, let alone use it,” he tells TechCrunch. “But it will nevertheless be used to defend the mass exploitation of creative work against creators’ wishes.” AI and training data is an extremely thorny issue with many photographers and content creators of all stripes feeling aggrieved that their work is being used to build products without ever giving permission or being remunerated. Media Manager was initially pitched as a way to sort out these problems and offer photographers an easy way to opt-out. But despite setting itself a deadline of “by 2025”, OpenAI has stopped mentioning Media Manager altogether. The last update was in August when a spokesperson told TechCrunch that the tool was “still in development.” An IP attorney tells TechCrunch that Media Manager is an ambitious project; noting that large platforms like YouTube and TikTok struggle with content ID systems. “Ensuring compliance with legally required creator protections and potential compensation requirements under consideration presents challenges,” says Andrian Cyhan from Stubbs Alderton & Markiles. “Especially given the rapidly evolving and potentially divergent legal landscape across national and local jurisdictions.” Image credits: Header photo licensed via Depositphotos.

It seems like they are deeply upset someone has figured out a way for a machine to do what artists have been doing since time immemorial. reply aithrowawaycomm 15 hours agorootparentThere are two major differences between art generators and human artists: 1) human artists are legal persons and capable of being held liable in civil court for copyright infringement; having a machine with no legal standing do the copyright infringement should be forbidden because it is difficult to detect, impossible to avoid, and a legal nightmare to unravel. 2) human artists are capable of understanding what flowers, Jesus on the cross, waterfalls, etc actually are, whereas DALL-E is much dumber than a lizard and not capable of understanding these things, so using the verb \"learning\" to describe both is extremely misleading. DALL-E is a statistical process which is barely more sophisticated than linear regression compared to a human brain. It is plain wrong to say stuff like this: > It seems like they are deeply upset someone has figured out a way for a machine to do what artists have been doing since time immemorial. when nobody has even come close to figuring that out! If DALL-E worked like a human artist it would know what a bicycle is: https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_pr... But it doesn't.

Courts will determine whether or not disseminating or giving access to a model trained on protected works counts as distributing protected derivative works or not. reply Terr_ 14 hours agorootparent> The problem is not \"when learning\", the problem is \"when distributing\". Technically making a copy to bring home for your own use is also problematic, just much less likely to get you into trouble. (Still a step removed from learning the skills and technique of making a copy, however.) reply mitthrowaway2 15 hours agorootparentprevThis analogy seems to be made every time this comes up on HN, but I don't think it really holds water. First of all, when a human artist learns from another, it's inherently a level playing field for competition; the junior and senior are both human, neither are going to be 1,000,000x more productive as the other. So the senior artist really doesn't have that much to worry about. And the senior artist recognizes that they themselves were once a junior and had to learn from their seniors, so it's a debt paid forward which results in more art. And becoming a master artist or even an imitator takes dedication and hard work, even with lots of artwork to learn from, so that keeps competition to a certain level. When it takes decades to develop an art style that a machine can copy in days, and then churn out derivative variations in seconds, it's no longer a level playing field. The machine can dramatically under-cut the artist who developed their style, much more than a copycat human artist could. This does become not just a threat to the livelihoods of artists, but also a disincentive to the development of new art styles. In this case, patent law may be an apt comparison for the world we're entering. Patent law was developed with the idea in mind that it is a problem if a human competitor could simply take an invention, learn how it works, and then mass produce copies of it. There are several reasons for this, including creating an incentive for technology development, and also expediently transitioning IP to the public domain. But patents were added to the legal system basically because otherwise an inventor would not be on a level playing field with the competition, because it takes so many more resources to develop a new invention than to produce clones. Existing IP law was built in a world where it was believed that machines were inherently incapable of learning and mass-producing new artistic works using styles learned from artists. It was not necessary to protect artists from junior artists learning how to work in their style, as long as it wasn't a forgery. But in a world of machine learning, perhaps we will decide it's reasonable to protect artists from machine copycats, just like we decided it was reasonable protect technology inventors from human copycats. The patent system is not the right implementation; it's expensive to file a patent, and you need skilled lawyers to determine novelty, infringement, and so on.

Seems like there's an argument that model weights are a derivative work of the training data, at least if the model is capable of producing output that would be ruled to be such a derivative work given minimal prompting. Although it may not work with photography since the model might just almost exclusively learn how the object of the photo looks in general and how photos work in general, rather than memorizing anything about specific photos. reply fenomas 14 hours agoparentI think that argument falls down though, because a derivative work is an expressive work in its own right, and model weights aren't. It would seem more coherent to argue that a model output could be a derivative work, though it would need to include a significant portion of some given source. But even then, since the copyright office's position is that they're not copyrightable, I'm not sure they could qualify. reply devit 5 hours agorootparentModel weights, if they can reproduce something like the original, are just a form of lossy compression (or even lossless for text), where the LLM answering the prompt is a more powerful version of asking software to retrieve a specific file from a Zip archive (or a webserver answering an HTTP query) of such lossy compressed data. So if model weights don't infringe, that would also imply that saving an image as a JPG or a video using AV-1 doesn't infringe, which would obviously effectively implies that copyright doesn't apply to images or videos on the web, which is not current law/policy, so I think that reasoning cannot possibly work. reply fenomas 3 hours agorootparentThat comparison would only make sense if compressed images were considered derivative works. They're not - copyright doesn't protect bytes on a disk, it protects creative expressions. Lossy compression doesn't affect the creative expression, so in copyright terms a compressed JPG is just a copy, and is covered exactly like the original image. In contrast a derivative work is one creative expression that contains elements of another - like when you take an image and add commentary, or draw your own addition onto it, etc. And I'm pointing out that a trained model is not that - it's not itself a copyrightable expressive work.

    "originBody": "Jack Dorsey, former CEO of Twitter, ousted board member of BlueSky, and grifter extraordinaire to the tune of a $5.6B net worth, is giving a keynote at FOSDEM. The FOSDEM keynote stage is one of the biggest platforms in the free software community. Janson is the biggest venue in the event – its huge auditorium can accommodate over 1,500 of FOSDEM’s 8,000 odd attendees, and it is live streamed to a worldwide audience as the face of one of the free and open source software community’s biggest events of the year. We’ve platformed Red Hat, the NLNet Foundation, NASA, numerous illustrious community leaders, and many smaller projects that embody our values and spirit at this location to talk about their work or important challenges our community faces. Some of these challenges, as a matter of fact, are Jack Dorsey’s fault. In 2023 this stage hosted Hachyderm’s Kris Nóva to discuss an exodus of Twitter refugees to the fediverse. After Dorsey sold Twitter to Elon Musk, selling the platform out to the far right for a crisp billion-with-a-“B” dollar payout, the FOSS community shouldered the burden – both with our labor and our wallets – of a massive exodus onto our volunteer-operated servers, especially from victims fleeing the hate speech and harassment left in the wake of the sale. Two years later one of the principal architects of, and beneficiaries of, that disaster will step onto the same stage. Even if our community hadn’t been directly harmed by Dorsey’s actions, I don’t think that we owe this honor to someone who took a billion dollars to ruin their project, ostracize their users, and destroy the livelihoods of almost everyone who worked on it. Dorsey is presumably being platformed in Janson because his blockchain bullshit company is a main sponsor of FOSDEM this year. Dorsey and his colleagues want to get us up to speed on what Block is working on these days. Allow me to give you a preview: in addition to posting $5B in revenue and a 21% increase in YoY profit in 2024, Jack Dorsey laid off 1,000 employees, ordering them not to publicly discuss board member Jay-Z’s contemporary sexual assault allegations on their way out, and announced a new bitcoin mining ASIC in collaboration with Core Scientific, who presumably installed them into their new 100MW Muskogee, OK bitcoin mining installation, proudly served by the Muskogee Generating Station fossil fuel power plant and its 11 million tons of annual CO2 emissions and an estimated 62 excess deaths in the local area due to pollution associated with the power plant. Nice. In my view, billionaires are not welcome at FOSDEM. If billionaires want to participate in FOSS, I’m going to ask them to refrain from using our platforms to talk about their AI/blockchain/bitcoin/climate-disaster-as-a-service grifty business ventures, and instead buy our respect by, say, donating 250 million dollars to NLNet or the Sovereign Tech Fund. That figure, as a percentage of Dorsey’s wealth, is proportional to the amount of money I donate to FOSS every year, by the way. That kind of money would keep the FOSS community running for decades. I do not want to platform Jack Dorsey on this stage. To that end, I am organizing a sit-in, in which I and anyone who will join me are going to sit ourselves down on the Janson stage during his allocated time slot and peacefully prevent the talk from proceeding as scheduled. We will be meeting at 11:45 AM outside of Janson, 15 minutes prior to Dorsey’s scheduled time slot. Once the stage is free from the previous speaker, we will sit on the stage until 12:30 PM. Bring a good book. If you want to help organize this sit-in, or just let me know that you intend to participate, please contact me via email; I’ll set up a mailing list if there’s enough interest in organizing things like printing out pamphlets to this effect, or even preparing an alternative talk to “schedule” in his slot.",

Maybe it's time for a \"No Drews DeVault at FOSDEM\" blog post. reply tgsovlerkhgsel 4 hours agoprevThere are two things that don't sit right with me: 1. \"the FOSS community shouldered the burden – both with our labor and our wallets – of a massive exodus onto our volunteer-operated servers\" -- this implies that users actually using decentralized services is a burden, a bad thing. Or rather, that a) it would be much better if Twitter was better and people just continued using Twitter rather than FOSS platforms b) that Twitter has some kind of obligation to keep their platform good because not doing so will make people use FOSS services. If the operators don't want their service to be used, they don't have to offer it... 2. \"No billionaires\" as a motto, implying that having money in itself (and not a specific way of behaving) is wrong, unethical, and worthy of exclusion. That feels like an very common envy-based position, trying to tear people down because they are better off. He does have reasonable points for not wanting that specific billionaire, but the demand for exclusion is \"no billionaires\".

If you don't want users on your site, disable the sign up field.

I have a hard time taking anything Drew is saying seriously here. reply PaulDavisThe1st 19 minutes agoparentprev> That feels like an very common envy-based position, trying to tear people down because they are better off. No, it's not because they are better off. It's because (a) to get control of that level of economic resources in this economy, you generally have to do something with many questionable aspects to it, despite its (potential) popularity and (b) you don't need to remain a billionaire or show signs of trying to increase your holdings. Mackenzie Bezos shows the way here - still deliriously rich but giving away money like a bank on fire and having plain her goal to ultimately donate essentially all of it. The billionaires we don't want at FOSDEM are not just rich, they want to be richer and they are, from our perspective, demonstrably causing harm. Yes, I happen to think that marginal tax rates above some threshold should probably be on the order of 95%, but I don't begrudge people making a lot of money by doing something good and/or for a lot of people. reply bo0tzz 3 hours agoparentprev> implying that having money in itself (and not a specific way of behaving) is wrong, unethical, and worthy of exclusion.

As an analogy, this is similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit. To GP: It's less \"no one should have any mass\".

That's your problem, not the money. That problem is not solved by drawing the line at personal wealth. reply bambax 4 hours agoparentThe money in itself is a problem. People with that amount of wealth are separated from the rest of humanity (and most of the time go to great lengths to make sure they absolutely never cross path with ordinary humans).

I thought Twitter was a publicly owned company and its board (on which Jack wasn't present AFAIK) agreed to sell to Musk. Jack did rollover his holdings into the new private entity X Holdings Corp created for this purpose, instead of cashing-out. So instead of owning 2.4% or so of Twitter shares, he holds shares of X Holdings Corp, I think. reply wormlord 4 hours agoprevI don't know how someone could look at Dorsey/Musk/Bezos actions and still be interested in what they have to say. There's probably a lot to be learned from someone who worships money, assuming that your goal is to emulate them. However their lifestyle and ideology is inherently dangerous to workers and life on earth as we know it. So yeah I don't really care what they have to say beyond knowing how the enemy views the average citizen (hint: it's not very positively). reply duxup 4 hours agoparentI'm not a big conference goer so my sample rate is not super high, but I've seen zero keynote speakers with something I cared to listen to. Regardless of their ideology ... I'm just not getting much out of those kinds of speakers. I'll tell a little story: I worked at a company with like 1k employees. Good company as far as I knew, as much as such a company can be. I work the night shift (tech support) and I'm young so I go to the company wide meeting in person because I'm curious and honestly don't have much to do. CEO talks, nothing of interest is said. I go back to my desk and get my things and I'm really tired and I'm in the elevator heading home. CEO steps in. Smiles and introduces himself and says \"What did you think?\" I'm really tired, so I say something like \"It was ok I guess, it's just not my kinda event. Stuff I really want to know I don't think can be said at an event like that...\" Other folks in the elevator (including my boss's boss who I didn't notice) look kinda horrified. CEO looks at me and pauses for a minute: \"Yeah I get it...\" And that was the truth of it ... there's nothing for those folks to say that they can say that I would want to know. I want the nitty gritty, not some pie in the sky stuff. reply remram 3 hours agorootparentYeah the keynote format is really weird. It's more about getting people inspired and hiping your company than talking about anything. I understand it when it's someone important in the community, but I think the \"invited keynote\" is a monstrosity that makes no sense and was invented at the behest of sponsors. reply duxup 3 hours agorootparent>It's more about getting people inspired and hiping your company than talking about anything.

If only out of amazement. reply scotty79 3 hours agoparentprevI think what they have to say is uninteresting for a very different reason. The owe very little of what they own to what they actually think and do. They just managed to keep on top of a huge commercial organism which development and almost cancerous growth has been dictated more by the environment it grew in and sheer chance than any single human opinions and choices. By every possible individual measurement they are no further from average than a standard deviation. There are many more unique and interesting people. That feat of staying on top of self-inflating balloon is their only claim to fame.

You're absolutely correct about these other people and I listen to them too. But you're not giving Musk enough credit. All engineers and other professionals told him that landing rockets is bullshit, and what is interesting here is that he went and made it happen anyways. I'm not talking just about the engineering, everything is interesting here - the project management, the hiring, the investments, the business side...

One of the interesting things about him. reply wormlord 4 hours agorootparentprev> All engineers and other professionals told him that landing rockets is bullshit Every company has some kind of mythology where someone says \"you'll never make it in this town!\". The reality is that uncrewed propulsive landing was technologically feasible since the soviets landed a rover on the moon. NASA propulsively landed a rover on Mars back in 2011.

I am watching it closely ever since SpaceX was founded in 2002. There is an incredible gap between the tech demo you're speaking about, and actually landing a heavy orbital rocket, and then doing it 100 times in a row without a hiccup. Mars is completely off topic, as they didn't land the booster there. We had Space Shuttle before and it didn't say much about landing rocket boosters. reply michaelt 3 hours agorootparent> There is an incredible gap between the tech demo you're speaking about, Didn't Apollo 11 land on the moon using a rocket, then take off from the moon again, back in the 1960s? Not exactly a tech demo. And the Apollo missions had the additional challenges of being crewed, and targeting an atmosphere and gravity they couldn't reproduce on earth for test purposes. The SpaceX stuff is neat though, compared to the defence industry clowns they're competing with. reply AnimalMuppet 2 hours agorootparentApollo 11 was crewed, though. reply throw5959 3 hours agorootparentprevApollo 11 had a three stage rocket and every stage was discarded. SpaceX is obviously not the first company to land something - but landing a rocket booster that just performed an orbital lift is the interesting and extremely hard thing to do. The payload can be entirely designed to land - but the booster has many other constraints (payload weight and its desired velocity and trajectory being some of them). To do what Apollo 11 did without discarding the boosters you also need orbital refueling and probably rapid turnaround (or a huge inventory of boosters), which SpaceX plans to develop next. Awesome stuff. reply michaelt 1 hour agorootparentI'm talking about the Apollo Lunar Module. You know, this bit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module that descended to the moon, landed, some guys walked out and grabbed some moon rocks, then they took off again and made it back to earth. That's a rocket-propelled space vehicle gently landing tail first, and ready for immediately reuse. Given that it clearly had been done, I doubt anyone who knew what they were talking about was telling Musk it couldn't be done. reply throw5959 13 minutes agorootparentI don't know how to put this if you don't see the difference yourself by now, but that's not an orbital rocket that could lift anything from Earth nor land back there. One huge problem is hypersonic aerodynamics, something you absolutely don't care about on the Moon. The payload weight can be much greater due to tiny gravity.

Everybody in the space industry was absolutely sure he is totally crazy and it's impossible to do with an entire first/second stage rocket booster. He built the company that built the booster, which to me is at least as interesting as building the booster itself.

Top-level players of the game have called him out for it. They have tracked his time with an API. It is actually mathematically impossible to be at his level in POE-- you would have to be a top-tier player and play nonstop for 20+ hrs a day. People who like Musk aren't going to care that he is racist, they will argue about what actually constitutes as racism (erm pushes up glasses --actually have u read the bell curve???). Having definitive proof of him paying others to play videogames for him is an example of how he just lies about everything. If he lies about videogames what else does he lie about? reply throw5959 3 hours agorootparentWhere does he lie about a video game? Maybe he has someone boost his level. Did he say it's not true? Just doing that can have many reasons - maybe he likes a shiny number there, wants a bigger challenge, more fun because of higher level and more items or whatever. Just playing on an account that I didn't level up myself is not lying. I know that some competitive amateur players think it's the end of the world but no, nobody cares. reply rybosworld 3 hours agorootparent> Where does he lie about a video game? He stated on Joe Rogan he was one of the best Diablo players in the world (top 20 or thereabouts). The only way to do that is to grind the game with long hours, because it gets exponentially more difficult to level up. I don't remember exactly how many hours of playtime he'd need to achieve the level he was at, but it was excessive. Something like 14+ hours a day. Then he recently live streamed his Path of Exile 2 account. It was one of the highest leveled accounts in the world. Similar to Diablo, that's not possible without grinding the game for many hours. However, it was clear from the stream that Musk barely understood how to play the game. He was having trouble just finding things in the UI. The point is: he paid someone (or multiple people) for a leveled up account. Then he publicly claimed to be one of the top players in the world. It's both shocking and revealing that he's willing to put forth such a blatant lie, for something that matters so little (a video game). reply throw5959 3 hours agorootparentThank you, if he really said that he is one of the best players, that would be a lie. I don't think just streaming a leveled up account is a lie, though. Why do you talk about hours per day? Does it matter if you play less hours per day, but more days? reply rybosworld 2 hours agorootparent> Why do you talk about hours per day? Does it matter if you play less hours per day, but more days? Because the only way to level up your character is to grind through a dungeon. You'll get experience for doing so. Every time you level up your character, it takes exponentially more experience to hit the next level. I don't remember the exact number of hours per day that are required to hit the levels his characters are at, but it's in excess of 14+ hours/day. Combine that with the evidence from his live streaming that he doesn't actually know how to play these games, and it's clear that he can't have achieved the character levels he has on his own. This youtube video has a decent breakdown of the whole thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N-WW0UDrVQ To be clear, I don't think anyone really cares that he's paying for a leveled up account. What people care about is that he's taking credit for achieving the high level on his own, when that's obviously not true.

How sad this site is becoming. reply lolinder 2 hours agoparentI'm one of the flaggers. This is just my opinion, I'm not speaking for the others, but: I flagged because the piece is poorly argued and mostly just spiteful. It starts off on a bad foot by implying that Dorsey chose to sell Twitter to Musk and made billions on the sale, both of which are false. Dorsey was forced to sell Twitter to Musk by the shareholders and the board. The shareholders profited, but Dorsey actually did not sell his shares, which means he did not cash out and instead lost money over the course of Musk's tenure. All of that nuance is ignored in favor of a swipe that's used to imply that Dorsey is a billionaire because he profited off selling Twitter to the far right. Then later he uses his dislike for Dorsey in particular (and don't get me wrong, there are plenty of reasons to dislike Dorsey even if the Twitter sale isn't one of them) to justify saying that all billionaires should be unwelcome at FOSDEM. This isn't backed up by any sort of argument for why this generalization makes sense, it's just assumed that you should agree with him. Maybe we should, maybe we shouldn't, but there's no argument there.

Your comment is hyperbole and blows the whole thing out of proportion. reply SpicyLemonZest 4 hours agorootparentHe highlights that this is his subjective opinion and preference right before announcing that he’s going to try and stop the talk from happening by sitting down on the stage. I think this is an extraordinarily rude thing to do at a volunteer led event and really demands a better justification than subjective dislike. reply Etheryte 4 hours agorootparentYou could say the same about any peaceful protest, whether it's this, climate, politics, or etc. I don't have a strong opinion about this specific talk happening, but I think that if you see something that's wrong in the world, you should try to right it, extremes notwithstanding. reply SpicyLemonZest 4 hours agorootparentI could not say the same about any peaceful protest because most peaceful protests are not held to disrupt volunteer-led events. I don’t agree that you should try and enforce your personal preferences for who deserves a conference speaking slot by declaring you’ll try and prevent those you don’t approve of from taking the stage. reply stavros 4 hours agorootparentprevI have no opinion on the rest of the article, but it feels a bit disingenuous to say that Twitter burdened Mastodon because it made the latter much more popular. reply debo_ 4 hours agoparentprevHe isn't boycotting. He is planning to peacefully protest, which I think is reasonable. reply pjfin123 4 hours agorootparentDisrupting a talk isn't really \"peaceful\". You're physically obstructing the talk and daring the conference organizers who rented the room and other participants who want to hear the talk to use force to remove you. reply debo_ 1 hour agorootparentYou're describing disruption, not violence. reply clovoak 4 hours agorootparentprevWhy is it reasonable to interrupt everyone else's freedom to hear someone talk? reply necovek 4 hours agorootparentIf you believe someone is actively harming the audience (as he seems to), a peaceful protest is the way to go. We'll learn soon enough if he is right and the community stands (sits?) with him or not. But I couldn't not giggle on \"freedom to hear someone talk\" as an inverse of \"free speech\". Jack Dorsey has many platforms where he is welcome, and there are plenty opportunities to hear him share his thoughts. It's not like someone on the fringes is being shut off. reply LordShredda 4 hours agorootparentprevHe's not \"violating\" someone's freedom to listen to a talk, but rather he hates the guy and wants him gone. At least he's doing something about it reply phkahler 4 hours agorootparentprev>> He isn't boycotting. He is planning to peacefully protest, which I think is reasonable. No. He's planning to forcefully disrupt by blocking the stage. Narcissistic to the core: \"My views and need for attention are more important than the other 8000 people here who may want to see this talk.\" reply debo_ 4 hours agorootparentDisrupting access with your physical presence is not a use of force. Without peaceful protests, people will resort to violence more often. reply phkahler 37 minutes agorootparent>> Disrupting access with your physical presence is not a use of force. When they try to move him, will that be use of force? When he tries to resist being moved will that not be forcibly staying? reply SpicyLemonZest 3 hours agorootparentprevYou're importing protest tactics developed for use against governments and large corporations into a context where they don't make any sense. There, this legalistic distinction between \"force\" and \"disruption\" is quite important, because ensuring you don't cross the line to \"force\" greatly decreases the legitimacy of any violent response. It doesn't matter at FOSDEM, because FOSDEM is not going to hire goons to beat you up regardless of what you do. reply debo_ 2 hours agorootparentI don't fully understand your reply. Peaceful protests have existed for a long while before corporations did, for many different causes. They weren't always existential, nor were they always directed at the state. I have participated in community events where venue security decided they had to forcibly remove protesters from the premises, and in one case they contacted police for help. I qualify those as peaceful protests, and I believe security / police took reasonable measures to respond. No one was hurt, and everyone got the message, whether they agreed with it or not. reply immibis 4 hours agorootparentprevJack Dorsey would be free to say anything he wants outside of the stage, like Jordan Peterson once did, or pinned to the top of Bluesky, or to any mainstream media outlet of his choice, or on prime-time TV, or so on. reply ergonaught 4 hours agoparentprevIn my experience he typically has a reasonable point, even if everything surrounding the point is wildly off mark. reply tucnak 4 hours agoparentprevAre you hackers or what? reply hello_computer 4 hours agoprev [–] Twitter has been a military-grade psychological weapon for most of its existence (remember “Arab Spring”, and how that worked out? or how much of their middle-management was [is?] [ex???] FBI?).

For many years, the Tofino family of programmable Ethernet switches, powered by P4, has represented the cutting edge of network innovation. Tofino’s unprecedented levels of programmability have enabled organizations to shape their networks like never before. But there was always one limitation: the software driving this groundbreaking hardware remained closed source. Today, that changes. The Tofino P4 software is being open-sourced, and it’s about to revolutionize how we think about programmable networks. This bold move from Intel to open-source the Tofino P4 software is more than just a licensing decision; it’s a call to action for the global developer community. It invites everyone—from seasoned network engineers to aspiring students—to participate, innovate, and contribute to shaping the future of networking. The open-sourcing of Tofino P4 code democratizes access to some of the most powerful tools in networking. Developers can now dive deep into the workings of Tofino switches, experiment with custom data plane designs without restrictions, and share and build upon others’ innovations to create groundbreaking solutions, utilizing the power and strength of an open-source community. Open source thrives on collaboration. By releasing the Tofino P4 code, we’re creating a community where developers can propose and implement new features, researchers can experiment with cutting-edge ideas in programmable networking, and educators can use open-source tools to train the next generation of network engineers. Traditionally, access to high-performance network programming tools has been limited by closed-source software, high costs, or proprietary restrictions. Open-sourcing Tofino P4 removes these barriers, allowing anyone with the curiosity and skills to participate. This democratization is a game-changer for startups, academic institutions, and developers in underrepresented regions. Aspiring P4 developers can now explore, dissect, and learn from production-grade software. This real-world exposure will be valuable for understanding how P4 programming operates at scale. Educational institutions can even build programming curricula around this. In the words of Brad Burres, Intel Senior Fellow, “open sourcing software is the best way to accelerate industry innovation and lift all boats”. Nanda Kuruganti, Intel VP of Networking SW, points out that “P4 programming and an open ecosystem are the cornerstones of our networking strategy. By open-sourcing Tofino P4 software, we aim to empower the community to drive innovation and unlock the full potential of programmable networks.” Developers now have access to the entire source code, which is organized in two main repos inside the p4lang structure. The p4c repo now additionally contains the Tofino compiler components, with subfolders such as arch, common, control-plane, driver, midend, test and docs. The Tofino backend is hierarchically at the same level as bmv2, ubpf and other backends. The newly introduced open-p4studio repo contains all the other components of the Tofino P4 Studio, such as bf_driver, bf_diags, bf_utils and tofino_model. We are immensely grateful to the following individuals within Intel who worked on the open sourcing effort – Glen Gibb, Han Wang, Prathima Kotikalapudi, Anil Samal, Vaishnavi Tipireddy, Shiv Kumar, Shuai Zhang, Rohit Nair, and Sai Pracheetha Beeyam. We also benefited immensely from the guidance from the P4 Technical Steering Committee members, Fabian Ruffy and Andy Fingerhut. The open-sourcing of Tofino P4 software is not just a milestone—it’s an invitation. It’s a call for developers, researchers, educators, and network enthusiasts to come together and shape the future of programmable networking. We encourage developers to dive into the repository, read the code, and understand how Tofino P4 works. The more they learn, the more they can contribute. Whether it’s fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation, every contribution helps the community grow. We are asking P4 enthusiasts all over the world to spread the word about the open-sourcing of Tofino P4, and encourage their peers, colleagues, and organizations to join the P4 movement.

    "commentBody": "Intel's Tofino P4 Software Is Now Open Source (p4.org)182 points by ram_rattle 14 hours agohidepastfavorite58 comments lifeisstillgood 11 hours agoI’m impressed by the political acumen it takes to get a Corp to release code as OSS. My career has seen at least two chunks of work that would have made great OSS (ie potentially useful outside of the single company) but Incoukd not get past the final hurdle And they would have been nice CV boosters as well (my real motivation!) reply dolmen 8 hours agoparentWell. It looks like abandonning software to the community. From the \"P4 workflow\" described at https://p4.org/ I see mentions of compiling to x86, but no mention of ARM, and no mention of BPF. So, as someone who discover it, I wonder if this project is still relevant in 2025. reply enragedcacti 2 hours agorootparentI'm not familiar with P4 but with some quick digging it seems like the compiler does support eBPF as a target. Additionally, I don't think the compiler outputs x86 directly at all, and instead includes targets like DPDK which supports ARM in addition to x86. https://github.com/p4lang/p4c reply trimethylpurine 5 hours agorootparentprevIs x86 dead for wire powered devices? Regardless, OSS is probably the best way to get it onto other architectures. reply neuroelectron 2 hours agorootparentBasically, now you have to document x86. xD reply baq 9 hours agoparentprevIt helps that Intel has been contributing to OSS since forever, they have good internal processes established and some orgs develop/contribute to OSS pretty much exclusively. reply bayindirh 7 hours agorootparentI think the biggest contributor to these processes was going open source in their graphics drivers. They went from \"we have tons of 3rd party IP in these!\" to, \"you don't need to download anything, it's in kernel mainline now\" in a generation and they're off to the races after that. Maybe their Ethernet drivers were open before that, I don't remember but, video drivers made them pass a threshold in maturity IMHO. reply bombcar 42 minutes agorootparentThe ethernet ones were big for awhile, I can remember when you wanted to go out of your way to get something that worked with the e1000 driver if you wanted reliable, usable gigabit. reply spookie 5 hours agorootparentprevIntel embraced Linux when they bet big in datacenters in early 2002. The momentum they got from there, with Linux dominating the sector, made them realize how much of a benefit it is to have a free software stack. With Linux they were able to go head to head with the incumbents of the day. Linux and x86 became unbeatable in the space for 20 years. They have known how important it is. They won't forget. reply bayindirh 5 hours agorootparentYes, however, they first made their hardware standard compliant rather than making their driver open source. The open source part came later, starting with CPU and chipset support, then Ethernet, then GPUs IIRC. The biggest and sweetest side-effect is Desktop/Personal use Linux support as long as the hardware doesn't do anything janky, or too janky. reply spookie 5 hours agorootparentFair enough reply kanwisher 8 hours agoparentprevI had one piece that made it open source (with blessing of 20 committees), then someone that didn't like me ran it back up the flag poll and pulled it back next day reply dfex 12 hours agoprevAm I mistaken or has Intel pretty much shelved the Tofino switching hardware that supports P4 in the first place? I seem to recall Oxide having to switch suppliers over this? reply rising-sky 45 minutes agoparentThis was the post by Bryan Cantrill of Oxide on the Tofino saga with Intel https://bcantrill.dtrace.org/2024/12/08/why-gelsinger-was-wr... reply wmf 11 hours agoparentprevYes, Intel canceled Tofino two years ago. I'm not complaining but it's weird that they're open sourcing the SDK now. Maybe it's to support Mount Evans. reply dolmen 8 hours agorootparentReleasing dead software that is used only to support dead hardware? reply spookie 5 hours agorootparentAt least you can still make use of that hardware, many companies should take note of this. You can make hardware and software that doesn't die once someone pulls the plug on the other side. Still, of course it would've been better to have released it sooner. reply snizovtsev 3 hours agorootparentprevI think half of Tofino's complexity was in their compiler. So it may inspire new hardware vendors to reuse it in some contexts. reply robertlagrant 7 hours agorootparentprevThat's fair enough. reply ggm 12 hours agoparentprevI also was told tofino was looking EOL. Like NUC, dropped from some C suites KPI set and longterm roadmap. I'd love to be wrong, this is just what people said. reply bayindirh 7 hours agorootparentHowever, NUC form factor is more lively than ever before. Maybe someone can grab the language and run for something? Miktrotik guys come into my mind. reply doctorpangloss 38 minutes agorootparentIt’s complicated. The NUCs had a lot of inevitable catastrophic hardware failures, like NIC ports that would break. Their problem is they were not good. reply UltraSane 2 minutes agorootparentHow is a ethernet port breaking \"inevitable\"? happycube 7 hours agorootparentprevNUC somewhat avoided the google^Wintel graveyard - they sold at least the branding to Asus. reply p_l 6 hours agorootparentNUCs are shifting completely to ASUS who is going to continue working on them and there are some long term commitments (there are industrial variants for example) reply binarycrusader 12 hours agoparentprevApropos: https://github.com/oxidecomputer/tofino https://www.infoq.com/presentations/tofino-2/ reply dvtkrlbs 12 hours agoparentprevThey didnt switch supplier iirc they are still using Tofino since it is is still a capable hardware and they see it being useful for years to come reply danpalmer 12 hours agorootparentThey spoke on their podcast (I think it was there?) about ditching Tofino for the next generation of the Oxide computer. So it sounds like the current model will always ship with Tofino, but due to no future product development they won't use it again in a new machine. It sounded like they had just secured a replacement for the future but I can't remember who it was. reply bcantrill 11 hours agorootparentWe've talked about it a bunch, most recently when talking about Intel after Gelsinger.[0] I went into more detail on Intel's total mishandling of Tofino in my blog entry describing why Gelsinger was the wrong choice to lead Intel in 2021.[1] As you might imagine, this move from Intel is something that we at Oxide have advocated for strenuously -- and it is a tremendous tribute to the former Tofino team at Intel that this got done. As I hope I made clear in my blog entry: the folks working on Tofino at Intel have been great to work with; they deserved much better than their (former) executive leadership.

Tofino was a full generation behind and didn’t make sense. P4 was compelling because people thought they’d solve the Elephant flow problem with traffic engineering in P4 but the resources to actually do this at scale never materialized for many reasons. reply yusyusyus 9 hours agorootparentehh scream SDN 5 times. kinda miss the 2010’s now. cisco silicon one uses p4 fwiw. internal development though, but the language makes sense for what the things are. reply 0xNOTVALID 9 hours agorootparentdo they expose the p4 functionality externally? ive heard this from them but never actually seen the proof - it seems like vaporware reply wmf 1 hour agorootparentI don't think they would lie but they just don't release the compiler. Maybe they give it to Meta. reply purpleidea 2 hours agoprevUnless there are devices that I could buy (48 port 1U style switches) and until this supports integrating with something like switchdev ( https://docs.kernel.org/networking/switchdev.html ) then this is too little too late. I hope I'm wrong though. does anyone know if someone can make this switchdev friendly? reply wmf 1 hour agoparentThere have always been Tofino switches available to buy but they were priced for the data center not the home. You can probably find them on eBay now that they're old enough. Writing a switchdev driver is an enormous amount of work so it only happens when someone (usually the chip vendor) pays for it. Any code open-sourced by Intel probably won't meet Linux kernel standards so it would have to be completely rewritten (like the tg3 driver from the old days). reply eqvinox 10 hours agoprev> This bold move from Intel to open-source the Tofino P4 software is more than just a licensing decision; it’s a call to action for the global developer community. Nah. 5 years ago this would've been bold. Now it's ridding yourself of the baggage of an almost-dead platform that you're about to make fully dead. Still appreciate getting the tooling as FOSS rather than just terminating it, but let's not go for delusions here. reply unixhero 10 hours agoparentWhat are they making instead? reply eqvinox 9 hours agorootparentTo my knowledge: nothing. Intel is exiting the network switch silicon business¹. Broadcom and nVidia are dominating (different parts of) the market; Marvell and Microchip are fighting for the scraps. The only \"cool\" player is Microchip, who have been providing full datasheets, register maps, and open sourcing their drivers for years now. But I'm under no illusions they're doing this out of the goodness of their heart, they're doing it because it's one of very few competetive advantages available to them. (Which is perfectly fine! FOSS drivers are a great competetive advantage! It's not working super well sadly :/ — but part of the problem here is Broadcom's anticompetetive behavior. To my knowledge, any switch OEM producing Broadcom-based gear will get their NDAs and silicon access revoked if they so much as dream about making devices with non-Broadcom silicon.) ¹ Intel has already exited this business some while ago, they only bought Fulcrum Micro to get better NICs basically since every NIC is nowadays also a switch. Tofino was always a \"special beast\", not quite competing against e.g. Qumran or Trio. Tofino is (was?) better thought of as special purpose FPGA… reply p_l 6 hours agorootparentAMD ended up entering the market to some extent - big powerful software-modifiable NIC chips that can also serve as switches from my understanding. But like Tofino, it's mostly stuff that is \"behind the curtain\"at hyperscalers or deep inside closed box switches reply kogepathic 4 hours agorootparentprev> To my knowledge, any switch OEM producing Broadcom-based gear will get their NDAs and silicon access revoked if they so much as dream about making devices with non-Broadcom silicon. Cisco Meraki did; their low end switches are Marvell and their \"high end\" switches (MS420, MS425, MS450, MS350, MS355) were all Broadcom based. Were because about a year ago they announced the End of Sale of all Broadcom based switches. Everything above the low end stuff is now Cisco Catalyst. (Although one can argue everything from Meraki is low end apart from their prices) > Marvell and Microchip are fighting for the scraps Realtek also. Lots of smaller L2 managed switches based on the RTL93xx series. [1] But I am not seriously comparing Realtek to Tofino, that's like comparing Hot wheels to the actual car. [1] https://svanheule.net/switches/ reply nsteel 2 hours agorootparentprev> To my knowledge, any switch OEM producing Broadcom-based gear will get their NDAs and silicon access revoked if they so much as dream about making devices with non-Broadcom silicon. Nokia use Broadcom silicon for low-end, in-house for the rest. reply dist1ll 4 hours agorootparentprevHopefully they don't axe their NICs. At least Intel provides really good open datasheets for their e800 cards, can't say the same about other vendors. reply gnabgib 13 hours agoprevRelated P4: open-source programming language for high-performance packet switching (98 points, 2016, 19 comments) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11903478 reply deivid 12 hours agoprevAfter having used & automated configuration of \"traditional\" switching/routing devices for years (Cisco , Arista, Juniper), I can't wait for P4 devices to take over reply fishstock25 11 hours agoparentI believe that Arista has (had?) P4 devices in their lineup, but after Intel's sunsetting of that platform, they probably axed them. reply wmf 11 hours agoparentprevWhat do you want to use P4 for? reply dfex 11 hours agorootparentThe dream is you never have to rely on buggy vendor software again. The reality is, you end up with a complex stack with no or homegrown documentation that requires experienced engineers to operate and maintain. In some environments, that's a perfectly fair trade-off. In most, it isn't. reply deivid 10 hours agorootparentThe APIs these vendors provide are a joke. A bunch of functionality can only be accessed via scripting interactive CLI commands. Some API endpoints cause short downtime / unexpected behavior (eg: by deleting the routing table and adding all entries back 1 by 1), while the on-device commands do not. And guess what, the switch may decide to print informational or environmental messages interleaved with the command output, because the commands were meant to be run by a human. Good luck knowing if your state-altering command succeeded when you receive broken JSON. I ended up regex-removing known environmental messages from command outputs.. reply eqvinox 8 hours agorootparentImprovement on this is more likely to come from switchdev than from Tofino & P4. (though these don't necessarily contradict each other) You can already run plain Debian on a Mellanox Spectrum device, treat it like a Linux software router, and by the power of magic your routes get pushed into hardware. (Source: device on my table to my right :D) Microchip's SparX-5 should be similar though I don't have one of those to test. reply antithesis-nl 11 hours agoprevAs far as I can tell, Software Defined Networking (which this is about: \"P4 is a domain-specific language for network devices\") by now is pretty much a decade-old promise that never materialized. I'd still love to be wrong though! So, let's take the next paragraph: \"Before P4, vendors had total control over the functionality supported in the network (...) controlled the rollout of new features (e.g., VXLAN), and rollouts took years\" Anyone has a pointer to any actually available hardware capable of L2 and L3 packet processing where I could have implemented VXLAN in, say, weeks using P4? Again, as far as I can tell, it's all either killed-off-a-long-time-ago, \"contact us\" vaporware, or exotic 40/100-Gb-only Top-o-Rack gear, and even for those, there is nary an \"add to cart\" button in sight... reply wmf 56 minutes agoparentP4 is used by Cisco Silicon One, Xsight, AMD Pensando, Intel Mount Evans, etc. \"Contact us\" isn't the same thing as vaporware; the Pensando SSDK and Intel ES2K SDE definitely exist for example. I realize it sucks when things aren't available to hobbyists but it's a mistake to pretend it's fake. P4 is really only needed in data center networks because slower campus/home networks can usually get away with software processing and their lower prices probably can't support the R&D of a programmable architecture. reply kuon 8 hours agoparentprevI would be curious as well. Every time we try something \"software defined\" the drawbacks are major, cost goes up, stability goes down and most importantly, bandwidth goes down by a factor 10. The only software defined networking gear we use is OpenBSD, to do some complex routing, but we cannot go above 5GB/s. reply newsclues 6 hours agorootparentSeems to be used in the military radio space. reply 14 10 hours agoprev [–] Not much to add technically but I am very curious who named it Tofino. Tofino is a city by where I live. It is a beautiful location on the Pacific Ocean on Vancouver Island. A favorite destination for our PM Justin Trudeau.
