    "originBody": "the ‘return to office’ lies 22 Nov, 2024 Edit: Sorry for the people seeing it on HackerNews, didn’t post it there and it wasn’t intended for that audience 🤷🏻♀ yes, it’s an “immature rant”, because it starts with “I have to rant about the home office situation […] specifically at my place of employment”. This is not a professional article, it’s a personal blog; it was written after I was on the phone with the disability rep, talking to each other about these matters. I fear since this isn’t the US private sector I’m talking about, it may not match your experiences. I have to rant about the home office situation in general, but also specifically at my place of employment and similar places. I cannot stand the fake positivity and cute-sounding arguments for returning to the office. It falls flat for so many and it’s trying to make it sound more legitimate by evoking this image of collaboration, being social, kindness, having a good time together when that’s not the point. The point is micromanagement and needing to justify the large office spaces they invested into. Very rarely are there positions or departments who truly need to collab in person, and then they can just do that for the occasion, not a fixed amount of days per week or month where they need to go in at all times. It’s a joke. At my place, we don’t innovate, we don’t develop new products for a mass market; we do lots of data entry, emails, and writing reports in SharePoint or with comments and track changes in Word. Excel spreadsheets and databases. Absolutely everything is digitized, we send auto-emails and all communication is via Teams or Mail and very rarely over phone. Documents arrive digitally. All the collaboration is already online and there is no need for an office presence. Even when you are in office, you don’t even see the people for the work since it’s all online! But they’ll look at FAANG and be like: “Ooh, they’re asking everyone to be back at the office because of better collaboration!” You clown, the collaboration happens the same regardless where my ass sits and we are not designers or knowledge workers solving issues, we handle data! We are not pioneers or a Silicon Valley tech firm! Asking everyone back to the office for the supposed social aspect is truly the fruit-bowl-ification of it all. It’s about as convincing to work for you as the mention of the kicker table in your job listings. I like my coworkers, and I call them often just to talk, or create Teams meetings just to catch up in private matters and not a work meeting. But asking people back into the office to be more social and combat supposed isolation is dumb! The people who need this are not prevented to come in and do just that anyway. But you’re asking people to waste fuel and time commuting there, tired, sitting their ass off at a table for that? You’re asking me as an immunocompromised and chronically ill person in pain and dealing with fatigue to show up and do the same stuff I do at home so others can play family at work? Babes, I am less social with the office than without. When I come home from the office I lie in bed and that’s it. I am drained. I haven’t had the time or energy to see the people I truly care about much. This isolates me more. When I get sick from it (like last year at the Christmas function when someone brought Covid!) I am isolated at home. And for what, so people who insist on office time have someone they see in the hallway on the way to the toilet? They haven’t taken it away yet, but the threat seems to always be there and often serves as a way to enact pressure or as a bargaining chip. Behave or we can’t do that anymore, it’s a privilege not a right, we do this out of goodwill, some people abuse this and so on. Home office is the only way for many people to have a decent work output because family, household, caretaking, further education, illness and free time activities are better taken care of this way and people can work focused in silence without noise and interruption. It lessens stress and burnout and allows people to see more of their loved ones - much more meaningful socially than office interactions. If I hadn’t had home office possibilities, I would’ve been gone from work for 8 months minimum due to my illness. But this way, I was still able to do the daily work, launch new features needed in our database, sign stuff as a representative and more. Home office is so important for disabled and chronically ill people to get and retain employment, and team members and coworkers deserve it as well to not have to take over someone else’s work for so long just because of a refusal to let people work from home. You cannot dangle what people need to effectively work in front of them like a carrot and subtly threaten to take it away. It’s ableist. You wouldn’t dare to do that with elevators or other accessibility features at the office, so don’t do it with that either. And that’s also what I sent the staff council and our disability representative at work. So far, I received positive feedback for that. The past few years but especially this year, I saw my coworkers bust their ass to make it all work. More work, more responsibilities, no extra hires, no pay increase. I busted my ass to make it all work despite my illness. Twice in a row in my three years in that spot, I got a performance bonus for my great work. Well, they told us all this year there won’t be any for anyone despite it all. If they take away or severely limit home office too, I’m throwing, man. Then do your shit alone and drive all the young capable people away, in the place where like 50% of the work force will retire in the next 5 years. Fuck around and find out.

I took a >50% pay cut but I think it is a 100% life saver. I remember spending 3-4 hours/day commuting and I am just not willing to do that any more. I've cut back on expenses and simplified my life, built up some savings so I can make do with less. My retirement savings will slow down dramatically, but if I don't hate my work life then those savings will be less of an all-consuming goal. Thank you senior leadership for your wisdom, \"If you don't like it, find another place to work\". The first good advice I've heard from them in 5 years. reply typeofhuman 1 hour agoparentI did the same and for around 50% cut. Working from home allows me to spend more time with my kids (I get to have lunch with them and hear them play in the background), no toxic rush hour commute, and I get the comfort of my own space. I know there's a down side of not being able to collaborate as well with my team. But I put my wellbeing over that. And to be honest, the pay cut - while significant - made no change in my daily life. But the peace of mind and serenity I have retained by WFH is invaluable. reply lolinder 1 hour agorootparent> And to be honest, the pay cut - while significant - made no change in my daily life. Yep. Speaking for myself, beyond a certain income threshold there has been no substantial quality of life improvement. My last promotion made it even easier to save for an even earlier retirement, and that's about it. Early retirement is nice, and earlier retirement is even nicer, but given a choice between retiring when my kid is 20 and being home with him every day throughout his whole childhood, there's no contest. I'll happily delay retirement if that's the trade-off that's needed in order to be there while he's growing up. reply insane_dreamer 1 hour agorootparentThis is a critical point. There seems to be an obsession with “making money so you can retire early” and then what? Your children are grown and left home, you’ve often sacrificed them as well as your own physical and mental health, you don’t have the energy you had in your youth, for what? So you can play golf with other retirees? Or maybe you saved up enough that you can invest in a new startup. Okay fine but that’s not retirement, in fact it may be more work. reply rachofsunshine 40 minutes agorootparentIt's odd to me that people think the value in excess wealth is just living on a beach somewhere. The value in excess wealth is what you can do with it. You can find a person in need and hand them a thousand dollars for fun. You can fund some program your town needs. You can build a \"third space\" for your community. There's so much you can do with wealth that isn't just hoarding it! Personally, my goal is to have enough money to buy a giant mansion on the edge of some town and be the weird rich lady you can go to with your problems. If I get richer than that, great! It'll be a bigger mansion and a bigger town. But if you gave me a billion dollars tomorrow, I'd just use it to be a bigger weird rich lady you can go to with your problems. reply thanksgiving 18 minutes agorootparent> The value in excess wealth is what you can do with it. You can find a person in need and hand them a thousand dollars for fun. You can fund some program your town needs. You can build a \"third space\" for your community. There's so much you can do with wealth that isn't just hoarding it! Thank you for your kindness. However, you can't become and definitely won't stay a billionaire if you give away your money. In practical terms, you don't want strangers in your home. There are some bad people in this world. https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24vo34/whats_the... reply fragmede 5 minutes agorootparentWho wants to stay a billionaire? You can't take it with you, and that's an unfathomable amount of money for a single person to have. At a flat 5 percent interest per year, that's $50 million a year, or just under a million per week, or $137k/day. per day! You could fund an third space for quite a while on that and still never run out of money after your ordinary life expenses were paid. (Ballooning life costs can still add up as jets and yachts get expensive, but that's still an insane amount of money.) On 50 million a year, you could give out 49,000 homeless people to give $1,000 to, and still have a million dollars to spend, without touching your principle. The goal is to Die with Zero, as written by Bill Perkins, and while you may not want to literally do that, it's still a good book to read to get you thinking. Muromec 1 hour agorootparentprev>but given a choice between retiring when my kid is 20 and being home with him every day throughout his whole childhood, there's no contest This. So much this. I don’t want to start catching up on life after I’m 70 or 60 something and hate every minute before I retire. Once I got my mortage, there is no more reasons to care about exact numbers that much. reply georgeecollins 59 minutes agorootparentI heard a financial planner say once that many of his clients don't know how to retire. My Dad worked until he was ninety making money he will never spend. If you enjoy your job and have control over your time and projects, you may also want to keep working. Retirement sounds very appealing when you aren't spending enough time with your friends and family, or when you aren't getting enough relaxation. But there will come a time when your kids won't really want to spend that much time with you. And a hobby you spend all your time on could become an unpaid job. There will be times in your life when you have to be all in on your job. But when its not those times, try to have a balanced life now. reply ghaff 45 minutes agorootparentI \"retired.\" Still go to some events that are particularly interesting, usually in areas that I enjoy spending some extra time--though I did my best when I had a wage. Doing some of what I used to do anyway but on my own terms. I realize doing that is somewhat privileged but it works for me. reply heelix 8 minutes agorootparentprevI live about six miles or so from the office. I'm so much more productive (and end up working far longer) at home than in the cattle car hotel configuration. I dislike the idea that they might try to pitch things as 'pay less' if I'm more productive. If I'm in the office, I've lost the day. WFH should not be a reason to make less - it should be considered a benefit like a gym membership. If folks use it, the company comes out ahead in the end. reply vundercind 1 hour agorootparentprevThose charts that show remaining time you’ll be around someone at a given age are sobering. Even if you live 30 years after your kids are out of the house, odds are only something like 5-10% of your total time with them will be in that 30 years. Similar figures for your own parents and grandparents. Those hours with them are few, especially at ages when they can still do much. reply A4ET8a8uTh0 1 hour agorootparentprevI am starting to wonder if the management wants to ensure people in general do not make that connection ( and just want to have, ideally, serfs barely making ends meet ). Covid was a big moment for me in a lot of ways, because I was very pro-corporate for a long time. Having seen some of the bs up close and personal, it made me realize how broken our current system really is ( I still remember 'we are in this together' lip service and 'driving is your zen time' ). Having a kid ( and seeing it grow up ) can be such a radicalizing moment. reply rachofsunshine 1 hour agorootparentHonestly, if you're not a radical in the year 2024, you haven't been paying attention. I travel around a lot (a thing I can do because I work remotely). From SF to Seattle to Tampa to Salt Lake to the small-town corners of the Carolinas, everyone is struggling. You can feel it in the air, find people identifying with it in every conversation, see the slow decay of every place you know. The dead mall in your hometown, your phone forcing a prompt to take your data to train some AI, the favelas that are now the norm in every major city (regardless of local policy), the fact that you now get a prompt for what is effectively a payday loan when you try to order a pizza. I think people underestimate how poisonous that is to a culture and to a body politic. When you don't believe in reform, you either shrug and let things burn, or you start setting the fires yourself. Neither bodes well. reply Muromec 1 hour agorootparentprevManagement wants replaceable units which are cheap to source, maintain and replace and utilize to the maximum. That’s all it was ever about reply A4ET8a8uTh0 44 minutes agorootparentIt does ring true and I am not sure I can refute it ( management wants easily replaceable cogs for the machine ). But my overall thought is that humans are a lot of things, but among those things they are also horrible biological machines if seen only through that prism. Our whole value to the system is that we can adjust to the unknown. Still, maybe more importantly, we are not all even the same cogs, but management tries to lazily put us in the same category. I am not sure we can even really call it management. That is actually a mismanagement of human resources.. I think I mentioned this pet theory before here, but it is no longer 1950, but the management has not evolved since that period in US. Maybe it is time to force that evolution. reply pwg 1 hour agorootparentprev> I am starting to wonder if the management wants to ensure people in general do not make that connection ( and just want to have, ideally, serfs barely making ends meet ). One big reason is they are very worried about their stock grants due to the stock value nosedive that will occur once they finally have to write off all those office space leases as actual losses and report the loss on their SEC forms. If they can force RTO then all the money being spent for office space leases remains in the \"business expense\" category and the stock price does not tank as a result. reply grecy 40 minutes agorootparentprev> I am starting to wonder if the management wants to ensure people in general do not make that connection ( and just want to have, ideally, serfs barely making ends meet) Why do you think healthcare is tied to employment in the US? Why do you think minimum wage in the US has not gone up in decades? Why do you think 2 weeks leave is normal in the US? Why don’t more Americans travel overseas? At this point you have to be willfully ignorant not to make the connection. reply A4ET8a8uTh0 36 minutes agorootparentThere is no reason to make too snarky. The reality is the propaganda machine in US is really well oiled. reply jumping_frog 21 minutes agorootparentprevI don't understand why isn't WFH made mandatory since it helps with climate change. reply Muromec 12 minutes agorootparentBecause mandate giving authority doesn’t care about climate change. That’s pretty obvious explanation reply jfengel 1 hour agorootparentprevBeyond a certain point, you have as much money as you wish to spend. Some people don't seem to have a top limit, but for many, those lucky enough to earn more will just put it away. The difference in your lifestyle isn't now, but in a few decades. It's hard to know when you have enough for the rest of your life. There are formulas, though I don't really know how meaningful they are. Meantime you're clearly leading a better life now, and may well not mind having a few additional years of it (compared to a bit less time with a lot more aggravation). So, congratulations. It sounds like you made a well-founded choice. reply ghaff 41 minutes agorootparentI probably saved more than I had to do and probably shouldn't be as (relatively) frugal as I am. COVID definitely pushed out a significantly earlier (semi-)retirement. reply mrweasel 1 hour agoparentprevMy pay cut was only around 15%, but I also wasn't working for a large company, and was apparently underpaid by around 20%. This will come of a spoiled and privileged, but I honestly have no idea how we'd make our day to day life work if I didn't work from home, with incredibly flexible hours. Getting children ready for school and pick them up at a reasonable hour, without stress just isn't possible. You have to drop off your children in some kind of care before their even fully awake, and you need to pick them up almost before you get out of the office. Obviously people make it work, but I have no idea what kind of hours other people work, because doing a pick up at 16:30 would mean that my child would be the last one in the day care. In any case I don't see the point in tolerating the stress of traffic, school/day care, or just regular difficulties getting your daily tasks to fit in with a 8-16 job at an office. I have a family member that works at a hospital, she can't get her car service for four weeks because there's no available time to drop of the car and pick it up afterwards, which also fits with the mechanic. I can normally get appointments for mechanics, doctors, dentists, contractors, everything, with a few days notice because I can be incredibly flexible with my time. reply rachofsunshine 1 hour agorootparentThis is pretty close to the average value engineers place on a remote job. In our data set, the on-paper gap is about 18% (~37k on ~200k) if you just compare remote to non-remote, but given that the remote candidates often live in lower-COL areas, some of that probably comes from COL and not purely value placed on remote work. The real driver is that ~half of engineers only want remote work, and the vast majority of the remainder aren't in whatever city you're hiring in. reply mrweasel 57 minutes agorootparentI get that businesses are about profit and not much more, but I do find it interesting that it doesn't really register that people, given that option, choose to live in very diverse locations. Some companies don't have the choice. If you need people to come in and operate machines, do manufacturing, care for others and similar, then you often need your employees to commute. If you don't need that, why wouldn't you hire the best qualified person, even if that person prefers to live in the Mojave desert? reply rachofsunshine 47 minutes agorootparentWell, I do, that's why my company is remote. But if I were to play devil's advocate? - Because you think the apparently qualified person in the Mojave desert might be a fraudulent person who doesn't exist. - Because you think the apparently qualified person in the Mojave desert might be interviewing for jobs they intend to quietly outsource, possibly to people worse than themselves and definitely in ways that create security risks. - Because you think the random overheard conversations and water-cooler factor of in-office work has enough benefits to compensate for nominally lower qualifications. - Because you think you're not perfect at detecting low-quality work and think remote employees might take the opportunity to slack off in ways they wouldn't in an office. - Because you think it creates additional security risks by removing the implicit air-gapping of having to physically be in an office to handle sensitive information. - Because you and your current employees actually like being in-office and having that cultural cohesion, and you don't think you can get it remotely. ...or any number of other reasons. Like, I get that people like remote work. I do too. But the moralizing of RTO is...just incorrect, I think? There are practical arguments against it (I literally wrote a few thousand words to that effect not long ago - see my most recent HN submission), but that's an entirely different class of objection than the idea that it's just about middle managers wanting to breathe down your neck. reply mrweasel 22 minutes agorootparentJust to be clear, I'm in an area of the world where there never was much work from home. During COVID, sure, everyone was home, but most have been back at the office for a long time. The question of trust also isn't as much of an issue, given that I'm in a country where trust is pretty much implicit. So I don't really buy into many of the especially American takes on return to office. It's not about a \"return\" for me, that is long gone. People returned to the office years ago. For me it's missed opportunities for business, it's about a better work life balance, reducing stress, improving health, about reducing traffic and the associated pollution and it's about decentralization. As you rightly point out, there will be situations where you absolutely need people to go to an office, or where it will make a difference. These jobs could benefit from less traffic, better service at the edges of working hours, because the work from home people can use the time slots in middle of the day. For those jobs where it makes no difference if you are in an office or would be an improvement not to be, I don't get why more companies aren't just going for it. reply dgfitz 22 minutes agorootparentprevSo, you need control. Your proposing that employees cannot be managed efficiently if they’re not inside your panopticon? reply bwanab 1 hour agorootparentprevOnly two ways that I know of that can make it work: 1) one parent needs to stay at home, or 2) hire a nanny. Both of those come with considerable costs. reply james_marks 9 minutes agorootparentAlso other families that are in the same boat and trade pickup days, etc. This is also how you build community, so has many benefits beyond cost. reply bwanab 3 minutes agorootparentGood point! reply mrweasel 1 hour agorootparentprevWhile I apparently where underpaid, my boss and I had a pretty good relationship, but he didn't think a 50+% pay raise, so my wife could stay at home, was realistic, but I did ask. My wife's boss recommended getting an au pair, she pointed out that he's aware of how much she makes, and that it was a stupid suggestion that he know that we wouldn't be able to afford that. reply ghaff 34 minutes agorootparentprevHistorically, you had grandparents or other extended family (which was the case when I was growing up with two working parents). But that's far less common in the US today. reply lorax 49 minutes agorootparentprevWhen I was doing this, I went in a bit later and dropped the kids off and my spouse went in a bit earlier and picked them up. They were neither the first ones in nor the last ones out. My commute was worst case 20 minutes, that also helped. It worked fine (except when spouse was traveling), but WFH Is much easier. reply vundercind 52 minutes agorootparentprevRelatives, or illegal daycares. Or relatives who run illegal daycares. I think that’s how folks make it work. reply klooney 23 minutes agorootparentThere's a huge class divide in affordability. Unlicensed childcare, home remodeling, etc., is wildly cheaper. reply insane_dreamer 50 minutes agorootparentprevNot to mention that you’re putting your corporate boss’ well being above that of your children who have to cope with those circumstances. I’m willing to deal with the commute. I’m not willing to let my kids take the hit. reply nkrisc 48 minutes agorootparentprev> This will come of a spoiled and privileged, but I honestly have no idea how we'd make our day to day life work if I didn't work from home, with incredibly flexible hours. I don't think it's spoiled, I think you're spot on. Yeah, it's hard. And yes, you (and me and probably many others reading here) are privileged. > Obviously people make it work And yeah, they usually make it work, and it sucks. Or if they can't make it work then maybe a spouse or partner has to quit their job to handle that stuff and take care of the kids and then they have to get by with even less income. reply taeric 1 hour agoparentprev3-4 hours a day commuting? I confess I used to bike to the office and that could take about 3 hours/day, but I could cut it down to a 2 hour/day by switching to an ebike. I also like biking. On my \"work from home\" days I would aim for an hour and a half ride every morning. I can't imagine being in a longer commute that I didn't like. reply plasticchris 1 hour agorootparentSf Bay Area can easily exceed 2 hours each way if you aren’t willing to pay insane money on housing. It honestly made me wonder how low income people exist there at all. I did more than 2 hours each way for many years there but only by riding the train with a hot spot. reply taeric 39 minutes agorootparentThat sounds insane to me. Again, I had a long commute by bike. Could have easily shed most of it by getting a car. Would have to shift off rush hour, but that isn't too hard to do? Would love to see more data on this. Quick googling shows average commutes well below an hour. I'm assuming average is just not a good stat for this? reply AlotOfReading 1 hour agorootparentprevLow income people exist by either living with family or commuting insane distances from lower cost areas. I've met quite a few people who would commute from Tracy or Stockton to SF/Mountain View to work as janitors or food service workers at tech offices. It's brutal, especially when they're expected to show up in time to serve breakfast or open the doors. reply jmspring 1 hour agorootparentprevWhen I graduated college, the drive from Santa Cruz to 85 and Shoreline was about 35min at 730am. These days that is 90-120 minutes at that same time (think google/microsoft campuses). Many can’t afford to live close to those areas any more. reply tokinonagare 1 hour agoparentprevI did a radical change recently too, save for the fact my job (full remote) wasn't very well paid to begin with. The additional 700€/month I got for working in comparison to the unemployment benefit is absolutely not worth working 150h a month, since I still can pay for whatever small or medium things I want, and it don't make a real change to what I can't (buy a house). On the other hand, I have now time and energy to focus on all the cool things: writing research papers and my thesis, learning accounting to set up my company, make contributions to the open-source and open-data projects I care about, taking time for friends and family.

They’re also pushing hard to flatten as they should reply rectang 1 hour agoparentprevI’ve done essentially the same thing for years, working for small remote companies at rates below what my resume would justify. There are labor force bargains to be had for companies that offer workers flexibility. reply layer8 1 hour agoparentprev> 3-4 hours/day commuting I’d switch jobs then as well, or rather, I would never take such a job in the first place. Luckily my commute is only 20 minutes by bike. I don’t earn anywhere near FAANG level either, though. reply user-one1 1 hour agoparentprevI'm happy that you found something that works for you. But wouldn't it have been cheaper to move to a place closer to the office of your previous employer? reply tomtom1337 1 hour agorootparentRather than the snarky response, I’ll answer: closer is likely to be impossibly more expensive for the requirements OP needs (e.g. living area, number of bedrooms or similar). reply dghlsakjg 1 hour agorootparentTo add in, they may have other obligations in life that prevent it as well. Taking care of elders, kids schools, spouses jobs, medical care needs. Frequently money is just not the answer reply JoeDaDude 1 hour agorootparentprevMaybe. But sign a new lease (or mortgage!), pay moving expenses, relocate away from friends/family/social network/what have you and then the job disappears after 18 months, leaving you to relocate again.... reply mrweasel 1 hour agorootparentprevSo not parent, but no. I lived as close as we could afford, roughly 20km away. Outside rush hour you can to the trip in 15 minutes, during rush hour it's 35 minutes, assuming no accidents (and this is a highly accident prone area where traffic would block up completely every other week). Taking a 15% cut, which allowed us to move further away severely reducing our cost of living, bring us closer to family which can help out if needed. It has reduce stress, ensures that our child doesn't need to be in the care of after school programs longer than she needs. The reduced cost of living, reduction in stress and the flexibility that we're able to offer my wife's employer was made a huge, positive, difference in our lives, well worth the 15%. reply insane_dreamer 48 minutes agorootparentprevIt’s not just that it’s more expensive COL but if you’re buying then you’re taking a 30 y mortgage that may not be so easy to divest when the next round of cuts come and you find yourself let go anyway. reply steveBK123 1 hour agorootparentprevNot really in VHCOL areas. You can get by on less, if you are planning your life around your job, for sure. But for example if your office is Midtown Manhattan, the equivalent lifestyle to own a home for your family in walkable Manhattan vs long subway commute Brooklyn vs longer commuter rail suburbs vs extreme commute exurbs is staggering. You can buy an entire exurban home for the incremental cost to upgrade from Manhattan 2bed/1.5bath to 3bed/2.5 bath. My parents & in-laws each have 3bed/2.5 bath homes outside of Manhattan commute range, but within tolerably unpleasant driving commute to Stamford/Greenwich. That is - they are in commuter range of where commuters live / satellite office are located.

The free market works! You valued something more than $$$ and so made adjustments to your employment (aka selling your labor). I think that in-office work is good for certain situations, which is why onsites still make sense. And for folks newer in their career, onsite time is really important, based on my experience. But if remote is more attracitve, over time companies that offer it will win in the talent marketplace. reply CooCooCaCha 1 hour agorootparentExcept it doesn’t because so many companies are slowly bringing people back to office and finding a fully remote job is becoming more of a privilege. One anecdote does not validate your views. reply mooreds 1 hour agorootparentThere were companies both hybrid and remote before covid (I worked for a few). Covid was a shock that shifted remote work (as well as a lot of other things). I would not call remote work a privilege. Rather I would say remote work is a benefit. It falls into the same bucket as all the other benefits that employees can weigh in addition to salaries when they weigh job options. I expect a reversion in terms of remote/hybrid, but not all the way back to where it was before hand. Looked for some stats, didn't find much. From the US BLS[0]: > However, remote work participation was still higher than its 2019 level in all industries except agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting, which returned to its 2019 level.

If you are willing to make the trade off for what you value more then go for it. Many do not want to make the pay or job tradeoff and come into office, and many others (myself included for many cases) think coming in to office is generally good. Remote is not more attractive to everyone and everyone doesn’t have the same economics on the trade offs. reply CooCooCaCha 1 hour agorootparentThat’s exactly why it doesn’t work. Leaving our rights to the market to decide does not work. It never has. Why? Because for the vast majority of people, employers have almost all of the negotiating power. What this means is the market is slowly shaped by what employers want, not employees. Because we need a job more than they need our labor. It’s naive to think the market is a level playing field and if employees want something they just vote with their labor and the market will adapt. That’s just not true. Most people don’t have the ability to change jobs on a whim to play the market with their livelihoods. reply dbish 41 minutes agorootparentIt works fine for tech and most white collar jobs.

Even if you are paid below the market, but you are highly skilled in a job where you deliver a lot of value for the employer and you make a lot more than the average worker, you can take a pay cut.

An intellectually honest manager will say \"it's not for me, I can't do it,\" and their higher-ups have to make a value judgment about whether it's worth it to force them into a shape that they're not, or accept that the tried-and-true method of socializing juniors in-person is still valid. If you're honestly curious as to why it's so hard, my experience is that it's a socialization task: you have to make the junior folks feel like they're part of the team and have standing to ask questions.

RTO isn’t about empty real estate, or not mostly. Leases can be broken, everything is subject to negotiation. Sure, there’s a cost, but it could be paid. It’s not about real estate, it’s about power.

RTO is about showing us all who is really in charge. reply rachofsunshine 1 hour agoparentI run a remote company, so I don't have skin in trying to convince anyone that RTO is a good idea. And there might be some truth to this in a wider, more systemic sense, in that employers and employees are always in some degree of zero-sum negotiation. But...like, do you think management actually thinks in these terms? I've known some pretty rich and powerful people. None of them talk this way behind closed doors, or at least they haven't around me. Even the ones that denigrate social programs or support for workers or poverty don't frame it this way. They think - rightly or wrongly - that it's a more effective way to run their company, usually because they don't trust workers not to abuse remote work, or sometimes because they've bought into some hustle-culture narrative that wanting comfortable work means you're not a Scrappy Highly Motivated Self Starter or whatever. reply PeeMcGee 2 minutes agorootparent> They think - rightly or wrongly - that it's a more effective way to run their company, usually because they don't trust workers [...] This still seems a lot like RTO being used as a weapon.

Just because they think it's a more effective way to run their company doesn't mean that their understanding of \"more effective\" isn't equivalent to exercising more control. > But...like, do you think management actually thinks in these terms? People are perfectly capable of thinking about things in terms that are inconsistent with their underlying motivations. Dog whistling in politics works and is necessary because explicit racism turns off a substantial part of the population that nevertheless remains open to more indirect forms of racist policy and language. Thus, dropping n bombs morphed into \"welfare queens.\" While such voters may be uncomfortable with outright bigotry, dog whistling rhetoric still appeals to them because on some level they are not entirely comfortable with true racial equality and integration. i.e., they harbor racial animus that motivates racist beliefs. Similarly, managers and executives may not feel comfortable speaking explicitly in terms of exercising power or control over their employees while still acting out of a subconscious need to exercise that very power or control. Almost certainly organizational leaders do not form a homogenous block here. Some of the leaders proposing these RTO policies are intentionally disguising their true motivations by using indirect language because they know their true beliefs are socially unacceptable and they do not want to incur the social cost of honestly representing their motivations. Others adopt similarly indirect language and comparable positions without being consciously aware of the emotional needs motivating their choices. Still others legitimately believe in their pro-RTO position without necessarily experiencing any ulterior motive. > because they don't trust workers not to abuse remote work Lack of trust in their workers is a failure of leadership. Rather than improve their accountability systems so that they can trust their workers more, they impose an extremely unwelcome cost on those employees. I don't see how that is any better than thinking about the problem in terms of raw power dynamics. > or sometimes because they've bought into some hustle-culture narrative Hustle culture itself encodes a sense of superiority that serves as emotional and philosophical justification for the power of business leaders over their employees. It's an example of attribute substitution. They don't know how to measure actual merit or hard work, so they measure visible, loosely correlated behaviors. Again, this is a failure of leadership, and a failure to establish systems of accountability that can function in a remote environment. It is difficult to see any real moral difference between wanting to exercise power for its own sake and imposing uncompensated costs on employees to avoid doing the hard work of being a leader. Especially because an organization that cannot hold employees accountable in a remote environment will be unlikely to do so in the office either. So far, the overwhelming majority of the published data around remote work and the rigorous analyses based on those data strongly suggest RTO policies damage rather than improve productivity. Likely precisely because organizations with poor organizational mechanisms around accountability continue to perform poorly in office, whereas those with strong accountability perform even better remotely. When leaders propose arguments for a policy that do not actually justify the policy, it makes sense to consider what their ulterior motives might be. Many ambitious leaders possess a deep psychological need to exercise power over others. That's what makes them ambitious. In the absence of any reasonable justification for RTO, it is thus not unreasonable to attribute their position to that need for control rather than accepting the insufficient and unconvincing excuses they explicitly offer for their position. reply aprilthird2021 1 hour agorootparentprev> usually because they don't trust workers not to abuse remote work So, it is about wanting to assert control.

You can say \"well that's the sort of thing you should catch in a performance review\", but that's more-or-less isomorphic to hiring anyone who applies to your job and relying on performance reviews to fire the bad ones. I think people can intuit that that approach would not work very well. If you want to frame \"being worried people will not do their jobs, or will do them worse than your expectations on hire\" as \"asserting control\", I suppose you can do that.

Travel distance between desks has already become so large that many people won't do it for small things. For decades now those situations would be handled by a phone call or email. Meeting in the coffee room to chat becomes rare because schedules and tastes (eg. office coffee versus off-site coffee, bagged lunches versus going out) differ. Also there's too many people and too much churn to really get to know anybody. Arranging meeting times becomes difficult outside smaller 5-10 person units so asynchronous communication becomes predominant. What I've seen work is not trying to co-locate a full team at all. Doing so only leads to silos and hiring difficulties. Instead have small offices which people from a small geographic area use. Those people will be on different teams and in different departments -- which is good for inter-team communication and synergy.

I'm not saying having only very few employers in an area is good, since that would be giving a central group way too miuch power. But, yeah, i kinda yearn for a sort of village approach.

Justifying office space is not a useful business strategy. I think it’s best to treat people you disagree with as reasonable and consider what their motivations could be. In this case I think it’s clear there is one big one—-productivity. It’s clear that some people (not everyone!) use remote work as a way to do minimal work (see r/overemployed). Moreover there are some benefits to in person collab in terms of being able to discuss things quickly and rely on people to be there. And I say this as a remote worker who loves it and never wants to RTO. But I don’t assume the other side is acting in bad faith, I think there’s pros/cons to both.

    "originBody": "SMART NEWS Check Out the Highest-Resolution Images Ever Captured of the Sun’s Entire Surface Four new images show our nearest star in dazzling detail, with each one made up of 25 shots observed by the Solar Orbiter in 2023 Margherita Bassi Daily Correspondent November 21, 2024 This view is just part of a new, high-resolution image of the sun's full surface captured by the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) on the Solar Orbiter spacecraft. Screenshot. ESA & NASA / Solar Orbiter / PHI & EUI teams; Data processing: J. Hirzberger (MPS) & E. Kraaikamp (ROB) The European Space Agency (ESA) has just released four new, stellar images of the sun, including the highest resolution views to date of its full, visible surface, called the photosphere. Each image is actually a mosaic of 25 high-resolution shots snapped by the Solar Orbiter mission on March 22, 2023. The spacecraft captured all 100 total images when it was less than 46 million miles from the sun. The process took more than four hours, since the spacecraft had to change position for each individual photograph. In the final mosaics, the sun’s diameter is almost 8,000 pixels across. “The closer we look, the more we see,” Mark Miesch, an astrophysicist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center who wasn’t involved with obtaining the images, tells CNN’s Ashley Strickland. “To understand the elaborate interplay between large and small; between twisted magnetic fields and churning flows, we need to behold the sun in all its splendor. These high-resolution images from Solar Orbiter bring us closer to that aspiration than ever before.” @ESASolarOrbiter’s daring trajectory close to the Sun is paying off, giving us the highest-resolution full views of the Sun’s surface to date. Full story https://t.co/Cy0H6JZmlp pic.twitter.com/0IyEDeLpX0 — ESA Science (@esascience) November 20, 2024 The Solar Orbiter is a joint mission between the ESA and NASA, operated by the ESA, that launched in February 2020 and released its first images the following July. Since its launch, the program has hit many milestones, capturing both the closest-ever images of the sun and the first close-up images of its polar regions. While the spacecraft totes six imaging instruments, the newly released images were captured with just two: the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) and the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). The PHI is responsible for three of the new solar views—an image in visible light, a map of the direction of the magnetic field and a velocity map featuring the speed and direction of parts of the sun’s surface. The EUI, meanwhile, produced an image of our star’s outer atmosphere, called the corona, in ultraviolet light. “These new high-resolution maps from Solar Orbiter’s PHI instrument show the beauty of the sun’s surface magnetic field and flows in great detail. At the same time, they are crucial for inferring the magnetic field in the sun’s hot corona, which our EUI instrument is imaging,” Daniel Müller, a Solar Orbiter project scientist with the ESA, says in a statement. “The sun’s magnetic field is key to understanding the dynamic nature of our home star from the smallest to the largest scales.” The four images offer a high-definition tour of the sun. First, the visible light image below depicts the star’s constantly moving surface of hot plasma—or charged gas, simply put. This layer has a temperature between 8,132 and 10,832 degrees Fahrenheit and emits most of the sun’s radiation. The sun in visible light ESA & NASA / Solar Orbiter / PHI Team CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO Beneath the surface is the sun’s convection zone, in which dense plasma swirls around, rather like the magma in Earth’s mantle. This phenomenon makes the sun’s surface look grainy, and scientists say the star’s magnetic field is driven by the churning plasma. Dark shapes called sunspots are seen in both PHI’s visible light image and its magnetic map, shown below. The sun’s magnetic field is stronger at the sunspots, with red in the image indicating where it moves outward and blue indicating where it moves inward. Sunspots are concentrated tangles of magnetic fields, where plasma is diverted from the sun’s heat-mixing convective flow, making it cooler than surrounding areas. As a result, the plasma in sunspots gives off less light and appears dark in the visible light image. This map, showing the line-of-sight direction of the sun's magnetic field, is also called a magnetogram. ESA & NASA / Solar Orbiter / PHI Team CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO In the third image—the velocity map, shown below—the PHI captures the movement of parts of the sun’s surface, with blue indicating movement toward the Solar Orbiter and red indicating movement away from it. “This map shows that while the plasma on the surface of the sun generally rotates with the sun’s overall spin around its axis, it is pushed outward around the sunspots,” according to the statement. The velocity map, also called a tachogram ESA & NASA / Solar Orbiter / PHI Team CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO Lastly, the EUI’s ultraviolet light image captures the sun’s corona—its wispy outer atmosphere that can only be seen from Earth during a total solar eclipse. The image depicts interesting activity once again around the sunspots: plasma shooting outward along magnetic field lines, which occasionally connect sunspots close to each other. This high-resolution image shows the sun in ultraviolet light, revealing its outer atmosphere, the corona. ESA & NASA / Solar Orbiter / EUI Team CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO The image processing that produced the PHI’s images was “new and difficult,” per the statement, but moving forward, ESA experts expect to produce similar images with greater speed, potentially releasing two a year. “This mission is such a treasure and important to science,” Günther Hasinger, director of science for the ESA, told Space.com’s Amy Thompson at the time of its launch.

It's not something someone drew/painted. It's photographic data combined together. If you want to be pedantic, every single picture ever taken with a digital camera is digitally modified. Every single image shot on film and scanned to be used on a computer is digitally modified. Just because you can't take a photo of the sun anywhere close to this does not mean others of us cannot, and does not make their actual images of the sun not real. Using proper filters so you do not melt your equipment allows for images of the photosphere to be captured. Using the moon to filter the photosphere during an eclipse allows the corona to be seen. It's not like it's not there except during an eclipse. It's just too faint to be captured without the filter. That's what the SRO uses a cornograph to block the photosphere at all times to be able to image the corona. Imaging the sun is very fun and challenging, and I'd suggest you'd learn a lot from reading up on it.

We receive about 1kw of sunlight per square meter on Earth, and earth is 149M km from the sun. From napkin math, it should rather be ~45MW/sqm on the sun to receive 1kw/sqm on Earth (surface of the sphere of radius 149M km divided by surface of the sun gives ~45000, so 1 watt from the sun becomes 1/45000 watt when it reaches the Earth) Where am I wrong ? reply grues-dinner 5 hours agorootparentBecause that's the irradiance at the Solar Orbiter's closest approach (well, more like 17.5kW, hence getting on for). It's pretty amazing that you can have a spacecraft in nearly 20x direct sunlight, permanently and still have it actually work. reply burnt-resistor 5 hours agorootparentprevYour calculations are incorrect. Use common sense, models, and first principles. Light point source irradiance is E = P/4πr², so inverse square law. It's 1361 W/m² at Earth's distance of 1.5e11 m. Solar Orbiter dips down to 4.2e10 m. ¼ the distance, Total solar power output = 4 * π * (1.5e11 [m])² * 1361 [W] = 3.85e26 W/m² Sun's \"surface\" irradiance = TSPO / (4 * π * (6.96e8 [m])²) = 6.32e9 W/m² At Solar Orbiter's perihelion, assuming the distance from the Sun's point center rather than the Sun's surface = TSPO / (4 * π * (4.2e10 [m])²) = 1.74e4 W/m². ^ Except for Earth's irradiance and the distances, these are theoretical rough values rather than observed ones because reality is messier than simplified models. reply popol12 4 hours agorootparentThe real issue was that I didn't get that you were talking about Solar Orbiter, I thought you were saying that the irradiance of the sun was 20kW/m2, which seemed low to me, but I didn't even know the word \"irradiance\" so I didn't know what to type on Google to check it.

The sun is emitting light at roughly the spectrum curve of a (non-ideal) black body at 5778°K [1]. The 'black body' curve is the idealized electromagnetic spectral emission curve of how every body 'glows' according to temperature. [0] The peak of the sun's emission curve is around 500nm which is a blue-green, but of course it is spread out across a broad spectrum so is closer to white, and then it is differentially scattered by the atmosphere.

Why is the corona only visible in the UV images, if it is, according to the article, visible from earth? reply sega_sai 5 hours agoparentCorona is very hot (millions of degrees) as opposed to 6000 of the Sun's surface, therefore it has higher contrast over Sun's surface if you go to shorter wavelengths. The reason corona is still visible from Earth is because it you mask the main solar disk (during the eclipse). reply willis936 6 hours agoparentprevIt might be that the surface is much brighter in visible light than the corona rather than the corona emits no visible light (as anyone who witnessed the recent total solar eclipse can attest). Since the corona is made up of rarefied high energy particles I would expect it to emit less total, but more short wavelength light. reply dukeofdoom 2 hours agoprevHow crazy is it that sun spots look like skin cancer, or skin cancer looks like sun spots. reply hulitu 5 hours agoprev> Highest-resolution images ever captured of the sun’s entire surface Did the probe revolves around sun ? reply grues-dinner 5 hours agoparentFirstly the Sun itself rotates roughly once a month, and secondly if the probe wasn't going round the sun, it would be called the Solar Impactor, not the Solar Orbiter.

We need total 360 degree coverage of the sun 24/7. Stereo A and B did this great, but when Stereo B failed, it was never replaced. reply superkuh 51 minutes agoparent [–] Yes, full coverage is needed. And not just of the lower lattitudes from the ecliptic plane. The original Solar Orbiter proposal plan A was for a highly inclined orbit passing over the poles of the sun. But this was too expensive and instead they went with just another generic spectroscopic imager in the ecliptic plane. It was such a disappointment. I wonder if the 4m DKIST on Earth would have higher resolution photomosaic of the sun if it were used to do this one day? Probably. It's field of view is smaller but it can image features down to the high single km scale (~8km) on the photosphere. The problem with this is that at 10km scale the features of the sun are changing far faster than at large scales. The rows of exposures' tops and bottoms would not match very well assuming a normal raster scan. The higher the resolution the smaller the timespan you have to take the full disk image. And the higher the resolution the smaller your FOV is. It's a rough situation. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "Fabien Sanglard's Website Home About FAQ Email Rss Twitter June 30, 2012 Quake 3 Source Code Review: Network Model (Part 3 of 5) >> The network model of Quake3 is with no doubt the most elegant part of the engine. At the lower level Quake III still abstract communications with the NetChannel module that first appeared in Quake World. The most important thing to understand is: In a fast paced environment any information that is not received on first transmission is not worth sending again because it will be too old anyway. As a result the engine relies essentially on UDP/IP: There is no trace of TCP/IP anywhere since the \"Reliable transmission\" aspect introduced intolerable latency. The network stack has been augmented with two mutually exclusive layers: Encryption using preshared key. Compression with pre-computed huffman key. But where the design really shine is on the server side where an elegant system minimize the size of each UDP datagram while compensating for the unreliablity of UDP: An history of snapshots generate deltas packets via memory introspection. Architecture The Client side of the network model is fairly simple: Client sends commands to the Server each frame and receive update for the gamestate. The Server side is as bit more complex since it has to propagate the Master gamestate to each Client while accounting for lost UDP packets. This mechanism features three key elements: A Master Gamestate that is the universal true state of things. Clients send theirs commands on the Netchannel. They are transformed in event_t which will modifiy the state of the game when they arrive on the Server. For each Client the server keeps the 32 last gamestate sent over the network in a cycling array: They are called snapshots. The array cycle with the famous binary mask trick I mentioned in Quake World Network (Some elegant things). The server also features a \"dummy\" gamestate with every single field set to zero. This is used to delta snapshots when there is no \"previous state\" available. When the server decides to send an update to a client it uses each three elements in order to generate a message that is then carried over the NetChannel. Trivia : To keep so many gamestate for each players consumes a lot of memory: 8 MB for 4 players according to my measurements. Snapshot systems In order to understand the snapshop system, here is an example with the following conditions: The server is sending update to a Client1. The server is attempting to propagate the state of Client2 which has four 4 fields (3 ints position[X], position[Y], position[Z] and one int health). Communication are done over UDP/IP: Those messages gets lost quite often on the internet. Server Frame 1: The Server has received a few updates from every client. They have impacted the Master gamestate (in green). It is now time to propagate the state to Client1: In order to generate a message the network module will ALWAYS do the following : Copy the Master gamestate in the next Client history slot. Compare it with an other snapshot. This is what we can see in the next drawing: Master gamestate is copied at index 0 in Client1 history: It is now called\"Snapshot1\". Since this is the first udpate, there are no valid snapshot in Client1 history so the engine is going to use the \"Dummy snapshot\" where all fields are always ZEROed. This results in a FULL update since every single field is sent to the NetChannel. The key point to understand here is that if no valid snapshots are available in the client history the engine will pick \"dummy snapshot\" to generate a delta message. This will result in a full udpate sent to the Client using 132 bits (each field is preceeded by a bit marker): [1 A_on32bits 1 B_on32bits 1 B_on32bits 1 C_on32bits]. Server Frame 2: Now let's move forward in time: this is the Server second frame. As we can see each client have sent commands and they have impacted the Master gamestate: Client2 has moved on the Y axis so pos[1] is now equal to E (in blue). Client1 has also sent commands but more important it has also acknowledged receiving the previous udpate so Snapshot1 has been marked as \"ACK\": The process is the same: Copy the Master gamestate in the next Client history slot: (index 1): This is Snapshot2 This time we have a valid snapshot in the client history (snapshot1). Compare those two snapshots As result only a partial update ( pos[1] = E ) is sent over the network. This is the beauty of the design: The process is always the same. Note : Since each field is preceeded by a bit marker (1=changed, 0=not changed) the partial update above would uses 36 bits: [0 1 32bitsNewValue 0 0]. Server Frame 3: Let's move forward one more step in order to see how the system deals with lost packets. This is now Frame 3. Clients have kept on sending commands to the server. Client2 has lost life and health is now equal to H. But Client1 has not acknowledged the last update. Maybe the Server's UDP got lost, maybe the ACK from the Client got lost but bottom line is that it cannot be used. Regardless the process remains the same: Copy the Master gamestate in the next Client history slot: (index 2): This is Snapshot3 Compare with the last valid acknowledged snapshot (snapshot1). As a result the message sent it partial and contains a combination of old changes and new changes: (pos[1]=E and health=H). Note that snapshot1 could have been too old to be used. In this case the engine would have used the \"dummy snapshot\" again, resulting in a full update. The beauty and elegance of the system resides in its simplicity. The same algorithm automatically: Generate partial or full update. Resend OLD information that were not received and NEW information in a single message. Memory introspection with C You may wonder how Quake3 is comparing snapshots with introspection...since C does not have introspection. The answer is that each field locations for a netField_t is preconstructed via an array and some clever preprocessing directives: typedef struct { char *name; int offset; int bits; } netField_t; // using the stringizing operator to save typing... #define NETF(x) #x,(int)&((entityState_t*)0)->x netField_t entityStateFields[] = { { NETF(pos.trTime), 32 }, { NETF(pos.trBase[0]), 0 }, { NETF(pos.trBase[1]), 0 }, ... } The full code of this part can be found in snapshot.c's MSG_WriteDeltaEntity. Quake3 does not even know what it is comparing: It just blindly follow entityStateFields's index,offset and size...and sends the difference over the network. Pre-fragmentation Digging into the code we see that the NetChannel module slices messages in chunks of 1400 bytes ( Netchan_Transmit), even though the maximum size of an UDP datagram is 65507 bytes. Doing so the engine avoid having its packets fragmented by routers while traveling over the internet since most network MTU are 1500 bytes. Avoiding router fragmentation is very important since: Upon entering the network the router must block the packet while it is fragmenting it. Upon leaving the network problems are even worse since every part of the datagram have to be waited on and then time-costly re-assembled. Reliable and Unreliable messages If the snapshot system compensate for UDP datagrams lost over the network, some messages and commands must be GUARANTEED to be delivered (when a player quits or when the Server needs the Client to load a new level). This guarantee is abstracted by the NetChannel: I wrote about it a few years ago (wow my drawings have come a long way !!). Recommended readings Brian Hooks a member of the developing team wrote a little bit about the Network Model. The author of Unlagged: Neil \"haste\" Toronto also described it.

Like, not just chores and a tiny bit of fun-coding once in a honeymoon, but really spending time on coding for fun, getting something done around the apartment, just going for a walk for two hours. All things I wanted to do or try but always felt too tired, or something more important popped up. Things like, just repainting part of a wall in one room got postponed for almost a year, and now that I did it, it didn't even take half an hour and actually felt good. I'm still working three days a week, because it's not like I hated my job, but it was quite demanding at times. I wrestled with the idea of just reducing hours for way too long.

You’d think the 8-hour workday would leave 8 hours for sleep and another 8 for recreation and other necessities, but somehow in my life there’s really only about 6 hours for sleep and 2-3 hours for everything else. Some of that is kids, but it’s not the entire explanation and honestly I’m not too sure where it all goes sometimes. reply hnthrowaway0328 2 hours agorootparentFor me it's the kid. Kid doesn't really take a huge chunk of time, but he takes all the time between 5pm and 6:30pm, 50 mins between 6:30 and 8:00pm, 10 mins between 9:00 and 10:00, and many times 30 mins between 8:00pm and 9:00pm.

But then I remember that I actually have a much more creative job than most people and my creative energies are spent from 9-6 Monday to Friday (I work in movies). I've found MUCH more peace and pleasure in my \"consumption hobbies\" like watching tv, reading, playing linear story games that don't require me to be particularly creative and learned to stop being so hard myself for not having a hobby where I'm actively producing something like writing a book or making a game. Weirdly when I have a quiet period at work and am not so creative for 2-3 months I get the urge to pick up creative hobbies again. I've come to realise for myself that I have a measureable amount of bandwidth to create and a measureable amount of bandwidth to consume and they seem to be seesaw'd together. reply markandrewj 15 minutes agoprevThe net code for the original Q3A client worked well for lan, but was sensitive to latency for remote play.

I don't play on MM servers if the ping is more than 10. reply Thaxll 5 hours agorootparentEven in the same city most people won't have 7ms, not sure where that number comes from. reply skhr0680 8 hours agorootparentprevIsn't ping mostly determined by the physical distance between you and the server? reply burnt-resistor 7 hours agorootparentSort of, but not precisely. In practice, it really depended on the slowest link's maximum single-channel bandwidth*, oversubscription ratio of the backhaul(s), router equipment and configuration like QoS/packet prioritization... and then it also depended on internet traffic at the particular time of day. In my case, I was 3-4 hops away and 34 mi / 55 km straight line distance, 110 / 177 driving, and most importantly roughly around 142 / 230 of cable distance approximately by mapping paths near highways in Google Earth. I doubt the network path CalREN/CENIC was used because it never showed up in hops in traceroute (although there was nothing preventing intermediaries from encapsulating and transiting flows across other protocols and networks), but it definitely went through PAIX. * Per technology, zero-distance minimum delay is a function of the single maximum channel bit rate and data size + lower layer encapsulating protocol(s) overhead which was probably UDP + IP + 1 or more lower layers such as Ethernet, ATM, ISDN/frame relay BRI/PRI, DSL, or POTS modems. With a 1 Gbps link using a billion 1 Hz|baud channels, it's impossible to have a single bit packet latency lower than 1 second. reply fragmede 7 hours agorootparentprevDepends on the location of you and the server. Obviously it can't go faster than the speed of light, but it can go much slower, since it doesn't go add the crow (or photon) flies, and more of in a zig zag path, and it has to traverse several photon/electron translation hardware hops (aka routers and switches), and there's typically some packet loss and buffer bloat to contend with as well. The speed of light in fiber is slower than in a vacuum, to be fair, but the latency you experience is marred more, not by the raw speed of the photon in fiber, which is still quite fast (certainly faster than you or I can run), but by all the other reasons why you don't get anywhere near that theoretical maximum speed. From me to Australia should be ~37 milliseconds if we look at the speed of light, but it's closer to 175 milliseconds (meaning a ping of ~350). Nevermind the latency of being on wifi adds to that. https://www.pingdom.com/blog/theoretical-vs-real-world-speed... reply Hikikomori 6 hours agorootparentThere are many problems with this article, it's for laymen so simplifies things but it's also factually incorrect. Fiber is usually next to roads or railways, which usually do not zigzag. Modern router/switches have a forwarding delay of micro/nanoseconds. The beam in a single mode fiber does not bounce like a pinball, it doesn't bounce at all, hence the name. Ping is largely a product of distance and the speed (200km/s). It's not the distance a bird would fly but it can be close to it sometimes. And then the internet is a collection of separate networks that are not fully connected, so even if your target is in the next building your traffic might go through another bigger city as that is where the ISPs peer. reply burnt-resistor 3 hours agorootparentYou're still missing many other significant factors besides distance. There are many conditions that affect latency, but on the minimum theoretical value possible, it's mostly dominated by the slowest path technology's single channel bandwidth. The other factors that reduce performance include: - Network conditions - High port/traffic oversubscription ratio - QoS/packet service classification, i.e., discriminatory tweaks that stop, slow, or speed up certain kinds of traffic contrary to the principles of net neutrality - Packet forwarding rate compared to physical link speed - Network gear, client, and server tuning and (mis)configuration - Signal booster/repeater latency - And too many more to enumerate exhaustively As such, point-to-point local- and internet-spanning configuration troubleshooting and optimization is best decided empirically through repeated experimentation, sometimes assisted by netadmin tools when there is access to intermediary infrastructure. reply Hikikomori 2 hours agorootparentI wasn't enumerating all sources of latency. I wrote largely, as after some amount of distance all the other factors are not really relevant in a normally functioning network (one without extreme congestion). reply Fade_Dance 9 hours agorootparentprevmaybe they mean solid open source netcode?

Customers believed the accounts were backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. CNBC spoke to a dozen customers caught in the predicament, people who have lost sums ranging from $7,000 to well over $200,000. While there's not yet a full tally of those left shortchanged, at fintech Yotta alone, 13,725 customers say they are being offered a combined $11.8 million despite putting in $64.9 million in deposits. Oscar WongMomentGetty Images For 15 years, former Texas schoolteacher Kayla Morris put every dollar she could save into a home for her growing family. When she and her husband sold the house last year, they stowed away the proceeds, $282,153.87, in what they thought of as a safe place — an account at the savings startup Yotta held at a real bank. Morris, like thousands of other customers, was snared in the collapse of a behind-the-scenes fintech firm called Synapse and has been locked out of her account for six months as of November. She held out hope that her money was still secure. Then she learned how much Evolve Bank & Trust, the lender where her funds were supposed to be held, was prepared to return to her. \"We were informed last Monday that Evolve was only going to pay us $500 out of that $280,000,\" Morris said during a court hearing last week, her voice wavering. \"It's just devastating.\" The crisis started in May when a dispute between Synapse and Evolve Bank over customer balances boiled over and the fintech middleman turned off access to a key system used to process transactions. Synapse helped fintech startups like Yotta and Juno, which are not banks, offer checking accounts and debit cards by hooking them up with small lenders like Evolve. In the immediate aftermath of Synapse's bankruptcy, which happened after an exodus of its fintech clients, a court-appointed trustee found that up to $96 million of customer funds was missing. The mystery of where those funds are hasn't been solved, despite six months of court-mediated efforts between the four banks involved. That's mostly because the estate of Andreessen Horowitz-backed Synapse doesn't have the money to hire an outside firm to perform a full reconciliation of its ledgers, according to Jelena McWilliams, the bankruptcy trustee. But what is now clear is that regular Americans like Morris are bearing the brunt of that shortfall and will receive little or nothing from savings accounts that they believed were backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The losses demonstrate the risks of a system where customers didn't have direct relationships with banks, instead relying on startups to keep track of their funds, who offloaded that responsibility onto middlemen like Synapse. Zach Jacobs, 37, of Tampa, Florida helped form a group called Fight For Our Funds after losing more than $94,000 that he had in a fintech savings account called Yotta. Courtesy: Zach Jacobs 'Reverse bank robbery' There are thousands of others like Morris. While there's not yet a full tally of those left shortchanged, at Yotta alone, 13,725 customers say they are being offered a combined $11.8 million despite putting in $64.9 million in deposits, according to figures shared by Yotta co-founder and CEO Adam Moelis. CNBC spoke to a dozen customers caught in this predicament, people who are owed sums ranging from $7,000 to well over $200,000. From FedEx drivers to small business owners, teachers to dentists, they described the loss of years of savings after turning to fintechs like Yotta for the higher interest rates on offer, for innovative features or because they were turned away from traditional banks. One Yotta customer, Zach Jacobs, logged onto Evolve's website on Nov. 4 to find he was getting back just $128.68 of the $94,468.92 he had deposited — and he decided to act.

Courtesy: Zach Jacobs The 37-year-old Tampa, Florida-based business owner began organizing with other victims online, creating a board of volunteers for a group called Fight For Our Funds. It's his hope that they gain attention from press and politicians. So far, 3,454 people have signed on, saying they've lost a combined $30.4 million. \"When you tell people about this, it's like, 'There's no way this can happen,'\" Jacobs said. \"A bank just robbed us. This is the first reverse bank robbery in the history of America.\" Andrew Meloan, a chemical engineer from Chicago, said he had hoped to see the return of $200,000 he'd deposited with Yotta. Early this month, he received an unexpected PayPal remittance from Evolve for $5. \"When I signed up, they gave me an Evolve routing and account number,\" Meloan said. \"Now they're saying they only have $5 of my money, and the rest is someplace else. I feel like I've been conned.\" A bank just robbed us. This is the first reverse bank robbery in the history of America.” Zach Jacobs YOTTA CUSTOMER Cracks in the system Unlike meme stocks or crypto bets, in which the user naturally assumes some risk, most customers viewed funds held in Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-backed accounts as the safest place to keep their money. People relied on accounts powered by Synapse for everyday expenses like buying groceries and paying rent, or for saving for major life events like home purchases or surgeries. Several people CNBC interviewed said signing up seemed like a good bet since Yotta and other fintechs advertised that deposits were FDIC-insured through Evolve. \"We were assured that this was just a savings account,\" Morris said during last week's hearing. \"We are not risk-takers, we're not gamblers.\" A Synapse contract that customers received after signing up for checking accounts stated that user money was insured by the FDIC for up to $250,000, according to a version seen by CNBC. \"According to the FDIC, no depositor has ever lost a penny of FDIC-insured funds,\" the 26 page contract states. 'We are responsible' Abandoned by U.S. regulators who have so far declined to act, they are left with few clear options to recoup their money. In June, the FDIC made it clear that its insurance fund doesn't cover the failure of nonbanks like Synapse, and that in the event of such a firm's failure, recovering funds through the courts wasn't guaranteed. The next month, the Federal Reserve said that as Evolve's primary federal regulator it would monitor the bank's progress \"in returning all customer funds\" to users. \"We are responsible for working to ensure that the bank operates in a safe and sound manner and complies with applicable laws, including laws protecting consumers,\" Fed general counsel Mark E. Van Der Weide said in a letter. In September, the FDIC proposed a new rule that would force banks to keep detailed records for customers of fintech apps, improving the chances that they qualify for coverage in a future calamity and cutting the risk that funds would go missing. McWilliams, herself a former FDIC chair during the first Trump presidency, told the California judge handling the Synapse bankruptcy case last week she was \"disheartened\" that every financial regulator has decided not to help. The FDIC and Fed declined to comment for this story, and McWilliams didn't respond to emails. Jelena McWilliams, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, testifies during a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Rayburn Building titled \"Oversight of Prudential Regulators: Ensuring the Safety, Soundness and Accountability of Megabanks and Other Depository Institutions,\" on Thursday, May 16, 2019. Tom WilliamsCQ-Roll Call, Inc.Getty Images Winners and losers Things hadn't always seemed so dire. Early in the proceedings, McWilliams suggested to Judge Martin Barash that customers be given a partial payment, essentially spreading the pain among everyone. But that would've required more coordination between Evolve and the other lenders that held customer funds than what ultimately happened. As the hearings dragged on, the three other institutions, AMG National Trust, Lineage Bank and American Bank, began disbursing the funds they had, while Evolve took months to perform what it initially said would be a comprehensive reconciliation. Around the time Evolve completed its efforts in October, it said it could only figure out the user funds it held, not the location of the missing funds. That's at least partly because of \"very large bulk transfers\" of funds without identification of who owned the money, a lawyer for Evolve testified last week. As a result, the bankruptcy process has minted relative winners and losers. Some end users recently received all their funds back, while others, like Indiana FedEx driver Natasha Craft, received none, she told CNBC. Natasha Craft, a 25-year-old FedEx driver from Mishawaka, Indiana. She has been locked out of her Yotta banking account since May 11. Courtesy: Natasha Craft As of Nov. 12, the four banks released $193 million to customers, or more than 85% of what they held earlier in the year. The Nov. 13 hearing has provided the only public venue for victims to register their distress; dozens of victims queued up in the hopes they could testify about receiving a tiny fraction of what they're owed. The event went longer than three hours. \"You can't imagine the panic when it said I was getting 81 cents,\" said Andreatte Caliguire, who said she is owed $22,000. \"I have no money, I have no path forward, I have nothing.\" 'Nothing optimistic' Evolve says that \"the vast majority\" of funds held for Yotta and other customers were moved to other banks in October and November of 2023 on directions from Synapse, according to an Evolve spokesman. \"Where those end user funds went after that is an important question, but unfortunately not one Evolve can answer with the data it currently has,\" the spokesman said. Yotta says that Evolve has given fintech firms and the trustee no information about how it determined payouts, \"despite acknowledging in court that a shortfall existed at Evolve prior to October 2023,\" according to a spokesman for the startup, who noted that several executives have recently left the bank. \"We hope regulators take notice and act.\" In statements released ahead of this month's hearing, Evolve said that other banks refused to participate in its efforts to create a master ledger, while AMG and Lineage said that Evolve's implication that they had the missing funds was \"irresponsible and disingenuous.\" As the banks and other parties hurl accusations at each other and lawsuits pile up, including pending class-action efforts, the window for cooperation is rapidly closing, Barash said last week. \"As time goes by, my impression is that unless the banks that are involved can sort this out voluntarily, it may not get sorted out,\" Barash said. \"There's nothing optimistic about what I'm telling you.\" Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway takes a stake in Domino's Pizza Wall Street is gearing up for an M&A boom under Trump.

The slogan is \"Play games. Win Big.\" Am I missing something? It doesn't look like something I'd trust to put any amount of money into. Looking at archive.org for September 2023 [1] they claim an \"average annual savings reward\" of \"~2.70%*\". At a real major US bank, I was getting 4.65% in my savings account at this same time. Reading the terms at the bottom of the page it says: \"Please note that the approximate Average Annual Savings Reward of 2.70% is a statistical estimate based on the probabilities of matching numbers each night. The Annual Savings Reward will vary from member to member depending on one’s luck in the Daily Drawings and is subject to change in the future.\" [1] https://web.archive.org/web/20230912164609/https://www.withy... reply Junk_Collector 5 hours agoparentYotta marketed itself as a \"bank\" where every time you deposited to savings you would get a free lotto ticket for the month based on how much you deposited. They did this by offering below average interest rates on savings then parking people's money in accounts at banks with higher interest rates than they paid out and pulling some of the difference into a prize pool. Over time (very quickly actually) to increase revenue they pivoted into more traditional gambling. Notably, Yotta is neither a bank nor a payment processor. They are just an \"app\" front end. Yotta's processor went bankrupt and the fintech bank they were working with to hold the accounts now disputes the amount of money they actually are holding to the tune of ~$96M being missing. This will probably be in courts for several years while things are unwound, someone will go to jail for financial crimes, and a lot of people will never be made whole. Some people have called for the FDIC to step in, but the FDIC has helpfully pointed out that no FDIC insured account has defaulted which is the necessary condition for FDIC insurance to pay out. reply rubyfan 4 hours agorootparent> Yotta marketed itself as a \"bank\" where every time you deposited to savings you would get a free lotto ticket for the month based on how much you deposited. The archive link shows something a little more nuanced than Yotta presenting as a bank. The archive link in gp has a hero text that says “banking” and then a few lines down says: Yotta is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services provided by Evolve Bank & Trust and Thread Bank; Members FDIC.” If I’m reading this as a consumer I’m thinking my money is protected but this Yotta thing is a lottery incentive to put deposits into those banks, maybe some loyalty incentive or marketing scheme on top of it? Lesson learned, don't trust “not a bank” to deposit your money into the bank for you. reply Thorrez 1 hour agorootparentShould I be suspicious that Wealthfront Cash accounts will fail as well? What about Fidelity Cash Management Accounts? >Wealthfront isn’t a bank, but we work with partner banks to get you an industry-leading APY, the security of FDIC insurance, and a full array of fee-free, no-strings-attached checking features — all wrapped up into one label-defying package we call a Cash Account. https://www.wealthfront.com/cash >The Fidelity Cash Management Account is not a bank account. It is a brokerage account that allows you to spend, save, and invest.

However, be aware that if there is fraud on the debit card, you can end up with Fidelity and the holding bank (BNY Mellon) pointing fingers at each other. I don't know how common this is, but I've read about it a few times. e.g. https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=164207 Fidelity has also apparently been locking accounts more frequently lately due to the stupid ATM/check fraud thing that was going around TikTok hitting Fidelity accounts and it's hit a few folks it should not have: https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=439500 Personally, I keep my debit card locked at all times except for when I need to withdraw from an ATM. I unlock it, use the ATM, and lock it again. I also have account lockdown on nearly all of my accounts. You can have as many brokerage/cash accounts with Fidelity as you want, so it's easy to keep critical funds in one account with it locked down. I use the Fidelity 2% cash back CC for most of my purchases. (I don't really know why anyone would use a debit card unless they just really don't trust themselves with credit.) Finally, we should all have backups, so I also have an account with Ally so that all my eggs aren't in a single basket. [1] I use the CMA account only for withdrawals linked to a brokerage account I use only for deposits. The cash manager is setup to automatically fund the CMA from the brokerage account as needed. This way I only needed to hand out my brokerage account number to my employer. CMA accounts also didn't previously have access to any decent money market funds as a core position, but they at least have SPAXX now. reply rubyfan 29 minutes agorootparentprevThese could have similar issues with gaps in FDIC protections due to money is being “managed” by intermediaries or because of the type of account. Their fine print discloses as much. As a sibling comment points out, Fidelity is seemingly a reputable enterprise with other business that would be adversely effected by poor management of this product and the reputation harm that would come with it. Among other features Wealthfront are trying to manage around the $250K FDIC limit for you by moving your money into multiple insured accounts - this is probably a new area with not enough regulation. reply georgeecollins 51 minutes agorootparentprevFidelity is very regulated, and large. If something happened it would be a systemic event that the government would definitely get involved. Wealthfront may be fine too, I just don't know. reply aluminussoma 4 minutes agorootparentTo put it differently, Yotta’s customer’s misfortunes are because they are poor and not politically connected. If Fidelity fails, their customers are rich and they vote: they must be made whole. Kind of like the SVB failure. SVB customers were made whole. Systematic risk and all that. SmellTheGlove 1 hour agorootparentprevFidelity’s brokerage business would be covered by SIPC, which would include its cash management accounts. They also likely sweep cash out to FDIC-insured accounts. More importantly though, Fidelity is large enough that you’re unlikely to need that insurance, and that’s really how I’d prefer to approach this. Yeah we can look at 2008 and say no institution is safe, but if there’s risk everywhere, I’ve just got to try and minimize that as best I can. Fidelity didn’t give me any sort of scare that year fwiw.

I use Betterment for everything, which strikes me as a much more legitimate company, but it follows the same model where accounts are \"FDIC insured\" by being distributed among various bank partners. I always thought that meant it was safe if the company had troubles, but it seems not. reply throwup238 1 hour agorootparentI don’t think Betterment distributes funds to centralized accounts like Synapse does, it establishes accounts in your name at those partner banks and provides a unified interface over those funds. You can do the same thing yourself by going to each bank individually and opening up accounts manually, but then you’d have to deal with KYC for each one and their online banking interfaces of varying quality. That’s how they get their $2 million insurance number, since they open accounts at 8 banks and FDIC insures $250k per account. That was my understanding when I looked into Betterment Cash Reserve (I ended up just going the manual route because I’m paranoid). reply KyleJune 36 minutes agorootparentprevI've had an account with them. It looks like in March they quit giving automatic tickets monthly based on funds. Now the app looks much more like a casino, with other games and a separate yottacash balance for playing games including the lottery that use to be automatic and based on cash in the account. Withdrawing isn't possible but it still shows I have a $400 balance. Evolve bank is sending me $0.06 based on my balance because of the synapse bankruptcy. I'm just glad I moved most of the money I had in it to a different bank a few months before the issues started, I had 10k in it at one point. It looks like the drawings are still happening and it says someone won 33k this month. That's gotta be bitter sweet. They won big but probably won't actually collect the prize considering it's not possible to withdraw. I wonder if they are going to have to pay taxes on that prize despite it not being accessible. reply jareklupinski 30 minutes agorootparentprev> every time you deposited to savings you would get a free lotto ticket for the month based on how much you deposited reminds me of a payment scheme someone in Poland described about getting a car on 'lottery', where every month one person 'won' the rest of their payments paid off as the prize, while the 'worst loser' paid twice the price of the car? i was pretty young so i'm sure i'm missing the details reply mimgdoc 3 hours agorootparentprevPrize linked accounts is a thing.

Win Big.” seems to be their current website’s slogan. In your archive link the same text instead reads “Banking for Winners”, which helps explain why people would be putting their life savings into this thing. In the small text below, they did say “Yotta is a financial technology company, not a bank.”, but that was immediately followed by: “Banking services provided by Evolve Bank & Trust and Thread Bank; Members FDIC.” And they weren’t lying about that. This isn’t some cryptocurrency rug pull. They really were operating under the regulated financial system, in concert with banks. It isn’t even a situation where someone stole the money, as far as anyone can tell. Sure, perhaps customers should have avoided the company for independent reasons, like the bad interest rate or the risk of it being an outright scam. But it’s hard for me to blame them when the actual failure mode was completely different and unexpected. reply UltraSane 5 hours agorootparentThe core issue seems to be that a company named Synapse was a middleman to a lot of fintech startups and spread money around various banks but didn't actually keep very accurate records of balances. Evolve bank noticed this and hired a fancy consulting firm named Ankura to reconcile 100 million transactions. But most of the money is still lost in the various banks that Synapse used. The core issue is why is it so hard to use Synapse's records to find where the money is? And the various banks that Synapse used should be able to work together to reconcile the money. I wonder if most the missing money was just embezzled. reply IggleSniggle 3 hours agorootparentTotally sounded like embezzlement to me too. Somebody at Synapse making the records intentionally unreconcilable/vague somewhere in the accounting chain so that they could claim some portion of that as their own. I guess it could be gross incompetence, but the embezzlement story actually seems more plausible in this scenario, especially given the animosity between the corporate parties involved. Maybe an incompetent CEO at Synapse who really believes the vague numbers they were given that doesn't line up well with the other banks' own records. The fact that there was a lottery system baked in that grabbed from a pool of \"cash winnings\" that was financed by the interest rates of deposits at other banks just adds to the opportunities for embezzlement. An employee \"gets lucky\" with the gambling setup a few times with a pot that is non-attributable, says more money needs to get transferred to the pot because somebody won a payout, etc reply anon84873628 1 hour agorootparentThe current lack of collaboration between the banks makes it seem like they believe this too. The ones that had funds paid out already so they could avoid holding the bag.

It very rarely works out that way. Malicious incompetence maybe. This is probably a rug pull in a system designed for money laundering. They can’t figure out where money came from or who it belonged to…. I don’t think that happened out of the blue using standard accounting practices. By mixing non-bank money companies and traditional banking services, you can construct an effectively opaque and ultra efficient system to obfuscate the origins of funds, all without deviation in an obvious way from what looks like standard accounting. All of the best money laundering happens in plain sight within the banking industry through clever constructions. AML rules are just there to eliminate the competition. My guess is that it was time to shut down and the fingerprints had to be burned. Maybe no customer money was stolen, but the data of who has what money and who it belonged to might be hopelessly obfuscated in the process of obfuscation of their primary activities. This is not likely an example of sloppy accounting, but rather of very, very clever accounting and orchestrated fraud to make money disappear out of an otherwise well designed system of accounting. The real question is where did the fraud propagate out of? What was the exploit, what was the systemic vulnerability, and who exploited it? There is a huge incentive in fintech to create “legitimate products“ where John Q. Public deposits funds that just happen to be very useful for money laundering when combined with some other, apparently unrelated activity or similar lever that only an insider knows how to pull. It works fundamentally like a cryptocurrency coin mixer, without the hassle or suspicious profile. Shifting burdens of documentation often have gaps where things can “get lost” and shell companies that act only as conduits and never hold funds can evaporate with little accountability. Often, “unknowing” accomplice banks are left holding the bag…but all you have to figure out is where to repatriate the money that people will come looking for, the flows you know no one is going to come asking about effectively never happened. Meanwhile it’s very easy to take a margin of 10 percent or more of the flows. And they aren’t small flows. It’s a multibillion dollar market. The demand and the incentives are absolutely spectacular. For the most part, these crimes are invisible to the public, very difficult to prosecute, and effectively impossible to garner the political support to even launch an investigation into, for reasons. I hope the hapless victims at least get their money back some day. reply zaphar 5 hours agorootparentI disagree with this previous premise: In finance, you should never assume incompetence over malice. It very rarely works out that way. Malicious incompetence maybe. I suspect it's informed more by confirmation bias fed by the news cycle than actual facts. And Misty likely the rule of thumb featuring incompetence still holds. reply K0balt 5 hours agorootparentI have very good reason to believe otherwise, but I do prefer your view of the world if given a choice. It’s a happier path to stay on until you find it no longer fits your experience. Kinda like the billions of dollars that the DOD “can’t” account for. You ever try to get the DOD to hand you a few million dollars? There’s a bit of paperwork involved. Accounting is not hit or miss, and it’s not exactly an unexplored frontier. Its a pretty safe bet that when a well funded, fully staffed organization “can’t” account for some amount of money, it’s because someone along that path wanted it to be that way, or was negligent in such a way that it is equivalent to intent. To clarify, I’m not maligning the DOD here. It’s just their way of saying “you don’t need to know.” Overall, the DOD is a great business partner, and I would recommend anyone with relevant high quality services to look into contracting with them. Aside from the relatively stringent paperwork requirements, they are responsive, diligent, and pleasant to work with. reply zaphar 3 hours agorootparentThere is a big difference between can't and won't. In the DoD case they \"won't\" for legal, and/or national security reasons. In the Synapse case I have no problem believing they can't because a bunch of tech \"entrepreneurs\" who think they can just break into as complicated an industry as money transfers are exactly the kind of people I would totally expect to mess it up without realizing it. Most things are more complicated than people think from the outside and it's way easier to be incompetent at something than people think. That's the whole point of the rule in the first place. reply K0balt 2 hours agorootparentI guess you are assuming that they did not employ an accounting firm or accountants to assist with the design of their system? If that is the case (non-accountants attempting accounting, or not bothering, perhaps) then you have a point… but I doubt that is what happened. It would be grossly negligent crossing into malfeasance, and probably criminally illegal to operate a money business without proper accounting supervision (and accounting is a regulated, qualified profession similar to law) But, if that is indeed what happened, I look forward to seeing the founders in federal prison. I just kinda doubt they ran a banking startup without ever consulting a lawyer or an accountant. reply a_dabbler 5 hours agoparentprevThe idea is that people will be more interested in saving with a low interest rate with the chance to win more than having the higher interest rate.

Capital One, Discover, Ally, etc. were offering 4.35% at the peak. Not quite as good, but very decent for a savings account. I don't know where you would draw the line under \"major\", though. But everyone knows BoA, WF, and Chase are trash when it comes to savings rates. They don't do it.

And Evolve is a real bank so they should have all the records to prove it. If so then it's a clear fraud by fintechs, but FDIC can't do much. Otherwise Evolve is lying and in this case FDIC can take over. I wonder what is a reliable way to know if in the end your money is covered or not. Trusting what the contract tells you is evidently not enough. Having a \"real\" individual account number in a real bank? Not sure either, if intermediary can move the money out of your personal account then account insurance likely won't work either. reply kasey_junk 2 hours agoparentA very common failure mode is for money to be commingled in an FBO account and improperly accounted for. In that case the company setting up the account is responsible for accurately keeping track of whose money is whose. The bank will require occasional documentation that this can be done and the bank regulators will do very occasional audits, but generally speaking the bank is not on the hook for keeping track of whose money is whose in the big FBO bucket. But all of it is FDIC insured (up to the limits) in the face of bank failure. It’s not insured in the face of the company failure or improper accounting. This is an area where the European regulators are much stricter than American ones. reply anon84873628 1 hour agorootparentYeah, it seems there should be equally strict regulations on whatever entity is managing the FBO. reply hammock 1 hour agoparentprev>In June, the FDIC made it clear that its insurance fund doesn’t cover the failure of nonbanks like Synapse, and that in the event of such a firm’s failure, recovering funds through the courts wasn’t guaranteed.

Where else could the money have gone? There were no risky investments. The underlying bank didn't collapse. Why isn't there a federal prosecutor on this? reply marginalien 11 hours agoprevApparently, the problem is not that the money would be gone but that it’s just somewhere else because only BaaS middleman Synapse has access to the actual reconciliation how these funds distribute across individual fintech end users. According to the article, this is because of „very large bulk transfers“ which did not identify ultimate creditors. I am still puzzled how that can be. If end users top up their digital wallets, they typically send money by means of a real bank transfer to a client money account at a real bank. So at least at this initial point in time it was clear to the underlying banks who owned the money. Apparently, end users then spent money through user-facing fintech apps (I.e., „Yotta“) which is where the problem must have started as reconciliation of funds sat with Synapse only but not with the underlying banks…? It would be great if someone with more background could comment to clarify as this case is potentially relevant to many other fintech / banking-as-a-service offerings out there. reply jt2190 4 hours agoparentOk so as I understand it the flow was something like: 1. Individuals deposited to Yotta 2. Yotta sent deposited funds to Evolve Bank via Synapse 3. Evolve Bank received \"lump\" deposits with no record of whose money was whose So somewhere between Yotta and Evolve Bank the money was pooled and records of whose money was whose was not forwarded. (Note that the FDIC now requires that the receiving back keep a record of whose money they're receiving because of this case.) Synapse went bankrupt. Supposedly Synapse's estate can figure out where everyone's money went, but they have no money to hire an auditor. Meanwhile Evolve Bank says they didn't receive all of the funds so there's something like 90 million that is \"lost\". Finally, the FDIC ruled that individuals had business relationships with Yotta, and those business relationships are not insured by FDIC, so any recovery of funds from Yotta would need to be pursued in Civil Court. reply roncesvalles 10 hours agoparentprevI don't have more context than what's in the article but what it sounds like is they've lost access to the database that says $2000 from this pile of $10MM belong to John Doe, because the company that hired the devs who understood this stuff is bankrupt, and the involved parties can't seem to reach an arrangement to bring in a cleanup crew.

FDIC protection covers more than I need for access to liquid cash and I'd prefer to manually manage my long-term cash well outside of savings accounts.

I really don’t understand what purpose any of these companies had for savings accounts — why not just bank at Evolve?? That’s where I’m confused. This doesn’t even seem like high rates or other perks? reply bostik 33 minutes agorootparentSavings accounts are a lucrative and relatively sticky offering. Many higher-rate savings accounts offer two (or more) tiers of interest, with higher rates applying to months where the customer does not withdraw or otherwise move money out of the account.[ß] The incentives mean that the customer is encouraged to deposit money INTO the savings account, but not take it out. If you don't have a full banking license, all that money is float - and you can invest it accordingly. Your net is the spread. If you do have a full banking license, you can then use some of that sticky float for loans and earn a bigger spread. From what I have learned, small short-term business loans tend to be particularly lucrative, because the default rates can be impressively low. Big banks don't typically want to deal with those types of loans because the absolute ROI is simply lost in the noise and overall they do not move the needle enough to make a difference. ß: you get access to better deals with less limitations if you have enough money to qualify for premier (or better) banking. The threshold is approximately the amount where the bank's wealth management unit becomes interested in you. I've told my bank that my absolute ceiling for any ongoing management fees is 25 bps and will manage my personal retirement funds accordingly. As a result they don't bother me, and I simply keep my fraction of investments at that bank in sufficiently low-cost instruments. I'm happy to pay my ongoing, sufficiently low management fees to them for this privilege. reply matwood 9 hours agorootparentprevAnd evolve just had a huge data breach triggering many business clients to leave.

SOX compliance, if they were, actually literally does say the CFO and other officers who signed off on their accounting are liable. That’s the point of SOX. Synapse itself likely wasn’t unless it was preparing for IPO but their banking partners might be. Their primary partner Evolve bank is not, but it is held to legal standards by the FDIC and other banking regulators and their lack of controls is probably where you might see executive management facing criminal challenges. However everyone involved could face civil penalties. If history had been different it’s likely this event would have turned up regulatory scrutiny on fintech precisely for these reasons - a privately held fintech can basically just fuck around and pretend to be a bank leveraging a poorly managed licensed partner holding the risk and abscond through incompetence with everyone’s money and no one suffer a consequence other than the customers.

So FDIC coverage should extend to all customers if the account was properly declared. reply blackeyeblitzar 8 hours agorootparentprevThis isn’t accurate. A fintech’s own money (as opposed to customer funds) may have low insurance. But if set up properly, those customer funds can have pass through FDIC insurance. See https://www.fdic.gov/financial-institution-employees-guide-d... However this apparently doesn’t protect you from the failure of the third party, which is what is unexpected. If you look at this bulletin the FDIC put out after the Synapse incident, they’re basically claiming they aren’t stepping in because a bank hasn’t failed.

Personally, I find the explanation to be pretty weak - what does pass through insurance even mean then? Does every fintech startup need to also directly be a bank - if so that’s a huge barrier to entry and basically gifts incumbents with regulatory capture. If the money is in an FDIC protected account, it should be safe. It does not make sense to me that they would step in for Silicon Valley Bank’s failure, but not in this situation. One weird part of the situation is that it seems the underlying bank does not have records about each customer and their numbers. To me that seems negligent on the part of the underlying bank. Surely they knew about this arrangement of pass through insurance and the need to protect funds. They should have maintained separate accounts for each client of the third party service.

This is incorrect. It wasn’t an insurrection but also not a legally protected protest. It was a riot. No one has been charged with insurrection, let alone convicted for it. That word has only been used by news media, politicians, and private citizens. The most serious charge was seditious conspiracy but only a few people (like five) were charged with that. Most of the charges were for simple trespassing since most people on the Capitol grounds were not involved in any conspiracy and weren’t violent or destructive either. reply atombender 6 hours agorootparentThe word \"insurrection\" — according to most dictionaries, meaning a \"violent uprising against civil authority or established government\" or some variation thereof — is perfectly fine to describe Jan 6. It has no legal meaning, so nobody can get charged for participating in an insurrection, but that is of course irrelevant to the question of whether the word is appropriate. There's no legal term for many words that we use colloquially or narratively to describe actions with which one may be legally charged with a crime. If you steal someone's wallet, you may be charged with \"theft of personal property\", not \"pickpocketing\", but what you did was pickpocketing. The fact that most participants were not violent is of course a red herring. They participated in an organized insurrection involving trespassing, destruction of property, conspiracy to commit treason (many participants were actively looking for Mike Pence and the crowd was chanting \"Hang Pence\"), and so on. \"I was only at the party to have fun\" is no excuse if the party was an violent, organized riot.

The Jan 6 mob didn't break into an airport, they broke into the Capitol building overtly seeking to perform acts of violence against the government. Not all political demonstrations are insurrections, of course. For example, demonstrations for Palestine, or against abortions, or for better worker's rights, or for women's rights — those are not insurrections because they are advocating for a specific cause, not the overthrow of government. If an anti-Israel demonstration turned into an armed mob that entered the White House or the Capitol seeking to bring about their demands with force, then it would be an insurrection.

The Supreme Court has, for decades, been carving down regulatory powers to only exactly cover explicit, specific, literal interpretations of confessional law, so now we get thousands of potential cases that amount to \"Stop touching the customer's money\" \"I'm not touching it, the atoms in my hand are getting close enough to the money to affect it with atomic forces, but nothing can be truly described as touching anything, if you think about it.\" Solid fundamental rules don't work if the Court takes every possible chance to redefine every single term to make them not apply. reply UltraSane 3 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately Government regulations are almost never proactive, always reactive.

That’s mostly because the estate of Andreessen Horowitz-backed Synapse doesn’t have the money to hire an outside firm to perform a full reconciliation of its ledgers, according to Jelena McWilliams, the bankruptcy trustee. Ok, so they can’t find $50m cause they don’t have any money? They still have $11m that they intend to pay customers back.

I also use Schwab _Bank_'s checking account instead of Fidelity's Cash Management Account for similar reasons. The latter's debit card is issued by PNC Bank and administered by BNY Mellon[2]. They are large institutions, but I have no wish to deal with the finger-pointing when something goes wrong. Whereas at Schwab, I know who to blame: Schwab. This type of specialization or \"deintegration\" seen with neobanks in the name of innovation seems to be a common pattern used to skirt accountability, and it is weaponized against the average consumer's already inadequate rights and ability to recover damages.

The problem is that the FDIC isn’t stepping in because they claim they can only do so when there is a bank failure, not a failure at the third party. So they’re claiming that clients of the third party have to go through the bankruptcy proceedings, rather than just getting covered by the FDIC, whereas most clients are expecting the FDIC to protect funds in all situations not just a “bank failure”: https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center/2024-06/bankin... Another problem is that in some of these setups, the third parties are not managing separate accounts for each client at the underlying bank. So the underlying bank is not maintaining records that track each client’s separate funds. To me that seems odd and I would expect neobanks to track those numbers themselves but also for the underlying bank to do so.

    "originBody": "Riley's Graphics library FrameWork Build statuses A cross-platform lightweight single-header very simple-to-use window abstraction library for creating graphics Libraries or simple graphical programs. Written in pure C99. About RGFW is a free multi-platform single-header very simple-to-use window abstraction framework for creating graphics Libraries or simple graphical programs. it is meant to be used as a very small and flexible alternative library to GLFW. The window backend supports XLib (UNIX), Cocoas (MacOS), webASM (emscripten) and WinAPI (tested on windows XP, 10 and 11, and reactOS) Windows 95 & 98 have also been tested with RGFW, although results are iffy Wayland: to compile wayland add (RGFW_WAYLAND=1). Wayland support is very experimental and broken. The graphics backend supports OpenGL (EGL, software, OSMesa, GLES), Vulkan, DirectX, Metal and software rendering buffers. RGFW was designed as a backend for RSGL, but it can be used standalone or for other libraries, such as Raylib which uses it as an optional alternative backend. RGFW is multi-paradigm, By default RGFW uses a flexible event system, similar to that of SDL, however you can use callbacks if you prefer that method. This library is single header and portable (written in C99 in mind) is very small compared to other libraries only depends on system API libraries, Winapi, X11, Cocoa lets you create a window with a graphics context (OpenGL, Vulkan or DirectX) and manage the window and its events only with a few function calls This library does not Handle any rendering for you (other than creating your graphics context) do anything above the bare minimum in terms of functionality Officially tested Platforms Linux Raspberry PI OS Windows, (XP, Windows 10, 11, ReactOS) MacOS, (10.13, 10.14, 14.5) (x86_64) HTML5 (webasm / Emscripten) Supported GUI libraries A list of GUI libraries that can be used with RGFW can be found on the RGFW wiki here examples The examples can also run in your browser with emscripten compiling The examples can be compiled by using make debug, which compiles them in debug mode and then runs them or make which simply compiles them. The dx11 example has its own Makefile functions because it is Windows only, those include make DX11 and make debugDX11 You can do CC=compiler to specify a specific compiler Tested and supported compilers include, gcc, clang, [x86_64 / i686-w64]-w64-mingw32-gcc, cl (linux AND windows) tcc has also been tested but work on linux only basic A basic example can be found in examples/basic, it includes a basic OpenGL example of just about all of RGFW's functionalities. events The event example can be found in examples/events, it shows all the events and the data they send. callbacks The callback example can be found in examples/callbacks, it shows all the events and the data they send, but processed with callbacks instead. dx11 examples/dx11 is a minimalistic example of the use of DirectX with RGFW gl33 examples/gl33 is a minimalistic example of the use of OpenGL 3.3 with RGFW, this example was made by AICDG gles2 examples/gles2 is a minimalistic example of the use of OpenGL ES 2 with RGFW vk10 examples/vk10 is a minimalistic example of the use of Vulkan with RGFW, this example was made by AICDG It also includes examples/vk10/RGFW_vulkan.h which can be used to create a basic vulkan context for RGFW. basic A basic example can be found in examples/basic, it includes a basic OpenGL example of just about all of RGFW's functionalities. buff examples/buffer is an example that shows how you can use software rendering with RGFW using RGFW_BUFFER mode which allows you to render directly to the window's draw buffer. PortableGL examples/PortableGL is an example that shows how you'd use RGFW with portablegl.h. first person camera examples/first-person-camera is an example that shows how you'd make a game with a first person camera with RGFW a very simple example #define RGFW_IMPLEMENTATION #include \"RGFW.h\" u8 icon[4 * 3 * 3] = {0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF}; void keyfunc(RGFW_window* win, u32 keycode, char keyName[16], u8 lockState, u8 pressed) { printf(\"this is probably early\"); } int main() { RGFW_window* win = RGFW_createWindow(\"name\", RGFW_RECT(500, 500, 500, 500), (u64)RGFW_CENTER); RGFW_window_setIcon(win, icon, RGFW_AREA(3, 3), 4); RGFW_setKeyCallback(keyfunc); // you can use callbacks like this if you want i32 running = 1; while (running) { while (RGFW_window_checkEvent(win)) { // or RGFW_window_checkEvents(); if you only want callbacks if (win->event.type == RGFW_quit || RGFW_isPressed(win, RGFW_Escape)) { running = 0; break; } if (win->event.type == RGFW_keyPressed) // this is the 'normal' way of handling an event printf(\"This is probably late\"); } glClearColor(0xFF / 255.0f, 0XFF / 255.0f, 0xFF / 255.0f, 0xFF / 255.0f); glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT); RGFW_window_swapBuffers(win); } RGFW_window_close(win); } linux : gcc main.c -lX11 -lXcursor -lGL windows : gcc main.c -lopengl32 -lshell32 -lgdi32 macos : gcc main.c -framework Foundation -framework AppKit -framework OpenGL -framework CoreVideo Documentation There is a lot of in-header-documentation, but more documentation can be found at https://colleagueriley.github.io/RGFW/docs/index.html If you wish to build the documentation yourself, there is also a Doxygen file attached.

You can still typedef those to i32, i64 shortcuts etc, but I would try to avoid this in libraries since it might collide with user typedefs of the same name - or at least try to avoid it in the public API declarations. reply colleagueRiley 2 hours agorootparentI use those by default although I read that MSVC's support for those are iffy.

AFAIK the STB headers are on C89 mainly because nothings likes to use VC6 as C IDE. E.g. if you depend on other C99 features anyway, including stdint.h is fine, also on MSVC.

I just roll my own for this because I don't need all the functionality, and generally find such cross-platform libraries to only really test on Linux, and it's too much of a hassle. reply colleagueRiley 2 hours agorootparentYes, because MSVC may or may not have stdint.h reply Conscat 2 hours agoparentprevI'm not sure that issue would be caught by ordinary testing. It will implicitly cast into long long, so it might make little or no difference in this case. reply eska 2 hours agorootparentA lot of people use i64 in the global namespace, so this will affect later code.

C has super nice and simple modularization via the classical .h/.c split which ensures fast compilation, proper encapsulation, no instruction bloat via creating multiple instances for all functions. reply tredre3 2 hours agoparent> no instruction bloat via creating multiple instances for all functions. This makes me think that you're using single-header libraries wrong. These kind of libraries usually require you to do something special prior to including it to get the actual code and you must do it only in ONE file. For example, you'd #define RGFW_IMPLEMENTATION before #include rgfw.h in exactly ONE .c. If you need the header in other files, you do NOT define RGFW_IMPLEMENTATION and no code will be produced. reply colleagueRiley 2 hours agoparentprevTry putting GLFW's source code into one file and then compile it. That will take at least a few seconds, RGFW compiles in less than a second. Where's the bloat? :) https://github.com/SasLuca/glfw-single-header/blob/master/ex... reply CyberDildonics 2 hours agoparentprevI can't figure out why anyone would call it 'nonsense'. The definitions and functions have to be together, they may as well be a single file separated by a preprocessor definition. Include the header where you want the definitions. Include the header and use the preproccesor definition in the compilation unit you want the functions in. Done. There is no speed issue here. It would take 100x the C to make a difference and it's actually going to be much faster and simpler to put a lot of single file libraries into one compilation unit. I always wonder if the downsides are theoretical or if people are really doing what I've been doing and still have a problem with it. reply felipefar 17 hours agoprevYou could support mobile platforms as well.

Modern games are expected to work in multi-monitor setups and render in “borderless windowed” mode, so you can alt-tab out to multitask, or have a comms overlay. Single monitor single process gaming still happens, but a good 85% of setups (according to the Steam Hardware Survey) are not that. There are five games I know or that actually handle multimonitor natively of the hundreds I’ve played. So we need some form of cooperative multitasking for graphics with the window manager. reply 1oooqooq 2 hours agorootparentModern good games are not expected to \"render in “borderless windowed” mode, so you can alt-tab out to multitask\" Really bad games with slow multiplayer match making lobby and tiresome repetitive gameplay and bad UX where you need to look most of the actual game information on a fan wiki, or triple A games where you have to login and enter credit card information on a \"launcher\"... those are the ones you expect to \"render in “borderless windowed” mode, so you can alt-tab out to multitask\". Good riddance. reply ori_b 11 hours agorootparentprevYou just described X11's DRI (direct rendering infrastructure). https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Rendering_Infrastruct... reply Longhanks 8 hours agorootparentprevX11 is utterly broken for multi-monitor setups with different resolutions at different scales (e. g. builtin laptop screen @1.25x, external display at 1x or some variation of that). With high resolution screens (e g. 4k at only 27\"), that setup is not uncommon anymore. (Wayland is broken in very many other ways, though, so you trade one evil for... 5 others). reply uecker 2 hours agorootparentX was a very well designed system IMHO that could be evolved via extensions (e.g. how compositing was added etc.). It is sad that few people work on it anymore to fix such issues. reply alwayslikethis 6 hours agorootparentprevWayland's scaling for 1.25x and even 1.5x is not so great either, though it is slowly going in the right direction with wp-fractional-scale-v1 reply themerone 14 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you expect from an alternative? reply colleagueRiley 5 hours agorootparent- Better API design - Not being experimental after 11 years I think that Wayland actually has some steps in the right direction, but overall I don't think it's actually a very good alternative. It's way more low-level than X11 and a lot of higher level features, like window decorations, are not even officially supported. reply amjoshuamichael 16 hours agoparentprevYeah, I've been looking for a minimal SDL alternative for a long time and I was really excited reading through this as that solution, but the lack of Wayland support is a huge dealbreaker for me. Are there any good minimal windowing utilities that support Wayland? SDL does a lot I don't need and I try to maintain minimal dependencies. I suppose I could just use glfw & libsoundio, haven't tried that yet. reply colleagueRiley 15 hours agorootparentAs far as I know, RGFW is the only minimal windowing of its kind. I guess I would suggest either targeting XWayland or using GLFW. The Wayland API itself also really sucks to work with, even more so than Xlib.... But, RGFW's Wayland support will probably be improved in the future. :) reply nextaccountic 8 hours agorootparentprevRust has a lot of those small libs, my favorite is miniquad https://crates.io/crates/miniquad reply Sharlin 6 hours agorootparentOther alternatives: pixels, minifb, softbuffer. reply colleagueRiley 5 hours agorootparentSure, but none of these are true alternatives because they are missing a lot of features that libraries like GLFW or RGFW have. (They may be good alternatives for certain use-cases) reply Sharlin 3 hours agorootparentOh, just based on the README I assumed RGFW was more minimal than it actually is. reply colleagueRiley 2 hours agorootparentMinimal refers to the code itself. GLFW's codebase is ~10MB while RGFW's is about ~300kb. But RGFW tries to support nearly everything that GLFW supports. reply Sharlin 40 minutes agorootparentYeah, my bad :) reply PittleyDunkin 14 hours agorootparentprevGLFW has worked well for me. reply vkazanov 10 hours agorootparentprevIsn't SDL itself is quite minimal already? I mean, it is definitely not high-level in any sense of the word. reply Sharlin 6 hours agorootparentNot minimal in the sense of \"just give me a window, a minimal event loop, and a GPU context/swapbuffers function\". reply colleagueRiley 5 hours agorootparentEven then, that's what GLFW is designed to do, and it's entire source code is still far larger than RGFW's. reply slimsag 5 hours agorootparentprevSDL provides.. ..an image decoding library. ..an audio input/output library. ..a multi-channel audio mixer. ..ttf and rtf font rendering. ..networking. ..runtime shader cross-compilation ..its own entire graphics abstraction layer / API. ..its own shader language, shader compiler, and shader bytecode format. I don't know at which point something becomes 'high level', but SDL is only 'minimal' if you use a subset of its functionality. reply marcthe12 12 hours agorootparentprevWaylands problem is that to use it, you need code generation so the wayland backend kinda hard to design for a header only lib. reply amjoshuamichael 2 hours agorootparentI've seen some interesting work in doing Wayland by hand: https://gaultier.github.io/blog/wayland_from_scratch.html I'd also look at the work done on minimal wayland projects like [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot), which supports wayland well and seems to be written by hand (see: https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/src/branch/master/wayland.c) reply colleagueRiley 5 hours agorootparentprevI just have the Makefile do the code generation, it would be annoying for the user, but they can complain to Wayland if they don't like it. reply CyberDildonics 18 hours agoprev [–] I love single header libraries and I like the idea here of taking care of one necessity well. It seems like good modularity all around. A quick heads up, the micro UI emscripten example doesn't work on chrome or firefox. The error is: DrawElements doesn't actually prepareClientAttributes properly. reply colleagueRiley 17 hours agoparentI'm aware of the errors for the micro UI (on the web), it's something I plan on looking into soon! reply ranger_danger 17 hours agoparentprev [–] The one big downside I see is that if you want to actually work on the library itself, it's a pain to have to re-compile the entire thing every time you change something. Nuklear (https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) uses separate files with a deploy script that combines them all into a single header; I think that approach is quicker for iterating on the code. reply colleagueRiley 17 hours agorootparentSure, but the library is also relatively small, so it compiles quickly. Although if you want to you can compile it on its own. It's also possible to compile it on its own using `gcc -c -x c -D RGFW_IMPLEMENTATION RGFW.h` Nuklear is not a true single-header style library, it only uses that as a format. The difference is that the design is far less compact and lightweight than a stb-style library. I'm pretty sure GLFW has some files that are nearly the same size as RGFW, for example. reply ranger_danger 16 hours agorootparentWhy do you claim Nuklear is not a \"true single-header style library\"? And who gets to say what that even means? reply colleagueRiley 15 hours agorootparentIt is a single-header library in terms of the format, yes. But it is also not designed to be a single-header library, unlike an STB-style library. Nuklear is a full-sized library that can be compiled into and used as one file. However, RGFW and STB are designed to be lightweight and minimalistic. That's the distinctive part of single-header libraries, also known as STB-style libraries. To be clear, I don't mean this to hate on Nuklear, it's a cool UI library, but its design doesn't match the single-header format. reply ranger_danger 2 hours agorootparentHow is it not designed to be a single-header library? The README even directly states \"Single-header library\". How is it not designed to be lightweight and minimalistic? How do you think the design differs from your idea (which is what exactly?) of a \"single-header format\"? reply colleagueRiley 2 hours agorootparenthttps://github.com/SasLuca/glfw-single-header/blob/master/ex... reply CyberDildonics 14 hours agorootparentprev [–] Have you actually tried? This is 287 KB of C. MSVC on computers from 15 years ago will compile C at about 60 MB/s. I'm skeptical this is actually a problem. SQLite is distributed as a single 6 MB .c file and compiles in ... 0.1 seconds. reply jstimpfle 7 hours agorootparent [–] That may be true for extremely simple source code, but it's almost too good to be true. Your number sounded so impressive that I tried with gcc (12.2) on my Linux VM. With -O0, it takes around 27s, with -O2 it's 1m07s. With -E (only preprocess) we are at around 0.320s for the 260K lines of sqlite3.c. Which makes sense, 1M lines/s for the preprocessor and maybe also the AST should be doable (that may be where you got your 60MB/s number from). But compiling is something else. MSVC may be faster here or not, I haven't tested it. A more modern machine (mine is a i5-7600K from 2018) may be 2x or more faster, and running on multiple threads will speed up the build as well. reply mandarax8 6 hours agorootparentWhat exactly did you try to compile and how? $ time gcc -x c -c RGFW.h -D RGFW_IMPLEMENTATION -fPIC -D RGFW_EXPORT 0.42s user 0.03s system 93% cpu 0.485 total reply jstimpfle 5 hours agorootparentsqlite3, if you read carefully again. reply CyberDildonics 3 hours agorootparentprev [–] (that may be where you got your 60MB/s number from) It's not that. I think I messed up and the 0.1 seconds was tcc and msvc was 1 or 2 seconds. Nothing was 27 seconds. Try tcc, even though you are in a VM it should be very fast as a baseline for what's possible. The point is that some people talk about single header files being slow are really saying \"what if\". C is incredibly fast to compile and the slow parts are the overhead from each compilation unit and the optimizers. 287 KB of source code added to a compilation unit is nothing in the modern era. Not only that, but you can just choose to put a lot of them in the same compilation unit and not touch it again. Every time I've used single file header libraries it makes things simple and fast. I'm not going to change them so dumping them all into a single compilation unit is fine. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

The best sgi ui innovation, which unfortunately I rarely see anywhere else, was the use of drop pockets, these are drag and drop targets, small squares that are uniformly styled to give the user a hint that dropping something here is useful. I was unable to find a good example with multiple pockets, but for example: when you see that blue square in the file manager, you know you can drop something there and it will try to use it as a path. https://docs.maxxinteractive.com/books/user-experience-ux/pa... reply dmd 3 hours agoparentVaguely related, I saw an extremely nice little bit of UI on a MRI machine console the other day. When planning a sequence of scans, you drag them into a listbox. But once that listbox is \"full\" from top to bottom, it's hard to append to the end (rather than inserting between two existing scans), because you keep having to hit that tiny 1px wide target between the bottom of the box and the last entry. So someone at Bruker noticed this, and made a drop target UNDER the listbox that's labeled Drop Here to Append. It makes things SO much more pleasant. Best screenshot I could find online: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Horea-Christian/publica... reply mixmastamyk 1 hour agoparentprevHad great scrollbars. When dragged there would be a shadow to show where the bar was. So you could go back if needed. Also the first platform I noticed that you could middle click the scrollbar to move directly, or control click the titlebar to lower. Though those conventions may have been from Motif? It listed wm hot keys on the window menu and had vector icons. Yes, believe it was the best desktop of the era. Would like to see an improved version of it, not merely a faithful reproduction. I hesitate to say modern because it often means dumbed-down. But made for higher resolution would be great. reply reaperducer 5 hours agoparentprevthese are drag and drop targets, small squares that are uniformly styled to give the user a hint that dropping something here is useful. Something similar exists in macOS, but isn't widely used, as far as I can tell. You can create a script in Automator that does things with an input file, and then save it as a desktop icon that you can drop things onto. I have a few of these for auto-resizing images. (Bonus: Because it's done in Automator, you can also have the same script appear under Quick Actions when you Option-click the file/s.) Panic's Transmit allows you to create a desktop icon that sends whatever's dropped on it to a server via FTP, SFTP, S3, Google Drive, or a dozen other methods. reply gigatexal 15 hours agoprevHow did we have this at one point but now we have gnome and it’s single threaded , bad extensions take down the whole session desktop manager? reply 1oooqooq 3 hours agoparentgnome was hijacked long ago to undermine linux adoption.

Also keep in mind IRIX (and most classic desktops) assumed 72 DPI displays rather than 96 DPI displays. That means when you view a screenshot or render them unadjusted they look 75% the size they did back in the day. Still plenty denser in many ways... just not as much as loading it up on a modern \"96 DPI is 100%\" screen would imply. reply mixmastamyk 21 minutes agorootparentI miss real window borders that you could see and drag—what a concept. reply spookie 14 hours agorootparentprevThis. The very reason I use KDE (I have tried tiling wm's, and they are horrible if I use my drawing tablet, which I use a LOT), then customize it in a way to minimize wasted space (taskbar on the left, take out window borders padding, etc). Then I go and enable compact look on firefox, take out a bunch of useless icons for things I don't use, and bam my 4K screen is able to accommodate all my work. Even though I do still use 125% DPI scale, not via KDE mind you, because I love eyes. And even then, it still looks slick and modern. It's crazy how much space we waste with flat design on desktop. Crazyyy. reply DrPhish 8 hours agorootparentOut of curiosity, what was the showstopper on dwm? reply mhd 4 hours agorootparentprevOpenLook would like to have a word about those corners… (But yes, in general it's all custom \"cards\" and list views. HTML didn't allow a good set of GUI widgets, so people adapted, and now the cruel circle has closed with desktop UIs being \"informed\" by web and mobile views) reply taeric 16 hours agorootparentprevFunny, I'll have to look when back at a computer in a few days. I don't recall the padding being that bad. Granted... I do largely use it as an emacs machine. I'm sure that colors what I notice. reply AnimalMuppet 18 hours agoparentprevWell, they didn't serve you ads on the start menu... reply Fnoord 16 hours agorootparentThey did (sort of). They were called demos and trials. But there was no DRM. FlexLM was easy to crack. The WWW was largely plaintext. I sadly fried my Octane 2 at some point (and got my Indy's, DS10L Mac Pro G5 (also RIP and Suns to the garbage waste disposal). The Octane 2 specifically was also using a lot of Watt. But it was fun to play with, and of course it ran IRIX ;) (I still remember how good the audio card in the Indy was compared to my PC's.) I noticed other day prices are still high on eBay. Better off buying recent enterprise stuff (mind the Watts though). One funny thing to note is SGI completely missed out on the AI era and boom. reply h4ck_th3_pl4n3t 11 hours agoprevI'm a little confused of what the current state of the project is. The Photo Gallery [1] features a couple of installations, running on 4k screen hardware and a Xeon X5690 as it seems, but is still based on CentOS from 2004 and running a Linux 4.18 kernel? Do they have compilation problems or kernel mod problems, or that they need to port their display server and kernel mods to newer APIs in the upstream kernel?

Sadly this is closed source and only amd64 Linux binaries are available.. reply bitwize 17 hours agoprevThe name makes me think of Holomaxx Technologies (styled as holoMaXx technologies), the vanity DBA of one Ilarion Bilynsky, also known as SsZERO. SsZERO was a squirrely guy with an interesting USENET presence in the late nineties. At first he was a bit like the later Imari Stevenson: a spoiled, videogame-obsessed teenager whose confidence far exceeded his competence. He promised the Holomaxx Ultimate Video Game Project or UVGP, a kickass game console that would beat all others and even feature AGI, to everyone on rec.games.programmer and several other newsgroups, and became quite truculent, to the point of rudeness, when actual game devs replied with constructive criticism. He accused them all of \"thinking linearly\", as opposed to his own \"dimensional thinking\". This was a TimeCube-like epistemology of Ilarion's creation, under which a circle can be a straight line at the same time, if you rotate it by 90 degrees, given by 90(n) so 90(45) would be a line at a 45-degree angle, that still had the properties of the original circle. It was also critical to how the UVGP worked, as it would possess \"dimensional logic\" and a \"dimensional information crossover\" or DFX. If you note that \"information\" begins with I and not with F, well, you're just not thinking dimensionally my friend. Needless to say the UVGP never came to fruition, or else it exists in a higher dimension us linear thinkers just can't comprehend. Ilarion would then pivot Holomaxx into a reseller of computer and audiophile parts (thousand-dollar speaker wires and the like), as well as a bespoke web development company (I think they claimed Kazaa as a client). They are most famous, however, for unsuccessfully suing Microsoft and Yahoo! because the spam filters at those two providers filtered out correspondence originating from Holomaxx as spam. The case of Holomaxx Techs. v. Microsoft is cited in case law concerning the reach of the CAN-SPAM Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, in terms of how much discretion a provider has in filtering communications going over their network that are, in the provider's determination, harmful. I don't know where I'm going with this except to say that until I dived in and checked out the authorship, I wondered if Ilarion were involved with this desktop project. It sounds like the sort of thing he might get involved with, especially since SGI was synonymous with \"kickass computing power\" among gamers in the 90s.
