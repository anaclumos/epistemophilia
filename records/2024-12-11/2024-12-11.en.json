Judge Rejects Sale of Infowars to The Onion The Onion’s bid for the conspiracy website was supported by the families of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting and a nonprofit focused on ending gun violence. Listen to this article · 5:12 min Learn more Share full article 79 Within hours of The Onion saying in November that it had won a bankruptcy auction to acquire Infowars, a bankruptcy judge halted the deal. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times By Benjamin Mullin and Elizabeth Williamson Published Dec. 10, 2024 Updated Dec. 11, 2024, 3:52 a.m. ET A judge late Tuesday night said he would not approve the sale of Infowars, the website founded by the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, to the Chicago-based satirical publication The Onion, prolonging a messy tug of war between two high-profile suitors. The ruling, by Judge Christopher M. Lopez in federal bankruptcy court in Houston, poses a roadblock for The Onion’s plan to take possession of the Infowars site and its associated assets after it won an auction last month. The Onion’s bid was backed by the families of the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting, who in 2022 won a $1.4 billion defamation lawsuit against Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones spent years claiming that the 2012 school shooting was a hoax and that victims’ family members were actors complicit in the plot. The Onion has said that it wants to turn Infowars into a satirical site mocking the kind of conspiracy theories that Mr. Jones spreads. Judge Lopez’s ruling put the fate of Infowars in limbo. He instructed a court-appointed trustee, Christopher Murray, to come up with an alternative resolution, though it was not immediately clear what approach Mr. Murray would take. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ben Collins, the chief executive of Global Tetrahedron, The Onion’s parent company, said the publication was “deeply disappointed” by Tuesday’s decision. He added that The Onion would “continue to seek a resolution that helps the Sandy Hook families receive a positive outcome for the horror they endured,” adding that the company would continue its pursuit of Infowars in the coming weeks.

That would be an important piece of information to have when deciding whether the decision was good or not. reply gms7777 8 minutes agoparentFrom the article: \"Judge Lopez said that the bankruptcy auction failed to maximize the amount of money that the sale of Infowars should provide to Mr. Jones’s creditors, including the Sandy Hook families, in part because the bids were submitted in secret. “It seemed doomed almost from the moment they decided to go to a sealed bid,” Judge Lopez said. “Nobody knows what anybody else is bidding,” he added.\" reply NoGravitas 6 minutes agoparentprevThis is the legal pretext, which appears about 2/3 of the way through the article: > Judge Lopez said that the bankruptcy auction failed to maximize the amount of money that the sale of Infowars should provide to Mr. Jones’s creditors, including the Sandy Hook families, in part because the bids were submitted in secret. reply pclmulqdq 13 hours agoprevThis is probably the correct decision. Alex Jones's vitamin company offered 2x more cash, and in the case of a bankruptcy, cash completely trumps any notion of \"giving up debt.\" Especially when the debt being settled is astronomically large and you are giving up a very small portion of it ($7 million out of $1.5 billion). The other creditors are far better off getting more cash, and those $7 million of claims are worth way less than one cent per dollar. Additionally, the auction here was run farcically, and basically seemed designed to create an outcome where the onion gets to buy this website for no money. reply alwa 13 hours agoparentIsn't it a little strange, though, that the system notionally decided that the families are owed an enormous amount of economic power as compensation for the nasty behavior of Alex Jones' media company, but at the same time it's obliging them not to use that economic power to prevent the sale of the media company to a \"new owner\" still affiliated with an unrepentant Alex Jones, who will undoubtedly continue the nasty behavior? Just in order to get cash to compensate them at pennies on the dollar for his previous round of nasty behavior? I have to say, just as a matter of gut instinct, it sure feels like when the court finds that Alex Jones damaged people—at a value orders of magnitude beyond that of his company—those people should be allowed to decide that, to them, there's value in snuffing out his ill-behaving company altogether. Is the issue that there are other creditors who are unhappy with this, who would get paid before the aggrieved families' damages would? The lawyers seem to be fine with it, as they're the ones advocating for this plan... reply acomjean 13 hours agorootparentSelling to a business involved with the individual that lost in court.. It seems like a Fraudulent Conveyance to my non lawyer self (but I could be wrong) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraudulent_conveyance reply pclmulqdq 12 minutes agorootparentThe fraudulent conveyance may have been the move of the vitamin company itself, but the purchase in bankruptcy wouldn't be a fraudulent transation. reply rfw300 13 hours agorootparentprevIt's not a good outcome, but it's also not fraudulent conveyance. Principally because the proceeds of the sale go to the victims. reply ipaddr 12 hours agorootparentThey go to the creditors including his primary sponsor. This is not a bad outcome it's the only correct legal outcome. What you are saying is we should allow a creditor (of many) to sell an asset to whoever they choose at a lower market rate because it's the right political move in this one case. Why wouldn't those rules be applied in other cases.. you can sell any asset for a dollar to yourself and the bankrupt person will still be on the hook for the total debt minus a dollar. Letting a single creditor value assets below marketrate and direct a sale to someone they wanted would be a completely unfair process. reply munk-a 4 hours agorootparentprevThe proceeds of the sale will not come close to the value of the judgement - and Jones has acted extremely dishonestly through the process and repeatedly tried to move value from his company to his parents and other affiliate companies. I don't believe it's a fraudulent conveyance but there's a lot of awful happening here. reply avs733 4 hours agorootparentprev>A transfer will be fraudulent if made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor. If they get it less, later, or more chaotically, or if that was the intent it is. reply ipaddr 12 hours agorootparentprevThey have a debt judgement not economic power. They can sell that debit judgement to a company who collects. They can take the money from the result of the court process and try to buy infowars after this is all over. They don't have a judgement of ownership in infowars they have a debt and the court is forcing Alex to sell all assets to cover the debt. Then the rest is written off and he gets a black mark on his credit report. There are rules around this process for a reason. If you allowed someone who has a debt judgement to just take over a company what is it's true value. Alex could try to value infowars at a trillion. So they put it up for an auction to get the real value. That's the fairest way for all cases. Besides others are in line as well. And killing the infowars brand means little in the short/long run. The real brand is Alex's name. It's not like his audience will suddenly not follow him to a new show with a new name. reply ThrustVectoring 12 hours agorootparent> They don't have a judgement of ownership in infowars they have a debt and the court is forcing Alex to sell all assets to cover the debt. It's a chapter 7 bankruptcy, the bankruptcy estate already owns the infowars assets. > There are rules around this process for a reason. If you allowed someone who has a debt judgement to just take over a company what is it's true value. Alex could try to value infowars at a trillion. So they put it up for an auction to get the real value. That's the fairest way for all cases. Specifically, the reason is protecting minority and junior creditors (including the debtor when assets are in excess of debts). If nobody offered up enough cash to pay off the debts in full and there is only one creditor who would rather have the business than the best cash offer, I don't think there'd be any reason for the courts to object. The big issue is, again, minority creditors getting less than their \"fair share\" of the assets, along with over-compensating senior claims with junior ones outstanding. Neither are at issue here - The Onion's offer paid more cash to the minority creditors, the majority creditor opted into the deal, and the assets are clearly worth less than the debts. reply pclmulqdq 4 hours agorootparent\"Cash to minority creditors\" doesn't matter. \"Cash to the estate\" is all that matters. The Onion's offer carried $1.75 million in cash to the creditors. Alex Jones's vitamin company offered $3.5 million in cash. reply Retric 12 hours agorootparentprev> So they put it up for an auction to get the real value. Except Onion’s bid minimized Alex Jones debt and was the preferred outcome by his creditors. Offering more cash isn’t the same as making a larger bid here. reply coding123 12 hours agorootparentprev> And killing the infowars brand means little in the short/long run. The real brand is Alex's name. It's not like his audience will suddenly not follow him to a new show with a new name. This is absolutely true.

Bankruptcies have all sorts of exceptions like this for fraud, student loans, child support, unpaid taxes, etc. reply crazygringo 21 minutes agorootparentExactly. The intent of bankruptcy law is to benefit the economy by allowing people and corporations to take risks and start over. It's not to let them get away with defamation. So there's a line between healthy economic risk-taking (bankruptcy discharges) and bad behavior (bankruptcy doesn't affect that). reply fennecfoxy 3 hours agorootparentprevNah it's just typical rich people getting away with everything stuff & we'll continue to let it happen because we are hapless. reply StefanBatory 3 hours agorootparentIt does really appear that America's getting her own, homegrown oligarchs. reply NoGravitas 1 minute agorootparentWe've had them for a long time; basically the only time we've tried to reduce their power was the Great Depression and post-WWII era, but since the 70s we've been letting them off the leash. avianlyric 5 hours agorootparentprev> Is the issue that there are other creditors who are unhappy with this, who would get paid before the aggrieved families' damages would? The lawyers seem to be fine with it, as they're the ones advocating for this plan... Nope. Under the rejected deal, other creditors would have seen a larger payout, because aggrieved families are actual two separate groups. One with a claim near a billion dollars, and other with a claim of only a few million (I think, it may be less). As a result the aggrieved families with the larger claim were set to basically hoover up all the cash from the bankruptcy, and the deal with the Onion was to create a better deal for the other families by having the larger claim reduced to allow a fair split of the total cash raised. reply wakawaka28 11 hours agorootparentprevThere was no public auction of InfoWars. That alone is a stain on the whole process. The objective of a bankruptcy court is not to institute some arbitrary meta-ethical standard. It is to deliver maximum cash to the creditors in a fair manner. >Is the issue that there are other creditors who are unhappy with this, who would get paid before the aggrieved families' damages would? The lawyers seem to be fine with it, as they're the ones advocating for this plan... Based on discussions I've heard on this subject, a subset of the families was pledging money they didn't have in the non-competitive bidding. This is highly questionable. They may never receive the money they claim for the purchase. So by buying a real asset on the promise of money they aren't going to get, it is taking money away from other people who are rightfully owed money. If they wanted to do it the right way they could try to borrow the money from someone, but nobody in their right mind thinks Alex Jones has this money or ever did. The size of the judgement was calculated to lead to exactly this conclusion. As you said, the judgement was orders of magnitude more than the value of his company. So you should be satisfied with that. It is not necessary for the funniest possible outcome to manifest in order for justice to be served. Alex Jones will not go away because he has rights just like anyone else, and the legal process must conclude eventually. reply cthalupa 3 hours agorootparent> There was no public auction of InfoWars. That alone is a stain on the whole process. Sealed bid auctions are not some absurd rarity in this sort of situation and I have no idea why you believe they are. reply avs733 4 hours agorootparentprev> There was no public auction of InfoWars.

You at least cannot pledge income from debt that is presently being negotiated down or cancelled. That kind of thing isn't \"value\" because it's imaginary. reply avs733 2 hours agorootparentbut you can pledge the debt itself. reply sarchertech 5 hours agoparentprev>2x more cash But because the largest creditor has a claim that is so much larger, the minority creditors will actually get less cash with the vitamin company offer. The deal was structured so that the minority creditors would get more cash than from any other offer. The only creditor that would get less cash from this offer is the sandy hook families and they are fine with that. reply snowwrestler 5 hours agoparentprevHow is it the correct decision that Alex Jones has a judgment against him for more money than he claims to have, but also Alex Jones has enough money to enter a bid to satisfy the judgement? It’s a farce. reply pclmulqdq 3 hours agorootparentMy comment has nothing to do with moral righteousness, merely legal correctness. However, the idea that the InfoWars brand is worth less than $10 million is a bit silly to me given its reach among crazy (and highly manipulable) people, and the low size of both bids (and the fact that only people intimately involved in bankruptcy procedures knew when and how to put in bids) suggests that the auction process was probably not run correctly. reply pythonaut_16 2 hours agorootparentSo where were all the other bidders offering $10 million plus? reply pclmulqdq 2 hours agorootparentNot there because the auction was run in a terrible way - it was very hard to submit a bid and the due date got moved forward at the last minute. There were rumblings that Elon Musk was going to put in a big bid. reply avs733 4 hours agorootparentprevbut if we launder it through law talking then it cannot be questioned. reply ThrustVectoring 12 hours agoparentprev>The other creditors are far better off getting more cash The other creditors get more cash from The Onion's offer. It was specifically structured to give better-than-next-offer remuneration to minority creditors. reply wakawaka28 11 hours agorootparentThe Onion didn't have the cash. It was basically an IOU from one of the families, which is like saying \"the very same guy going bankrupt is going to pay us money to buy this business from him\" and that makes zero sense. There was also no transparency in the bidding. It should have been a simple auction, to get the maximum amount of money. reply ThrustVectoring 11 hours agorootparent> The Onion didn't have the cash. Correct, it was given up by the majority creditors in exchange for non-monetary considerations (specifically, the moral victory of having The Onion own Infowars). > It was basically an IOU from one of the families This is fine, people are allowed to act against their own financial interests. That's one thing that having ownership means is that you can ruin the thing you own for any or no reason. The court has zero reason to intervene if a majority creditor is giving up their own share of the proceeds for any or no reason. > There was also no transparency in the bidding. It should have been a simple auction, to get the maximum amount of money. This is a non-issue, the trustee was given wide latitude to dispose of the assets in any way he deems fit. reply wakawaka28 11 hours agorootparent>This is fine, people are allowed to act against their own financial interests. That's one thing that having ownership means is that you can ruin the thing you own for any or no reason. The court has zero reason to intervene if a majority creditor is giving up their own share of the proceeds for any or no reason. You're oversimplifying this. If someone owes you $1B and they owe me $2B, and they've got an asset worth $500M, I can't just pledge $2B of bad debt to buy the asset. The only fair way is to sell it for $500M in actual cash. Then it gets divied up accordingly. >This is a non-issue, the trustee was given wide latitude to dispose of the assets in any way he deems fit. Isn't it telling that the same judge said it was done improperly? Trustees have an obligation to follow standard practices which maximize cash flow or at least don't give the appearance of impropriety. reply munk-a 3 hours agorootparent> Isn't it telling that the same judge said it was done improperly? Trustees have an obligation to follow standard practices which maximize cash flow or at least don't give the appearance of impropriety. This is incorrect - trustees have an obligation to maximize the benefit to debtors. You'll see common examples of non-monetary benefit when it comes to wills - a cabinet that may be valued at 150$ but has immense sentimental value may be given to inheritors even if there is a 200k bid on it if that is what the beneficiaries all agree to. You are treating debt discharging too literally like a numbers game - there are other important factors and in this case all the debtors were aligned and would have clearly preferred the deal with the lower monetary value. reply patmcc 17 minutes agorootparentprev>>You're oversimplifying this. If someone owes you $1B and they owe me $2B, and they've got an asset worth $500M, I can't just pledge $2B of bad debt to buy the asset. The only fair way is to sell it for $500M in actual cash. Then it gets divied up accordingly. Except what if all the creditors prefer that outcome to the \"more cash\" outcome? If the way it would get divvied up is $499m to you and $1m to me, vs $350m to you and $50m to me (but you get some other benefit that you prefer), why shouldn't that be accepted? reply timmaxw 1 hour agorootparentprev> If someone owes you $1B and they owe me $2B, and they've got an asset worth $500M, I can't just pledge $2B of bad debt to buy the asset. The only fair way is to sell it for $500M in actual cash No, that's not the _only_ fair way. Suppose the $2B creditor bids $200M in cash and also agrees to forfeit their share of the proceeds from the sale. Then the $1B creditor would receive the entire $200M, which is more than the $167M they would have received from a $500M cash sale. The bid is effectively equivalent to $600M. Isn't that what happened in the InfoWars case? The bankruptcy judge agreed that the structure of the Onion's bid was valid; he just said the auction would have continued for more rounds. reply ThrustVectoring 11 hours agorootparentprev> You're oversimplifying this. If someone owes you $1B and they owe me $2B, and they've got an asset worth $500M, I can't just pledge $2B of bad debt to buy the asset. You actually can, so long as it's the best offer for the other creditors. So long as you can come up with sufficient cash for the minority creditors you're entitled to dispose of the asset in any way you see fit. The Pennsylvania families came up with the cash (via The Onion's cash offer and structuring the payout). reply pclmulqdq 3 hours agorootparentIn your theoretical framework you can. In real-life bankruptcy court, you almost certainly can't. reply vizzier 6 minutes agorootparentHonestly I don't see how this theoretical framework is much different from corporate leveraged buyouts. wakawaka28 3 hours agorootparentprevMy point is going over your head. Pledging money that you will never receive to get over the finish line is not the best offer. You could not consider such debt in any other purchase. Going back to that example, if the guy owed $2B pledged to buy the asset for $500M and the other one didn't even know about the auction, or instead pledged $501M, then the one who was owed less would be stealing from the one who was owed more. The fact that neither of them has any actual money is another very troublesome point on its own, as is the fact that the bidding was completely private. There might have been someone willing to pay 10x the winning bid for InfoWars in actual cash and been out of the loop. Put it in any other context. Do you think a bank would issue a loan whose repayment was contingent on income from an individual who was seeking relief in bankruptcy? Obviously they would not. The court has an obligation to not accept fugazi money to buy real assets. reply rtkwe 3 hours agoparentprevNothing in the order says the accounting of the bid value was wrong it was mostly the form of the auction taking place as a single sealed bid round that the judge seems to quibble with. Counting debt as part of the bid is also not that unusual or weird, banks will bid their outstanding debt on foreclosure auctions all the time to get control of the house and sell it normally. reply reedf1 5 hours agoparentprevI read the details of the auction out of interest. I think it is valid, and in the best interests of the creditors as it currently stands. Interested to see how others have read into it that they offered \"more\". It was a blind auction and the result is clearly in the best interests of the creditors to take the onion deal. reply UncleOxidant 13 hours agoparentprev> Alex Jones's vitamin company offered 2x more cash Wait, isn't Alex Jone's essentially bankrupted by the ruling for the Sandy Hook parents?

Johnson & Johnson tried to get out of the talc powder settlement by creating a different legal entity to contain responsibility and damages. A court ruled that invalid but this type of corporate entity manipulation happens all the time. With the vitamin company, it might be that Jones is not majority owner of it but the other owners are sympathetic to him. Giving Jones' ownership stake to the Infowars creditors wouldn't change anything if Jones is not the controlling owner. This is all supposition on my part and perhaps he is the controlling owner but the court for some reason decided not to include it in his bankruptcy assets.

First-price sealed-bid auctions are a vetted auction system [1]—almost all real estate and corporate mergers, for example, are sold like this, as are government tenders [2]. (They’re not as efficient as Vickrey auctions [3], but nobody actually does that.) The bankruptcy estate is selling the asset. Not Alex Jones. The creditors should be deciding who buys their stuff. Not a judge. (The judge is there to coördinate the creditors, not substitute his judgement for theirs.) [1] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-price_sealed-bid_aucti...

I've always been curious -- do you know why? It's certainly not for lack of familiarity, considering that paying the second-highest bid is basically how eBay works. And eBay doesn't reveal people's maximum bids either. And so between that and the prevalence of last-second sniping, it essentially operates as sealed for all practical purposes. reply pclmulqdq 3 hours agorootparentprevLike other commenters, you have posited a theoretical framework for how a bankruptcy court theoretically should work. None of this is how bankruptcy court actually works. reply JumpCrisscross 3 hours agorootparent> you have posited a theoretical framework for how a bankruptcy court theoretically should work. None of this is how bankruptcy court actually works Literally started by saying I'm holding judgement until reading the opinion. My point is simply that if the reason the judge raised for re-starting the process is solely around the bids being sealed, they're wrong in a provable way. reply pclmulqdq 3 hours agorootparentOh, it's not that at all. The problem with auction procedures in this case wasn't the actual auction methodology, but the lack of notice and the difficulty of submitting a bid. In any case, a judge does make the decisions in a bankruptcy court when the parties disagree about things. In this case, the creditors are not in agreement that this was okay. A sealed-bid auction is a bit non-standard in a bankruptcy, but there should be no problem if all the bids get revealed post-facto. I wouldn't be surprised if this was mentioned in the opinion because it doesn't help you say that the auction was fair in light of everything else (if you're going to do non-standard stiff, do it in a very clean-looking way). reply JumpCrisscross 2 hours agorootparent> roblem with auction procedures in this case wasn't the actual auction methodology, but the lack of notice and the difficulty of submitting a bid Which would make sense. That's not what the article quotes as the judge's reason (nor what you've said). The quote in the article criticises sealed bids. That's mind-blowingly wrong to the point of having substance on appeal. It's so wrong I expressed scepticism it's actually the case, scepticism based on experience evaluating bankruptcy claims. reply pclmulqdq 3 minutes agorootparentYeah, the article is incorrect about that (like I said, sealed bids are very unusual in bankruptcy auctions, but the actual opinion cites the other stuff), and when I said that the auction procedure was farcical, I did not mean that the underlying algorithm of the auction was wrong, but that the procedures run by the auctioneer were awful. geor9e 12 hours agoparentprevAre there practically any other creditors? I would think the creditor owed $1.5B would cause all other creditors to become irrelevant rounding errors as a fraction of a percent. So if the families were to bid $X, then they'd be paying it right back into their other pocket. Seems like just a technicality or theatrics to require them to temporarily come up with cash just to give it right back to themselves. But lawyers love arguing technicalities. reply habinero 12 hours agorootparentYes, the set of Sandy Hook parents who won $1.5B would normally get essentially everything, but the Onion agreement had the minority creditors get a lot more money. reply jasonlotito 3 hours agoparentprev> This is probably the correct decision.

The other creditors are far better off getting more cash, and those $7 million of claims are worth way less than one cent per dollar. The whole purpose of the deal was to give everyone, except the largest creditor, more cash. Sure the other deal offered 2x more cash, but the largest creditor is so disproportionately large compared to all the other creditors, they would have basically taken all the cash and left little to nothing for the other creditors. The rejected deal involved the largest creditor voluntarily giving up part of their claim, resulting in a much larger (I.e. something like 10x larger) payout for other creditors, despite the lower dollar value on the entire deal. So yeah, the other creditors are far better off getting more cash. But to do that InfoWars would need to sell for many multiples more than highest bid seen so far. reply habinero 12 hours agoparentprevNo, Legal Eagle covered the sale, and the agreement giving it to the Onion maximized the proceeds to both of the Sandy Hook groups that have won judgement against Alex Jones.

Like you do see the obvious corruption here, right? reply amalcon 5 hours agoprevI am just some guy who doesn't actually know much about this. This being the internet, though: If I understand, it's pretty routine in real estate foreclosures for a creditor to win the auction simply by bidding the outstanding value of the debt. Thus not needing to actually come up with much or any cash. This gains the ability to use or resell the property however you want. How is one situation different from the other? reply trollbridge 5 hours agoparentBankruptcy runs by different rules than foreclosures (which is why people about to be foreclosed on often file bankruptcy). Specifically, junior creditors are protected, and everyone gets a proportionate share of the proceeds. In a foreclosure, the senior lienholder usually gets the property and the junior lienholders either get nothing or get what’s left over after the senior creditor gets whatever they were owed. I’m really not sure why the creditors in this case did a shady no bid deal… it seems they would have had an easy time buying out the junior creditors and then getting whatever they want, although I’m also not sure why anyone would want the “infowars.com” domain and a warehouse full of vitamin pills. reply austin-cheney 2 hours agorootparent> I’m really not sure why the creditors in this case did a shady no bid deal… The reason is because there were two civil judgements against Alex Jones to satisfy with the second judgement being about 27x larger than the first. As a result, it is mathematically impossible to run an auction that triggers an outcome large enough to satisfy both judgements proportionally and positively. Many members of the second judgement decided to forego any winnings from this auction so as to satisfy the first judgement positively on the condition they would earn a share of ad revenue from the intellectual property in the future. Their primary motivation was not ad revenue or any other form of income, but instead ensuring the concerned intellectual property rests with an owner not friendly to Alex Jones. That is the reason the Onion won the auction despite offering the lower of two bids, because the larger bid did not positively satisfy the parties to the first judgement. reply pclmulqdq 3 hours agorootparentprev> I’m really not sure why the creditors in this case did a shady no bid deal… it seems they would have had an easy time buying out the junior creditors and then getting whatever they want, although I’m also not sure why anyone would want the “infowars.com” domain and a warehouse full of vitamin pills. The creditors with smaller claims hate the guts of the creditors with bigger claims, and likely wouldn't sell for any amount of money.

(For private individuals, such as Mr Jones, some or all of their primary residential property is exempt from bankruptcy, and the foreclosure itself will be stayed until the bankruptcy is adjudicated, and, generally speaking, foreclosure will be stopped if they resume making mortgage payments, regardless of prior delinquencies.) reply patrickhogan1 3 hours agoprevA bankruptcy trustee was involved during the whole process (3rd party neutral). While the goal of increasing money to creditors here may work due to the free publicity, it harms the creditors interests who already agreed to the settlement.

This would be the same principle as those fines in Nordic countries sometimes that depend on how rich someone is.

Court battles like this can be bitter. Perjury is a criminal charge. Contempt is an option to. Judges use the lever of jail time to deal with situations like this all the time (again, direct experience here -- a surrogate court judge put two 70+ year old ladies in Rikers for a month for failing to comply with the court repeatedly over years). Going to default was exceptional behavior that nobody shed a tear for because it's Alex Jones. Edit: To answer your question > How many more chances do you think Jones deserves here? If you're looking to make a political statement, sure none. If you're looking to have a fair trial, there's still steps A, B and C. Even the fact that he had to fight all those cases for the same thing separately is a deliberate step to fuck him. Then the court treating giving the same data in each trial as a separate offense is certainly cherry-picking. I'm not really complaining though because the concept of a fair trial does not exist. Civil or criminal. Do whatever you can not to end up in court. It always boils down to who has the most resources and the appetite for battle.

But I know that \"that document doesn't exist\" is a valid response to a discovery request. Silence is not a valid response, even if the document doesn't exist. (If one side falsely claims the document doesn't exist, the other side then can present evidence to the judge that the document does in fact exist, and that the first side is withholding evidence. If you play that game and get caught, various bad things can happen to you. The judge can look more skeptically at everything you say thereafter, the judge can rule that the other side is entitled to assuming the contents of the document are whatever would be most damaging to your side's case, you or your lawyers can be fined, and your lawyers can be disbarred. Judges deal with this kind of stuff all the time; detecting and blocking such games is a major part of what they do.) reply JacobThreeThree 27 minutes agorootparentThe judgement document does not go into any detail therefore we don't know whether the Jones team responded with \"these documents don't exist\" or not.

The VCG auction is only good in theory. In practice, most people don't know how much they actually value a thing, and when they are trying to play the VCG game they typically underbid and later have deep remorse. That's the most common mistake, but I've seen plenty of other mistakes as well. In other words, VCG auctions tend not to work well because the bidders often don't have a strong enough grasp over game theory nor a deep enough understanding of how valuable an asset is to them, and therefore the VCG usually generates suboptimal outcomes. In my experience, the auction that seems to work the best is the Ebay auction, where you get immediate feedback if you underbid, but you aren't allowed to see how high the other person is willing to go. Instead, you have to talk yourself into taking a risk on being left holding the bag if you choose to push the price up. reply JumpCrisscross 26 minutes agorootparent> VCG auctions tend not to work well because the bidders often don't have a strong enough grasp over game theory nor a deep enough understanding of how valuable an asset is to them, and therefore the VCG usually generates suboptimal outcomes May I hazard a guess that you worked on low-value recurring auctions?

The only thing an open auction does is facilitate collusion.

You can place a huge maximum bid and will only pay the second highest bid plus an increment. It just automatically semi-unseals bids as new bids come in so it looks a lot more like a live outcry auction. This sounds small, but it's a huge difference. Let's I know that some widget is actually extremely valuable, and would be willing to pay up to $1,000. You don't know this, and are willing to pay $80. In a true second-price auction I put in $1000, you put in $80, the bids are unsealed and I pay $80. But with the e-bay system, if I put in $1,000 at the beginning I've partially tipped my hand by bidding it up to $80. You started with some uncertainty about the value of the object, but knowing that I agree it's worth at least $80 pushes you in the direction of thinking it's worth more. This is a major advantage of sniping: by putting your bid in only at the last minute you keep others from reacting to your bid by changing theirs, and so convert the auction into something much closer to a true second-price auction. reply rtkwe 1 hour agorootparentYes it different but it does work to increase the bid which is the goal of an auction, discover the best price an item can be sold for in a reasonably constrained time. The fact that it's worse of you as a bidder hoping to get a deal is actually good for it as an auction design. There's also some assumptions built into these analyses that there's at least two people who have a reasonable perception of the value of an item. Things get massively more difficult to analyze when you start including changes in perceived value. reply JumpCrisscross 29 minutes agorootparent> fact that it's worse of you as a bidder hoping to get a deal is actually good for it as an auction design The point is, in the above example, you wouldn't bid $1,000. So I will bid $50. Then $60. Then $70. Then $80. Then $90. And then, seeing the price has changed, I will stop. And wait. I am willing to pay $1,000. But it doesn't ever make sense for me to bid that. rtkwe 13 minutes agorootparentEven in the eBay example you're betting against their being a third party that will attempt to come in with a late bid so the auction closes before you can respond. If you want the item it's still optimal to bid your maximum and allow the second price mechanism to function, if you bid $1000 and there's only one other bid of $80 (and the price increment is $10 or 12.5%) you get the item for $90 either way no matter if you bid that manually or if you placed a maximum bid. That's how a semi-sealed second price auction works (at least as eBay implements it) the next minimum bid is revealed as new bids come in that are responding like it's a live cry out auction. If there are multiple max bids it's just set to the highest second price plus the bid increment and the max bid is still hidden. That's the beauty of the eBay system it works for people to interact in two ways, as a more boring sealed second bid system and as a live cry auction. The biggest point it falls apart is you need a certain number of people to understand the system to act rationally about it. If you only have people treat it like a live cry auction then it defaults to acting like one. chongli 43 minutes agorootparentprevmost people just don't use ... place a huge maximum bid and will only pay the second highest bid plus an increment The reason people don't do this on eBay is because sellers can have a friend bid on the item to raise the second-place bid more than you're willing to pay (shill bidding). The Nash equilibrium for second price auctions is to only bid the maximum you're willing to pay. Bidding a higher amount leaves you vulnerable to these shill bidding tactics. reply rtkwe 23 minutes agorootparent> The Nash equilibrium for second price auctions is to only bid the maximum you're willing to pay. Of course... why would you ever bid more than you're willing to pay? Huge doesn't mean more than your maximum. Also those shill bids are also betting on being able to perfectly find the point where they are juuuust below your max bid without knowing the actual max bids on the item at any given moment. If they fail they can not pay out but the seller is out their time and any listing fees (depending on the eBay era we're talking about). Conceivably you're still willing to pay your maximum bid the second time an item is available in most circumstances. Even shill bidding aligns with the goal of auctions to find the maximum price for an item. The goal of the auction is to benefit the seller not the buyer's ability to get a deal. It would probably be fixable by making the bid more binding but that's a separate issue you're still paying at max your nominal maximum price if you win. whimsicalism 3 hours agorootparentprevmulti-round or not, they should still be equivalent in expected revenue to VCG - no? reply JumpCrisscross 3 hours agorootparent> multi-round or not, they should still be equivalent in expected revenue to VCG - no VCG is second price, so we're already in a sub-optimal regime with a first-price format.

Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Mail Copy link In this story In this story A message from our CEO Introducing Gemini 2.0 Gemini 2.0 Flash Project Astra Project Mariner Agents for developers Agents in games Building responsibly A note from Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai: Information is at the core of human progress. It’s why we’ve focused for more than 26 years on our mission to organize the world’s information and make it accessible and useful. And it’s why we continue to push the frontiers of AI to organize that information across every input and make it accessible via any output, so that it can be truly useful for you. That was our vision when we introduced Gemini 1.0 last December. The first model built to be natively multimodal, Gemini 1.0 and 1.5 drove big advances with multimodality and long context to understand information across text, video, images, audio and code, and process a lot more of it. Now millions of developers are building with Gemini. And it’s helping us reimagine all of our products — including all 7 of them with 2 billion users — and to create new ones. NotebookLM is a great example of what multimodality and long context can enable for people, and why it’s loved by so many. Over the last year, we have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision. Today we’re excited to launch our next era of models built for this new agentic era: introducing Gemini 2.0, our most capable model yet. With new advances in multimodality — like native image and audio output — and native tool use, it will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant. We’re getting 2.0 into the hands of developers and trusted testers today. And we’re working quickly to get it into our products, leading with Gemini and Search. Starting today our Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental model will be available to all Gemini users. We're also launching a new feature called Deep Research, which uses advanced reasoning and long context capabilities to act as a research assistant, exploring complex topics and compiling reports on your behalf. It's available in Gemini Advanced today. No product has been transformed more by AI than Search. Our AI Overviews now reach 1 billion people, enabling them to ask entirely new types of questions — quickly becoming one of our most popular Search features ever. As a next step, we’re bringing the advanced reasoning capabilities of Gemini 2.0 to AI Overviews to tackle more complex topics and multi-step questions, including advanced math equations, multimodal queries and coding. We started limited testing this week and will be rolling it out more broadly early next year. And we’ll continue to bring AI Overviews to more countries and languages over the next year. 2.0’s advances are underpinned by decade-long investments in our differentiated full-stack approach to AI innovation. It’s built on custom hardware like Trillium, our sixth-generation TPUs. TPUs powered 100% of Gemini 2.0 training and inference, and today Trillium is generally available to customers so they can build with it too. If Gemini 1.0 was about organizing and understanding information, Gemini 2.0 is about making it much more useful. I can’t wait to see what this next era brings. -Sundar Introducing Gemini 2.0: our new AI model for the agentic era By Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind and Koray Kavukcuoglu, CTO of Google DeepMind on behalf of the Gemini team Over the past year, we have continued to make incredible progress in artificial intelligence. Today, we are releasing the first model in the Gemini 2.0 family of models: an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Flash. It’s our workhorse model with low latency and enhanced performance at the cutting edge of our technology, at scale. We are also sharing the frontiers of our agentic research by showcasing prototypes enabled by Gemini 2.0’s native multimodal capabilities. Gemini 2.0 Flash Gemini 2.0 Flash builds on the success of 1.5 Flash, our most popular model yet for developers, with enhanced performance at similarly fast response times. Notably, 2.0 Flash even outperforms 1.5 Pro on key benchmarks, at twice the speed. 2.0 Flash also comes with new capabilities. In addition to supporting multimodal inputs like images, video and audio, 2.0 Flash now supports multimodal output like natively generated images mixed with text and steerable text-to-speech (TTS) multilingual audio. It can also natively call tools like Google Search, code execution as well as third-party user-defined functions. Our goal is to get our models into people’s hands safely and quickly. Over the past month, we’ve been sharing early, experimental versions of Gemini 2.0, getting great feedback from developers. Gemini 2.0 Flash is available now as an experimental model to developers via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI with multimodal input and text output available to all developers, and text-to-speech and native image generation available to early-access partners. General availability will follow in January, along with more model sizes. To help developers build dynamic and interactive applications, we’re also releasing a new Multimodal Live API that has real-time audio, video-streaming input and the ability to use multiple, combined tools. More information about 2.0 Flash and the Multimodal Live API can be found in our developer blog. Gemini 2.0 available in Gemini app, our AI assistant Also starting today, Gemini users globally can access a chat optimized version of 2.0 Flash experimental by selecting it in the model drop-down on desktop and mobile web and it will be available in the Gemini mobile app soon. With this new model, users can experience an even more helpful Gemini assistant. Early next year, we’ll expand Gemini 2.0 to more Google products. Unlocking agentic experiences with Gemini 2.0 Gemini 2.0 Flash’s native user interface action-capabilities, along with other improvements like multimodal reasoning, long context understanding, complex instruction following and planning, compositional function-calling, native tool use and improved latency, all work in concert to enable a new class of agentic experiences. The practical application of AI agents is a research area full of exciting possibilities. We’re exploring this new frontier with a series of prototypes that can help people accomplish tasks and get things done. These include an update to Project Astra, our research prototype exploring future capabilities of a universal AI assistant; the new Project Mariner, which explores the future of human-agent interaction, starting with your browser; and Jules, an AI-powered code agent that can help developers. We’re still in the early stages of development, but we’re excited to see how trusted testers use these new capabilities and what lessons we can learn, so we can make them more widely available in products in the future. 10:25 Project Astra: agents using multimodal understanding in the real world Since we introduced Project Astra at I/O, we’ve been learning from trusted testers using it on Android phones. Their valuable feedback has helped us better understand how a universal AI assistant could work in practice, including implications for safety and ethics. Improvements in the latest version built with Gemini 2.0 include: Better dialogue: Project Astra now has the ability to converse in multiple languages and in mixed languages, with a better understanding of accents and uncommon words. New tool use: With Gemini 2.0, Project Astra can use Google Search, Lens and Maps, making it more useful as an assistant in your everyday life. Better memory: We’ve improved Project Astra’s ability to remember things while keeping you in control. It now has up to 10 minutes of in-session memory and can remember more conversations you had with it in the past, so it is better personalized to you. Improved latency: With new streaming capabilities and native audio understanding, the agent can understand language at about the latency of human conversation. We’re working to bring these types of capabilities to Google products like Gemini app, our AI assistant, and to other form factors like glasses. And we’re starting to expand our trusted tester program to more people, including a small group that will soon begin testing Project Astra on prototype glasses. 10:25 Project Mariner: agents that can help you accomplish complex tasks Project Mariner is an early research prototype built with Gemini 2.0 that explores the future of human-agent interaction, starting with your browser. As a research prototype, it’s able to understand and reason across information in your browser screen, including pixels and web elements like text, code, images and forms, and then uses that information via an experimental Chrome extension to complete tasks for you. When evaluated against the WebVoyager benchmark, which tests agent performance on end-to-end real world web tasks, Project Mariner achieved a state-of-the-art result of 83.5% working as a single agent setup. It’s still early, but Project Mariner shows that it’s becoming technically possible to navigate within a browser, even though it’s not always accurate and slow to complete tasks today, which will improve rapidly over time. To build this safely and responsibly, we’re conducting active research on new types of risks and mitigations, while keeping humans in the loop. For example, Project Mariner can only type, scroll or click in the active tab on your browser and it asks users for final confirmation before taking certain sensitive actions, like purchasing something. Trusted testers are starting to test Project Mariner using an experimental Chrome extension now, and we’re beginning conversations with the web ecosystem in parallel. 10:25 Jules: agents for developers Next, we’re exploring how AI agents can assist developers with Jules — an experimental AI-powered code agent that integrates directly into a GitHub workflow. It can tackle an issue, develop a plan and execute it, all under a developer’s direction and supervision. This effort is part of our long-term goal of building AI agents that are helpful in all domains, including coding. More information about this ongoing experiment can be found in our developer blog post. Agents in games and other domains Google DeepMind has a long history of using games to help AI models become better at following rules, planning and logic. Just last week, for example, we introduced Genie 2, our AI model that can create an endless variety of playable 3D worlds — all from a single image. Building on this tradition, we’ve built agents using Gemini 2.0 that can help you navigate the virtual world of video games. It can reason about the game based solely on the action on the screen, and offer up suggestions for what to do next in real time conversation. We're collaborating with leading game developers like Supercell to explore how these agents work, testing their ability to interpret rules and challenges across a diverse range of games, from strategy titles like “Clash of Clans” to farming simulators like “Hay Day.” Beyond acting as virtual gaming companions, these agents can even tap into Google Search to connect you with the wealth of gaming knowledge on the web. 10:25 In addition to exploring agentic capabilities in the virtual world, we’re experimenting with agents that can help in the physical world by applying Gemini 2.0's spatial reasoning capabilities to robotics. While it’s still early, we’re excited about the potential of agents that can assist in the physical environment. You can learn more about these research prototypes and experiments at labs.google. Building responsibly in the agentic era Gemini 2.0 Flash and our research prototypes allow us to test and iterate on new capabilities at the forefront of AI research that will eventually make Google products more helpful. As we develop these new technologies, we recognize the responsibility it entails, and the many questions AI agents open up for safety and security. That is why we are taking an exploratory and gradual approach to development, conducting research on multiple prototypes, iteratively implementing safety training, working with trusted testers and external experts and performing extensive risk assessments and safety and assurance evaluations. For example: As part of our safety process, we’ve worked with our Responsibility and Safety Committee (RSC), our longstanding internal review group, to identify and understand potential risks. Gemini 2.0's reasoning capabilities have enabled major advancements in our AI-assisted red teaming approach, including the ability to go beyond simply detecting risks to now automatically generating evaluations and training data to mitigate them. This means we can more efficiently optimize the model for safety at scale. As Gemini 2.0’s multimodality increases the complexity of potential outputs, we’ll continue to evaluate and train the model across image and audio input and output to help improve safety. With Project Astra, we’re exploring potential mitigations against users unintentionally sharing sensitive information with the agent, and we’ve already built in privacy controls that make it easy for users to delete sessions. We’re also continuing to research ways to ensure AI agents act as reliable sources of information and don’t take unintended actions on your behalf. With Project Mariner, we’re working to ensure the model learns to prioritize user instructions over 3rd party attempts at prompt injection, so it can identify potentially malicious instructions from external sources and prevent misuse. This prevents users from being exposed to fraud and phishing attempts through things like malicious instructions hidden in emails, documents or websites. We firmly believe that the only way to build AI is to be responsible from the start and we'll continue to prioritize making safety and responsibility a key element of our model development process as we advance our models and agents. Gemini 2.0, AI agents and beyond Today’s releases mark a new chapter for our Gemini model. With the release of Gemini 2.0 Flash, and the series of research prototypes exploring agentic possibilities, we have reached an exciting milestone in the Gemini era. And we’re looking forward to continuing to safely explore all the new possibilities within reach as we build towards AGI. Get more stories from Google in your inbox.

Google is one of the leaders in AI and are home to incredibly talented developers. But they also have an incredibly bad track record of supporting their products.

They haven't wielded this advantage as powerfully as possible, but changes here could signal how committed they are to slaying the search cash cow. Nadella deservedly earned acclaim for transitioning Microsoft from the Windows era to cloud and mobile. It will be far more impressive if Google can defy the odds and conquer the innovator's dilemma with search.

Weirdly Google is THE AI play. If AI is not set to change everything and truly is a hype cycle, then Google stock withstands and grows. If AI is the real deal, then Google still withstands due to how much bigger the pie will get. reply crazygringo 34 minutes agoparentprev> and Google has been famously bad at getting people aligned and driving in one direction. To be fair, it's not that they're bad at it -- it's that they generally have an explicit philosophy against it. It's a choice. Google management doesn't want to \"pick winners\". It prefers to let multiple products (like messaging apps, famously) compete and let the market decide. According to this way of thinking, you come out ahead in the long run because you increase your chances of having the winning product. Gemini is a great example of when they do choose to focus on a single strategy, however. Cloud was another great example. reply pelorat 2 hours agoparentprevWell, compared to github copilot (paid), I think Gemini Free is actually better at writing non-archaic code. reply rafaelmn 2 hours agorootparentUsing Claude 3.5 sonnet ? reply bwb 24 minutes agoparentprevSo far, for my tests, it has performed terribly compared to ChatGPT and Claude.

Google does really well - in terms of pushing efficiency in the community they're second to none. They also don't need to rely on inordinate amounts of compute because Google's differentiating factor is the products they own and how they integrate it. OpenAI is API-minded, Google is laser-focused on the big-picture experience. For example; those little AI-generated YouTube summaries that have been rolling out are wonderful. They don't require heavyweight LLMs to generate, and can create pretty effective summaries using nothing but a transcript. It's not only more useful than the other AI \"features\" I interact with regularly, it doesn't demand AGI or chain-of-thought. reply closewith 51 minutes agorootparent> Google is laser-focused on the big-picture experience.

Bullish. reply dagmx 3 hours agoparentRegarding TPU’s, sure for the stuff that’s running on the cloud. However their on device TPUs lag behind the competition and Google still seem to struggle to move significant parts of Gemini to run on device as a result. Of course, Gemini is provided as a subscription service as well so perhaps they’re not incentivized to move things locally. I am curious if they’ll introduce something like Apple’s private cloud compute. reply whimsicalism 2 hours agorootparenti don’t think they need to win the on device market. we need to separate inference and training - the real winners are those who have the training compute. you can always have other companies help with inference reply maeil 2 hours agorootparent> i don’t think they need to win the on device market. The second Apple comes out with strong on-device AI - and it very much looks like they will - Google will have to respond on Android. They can't just sit and pray that e.g. Samsung makes a competitive chip for this purpose. reply petra 1 hour agorootparentBut given inference time compute, to give a strong reply reasonably fast, you'll need a lot of compute, very rarely used. Economically this fits the cloud much better. reply dagmx 2 hours agorootparentprevAt what point does the on device stuff eat into their market share though? As on device gets better, who will pay for cloud compute? Other than enterprise use. I’m not saying on device will ever truly compete at quality, but I believe it’ll be good enough that most people don’t care to pay for cloud services. reply whimsicalism 1 hour agorootparentYou're still focused about inference :) inference basically does not matter, it is a commodity reply dagmx 1 hour agorootparentYou’re still focused about training :) training doesn’t matter if inference costs are high and people don’t pay for them reply whimsicalism 1 hour agorootparentbut inference costs arent high already and there are tons of hardware companies that can do relatively cheap LLM inference reply dagmx 1 hour agorootparentInference costs per invocation aren’t high. Scale it out to billions of users and it’s a different story. Training is amortized over each inference, so the cost of inference also needs to include the cost of training to break even unless made up elsewhere reply rowanG077 50 minutes agorootparentprevThat makes no sense. Inference cost dwarf training cost if you have a succesfull product pretty quickly. Afaik there is no commodity hardware that can run state of the art models like chatgpt-o1. reply whimsicalism 16 minutes agorootparent> Afaik there is no commodity hardware that can run state of the art models like chatgpt-o1. Stack enough GPUs and any of them can run o1. Building a chip to infer LLMs is much easier than building a training chip. Just because one cost dwarfs another does not mean that this is where the most marginal value from developing a better chip will be, especially if other people are just doing it for you. Google gets a good model, inference providers will be begging to be able to run it on their platform, or to just sell google their chips - and as I said, inference chips are much easier. reply vineyardmike 1 hour agorootparentprevI don’t think the AI market will ever really be a healthy one until inference vastly outnumbers training.

Especially on mobile devices that could be offline entirely. reply dagmx 2 hours agorootparentprevThey’ll care though when they have to pay for it, or when they’re in an area with poor reception. reply vineyardmike 1 hour agorootparentPoor reception is rapidly becoming a non-issue for most of the developed world. I can’t think of the last time I had poor reception (in America) and wasn’t on an airplane. As the global human population increasingly urbanizes, it’ll become increasingly easy to blanket it with cell towers. Poor(er) regions of the world will increase reception more slowly, but they’re also more likely to have devices that don’t support on-device models. Also, Gemini Flash is basically positioned as a free model, (nearly) free API, free in GUI, free in Search Results, Free in a variety of Google products, etc. No one will be paying for it. reply dagmx 1 hour agorootparentMany major cities have significant dead spots for coverage. It’s not just for developing areas. Flash is free for api use at a low rate limit. Gemini as a whole is not free to Android users (free right now with subscription costs beyond a time period for advanced features) and isn’t free to Google without some monetary incentive. Hence why I also originally ask about private cloud compute alternatives with Google. reply mupuff1234 2 hours agorootparentprevThey pay to run it locally as well (more expensive hardware) And sure, poor reception will be an issue, but most people would still absolutely take a helpful remote assistant over a dumb local assistant. And you don't exactly see people complaining that they can't run Google/YouTube/etc locally. reply dagmx 1 hour agorootparentYour first sentence has the fallacy that you’re attributing the cost of the device to a single feature against the cost of that single feature. Most people are unlikely to buy the device for the AI features alone. It’s a value add to the device they’d buy anyway. So you need the paid for option to be significantly better than the free one that comes with the device. Your second sentence assumes the local one is dumb. What happens when local ones get better? Again how much better is the cloud one to compete on cost? To your last sentence, it assumes data fetching from the cloud. Which is valid but a lot of data is local too. Are people really going to pay for what Google search is giving them for free? reply mupuff1234 1 hour agorootparentI think it's a more likely assumption that on device performance will trail off device models by a significant margin for at least the next few years - of course if magically you can make it work locally with the same level of performance it would be better. Plus a lot of the \"agentic\" stuff is interaction with the outside world, connectivity is a must regardless. reply dagmx 1 hour agorootparentMy point is that you do NOT need the same level of performance. You need an adequate level of performance that the cost to get more performance isn’t worth it to most people. reply mupuff1234 1 hour agorootparentAnd my point is that it's way too early to try to optimize for running locally, if performance really stabilizes and comes to a halt (which may likely happen) then it makes more sense to optimize. Plus once you start with on device features you start limiting your development speed and flexibility. reply jsight 1 hour agorootparentprevIt isn't really hypothetical. Lots of good models run well on a modern Macbook Pro. reply YetAnotherNick 2 hours agorootparentprevYou can run model >100x faster in cloud compared to on device with DDR RAM.

Anyway, I'm glad that this Google release is actually available right away! I pay for Gemini Advanced and I see \"Gemini Flash 2.0\" as an option in the model selector. I've been going through Advent of Code this year, and testing each problem with each model (GPT-4o, o1, o1 Pro, Claude Sonnet, Opus, Gemini Pro 1.5). Gemini has done decent, but is probably the weakest of the bunch. It failed (unexpectedly to me) on Day 10, but when I tried Flash 2.0 it got it! So at least in that one benchmark, the new Flash 2.0 edged out Pro 1.5. I look forward to seeing how it handles upcoming problems! I should say: Gemini Flash didn't quite get it out of the box. It actually had a syntax error in the for loop, which caused it to fail to compile, which is an unusual failure mode for these models. Maybe it was a different version of Java or something (I'm also trying to learn Java with AoC this year...). But when I gave Flash 2.0 the compilation error, it did fix it. For the more Java proficient, can someone explain why it may have provided this code: for (int[] current = queue.remove(0)) { which was a compilation error for me? The corrected code it gave me afterwards was just for (int[] current : queue) { and with that one change the class ran and gave the right solution. reply srameshc 2 hours agoparentI use a Claude and Gemini a lot for coding and I realized there is no good or best model. Every model has it's upside and downside. I was trying to get authentication working according to the newer guidelines of Manifest V3 for browser extensions and every model is terrible. It is one use case where there is not much information or right documentation so every model makesup stuff. But this is my experience and I don't speak for everyone. reply huijzer 1 hour agorootparentRelatedly, I start to think more and more the AI is great for mediocre stuff. If you just need to do the 1000th website, it can do that. Do you want to build a new framework? Then there will probably be less many useful suggestions. (Still not useless though. I do like it a lot for refactoring while building xrcf.) EDIT: One reason that lead me to think it's better for mediocre stuff was seeing the Sora model generate videos. Yes it can create semi-novel stuff through combinations of existing stuff, but it can't stick to a coherent \"vision\" throughout the video. It's not like a movie by a great director like Tarantino where every detail is right and all details point to the same vision. Instead, Sora is just flailing around. I see the same in software. Sometimes the suggestions go towards one style and the next moment into another. I guess AI currently is just way lower in their context length. Tarantino has been refining his style for 30 years now. And always he has been tuning his model towards his vision. AI in comparison seems to always just take everything and turn it into one mediocre blob. It's not useless but currently good to keep in mind I think. That you can only use it to generate mediocre stuff. reply copperx 1 hour agorootparentprevThat's when having a huge context is valuable.

So logically it's a single element, not an iterable. If you had wanted to iterate over each item in the array, it would need to be: ``` for (int[] current : queue) { for (int c : current) { // ...do stuff... } } ``` Alternatively, if you wanted to iterate over each element in the queue and treat the int array as a single element, the revised solution is the correct one. reply ianmcgowan 2 hours agoparentprevA tangent, but is there a clear best choice amongst those models for AOC type questions? reply og_kalu 3 hours agoprevThe Gemini 2 models support native audio and image generation but the latter won't be generally available till January.

I have an A.I. textbook that has agent terminology that was written preLLm days. agents are just autonomous ish code that loops on itself with some extra functionality. LLMs in their elegance can more easily out the box selfloop just on the basis concatenating language prompts, sensibly. They are almost agent ready out the box by this very elegant quality(the textbook agentic diagram is just a conceptual self perpetuation loop), except… Except they fail at a lot or get stuck at hiccups. But, here is a novel thought. What if an LLM becomes more agentic (ie more able to sustain autonomous chain prompts that do actions without a terminal failure) and less copilotee not by more complex controlling wrapper self perpetuation code, but by means of training the core llm itself to more fluidly function in agentic scenarios. a better agentically performing llm that isnt mislabeled with a bad buzzword might not reveal itself in its wrapper control code but through it just performing better in an typical agentic loop or environment conditions with whatever initiating prompt, control wrapper code, or pipeline that initiates its self perpetuation cycle. reply thomassmith65 2 hours agoparentprevIt's easier for consultants and sales people to sell to enterprise if the terminology is familiar but mysterious.

That production of output is a form of reasoning via _some_ type of logical processing. No? Maybe better to say computational reasoning. That’s a mouthful. reply nightski 1 hour agorootparentStatic computation is not reasoning (these models are not building up an argument from premises, they are merely finding statistically likely completions). Computational thinking/reasoning would be breaking down a problem into an algorithmic steps. The model is doing neither. I wouldn't confuse the fact that it can break it into steps if you ask it, because again that is just regurgitation. It's not going through that process without your prompt. That is not part of its process to arrive at an answer. reply thelastbender12 51 minutes agorootparentI kinda agree with you but I can also see why it isn't that far from \"reasoning\" in the sense humans do it. To wit, if I am doing a high school geometry proof, I come up with a sequence of steps. If the proof is correct, each step follows logically from the one before it. However, when I go from step 2 to step 3, there are multiple options for step-3 I could have chose. Is it so different from a \"most-likely-prediction\" an LLM makes? I suppose the difference is humans can filter out logically-incorrect steps, or prune chains-of-steps that won't lead to the actual theorem quicker. But an LLM predictor coupled with a verifier doesn't feel that different from it. reply ramoz 1 hour agorootparentprevThe point is emergent capabilities in LLMs go beyond statistical extrapolation, as they demonstrate reasoning by combining learned patterns. When asked, “If Alice has 3 apples and gives 2 to Bob, how many does she have left?”, the model doesn’t just retrieve a memorized answer—it infers the logical steps (subtracting 2 from 3) to generate the correct result, showcasing reasoning built on the interplay of its scale and architecture rather than explicit data recall. reply w10-1 1 hour agoparentprevDoes it help to explore the annoyance using gap analysis? I think of it as heuristics. As with humans, it's the pragmatic \"whatever seems to work\" where \"seems\" is determined via training. It's neither reasoning from first principles (system 1) nor just selecting the most likely/prevalent answer (system 2). And chaining heuristics doesn't make it reasoning, either. But where there's evidence that it's working from a model, then it becomes interesting, and begins to comply with classical epistemology wrt \"reasoning\".

So the frontier models come first then smaller models later. reply coder543 26 minutes agorootparentTraining a \"frontier model\" without testing the architecture is very risky. Meta trained the smaller Llama 3 models first, and then trained the 405B model on the same architecture once it had been validated on the smaller ones. Later, they went back and used that 405B model to improve the smaller models for the Llama 3.1 release. Mistral started with a number of small models before scaling up to larger models. I feel like this is a fairly common pattern.

It doesn't make sense to try to sell the hardware -- it's operationally expensive. By keeping it in house Google only has to support the OS/hardware in their datacenter and they can and do commercialize through hosted services. Why do you want the hardware vs just using it in the cloud? If you're training huge models you probably don't also keep all your data on prem, but on GCS or S3 right? It'd be more efficient to use training resources close to your data. I guess inference on huge models?

If Google cracked robots, past plays show that the market for those aren't big enough to interest Google. Like VR, you just can't get a billion people to be interested in robots - so even if they make progress, it won't survive under Google.

The Detroit automaker cited the increasingly competitive robotaxi market, capital allocation priorities and the considerable time and resources required to grow the business. GM said it plans to instead \"realign its autonomous driving strategy\" to focus on advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous systems for use in personal vehicles. A in San Francisco, California, US, on Thursday Aug. 10, 2023. David Paul MorrisBloombergGetty Images After spending more than $10 billion on its robotaxi unit, General Motors is abandoning its Cruise driverless ride-hailing service. The Detroit automaker on Tuesday said it will no longer fund its Cruise division's robotaxi development and will instead fold the unit into its broader tech team. GM shares rose 2.3% in extended trading. \"Cruise was well on its way to a robotaxi business — but when you look at the fact you're deploying a fleet, there's a whole operations piece of doing that,\" GM CEO Mary Barra said on a call Tuesday. Barra said GM would instead focus on the development of autonomous systems for use in personal vehicles. GM cited the increasingly competitive robotaxi market, capital allocation priorities and the considerable time and resources necessary to grow the business as reasons for its decision. The company will combine the majority-owned Cruise LLC with GM technical teams. Barra, who also serves as board chair of Cruise, said the companies have yet to determine how many employees will move to GM. Cruise has nearly 2,300 employees, a GM spokesperson told CNBC. GM acquired Cruise in 2016. The automaker currently owns about 90% of Cruise and has agreements with other shareholders that will raise its ownership to more than 97%, GM said in a statement. GM anticipates it will complete the acquisition of remaining Cruise shares from outside shareholders by early 2025, CFO Paul Jacobson said Tuesday. GM's current annual expenditure on Cruise amounted to about $2 billion, and the restructuring would cut that by more than half, Jacobson said. Honda, an outside investor in Cruise, told CNBC that it had planned to launch a driverless ride-hail service in Japan in early 2026, but will now re-assess those plans and make adjustments if needed. \"Honda remains committed to various research and development initiatives aimed at providing new mobility solutions to our customers in Japan,\" a Honda spokesperson said on Tuesday. Honda said its total investment in Cruise was $852 million. Cruise founder Kyle Vogt, who left the company in November 2023, posted on X after the announcement, \"In case it was unclear before, it is clear now: GM are a bunch of dummies.\" An early entrant in the U.S. robotaxi market, Cruise grounded its driverless operations in October 2023, shortly before Vogt's departure. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration fined Cruise $1.5 million after the company failed to disclose details of a serious crash that month involving a pedestrian. A third-party probe into the incident ordered by GM and Cruise found that culture issues, ineptitude and poor leadership fueled regulatory oversights that led to the accident. The probe also investigated allegations of a cover-up by Cruise leadership but found no evidence to support those claims. In July of this year, GM announced that it would indefinitely delay production of the Origin autonomous vehicle as its Cruise self-driving unit attempted to relaunch operations. At that point, Cruise began to focus on using the next-generation Chevrolet Bolt for development of its autonomous vehicles. As Cruise's operations were on hold, its robotaxi rivals gained ground. Alphabet -owned Waymo has begun to operate commercial robotaxi services across several major U.S. metro areas, with the company last week announcing its plans to expand into Miami. Chinese autonomous vehicle makers including Pony.ai and WeRide have rolled out in overseas markets as well. Tesla , meanwhile, showed off design concepts for a self-driving Cybercab at an event in October. Tesla still classifies the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software in its vehicles as \"partially automated driving systems,\" which require a human to be ready to steer or brake at all times. In an October earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in California and Texas as early as 2025. SoftBank-funded Wayve is testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, and Amazon-owned Zoox is also testing its autonomous vehicles, which do not feature steering wheels, in several U.S. cities including San Francisco. SoftBank's Vision Fund was also an investor in Cruise, with a nearly 20% stake, until GM repurchased the shares for $2.1 billion in 2022.

Isn't there basically Google/Waymo and then, seemingly much further behind, Tesla Cybertaxi, Amazon/Zoox, and Uber/Yandex? Cruise allegedly has one of the most sophisticated autonomous driving platforms, and GM's Super Cruise (if they share any tech) is comparable to Tesla FSD. Strange that they would bow out. Small anecdote: I visited a GM dealership this week and the salesperson told me Super Cruise was not enabled for test drives. The excuse was pretty weak, like the dealership would have to pay for the service or something. GM might have the technology but they are completely bungling the strategy. Ford just lowered the cost of its BlueCruise subscription by 1/3rd. In an earnings call eight months prior they remarked they made a 70% margin on the service. It seems like drivers did not find the feature compelling and were not renewing. Interest in autonomous driving appears to be cooling across the board. reply ethagknight 5 hours agoparentI’ve had a Yukon with supercruise for 18 months. It is fantastic for highway driving, particularly, we’ve driven it west from Tennessee to Colorado and Florida. Other comments claiming it’s the same as other standard driver-assist packages are incorrect. Totally hands free, no “ping pong” with the lanes. That said, when trying to BUY a supercruise vehicle, the sales guys were clueless, I had to review the stat sheets of each car to see which ones did or did not have it. GM is treating this technology as “surveys say 2% of the market wants a self driving vehicle” (incorrect question) compared to “install on every vehicle as an available subscription, let the sales team earn their way.” I’m sure the tech is expensive, but it can’t be that much more at the OEM level. I also have a Tesla with FSD. FSD is truly amazing but still struggles with edge cases like, my office has two entrances, one is blocked by barrels, it tries to turn into the barrels every time. reply Workaccount2 4 hours agorootparentFrom my understanding, super cruise only works on pre-approved roads/road sections, whereas FSD works just about anywhere. When I last checked my commute to work, the main highway I take becomes unsupported half way to work, despite it being the same bland typical highway layout. I really don't want to buy a Tesla, but from what I can tell, nobody has anything close to what FSD offers. reply ethagknight 1 hour agorootparentSuperCruise and FSD are not comparable. SuperCruise does what it claims to do, keep it up the middle on listed corridors. Most highways and interstates are eligible. I love both systems. FSD is truly almost there for unsupervised, point to point driving. People want to virtue signal and complain about Tesla but it is an amazing piece of hardware being mass produced today.

From what I read about it, you're absolutely right. Down to the point of unwanted veering towards road dividers and other vehicles. reply hedora 1 hour agorootparent> Down to the point of unwanted veering towards road dividers and other vehicles. Our 2024 Kia does this every 10-20 miles on average. You don't even have to enable lane assist. It also randomly decides to weaken the regenerative braking, or switch out of single pedal mode. If you disable enough of the safety features it stops doing these things, but, for instance, that means you can't have blind spot detection that works when you're going over 5mph and a working steering column at the same time. reply jsight 1 hour agorootparentYeah, people act like some Tesla problems are bad, but I've certainly used systems that are worse. Just in a few miles, I've had a Nissan accelerate towards stopped traffic aggressively enough to trigger its own collision warning. It'll also fly try to drive off the road in relatively shallow curves, triggering its own lane departure warnings. The Tesla system isn't perfect, but it is far from unique in being imperfect. reply bayindirh 1 hour agorootparentThat's true. I took a jab specifically at Tesla, because it's generally framed as the \"leader of the pack and problem free to the point that you can sleep in it\". FSD is a very hard problem, and the systems deployed are at best alpha level. These things should be \"hyped responsibly\". reply zardo 31 minutes agorootparentNot paying attention while FSD drives for you ended with a motorcyclist crushed to death under a Tesla, and a manslaughter charge for the driver near me this summer. reply tosser2084 2 hours agorootparentprevYup, 100%. I sorta wrote it off a few years back, but recently used it for ~90% of a 4-hour trip, and it was pretty flawless. It's super-duper popular to bag on Tesla / Musk now because the mainstream news is shilling for the Left, and he's 'the enemy', even though they're the ones that drove him away. That plus, Musk won't bend the knee to the censorship machine and won't deplatform anyone with contrary narratives to the endless lies the mainstream pumps out these days. I know how difficult to avoid the non-stop lie machine, you have to actively seek out actual journalism such as Glenn Greenwald or Matt Taibbi... and X is quite literally the only truly free and open space, and sure it's got a ton of nutty shit, but that's the canary showing you it's at least non-censored. I'd rather wade through a bunch of crazy stories about hurricane weather control and see actual pictures of these crazy UAP's all over NJ that don't seem to get much press anywhere else... but I digress. reply dartos 2 hours agorootparentA lot of crazy in here, but this is the lowest hanging fruit. > and X is quite literally the only truly free and open space > free My brother, you need to literally pay money or your tweets get buried by those who do. > open Since taking control of the company, musk made it a closed platform.

IMO, it's largely because BlueCruise (and all of the similar services) is not sufficiently better than the non-subscription driver assists. I have the option of BlueCruise on my vehicle and it's just not a compelling offer. * It only works on major highways. Beyond actual coverage, major highways are places where the standard driver assists already work extremely well. * It does nothing about traffic around you. You have to be prepared to react. Not much different than driver assist. * It's wickedly expensive. Right now, radar assisted cruise and camera based lane centering eases 95% of my driving fatigue. reply logifail 11 hours agorootparent> it's just not a compelling offer I drive (and have driven) a fair number of rental cars due to travel, and I have to say I feel that way about many new vehicles in their entirety. So much vehicle tech is at best unimpressive and at worst positively in my way as a driver. > It's wickedly expensive We own two cars, 6 and 10 years old respectively, yet I've never felt less motivated to look at new cars than I do now. Guess our part towards saving the planet may well turn out to be 'driving that existing ICE vehicle for just a little bit longer'... reply ZeroGravitas 9 hours agorootparentIf you look at the lifecycle analysis of ICE cars, burning the fuel is the major contributor. So if you drive an average amount with those cars you're not saving the planet by continuing to drive them. In a well functioning system you'd be selling them on to people who drive very little and are old and set in their ways and replacing them with an EV. reply maerF0x0 2 hours agorootparentIn the book Heat Monboit argues the stats show that when someone \"greens\" their consumption they also increase it. For example switching to \"green\" energy meant people stopped thinking about conserving. In the specific case of electric vehicles (and many plug in hybrids) luckily they're such an immense improvement that my guess is that they still have a net benefit. But far from the simple efficiency math, and more likely the user will increase their consumption by some meaningful percent. reply manwe150 1 hour agorootparentI think you mean Jevon's Paradox? Wikipedia claims it has been studied and that the effect is small: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox#Cause I wonder though if the more significant limitation for most people is the value placed on their time currently, so they seek to minimize travel and commute times (rather than minimizing for fuel costs). And if so, does will the rise of self-driving + EV paradoxically increase the number of miles someone is willing to sit behind the wheel in the coming decade? reply travisporter 1 hour agorootparentprevGood point. I think the hopeful next step would be looking at efficiency of EVs, miles per kWh (of course not counting public transport) reply logifail 9 hours agorootparentprev> If you look at the lifecycle analysis of ICE cars, burning the fuel is the major contributor (Genuine question, not whataboutism...) what about the environmental aspects of manufacturing and distributing a vehicle other than CO2 emissions? > old and set in their ways I fear I may be approaching this stage myself! :) reply Workaccount2 4 hours agorootparent>he environmental aspects of manufacturing and distributing a vehicle other than CO2 emissions? The importance of those is a tiny fraction of the importance of CO2 emissions. A toxic pit full of battery waste the size of a small town will not end life on Earth. An atmosphere full of CO2 will. reply Mashimo 8 hours agorootparentprevEVs have a way higher initial CO2 footprint. The crossover depends on car and where you get the energy from. I think it's often around the 100 000 km mark where an EV gets the smaller footprint. But like I said, many variables factor in. reply lucianbr 8 hours agorootparentIs battery manufacturing that bad for the environment? I mean, ICE cars still have wheels, drivetrains, chassis, doors, windows, chairs, electronics, paint and many other things, same as the EVs. The electric motor I can't imagine its worse to produce than a combustion motor. So that leaves batteries as the cause of this huge disparity on day one, that takes 100,000km of fuel consumption to overtake. Is this with the battery tech of today, december 2024? So for EVs built in 2020 let's say, it was worse? I think there is some advancement in battery making, isn't there? reply Workaccount2 4 hours agorootparent>Is battery manufacturing that bad for the environment? In any practical sense, no, it's not. Its a dumb argument pushed by people trying to sandbag EVs. reply specialist 2 hours agorootparentYes and: Current recycling tech is pretty terrific (IIRC ~98% recovery of lithium, misc metals). Enabling the long fabled \"circular\" economy. At some point we'll hit a (near) equilibrium. IIRC, ~20 years out. (Assuming Li-ion battery tech continues to improve at current rate. Thereby balancing out the lithium lost during recycling.) So we'll hit something like \"peak lithium\", greatly reducing mining (extraction) of new lithium. Recycling is much cheaper than mining (both $ and CO2). (I believe, but obliviously can't prove, that sodium (et al) batteries will enable new use cases and markets, complimenting lithium rather than replacing it.) reply logifail 7 hours agorootparentprev> The electric motor I can't imagine its worse to produce than a combustion motor I assumed we're attempting to weigh up keeping an ICE vehicle that already exists - like my 10 year old diesel - vs building building a new EV vehicle and scrapping the old ICE. reply vel0city 3 hours agorootparentNobody is crushing their ICE and dumping it in the lake when they replace their existing and working ICE with an EV. They're selling/trading in their ICE which someone else will buy and use until it's not worth servicing anymore. reply throwaway2037 6 hours agorootparentprevMy guess: Most of the CO2 emissions for making cars comes from the body of the car. It is basically identical between ICE and EV. I guess a modern car body is a combo of steel and aluminium. (Is that correct?) reply logifail 6 hours agorootparent(from 14 years ago, but still an interesting read) https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/20... reply ZeroGravitas 3 hours agorootparentUnfortunately that article is confused nonsense. It suggests that making an ICE car is roughly equal to the running in terms of carbon. In reality manufacturing is about 10%, disposal 5% and the other 85% from running it e.g. fuel and maintenance. It then suggests that keeping an old car is better because if you keep the car for twice as long then the emissions are half per mile, but you don't scrap functional cars you sell them onto someone else. This causes a cascade with the oldest and most polluting cars being scrapped. reply rcxdude 8 hours agorootparentprevThat seems like an overestimate. A quick search is showing up numbers more in the 15-20,000 km region, and that's comparing a large EV running off of a mostly fossil fuel grid against a much smaller ICE (i.e. quite a conservative estimate). reply joebob42 4 hours agorootparentThere's \"Is an ev better than a new ice car\" and \"is an ev better than an ice car you already have\". I think we're discussing the latter, where the upfront cost of the ice doesn't count because you already have it. reply ZeroGravitas 3 hours agorootparentThe upfront is about 50% higher for an EV, so if you catch that 50% up in 1 year then you'd pay back an entire new EV in 3 years if you scrapped the old ICE one. (figures for simplicity depending upon grid and how much you drive it could be 6 months or 18 months). But generally we don't scrap old ones. If you instead sell the old one to someone who drives an ICE car that gets worse mpg then that's a further benefit. reply tialaramex 7 hours agorootparentprevIn particular, grid decarbonisation means that distance to break even moves after the car is manufactured. If you live somewhere that mostly burns coal to make electricity, your break even is determined based on the higher efficiency of electric motors and of the (energy efficient but filthy) big stack coal generators compared to the relatively clean but inefficient gasoline ICE. But if they start building wind turbines and solar farms, because those are just cheaper and easier - suddenly that distance shrinks rapidly (maybe half) even though for you as an end user nothing changed, because electricity is fungible so you charge a car from the solar farm just the same as from a coal power plant. reply notdonspaulding 1 hour agorootparent> If you live somewhere that mostly burns coal to make electricity, Which is almost everywhere in the world. Fossil fuels make up around 80% of energy production. > But if they start building wind turbines and solar farms, because those are just cheaper and easier - If they were \"just cheaper and easier\" they wouldn't need huge clean energy investments and subsidies. I love solar, but don't let anyone sell you on the fiction that your EV is avoiding fossil fuels at any time in the near future unless you have installed enough solar on your personal residence to charge your car every day.

Obviously if you cause one less vehicle – of any kind – to be manufactured, you’re saving CO2 in the short term.

The greenest choice most of us can make is an old, used car with reasonable emissions and that’s fuel efficient. Like a 15 year old Civic or Corolla. Or do what a colleague of mine did - he revived a first generation Prius, flashed newer software onto it, and salvaged a battery pack from a newer, wrecked Prius. reply manwe150 1 hour agorootparentAs pointed out by other nearby comments, that is not the greenest choice (which is to not drive), nor even the second greenest choice (which is to replace your ICE with a refurbished Prius like your colleague), or even the third greenest choice (which is to buy a new EV), but only barely beats out the worst non-green choices (buying a new ICE) and then only if you pay to make sure the car emissions controls and engine aren't becoming rusty and inefficient. Here's an article explaining: https://www.topgear.com/car-news/electric/mythbusting-world-... There are also the caveats you mentioned that the analysis does assume that an EV is actually the greener choice, which is itself a function of a lot of other choices being made green also, such as whether it was constructed and powered with the most environmentally favorable choices of mining and manufacturing, most of which isn't really in the consumers direct control. reply ZeroGravitas 3 hours agorootparentprevThe actual scientist doing the calculations in proper LCAs do include this and production of the fuel is a notable chunk of the CO2 running cost of an ICE car (about 25%).

Just because we already have the ICE doesn’t make it more efficient to keep using it, over immediately replacing it with something more efficient, as long as you then keep the more efficient thing operating until it becomes inefficient to keep that operational. The crossover point seems likely it would occur much sooner if you replace the ICE now than if you wait for its end of life, regardless of the age of the ICE now reply criley2 4 hours agorootparentAnd I think this analysis suffers from ignoring the increased environmental cost of creating a new electric vehicle. It takes 15,000 to 20,000 miles of driving for the average EV to \"break even\" with new ICE vehicles due to the much worse environmental impact of creation. Reduce, reuse, repair, recycle. Vehicles should be reduced first (drive less), reused second (keep using existing one), repaired (keep using existing ones), and finally you can recycle as best as possible. All of this should happen prior to replacement. If you replace an existing ICE with an EV, the EV not only has to catch up with a new ICE, it actually has to \"catch up\" with your existing already made working ICE that has no new cost for construction. That's much worse than 20k miles because the cost of building your existing car is sunk. It could take as many as 50,000 miles of driving to break even against your existing used car. Consumerism and early replacement of working goods has always been the mortal enemy of environmentalism. reply manwe150 1 hour agorootparent> All of this should happen prior to replacement... it actually has to \"catch up\" with your existing already made working ICE that has no new cost for construction That is precisely the sunk cost fallacy though: the principle is that continuing an endeavor simply because it already has been a cost paid shouldn't be done, unless the total continuing cost (including the eventual replacement) is less than the cost of immediate replacement (plus all continuing costs after initial replacement, including the eventual replacements of those in turn). Otherwise the principle says it is a waste of resources. The 4 R's assume that the replacement is no better than the original at the job, which is why I described that analysis as the sunk cost fallacy. We don't have to take this assumption (personally, I prefer to bike over driving my ICE, so this analysis doesn't apply), but if we take the assumption that the EV does less environmental damage over its lifetime, then this assumed \"environmental damage\" function is minimized by discarding the ICE immediately, as any further use simply increases the total \"environmental damage\" caused by the choice of which car to use. This can be seen in computers too, as newer computers are sometimes so much more power efficient then their replacement that they can very quickly save on resources by throwing out a perfectly working computer to replace it with a newer one. reply Shawnj2 9 hours agorootparentprevAs long as your old cars are like Toyota corolla/camry’s and not like giant gas guzzling SUV’s or trucks keeping them on the road is better than buying a new EV IMO.

(In general, because of cratering manufacturing costs, improving tech, and a still low trust for battery health, being an EV early adopter is an expensive option at the moment because even if an early EV is still at 80% functionality compared to new, the resale value is terrible, and I think this plus the lack of charging infrastructure is a big impediment to adoption growing to become dominant in the mainstream) reply jcgrillo 5 hours agorootparentI'm not super convinced about the V2H stuff, tbh.

Tesla might have a point here. Instead of transparently selling a product for fixed price, the dealer system appears based on information asymmetry, haggling, upcharges, finance bullshit, warranty bullshit, subscription bullshit, and many decades of entrenched psyops culture against customers. On top of that, salespeople are often poorly trained on the products and dealerships seem to have an adversarial relationship with corporate, especially around the corporate website differing from the local story. And then the dealerships steer you for whatever benefits them. In 2017 I tried to test drive a Chevy Bolt: Motortrend's car of that year. One dealer hadn't even heard of it. Another said he couldn't get one. Another tried to dissuade me from looking at it by dissing the product.

I hate having to think about decisions I don't particularly care about, so I would prefer to constrain my choices to \"maker Y's automobiles\", be it GM, Ford or Toyota for the rest of my life, so that once I have the capabilities I need out of an automobile there's only one or two choices. I would love the simplicity of the dealer being the default maintainer of my automobile and I just show up once a year or so and they take care of it in a pleasant experience.

They certainly put the old college try into introducing you to the service manager even when you've purchased your car in a situation where you're unlikely to use that dealership for service. My last purchase during the supply chain shortages was actually remarkably stress-free other than not being able to get the car sooner rather than later. I was paying cash. Knew there was almost certainly very little negotiating leverage on the list price. Did a bit of haggling on some \"factory-installed\" add-ons with a car that hadn't been built yet against my trade-in which I got IMO a good deal on. The whole thing took me maybe an hour which is hard to complain about for a large purchase. One of the keys is being ready and able to sever the actual purchase from the financing and the trade-in. It's when people really are stretching their financial envelope (which is common) that conflating various aspects of the transaction starts causing a lot of stress. Of course, it also helps if you've been around the block a few times. OK, if I MUST I'll watch the stupid video about some coating product but know that the answer is no.

I can think of a dozen other similar situations so I'm very sure there are many others I've never even encountered.

FSD isn't even approved for being a drivers aid(hands off, eyes on) in EU and China because Tesla has not demonstrated that it is safe. Even Blue cruise is approved in EU for comparison.

But accident rates in urban areas are likely significantly higher than in non-urban areas, due to higher vehicle density/congestion, despite the fact that vehicle accident fatality rates are higher in rural areas[1]. Urban areas tend to have a lot more low-speed no-injury or mild-injury collisions. When you account for all of those, AVs are in shooting distance of human driver accident rates in urban areas. Also, the accident rates are much higher for drunk, sleepy, or distracted drivers, so to the extent AVs reduce those types of driving, they bring the overall accident rates down much further. 1. https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/Publication/8135.... reply mbreese 16 hours agorootparentprevArguably, it would be a better comparison if the Tesla was restricted from highway driving.

They will also be way too heavy, just as a function of being an EV. Plus, the styling is absolute garbage. I've owned a scout 80 for 18 years, it was my first vehicle. I owned an OH scout for longer than they have been collectible. This new scout doesn't have any styling cues to any prior vehicle, it just looks like if you asked an AI to generate an off-road truck. And they even had a better example, the new broncos absolutely hit it out of the park. Line I E if those up next to a mid 60s bronco and you can see the resemblance, which is why Ford did that in their marketing. These new VW scouts, if you park them next to either an 800 or a scout 2, don't even look like the same lineage. They are just an abomination, and the only car company I'd trust less with shepherding the scout brand would be stellantis2. We've seen how poor of a job they've done with the jeep. And the stupid part is,most people don't and have never understood why the original scout was good. They were an overly heavy, underpowered, and expensive vehicle.

Premium-priced vehicles are more about image than the implied capabilities of that image. Porsche sells more four door vehicles than two door sports cars. You might say that's not a real Porsche in the spirit of a Porsche, but it is what it is.

Wouldn't this be served just as well by having independent repair shops certified by the manufacturer to do recall and warranty repairs, without prohibiting direct sales of vehicles? reply makestuff 15 hours agorootparentprevDealerships also make most of their profit from the service departments which is why they don’t really like EVs. No longer do you need to go in every 3-6 months to get an oil change, belt replacement, spark plugs, etc. reply bluGill 15 hours agorootparentOil changes are a minority ofincome and the rest is far cars old enough that the owner is going to a third party mechanic. reply Loudergood 4 hours agorootparentThey're a huge opportunity to upsell though. Especially to people who are likely to get out of warranty work done by the dealer. reply dangus 13 hours agorootparentprev1. There are still service items on a Tesla that are relatively frequent. Tires rotated every 6,400 miles, brake calipers cleaned and lubricated yearly for northern climates with salted roads, cabin air filter changed every 2 years, and two other service items every 4 years. 2. This is technically a tangent to the issue at hand. If Tesla was a gasoline vehicle startup they would have the same incentives to avoid dealership franchises, perhaps an even stronger incentive. 3. The fact that vehicle service is the most profitable part of the business is a great argument for the dealership model. Tesla owning their own service centers means that they are directly incentivized not to fix reliability problems in their vehicles, while all the car companies who have to pay out dealerships to handle recalls and warranty claims have a direct incentive to produce a reliable vehicle. Lo and behold, Tesla is about halfway down the vehicle reliability list according to consumer reports. At least they're better than Chrysler? reply AlotOfReading 16 hours agorootparentprevThey do. reply mensetmanusman 16 hours agorootparentprevBusiness model enforced by the government. reply chiph 16 hours agorootparentPeople incorrectly throw around the term \"rent-seeking\" all the time, yet this is a case where it would be correctly applied. The dealerships petition the government to enforce the franchise model of car sales to block potential competitors. Like Tesla, but also mega-chains like CarMax. reply KennyBlanken 16 hours agorootparentprevAnd for good reason. The whole point of the regulation is to assure that there is someone nearby for the owner to get a vehicle repaired and be able to buy parts. ahem Guess what Tesla has a ton of problems with? Edit: there are a whole lot of people replying who seem unaware that I was referring to new car customers who have a vehicle which is broken under government-mandated warranties, but also that: - The majority of manufacturers have long required proprietary diagnostic tools (the OBD-II functions in your car are only useful for the most basic diagnostic info, cannot adjust parameters, and cannot trigger diagnostic procedures such as cycling a valve or motor.) That is why some states and countries have right-to-repair laws. Automakers responded by shifting all that stuff to work only over telematics, and then claimed that online websites were not \"tools.\" - At one point car companies were doing bullshit like shipping parts with electronics in them \"uncoded\" (not uncommon, VAG does this) and not flashed with any firmware. Volvo did this. The firmware could only be flashed by a dealer, and it required them to plug the car into their internet-connected diagnostic tool through which servers in Sweden would encrypt the firmware for that specific VIN number and module, which could only be decrypted by the main control units in that specific car - and transmit it back to the technician's diagnostic tool. - Teslas require software/online tools only provided to Tesla service centers and technicians - You cannot buy parts for a Tesla without providing them with the VIN number of a car you own and which they still consider roadworthy. Tesla has a very arbitrary process for declaring vehicles to not be roadworthy, with relatively minor collisions triggering it, whereas vehicles nearly totally destroyed often are not declared unroadworthy and their VIN can be used to purchase parts - Tesla does not distribute parts via third party distributors such as Worldpac, and prohibits its OEMs from selling parts, which is extremely unusual. You (and your independent mechanic) can only get parts directly from them - if they'll sell you the part at all. The laws requiring dealerships and that they be independently owned were created because in the early days of the auto industry, people were getting endlessly screwed by automotive manufacturers producing cars that would break within weeks or months, did not have parts available for them at all, and the company would dissolve right after a production run so that customers had nobody to go after for damages. The reason for requiring it be an independent business is simple; the state government wants to see that a local business has judged the manufacturer to have their shit together sufficiently enough to want to do business with them, and they won't be left holding the bag. reply TheDong 14 hours agorootparent> The whole point of the regulation is to assure that there is someone nearby for the owner to get a vehicle repaired and be able to buy parts. > ahem Guess what Tesla has a ton of problems with? If the goal is to allow people to have vehicles repaired, then mandate right-to-repair laws, mandate that all auto manufacturers must fully document how to service the vehicle. The problem with Tesla isn't the lack of dealerships, it's that even if you go to a normal auto repair store, Tesla won't sell repair parts nor provide detailed enough repair manuals. Tesla will void your warranty for having someone else fix it.

    "title": "Electric (Postgres sync engine) beta release",
    "originLink": "https://electric-sql.com/blog/2024/12/10/electric-beta-release",
    "originBody": "With version 1.0.0-beta.1 the Electric sync engine is now in BETA! If you haven't checked out Electric recently, it's a great time to take another look. What is Electric? Electric is a Postgres sync engine. We do real-time partial replication of Postgres data into local apps and services. Use Electric to swap out data fetching for data sync. Build apps on instant, real-time, local data. Without having to roll your own sync engine or change your stack. We also develop PGlite, a lightweight WASM Postgres you can run in the browser. The path to BETA Six months ago, we took on a clean re-write. First commit was on the 29th June 2024. 600 pull requests later, we're ready for adoption into production apps. Production ready Electric and PGlite are being used in production by companies including Google, Supabase, Trigger.dev, Otto and Doorboost. We use ElectricSQL to power Trigger.dev Realtime, a core feature of our product. When we execute our users background tasks they get instant updates in their web apps. It's simple to operate since we already use Postgres, and it scales to millions of updates per day. — Matt Aitken, Founder & CEO, Trigger.dev At Otto, we built a spreadsheet product where every cell operates as its own AI agent. ElectricSQL enables us to reliably stream agent updates to our spreadsheet in real-time and efficiently manage large spreadsheets at scale. It has dramatically simplified our architecture while delivering the performance we need for cell-level reactive updates. — Sully Omar, Co-founder & CEO, Otto At Doorboost we aggregate millions of rows from a dozen platforms, all of which gets distilled down to a simple dashboard. With Electric we have been able to deliver this dashboard in milliseconds and update live. Moving forward, we will be building all our products using Electric. — Vache Asatryan, CTO, Doorboost Scalable So many real-time sync systems demo well but break under real load. Electric has been engineered from the ground up to handle high-throughput workloads, like Trigger.dev, with low latency and flat resource use. You can stream real-time data to millions of concurrent users from a single commodity Postgres. The chart below is from our cloud benchmarks, testing Electric's memory usage and latency with a single Electric service scaling real-time sync from 100k to 1 million concurrent clients under a sustained load of 960 writes/minute. Both memory usage and latency are essentially flat: You can also see how large-scale apps built with Electric feel to use with our updated Linearlite demo. This is a Linear clone that loads 100,000k issues and their comments through Electric into PGlite (~150mb of data). Once loaded, it's fully interactive and feels instant to use: Screenshot of Linearlite. Open the demo Easy to adopt We've iterated a lot on our APIs to make them as simple and powerful as possible. There should be no breaking changes in minor or patch releases moving forward. We've updated our Documentation, with a new Quickstart and guides for topics like: how to do auth how to handle local writes how to do partial replication with Shapes how to deploy Electric how to write your own client for any language or environment We have client libraries, integration docs, demo apps and technical examples showing how to use Electric with different patterns and frameworks: Interactive demos Notes Collaborative note-taking app with sync powered by Electric and Yjs. Open demo Source code Pixel art Collaborative pixel art editor with real-time multiplayer editing. Open demo Source code Incrementally You can adopt Electric one component and one route at a time. Wherever you have code doing something like this: tsx import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react' const MyComponent = () => { const [items, setItems] = useState([]) useEffect(() => { const fetchItems = async () => { const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/items') const data = await response.json() setItems(data) } fetchItems() }, []) return () } Swap it out for code like this (replacing the fetch in the useEffect with useShape): tsx import { useShape } from '@electric-sql/react' const MyComponent = () => { const { data: items } = useShape({ url: 'https://electric.example.com/v1/shapes', params: { table: 'items' } }) return () } This works with any Postgres data model and host, any data type, extension and Postgres feature. Including pgvector, PostGIS, sequential IDs, unique constraints, etc. You don't have to change your data model or your migrations to use Electric. With your existing API Because Electric syncs over HTTP, you can use it together with your existing API. This allows you to handle concerns like auth and writes with your existing code and web service integrations. You don't need to codify your auth logic into database rules. You don't need to replace your API endpoints and middleware stack. Take another look With this BETA release, Electric is stable and ready for prime time use. If you haven't checked it out recently, it's a great time to take another look.

There’s a massive tension between open source and a sustainable business which is much more prevalent with deeply technical products.

One surprise for me though is that Electric is a read only replica. In particular, “Electric does read-path sync. It syncs data out-of Postgres, into local apps and services. Electric does not do write-path sync. It doesn't provide (or prescribe) a built-in solution for getting data back into Postgres from local apps and services.” https://electric-sql.com/docs/guides/writes reply aidos 10 hours agoparentWe hit on exactly the same pattern for our product and it works really well. We use Hasura as the read engine. That updates a graph of mobx objects that drive the ui. We apply updates directly to those objects so the ui updates immediately. The mutations are posted back to a Python api that applies them to the db. I’ve looked at Electric because we’ve had to recreate some of what they do to interface with Hasura. At the moment it’s a non-starter because we use pg views to shape the data for the frontend. reply thom 9 hours agorootparentHave you looked into something like Materialize?

I have a similar graph of mobx objects for something I’m building but haven’t come up with an ergonomic sync story yet. reply dantiberian 14 hours agoprevI listened to https://www.localfirst.fm/18 recently from Electric-SQL. One of the things James mentioned was that Electric lets you use commodity CDNs for distributing sync data, which takes the load off your main Postgres and servers. This seems like a good pattern, but of lower value for a SaaS app with many customers storing private data in your service. This is because the cache hit-rate for any particular company's data would be low. Is this an accurate assessment, or did I misunderstand something? reply thruflo 13 hours agoparentHey, one of the things here is to define shapes that are shared. If you imagine syncing a shape that is that user’s data then it may be unique. But if you sync, say, one shape per project that that user has access to and a small shape of unique user data then you get shared cache between users who have access to each project. It’s worth noting that Electric is still efficient on read even if you miss the CDN cache. The shape log is a sequential read off disk. reply Ineentho 6 hours agorootparentI'm curious on how you'd configure this. Is it common (and safe) to let a cdn cache private data for authenticated users? Say Jira used electric, would you be able to put all tickets for a project behind a cdn cache key? You'd need a cdn that is able to run auth logic such as verifying a jwt to ensure you don't leak data to unauthorized users, right? reply thruflo 5 hours agorootparentYup, you can put an auth proxy in front of the CDN, for example using an edge worker. See the auth guide: https://electric-sql.com/docs/guides/auth Some CDNs also validate JWTs, so the CDN can be the proxy part of the Gatekeeper pattern (in the guide). reply kylemathews 4 hours agorootparentprevAnother option too for scaling reads is just putting an nginx in your cluster. Electric itself is quite scalable at reads too so for a SaaS use-case, you might not need any http proxy help. reply zknill 2 hours agoprevThe ElectricSQL concept of 'shapes' is interesting. Right now, a shape is just a single table with some column filters and a where clause. The shape is defined on the fly in the query string. Electric does single table sync of those 'shapes' a lot like Supabase realtime. I work as part of the team building Ably LiveSync, a competitor in this space. Our postgres connector[0] works in the opposite way by taking rows from an 'outbox' table and fanning them out to subscribed clients over websockets in realtime. Here's the thing; for any meaningfully complicated data in a relational database the data is likely to be normalised across tables with relations, and there are going to be joins. So I'm really curious how people are making single-table-sync work. (Maybe this is where Electric imagine the future of shapes, solving for joins). In LiveSync we do it the other way around, instead of having a live-query style subscription to a table (like ElectricSQL), we listen for someone writing a row to the 'outbox' table and that row is automatically sent to subscribers. This means that you're writing your denormlised data directly to the outbox and it's being sent on to clients, rather than writing your normalised data to tables but being limited by single table sync. Or worse, your clients having to subscribe to multiple sync streams and trying and stitch the data back together. We opted to have the write-side insert the denormalised data, rather than having the read side have to stitch normalised data back together. Electric will at some point try and solve multi table sync, which isn't easy given how the Postgres replication protocol works. It's also not easy to imagine how shapes (which are defined on the fly right now in the query string) will adapt to multiple tables. There's going to be a tradeoff between a complex query string trying to stitch the normalised tables back together, or a 'shape' becoming an entity in Electric which would define how to stitch the normalised tables back together (which you would have to CRUD manage, and update in Electric every time your schema changed). [0]: https://ably.com/docs/livesync/postgres reply matharmin 1 hour agoparentIn my experience, the \"outbox\" approach means a lot more manual work for developers. It requires developers to create a message for every type of change they want to sync to the client, and then also interpret that on the client. ElectricSQL's Shapes does a lot more work to keep the shape in sync between the client and the server, reducing the need for the developer to do that work. You're right that \"single-table sync\" does have its limitations. At PowerSync we effectively support one level of \"joins\", and even then it's often not enough for more complex schemas. An older version of ElectricSQL did also actually have multi-table shape sync support, but I believe doing that at scale proved to be difficult. One solution to this is often denormalizing data - either adding more denormalized columns in the existing table, or creating new tables dedicated to sync data. Conceptually, keeping these tables up to date is not that different from writing updates to an outbox table. I'm also interested in seeing what Zero comes up with in the space.

So natural places are web apps, mobile apps, backend services, etc. Here's an example showing how to sync a table from PG to Redis https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/blob/main/examples/... It's dramatically faster to read from a local copy of data vs. sending the query to Postgres and can eliminate a lot of network and db load as well. reply big_elephant 13 hours agorootparentThanks! reply TripleChecker 3 hours agoprevIs this basically a read-only partial replica?

We'll be writing our own JS WASI shim if we do. Having full control of the JS code will help to solve some of the problems we've faced with Emscripten. - we are also exploring a route to native where we take the WASI build and decompile it back to C. This seems a little mad, but it makes it possible to compile (with any tool chain) a native binary with a very minimal WASI-like api that can be linked to from any app. It essentially end up a little like the SQLite amalgamated header file as a build route. It's very experimental, and we haven't committed to it yet, but it looks like it may work. reply apitman 11 hours agorootparentThis is interesting. Can you go into a bit more detail on why the WASM decompiling would be helpful as opposed to just using the native codebase? reply samwillis 9 hours agorootparentDynamic linking on iOS is complex, and Android also brings some toolchain complexities. It would be possible to do a native build and link it, and that is a route we are also exploring, but a single C file that can be linked with any existing toolchain would simplify things for users. It also allows us to implement a VFS layer underneath PGlite in a native mode. So things like the in-memory VFS, or a custom VFS, would be possible. We have not committed to one route or the other yet. reply CubsFan1060 17 hours agoprevI may be misunderstanding, but does this boil down to essentially a partial read replica? reply btown 16 hours agoparentIt's way more powerful than that, since every active user session can have its own shaped & subsetted subscription to live data. See https://electric-sql.com/demos/proxy-auth for an example of how you could build a simple authorization proxy that allows each client session to build a customized long-poll of their own subset of relevant data, directly connecting to the Electric engine, and https://electric-sql.com/demos/react for how simple the frontend code can be. I fondly remember the days of Meteor (before the pivot to Apollo), where you'd give up SQL and in return be able to give every user a real-time live-updating data model, kept in sync with a secure subset of the central MongoDB database. Now, you don't need to give up the SQL part, nor are you locked into an entire ecosystem.

    "commentSummary": [
      "ElectricSQL has released a beta version of its Postgres sync engine, generating interest due to its engineering quality and business model considerations.- The engine syncs data from Postgres to local applications as read-only replicas, suitable for high-read, low-write services, but does not support write-path synchronization.- Users are discussing its potential compared to alternatives like PowerSync and Triplit, and the project aims to simplify local/offline-first app development, despite challenges in multi-table synchronization and schema changes."

Usually they are confusing Blackrock with Blackstone. All Blackrock does is manage wealth and investments on behalf of individual clients. One of the ways they do this is by sticking private assets into funds for their clients. It's more akin to Vanguard than anything to do with private equity. There's no reason to believe BlackRock would be breathing down their necks when all they do is broker the funds on behalf of their clients.

People tend to want to assume that private equity buying a business will retain the same incentive as the original owners - but the reason why PE would buy a business is _because_ the original owners weren't being perfectly efficient (aka, stingy).

The writing in injunctions like this is indicative of the court's thinking based on the pleadings, and they have basically regurgitated the complaint while adding on more evidence from Matt being an ass on social media, which suggests that the judge has a strong preference. reply DannyBee 13 hours agoparentprevUh, yeah, and in fact, the judge found likelihood of success on the tortuious interference claim which basically never happens, and so didn't bother to deal with the unfair competition part.

Just because they have a huge number of OSS projects.

Just look at the GH issues and PRs in the WP-calypso and Gutenberg repositories, and you’ll see even a lot of technical discussion and planning happening completely public. You can even chime in if you want :) Automattic has lots of issues. But they simply have much more open software development practices than nearly any other tech company (most of which are completely private and closed source). I just don’t think this is the core problem. reply ivraatiems 15 hours agoprevAs much as the US justice system is deeply, deeply flawed, it is one of the few places where very wealthy people ever hit the \"find out\" stage after fucking around. Some recent examples, apart from this case, certainly include SBF going to prison, Elon Musk being forced to buy Twitter, Alex Jones' enormous civil judgment, and so on. I'm not saying I have faith in the system, exactly, especially when it tends to only do this at the behest of other very wealthy people demanding it, but it is nice to see. Matt Mullenweg, if you're reading this (and we know you read HN), feel free to not listen to your attorneys and continue to attack random individuals and companies randomly because you decide you don't like them, or whatever. It will surely end well for you and definitely not with more massive own goals like this one. (And if you are Matt Mullenweg's attorney, and reading this because he decided to follow my bad advice instead of your good advice, well, I'm happy to take a steak dinner in appreciation of the massive bill you'll soon be sending him.) reply anonymousab 2 hours agoparentMatt's attorney - or someone claiming to be him - was saying that Matt is in the right and everything he's posted since the start was cleared by him. On here and on Twitter. That jives with Matt's claims that his lawyers were on board with all of his nonsense (and now, probably legally incriminating!) posts. But it could also have just been someone LARPing. reply echoangle 2 hours agorootparentSince Matt was personally commenting in the threads, I think he would have made a comment saying that the person claiming to be his lawyer isn't actually his lawyer. reply tofof 3 hours agoparentprevAlex Jones' loss of infowars has been rejected by the judge, who seems intent on handing it to the assets Jones transferred to his parents to shield them instead. You might want to reevaluate. reply kmeisthax 2 hours agoparentprevIn almost every example you cited, the very wealthy people were also very stupid and violated bedrock principles of the court system in a way that could not be swept under the rug. Specifically: - Elon Musk put it in writing that he was going to buy Twitter with no due diligence. Contracts are nine tenths of the law; no court in the world is going to get you out of one because the biggest value the court system has to the wealthy is contract enforcement. - Alex Jones never actually argued the merits of the defamation case against him. He didn't even show up to court. Judges have wide latitude to rule against people who don't show up to defend their cases, because otherwise nobody would be dumb enough to actually defend themself in a (neutral) court of law. - One of the few things US law can actually still protect you against is all the classic failure modes of banks and investments, both because the wealthy demand protection for their wealth and because the less-wealthy have been fleeced by investment fraud for so long that the list of memestock victims includes Issac Newton. SBF did the one kind of financial crime that the system actually cares about[0]. Today's system is corrupt on the margins: it needs to at least provide the appearance of impartiality, because the wealthy still rely on it being an impartial arbitrator of competing interests. In 1500s England, wealthy people didn't get divorces, they got annulments, where they paid a priest to go squint at Bible verses and find something to explain why the marriage was spiritually invalid. The wealthy person gets to sidestep the rules, but only if someone can find their desired loophole. Sometimes, they can't. And then sometimes a Henry VIII comes along, tries to have it both ways, gets told no, says \"fuck that, I'm the church now\", and completely replaces the partially corrupt system with a completely corrupt one. Matt Mullenweg seems to be playing at the same bit, doing ideological purges of Automattic and such; but he doesn't own the WordPress community, and he doesn't own the law. Enjoy it while it lasts, because it might not survive convicted felon / ex-President / President-Elect Donald Trump, depending on how many of Big Tech's Henry VIIIths come running to Trump for protection from countries that actually enforce their antitrust laws. [0] This also goes for Martin Shkreli; whose first criminal charge was for running a Ponzi scheme, not for jacking up the cost of generic drugs to exploit FDA regulations on sole-supplier drugs. reply throw646577 3 hours agoprevEhh. I speak as a pretty long-term WP-oriented developer who is no fan of WP Engine for reasons that are defined by having used their product when I say: This was the only sensible and just outcome. The \"Secure Custom Fields\" thing is one of the most egregious things to happen in open source for at least a decade. Just crazy. Hopefully Matt understands he has become self-limiting and steps back from some of his positions/takes off one of his too many hats. reply ookblah 14 hours agoprevI stopped following it for a bit after the initial drama after Matt had repeated meltdowns and showed his true face in all of this. It was just tiring try to fight all the non-stop gaslighting which was probably part of the strategy. Any leg he had to stand on was betrayed by his tantrums. Good to see some movement. reply chris_wot 13 hours agoprev> Defendants’ arguments in opposition do not persuade otherwise. They assert that “[t]he public is not, and will not, be subject to any harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction” noting that WPEngine implemented a workaround for Mullenweg’s interference with its access to WordPress. Opp. at 33. Not so. In his reply declaration, Prabhakar explains that the temporary solution “is impractical for many reasons.” Prabhakar Reply Decl. ¶ 4. Without access to wordpress.org, those who use WPEngine’s plugins “would not know that their plugins require update[.]” Id. Many do not know how to update plugins manually. Id. For those that do, if they manage several websites, and those websites run multiple plugins, the process of performing manual updates would be too onerous and time consuming to be workable. Id. Moreover, even if WPEngine’s workaround did not present the difficulties Prabhakar describes, the costs associated with its implementation, as necessitated by Mullenweg’s conduct, supports the issuance of injunctive relief. Ouch. The court is basically saying that they need to implement the preliminary injunction for the wider public good. Rather puts the lie to several assertions by Mullenweg. In fact, it's not at all looking good for Mullenweg or Automattic. reply bravetraveler 18 hours agoprevTried to get bond for an amount covering bills for two years; lol. This gives me more hope than most things I've read lately reply digitalPhonix 49 minutes agoparentI sort of wish the court did a hand wavy estimate of the marginal cost of providing service to WPEngine (Automattic was claiming the bond was to cover the cost of service) and ordered a bond of something like $0.01 reply jcranmer 23 minutes agorootparentThis is the preliminary injunction, which needs to be issued relatively quickly to preserve the status quo for the litigation, so the court isn't going to ask for anything it doesn't already have. Automattic only asked for covering the total cost of website hosting, which was clearly too high, so the court didn't have sufficient information to be able to make any reasonable estimate. reply bawolff 18 hours agoparentprevMakes you wonder if they really thought that would work. I guess it never hurts to shoot for the moon. reply bravetraveler 18 hours agorootparent+1, something about landing among the stars. I think Matt wanted to be one; this had a very astroturf feel - making himself the champion... and now, lol. But I repeat myself! reply pessimizer 16 hours agoprevnext [4 more] [flagged] InsomniacL 5 hours agoparent> I think wordpress had every right to cut WPEngine off Even though wordpress.org is built/maintained by volunteers such as WPEngine who were all told it's a \"community asset\", \"nobody owns it but wordpress\", \"it's maintained by the foundation\". Volunteers who now find out from court documents that wordpress.org is the personal website of Matt who can do whatever he wants with it? Volunteers who are now banned from the thing they helped build for simply voicing disagreement with actions which are accepted by most as extreme/unwarranted? Even volunteers who work on WordPress (not w.org), who built in to the Core reliance on w.org infrastructure after being lied to that it's owned by the Foundation. I think in this specific case, they have absolutely no right and the injunction supports that. reply onli 4 hours agoparentprevThe explanations in the injunction with regards to clients' contracts of wpengine does not read like he ever had any right to cut wpengine off. And his argument about how trademarks somehow gave him a right to ask for money from a wp hoster was never valid. I don't think he ever had a right to cut off wpengine, neither legally nor ethically. The case will be a complete loss for WordPress, and matts statements probably didn't even change that all that much, they just make the decision easier and add additional charges to lose, like the blatant extortion. (It's thinkable to ask for money from entities accessing the plugin registry, making it a paid api. But not a fee from a company just for using a Foss software. The license doesn't allow that.) reply FireBeyond 14 hours agoparentprev> the pretense that he was doing it for \"security reasons\" because there was an exploit (every single part of everything about wordpress has an exploit in a random month) shows that he thought he was doing something unjustifiable Not to mention the threats posted online to other plugin developers, \"we can and will find an exploit in your plugin and do exactly the same to you if we want\" indicated it had very little to do with security. I'm sure he had Automattic employees pulled onto finding even the most trivial of exploits just to be able to do this. > they'd probably have backed down and started contributing WPE contributes probably in the seven digit a year range to WP. The very conference that Matt went \"nuclear\" at was sponsored by WPE to the tune of $75K (and for insult on injury, they were denied the ability to attend, and I believe all references to them were removed, but the money was kept). reply tmsh 19 hours agoprevnext [10 more] [flagged] lolinder 18 hours agoparentOof.
