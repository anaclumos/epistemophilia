Earlier this year, Google removed the cache link from the search result snippets. Then a couple of weeks ago, added links to the Wayback Machine. Now, the direct link to see the Google Cache has been fully disabled. If you try to go directly to the Google Cache - something I have tried literally every day since Google removed the links from the search results - Google will now show nothing: Here is the link I've been trying daily at this link: This stopped working in the past 12 hours or so. There are a lot of people chattering about it on social: Google has removed the ability to check cache manually, just happened today. It didn't work on every site, but you could see the cache on new pages temporarily.https://t.co/AMffKaKrbM Now it just redirects to a search result with cache: in front of the domain. @rustybrick — SEOwner (@tehseowner) September 24, 2024 cache:https://t.co/IR03XZd2iZ is cache operator no more? I have checked many website, no one site is showing cache page. So I think this is no more from now. What you think guys?@JohnMu @rustybrick — Rajesh Prajapati (@prajapatiseo) September 24, 2024 In India, Google have completely stopped giving cache copy of indexed pages. Tried on more than 10 to 20 websites. I think they have completed this rollout in India.@JohnMu @rustybrick pic.twitter.com/fWmQTUfD6p — Nilesh Yadav (@Nilesh__Yadav) September 24, 2024 hi @rustybrick @JohnMu Google Cache is not working. Is this a Google bug, or is only my website facing this issue? pic.twitter.com/rHw4EZMxcO — Akshay Kumar Sharma (@alexsharma111) September 24, 2024 As a reminder, Google's Search Liaison, Danny Sullivan, said on X: Yes, it's been removed. I know, it's sad. I'm sad too. It's one of our oldest features. But it was meant for helping people access pages when way back, you often couldn't depend on a page loading. These days, things have greatly improved. So, it was decided to retire it. Personally, I hope that maybe we'll add links to @internetarchive from where we had the cache link before, within About This Result. It's such an amazing resource. For the information literacy goal of About The Result, I think it would also be a nice fit -- allowing people to easily see how a page changed over time. No promises. We have to talk to them, see how it all might go -- involves people well beyond me. But I think it would be nice all around. As a reminder, anyone with a Search Console account can use URL Inspector to see what our crawler saw looking at their own page. You're going to see cache: go away in the near future, too. But wait, I hear you ask, what about noarchive? We'll still respect that; no need to mess with it. Plus, others beyond us use it. Here are some of those posts: Update! We've now added links to previous versions of webpages from the Internet Archive. Learn more in the post below: https://t.co/qbYUi8iSoI — Google SearchLiaison (@searchliaison) September 11, 2024 So he told use the cache: operator would go away in the \"near future.\" That took 9 months or so to happen and now it is gone. What are your alternatives? So, yea, the Wayback Machine or the URL Inspection tool in Google Search Console or Google's rich result testing tool. Forum discussion at BlackHatWorld. Update: After this story was published, Google confirmed the cache operator no longer works. Google posted, \"The cache: search operator no longer works in Google Search.\" Google has now officially confirmed the cache operator is no longer working - story updated at https://t.co/wHb5HuQnJ6 pic.twitter.com/xLWggZy9Vg — Barry Schwartz (@rustybrick) September 24, 2024 Google also removed it from the docs, so the old version of search operators had this: This story was originally published at 6am ET but updated at 7:52am ET.

Because I want to trust Wayback Machine and the Internet Archive to be unbiased. Google likes to influence search results, hiding ones it doesn't like, and elevating those that the Company supports. Wayback Machine has been very reliable so far, I hope it stays that way. reply krackers 20 hours agoparentprevIt'd be absolutely foolish if the agreement wasn't contingent on funding. I assume the reason it's not explicitly stated was some sort of NDA (since IA is also involved in turmoil and Google doesn't want to be part of that). reply InDubioProRubio 10 hours agorootparentI wouldn't designate IP-holders attacking the longterm memory of mankind as turmoil.

Or for sites that have gone offline, or no longer have the item. \"It's still in the Google Cache!\" you can't say that anymore. I use Google less and less these days. What's the point when you can just ask an LLM, and it gives you an answer within seconds, with no ads? You can ask for references and links and it will give those to you too. I don't think I've ever been given a link to an SEO content farm, where as with Google search its the entire page. Google Search feels like Yahoo was (maybe even worse) right before it died and was replaced with Bing. reply deanCommie 1 hour agoparentThis still happens all the time. * I search a keyword * I see a google result * I see the keyword IN THE PREVIEW on Google * I click on the link * No keyword And this isn't hidden SEO spam stuff, it was literally removed. The cache doesn't match the live result. No recourse. reply iggldiggl 52 minutes agorootparentAnother annoying scenario is when the search result isn't the actual page/article/… itself, but only a snippet within a site's own (paginated) index. At the time Google had indexed that page, the article preview you were looking for was maybe on page 5 of that index, but by the time you're arriving, it might have moved to page 11 because of all the additional content that got added since then. With online shops it's even worse, because there items get both added and possibly removed again, plus the default ordering usually isn't strictly chronologically but some sort of popularity-based or whatever algorithm, so something that originally was indexed on page 5 of the catalogue might by now be on page 2 or on page 12 or it might have been dropped from the inventory altogether. reply EasyMark 1 hour agoparentprevLLM… no ads…. *For now reply runxel 20 hours agoprevVery sad to see it gone. It was always some kind of last resort. Internet Archive is lovely, don't get me wrong, but it relies mostly on people actively queueing up sites to save. So most of the time for more obscure sites where the bitrot was already in place and they aren't loading anymore you could use the Google cache to get something out of it – where IA had nothing. reply DaoVeles 19 hours agoparentI do worry about the future of IA. Simply because of some of their reckless moves with their book lending policy, they have opened themselves up to being bleed dry financially. That plus the amount of copyright infringement openly available on the site is just waiting to be attacked. I am waiting for Nintendo to get wind of the huge ROM dumps on there, it is not going to pretty. No manner of 'moral high ground' will defend against lawyers. reply Gud 14 hours agorootparentI disagree. I am happy the Internet Archive are fighting the draconian copy right laws that exist. reply anonymousab 4 hours agorootparentThey aren't really fighting it, because they never picked a winnable battle. Rather, they overextended themselves massively in a blunder akin to just throwing themselves on their enemy's sword. They decided to go all-or-nothing on uncontrolled digital lending when there wasn't a snowball's chance in hell that the current laws would give them any wiggle room. And unsurprisingly, it will give them a mortal wound. reply mrguyorama 1 hour agorootparent\"Pick a winnable fight\" means the internet archive does not exist. Copyright in the US is very clear cut. There is no fight to \"win\" without changing the law. That means advocacy. That sometimes means civil disobedience and getting society to fight for them. You want an internet archive? We need to reform copyright law. reply renewiltord 3 hours agorootparentprevYeah, but no person who would worry about this would have made the IA in the first place. IA itself is a massive copyright suit waiting to happen. I know, I know, if you were them and had bought bitcoin at $10 you would have sold at precisely the top at $70k per and neither before nor after. reply anonymousab 3 hours agorootparentI would agree, but IA did eventually add a mechanism for removing a site/copyrighted content entirely. If they were straight up ignoring or rejecting DMCA takedown requests, then that would be a self-immolation that is similarly pyrrhic to the uncontrolled digital lending operation. reply Apocryphon 2 hours agorootparentprevWhat are you talking about. If they hadn’t done the emergency library they could’ve flown under the publishers’ radar for decades more. reply renewiltord 2 hours agorootparentSure, but the guy who would conceive and execute on this idea was never going to be a guy who would stop there. Folks like this don’t aim at some point and then achieve it and stay there. They aim higher, land where they do, and continue to target the higher point. It’s how it is. You can tell because how many of the rest of the people who would have stopped and flown under the radar have duplicated the Archive and served it without the taint of the ebook lending? Precisely zero. reply Apocryphon 40 minutes agorootparentHm, what's that Carl Sagan quote, \"They laughed at Columbus, they laughed at Fulton, they laughed at the Wright brothers. But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown.\" Brewster Kahle's vision for the Internet Archive as an electronic repository for human knowledge is the former. His belief that he can just blithely tussle with the entire copyright regime in such a half-cocked manner is the latter. You should not confuse folly for audacity. Especially when it might completely jeopardize the former. reply lolinder 4 hours agorootparentprevThey risked one of the greatest public goods in the history of humanity on a battle that everyone knew they would lose. That's not an admirable underdog fight and it's not a glorious martyrdom, it's at best a naive slip up and at worst an ignoble organizational suicide attempt. Change isn't going to happen because people recklessly throw themselves against the draconian laws and get annihilated by them—it will happen when people strategically set up a battle that they can win or persuade Congress to fix it. reply HeatrayEnjoyer 14 hours agorootparentprevBut the arena for that fight is legislation. Weed didn't become legal through lawsuits, it became legal because laws were repealed. I hope IA prevails but it's long shot, even more with the Heritage infestation of the courts. reply raxxorraxor 4 hours agorootparentEveryone just ignoring bad laws and contradicting them can remove laws too. But of course this is a niche topic that would never get such broad support. A lot of people smoking weed is certainly a component for the prohibition to fail at some point. Writing mails to legislative members isn't enough if you don't have any form of leverage. reply autoexec 2 hours agorootparentJury nullification is the real mechanism for We The People when we don't consent to be held to laws passed by They The Wealthy/Bribed Lawmakers It requires that people refuse plea deals and demand jury trials, and that the jury is educated on what jury nullification is but when prosecutors can't get a conviction regardless of much evidence they have of guilt the laws will get changed or at least they stop being enforced. reply Gud 13 hours agorootparentprevAgain, disagree. The copyright trolls need to be fought in the courts as well. Obviously the law needs to be changed. reply vineyardmike 10 hours agorootparentThe “problem” is that society doesn’t see Nintendo/Disney/et al as copyright trolls - instead they’re successful businesses who made content and profit. Connecting those dots to archival work and historic preservation is a long slow process and won’t be successful in courts without legal changes. reply throwaway14356 7 hours agorootparentWe have to stop prioritizing it over everything else. You can't compete in the global playground if you have impossible to implement entitlement programs. Priority has to be new work not existing work and definitely not the work of dead people. We have countless similar schemes were people are to be rewarded for things done long ago. One can't pretend it isn't slowing everything down. reply rwmj 7 hours agorootparentprevBack over here in the real world, there is no possible way the IA will win this fight through the courts. It has to be dealt with by legislation. reply cyberax 21 hours agoprevI used cache a lot, not just to view sites, but see the text versions of PDF and Word documents. RIP. reply ThinkBeat 21 hours agoprevI would presume Google still has all this data. They just will not let anyone else use it. Could this be an advantage that Google can use to train their models on but others won't have access? Google wants it to be more difficult to notice rewrites? Journalists to often have found valuable information with it? reply lofaszvanitt 43 minutes agoparentJust with youtube, the surface area of these services is getting smaller and smaller and you get less and less. Too much optimization to the detriment of users. All the while search is still rooted in 90s concepts and only serves as a money making thing. reply advisedwang 2 hours agoparentprevAs I understand it, Google does a decent amount of rendering of a page before indexing; this a) allows it to index content loaded by JS and b) prevents some ways spammers show Google different content from users. Perhaps Google's main way of storing a page no longer matches something that can be easily served as a cache page. This might be a way to remove a legacy copy of each page and reduce storage costs. reply selectodude 21 hours agoparentprevI feel like the internet archive has taken a lot of that sort of use off of Google. Unrelated: Google should probably think about a sizable donation to the Internet archive. reply amorfusblob 21 hours agorootparentSome kind of collaboration appears to be happening between the two https://blog.archive.org/2024/09/11/new-feature-alert-access... reply bigstrat2003 20 hours agoprevI am genuinely surprised to learn that it even still existed.

I have to assume the additional interest in crawling/scraping data for AI precipitated this. Why deal with all the messiness of crawling the web at large when you can use a Google search and cache: results as your RAG? reply progmetaldev 19 hours agoparentThe answer could be to push users to their AI offerings, or possibly due to bots scraping up the cached data for their own AI models, where Google wasn't making a profit off providing the data. Most likely the feature wasn't used enough for them to care, and they couldn't find a way to monetize it to make it worth keeping around. reply matt-p 9 hours agoprevOn a unrelated note, could IA be charging companies training AI for access to an API with all thier data, or a enormous data dump? Presumably historical context is quite useful for so e cases and if they can access new content like books etc then that'd be another benifit.

It was a great complement to the increasingly unreliable IA, whose list of blacklisted websites just keeps skyrocketing for opaque reasons This could be due to site owners contacting the IA and requesting their site be permanently removed from the archive. It's not as easy as pressing a button, but it's not difficult to have your site removed. I don't think that the IA itself makes editorial decisions as to which sites to include and which to blacklist. It's more likely that the blacklist is a voluntary opt-in thing... reply probably_wrong 21 hours agoprev> [Google Cache] was meant for helping people access pages when way back, you often couldn't depend on a page loading. These days, things have greatly improved. So, it was decided to retire it. I wish I knew what he's talking about - not only are sites disappearing left and right, but even those that remain will often change so quickly that your search term is nowhere to be found. My cynical guess: websites want Google to index them so they show full versions of their articles knowing they won't be penalized for that. Everybody else gets a paywall, but Google Cache let everyone bypass them. Faced with the choice between users and companies, Google threw the users under the bus. reply wakeupcall 9 hours agoparent> will often change so quickly that your search term is nowhere to be found About 5 years ago I was often pulling up the cache to see if the indexed/cached page actually contained the search terms I was looking up, suspecting the site was serving a different page compared to what I was redirected to. The number of websites doing this to game SEO was (and I suspect still is) substantial, despite google saying they're penalizing this behavior. Outlets serving full articles to google then presenting you an unreadable mess, often downgraded through JS, is one of the most egregious, and google doesn't seem to care anyway. This was before I gave up completely on google giving me pages containing the terms I was looking for. reply Dylan16807 8 hours agorootparentAnd it doesn't have to be malicious either. Sometimes a result used to be on page 47 and is no longer on page 47.

So most sites therefore did not use noarchive because it improved discoverability/SEO to allow Google to cache your site. This is just a guess though and what I always assumed to be the case. This seems to be the case though because the cached versions would often contain the entire article for free, which makes no sense unless they were doing it for SEO. For example you could use this trick to read any nikkei article. reply 8organicbits 18 hours agorootparentNah, it's not a Google thing although Google honored it.

You've blotched your copybook too many times. reply wwweston 21 hours agoparentThe real question is why they'd have to be aware. It's entirely possible that those of us who pay attention to this are a vanishing minority compared to the cultural momentum of Google as the default search provider and a dominant provider of email/office SaaS. But even if dissatisfaction is growing, the institional momentum is just so huge that it's very likely Google simply doesn't have the capacity to sense any brand damage even if it were actually occurring at any significant scale. You'd need to have people whose role included a duty to pay attention to this with systems for measuring it reporting to people who take them seriously. Google's never needed those people. It came into the world with a halo of value, primarily knowing the challenges of demand and growth rather than attrition. Much of its management and professional staff are probably largely drawn from the ranks of those who have known more success than challenge, and they are rewarded in such a way that they not only have little incentive to behave differently they may actually have an atrophied sense of the possibility that different might be important, even if they were aware of cultural momentum shifts and were willing/able to persuade others at Google to change how things are done in an enormously successful place. Like Bill Gates said, success is a terrible teacher. Why would enough people at Google think Google has crucial lessons to learn? reply bane 16 hours agorootparentIt's a mistake that's made over and over again in tech. Back when Atari was printing money in the late 70s and early 80s the leadership and marketing people literally didn't know what to do that would help or hurt their business. Literally anything they did brought in more profits than they knew what to do with. It caused them to make wild mistakes that jeopardized the long term viability of the company like milking their core product well after it had served its time in the market and neglecting, shutting down, or even warehousing everything else (sound familiar?). It took some really forceful misunderstanding of their marketspace by clueless executives to finally bring Atari down and have it sold off for parts. And that's where Google's fate diverges from the historic lesson, Google won't die because its stuff its sales channels full of more hardware than they can sell (tying up every dollar in the company). Google will die because it's core product, ad placement, is become less valuable, causing the company to optimize trying to capture that main source of revenue -- which is realized in a total lack of strategy to build literally any other business. reply CM30 9 hours agorootparentprevThey'd have to be aware because people have gotten wary of anything new from the company, due to the fears it'll be killed in a year or two. That's not a huge issue right now (since Search, YouTube, Maps, Gmail, Android, Chrome, Docs, etc are huge), but it does make it more difficult for them to compete if the technological landscape changes and leaves them behind. For example, if AI/VR/neural implants/something else* completely shake up the computing landscape (and traditional search engines start to fall into irrelevancy), will people trust Google to be the provider for these things? Or will they look at their history of quickly killing products, and choose a competitor who might be in it for the long haul? * Given some of these fields are already dominated by Google's competitors/other FAANG level companies, that already be a bad sign. reply manquer 17 hours agorootparentprevIt matters because the HN crowd maybe small when it comes consumer products , but is a dominant factor for cloud purchases.

I used and liked Google domains for a bunch of websites, and was disappointed when that was axed and all my domains moved to squarespace (and have since transferred them all out). I used the Google podcast app on my phone, and that was killed and replaced by YouTube music which is a horrible replacement. I used to buy in heavily to the Google ecosystem and trust it as a pretty solid go to option for anything they offered, now I'd be really hesitant to use it for anything critical. I have even been wondering if my longstanding gmail email address will someday be a liability. Those two examples were probably smaller services but had their effects on different populations. When you add up all the things that have been ended by Google it can really contribute to their overall brand image. Some things can trickle down from more technical users to less technical. I think chrome was first adopted by a highly tech literate population before breaking into the mainstream, and if that population starts to mistrust Google it could hurt them in the long run.

Feel free to criticize Mozilla all you like, but this is a prime example of myopic tech-bubble thinking that is being decried elsewhere in this thread. Firefox market share declined first because Google used their market position to advertise Chrome for free on what was then the most valuable web real estate in the world (the Google home page), then because they paid software installers to use dark patterns to automatically install Chrome and set it as the default browser without the user's consent, and then because they optimized all of Google's popular properties to work best in Chrome and only begrudgingly in other browsers, and then because they shipped it as the default browser on the OS that Google controls. There's not a single thing that Mozilla could have done to stop Chrome, short of making their own phone OS where they could ship Firefox as the default, which they did in fact attempt. reply roenxi 17 hours agorootparentI do agree that perspective is more accurate; Chrome was always going to be huge with a combination of Google's development effort and advertising. However Mozilla's leadership have done an unimpressive job. They took a large amount of money from Google, decided that their vision of how the internet should work was identical to Google's, then converged Firefox to being an inferior Chrome clone. Brave does a better job of articulating a different vision of the web than Firefox and it is a Chrome fork; the situation is a bit ridiculous [0, 1]. And Brave's crypto scheme, while maybe it'll work and maybe it won't, is a radical re-imagination of how the web could be commercialised. So there is clearly room to imagine an internet other than the one Google wants where everyone has Google Ads.

This may or may not have been wrong of Google, however this is also called \"competition\". And what did Mozilla do? It flinched. Many users loved Firefox, and disliked that Chrome had barely any ability to customize anything when released. It was literally years before you could change even the most basic things about the interface. When released, almost nothing could be configured about it, and it was a far cry from Firefox's ability to give the user what they wanted. Firefox's response to Chrome's minor speed improvements? Was to literally begin a campaign to become the enemy. Firefox devs worked diligently to make Firefox a second rate clone of Chrome. They removed features, configuration, the ability to modify the interface, and more. Mozilla could have so easily kept all that configurability, its strong point, its unique factor, but instead panicked. And in doing so it rendered itself incapable of competing on any footing. Put another way, yes Google had vast resources. Yet this is precisely why you never compete on the same footing as them. You instead compete on what they do not have. And that was the ability to theme Firefox, to configure it as you wanted, to turn off features you did not want, and more. Chrome had none of this initially. And Google is literally famous for, and incapable of listening to users. They're not built for it. Mozilla was. And they threw all those strengths away, the only way they could compete with Chrome. So yes, there were things they could have done. And yes, endless people told them that in bug reports, in emails to them, and more.

If there was a more perfect example of a product being killed by penny pinching, I can't think of one. It just didn't have enough flash for anything but a super cut down android. We had to drop multilib - the SoC and everything supported 64bit, just there wasn't enough space for the libraries. And the cheapest, bargin-basement flash as well - causing so many to be bricked trying to update. Plus 1gb ram, when even entry level phones were shipping with 2gb - just a couple of 4k framebuffers and the video decode reference frames meant there was pretty much nothing left for the apps themselves. So 1080p was it's limit despite having a capable video decoder and output. And for ages afterwards they would use it as a reference device for google TV and testing for play store certification - just as they were pushing 64-bit only as a valid app path. So many things were only missing from the google tv play store for years afterwards because they just wouldn't function on those things. reply Tijdreiziger 20 hours agorootparentprevI think you can just ignore the apps and cast like you’re used to, if you don’t care about the extra functionality.

It was a gift for a relative: a \"Chromecast with Google TV.\" I didn't know what it really was when I bought it. Taking \"Chromecast\" out of the name makes sense. The original concept was great, but I guess it doesn't sell anymore? reply ssl-3 17 hours agorootparentThe original concept was great for some things, sure. I bought an OG Chromecast over a decade ago. It was a one-trick pony: Push \"cast\" button on pocket computer, and whatever I was doing there would show up on the BFT. Which is great, you know, for a person who lives alone and never has visitors: One can select an item from the slick interface provided by the service they subscribe to on their amazing personal computing device and it appears magically on the big screen. The control buttons are there on the pocket computer, too. It Just Works. However, it is an awful experience for someone who wishes to watch a film together with others: My personal pocket computer is not really set up to be shared with others (and the live screencast function of Chromecast, while functional, has really high latency for interactive tasks). And if someone else wants to pick something to watch using their own personal pocket computer, then they can of course do so -- but theirs is also not meant to be a shared experience, and they won't be able to use the services that I pay to use in my home. So fine. A film is selected, however that is done, and it is playing. But it's time to pause it so someone can use the bathroom. Do I use my phone for my Chromecast for the movie my friend picked on their phone? I already had to hide the buttons from showing up in the notification area of everyone's pocket computer on the LAN, since my roommate kept being a dick and stopping my shit. Or do I have my friend fumble around with this potentially-unfamiliar interface on their own (locked) pocket computer to pause it? What if they stepped away? Do I find the Home app on my own pocket computer, open it, find the devices page, find the appropriate Chromecast device, and then finally fucking pause it? (Fuck you. I just want to go take a fucking piss.) Back then, it was a much better experience in my household to use a PS3 for streaming: It had a regular remote control that -- as a design intent -- anyone could pick up and operate. Browsing possible selections was done on the BFT that was visible to all interested parties. My roommate didn't get a notification on their phone that encouraged them fuck with me from a different area of the house. It was a much better experience for those who didn't live a life of absolute solitude. Today, it's still that way -- except nowadays I have [what is sometimes referred to as] a GCWGTV. It can behave like an OG Chromecast (what UI???), or it can behave like a human-centric streaming device with its own GUI and dedicated physical remote control that anyone can pick up and use, browsing Netflix or Plex or whatever in a manner very similar to what we were doing on a PS3 back in the day. This works fine. reply vel0city 17 hours agorootparent> I already hid the buttons from showing up in the notification area of everyone's pocket computer on the LAN, since my roommate kept being a dick and stopping my shit. Honestly that sounds far more like your roommate being an ass than some failure of the technology.

I've had a few dozen AV setups of \"moderate\" complexity (multiple game consoles/streaming boxes, AV receiver, BD player, TV) and never really had bad experiences.

And honestly most of the time with things running my OG Chromecasts its the only actual device on the setup (a stand-alone TV mounted someplace like in the garage or kitchen or patio). reply ssl-3 17 hours agorootparentDid the TV B Gone manifest itself from nothing and present that manifestation on my asshole roommate's personal pocket computer with zero action on their part?

Google genuinely kills enough stuff that there's really no need to pad out the list by counting the Google Drive desktop client that still exists and was just renamed, or the standalone Street View app which was just a worse version of the Google Maps app, or Google Toolbar which was obsoleted by browsers integrating search and wouldn't be supported by any modern browser anyway.

Some other examples: It counts Jamboard (the device) and Google Jamboard (the app) as two different things, despite the link to the news of their death being in the same article and Google shutting them at the same time.[0] It counts YouTube go which was an optimized version of YouTube for slow devices in developing countries. Google claims these optimizations are no longer necessary. That makes sense as devices have gotten more powerful over time and a smartphone in the developing world should be enough to play YouTube videos in the regular YouTube app. Seems like the latest budget Itel model, which is popular in Africa,[1] the A50, has 3GB of RAM and 64GB ROM.[2] For comparison the iPhone SE from 2020 also had 3GB X 64GB. Running adb shell dumpsys meminfo while running a Youtube video shows the following: 585,268K: app.revanced.android.youtube. So it seems to me that the YouTube app may really not need a Go version anymore. Same for YouTube Leanback which was for the web. Similarly shutting down YouTube gaming probably did not actually affect users in any way. It's not like there were videos that were only accessible from that app. [0] https://www.itel-india.com/product/a50/ [1] https://www.pulse.ng/business/domestic/top-phone-brands-in-a...

You can see it in action at http://playin.coz.is/index.html. I asked Reddit to hack me, which resulted in gigabytes of hilarious and malicious request logs. I saved some in attempts.txt, and may dig out a few more for fun someday :^) But.. Why? I enjoy making my own tools and I'm a bit tired of hearing that everything needs to be \"battle-tested.\" So what it will crash? Bugs can be fixed :^) Specs Linux only Implements HTTP/1.1, pipelining, and keep-alive connections HTTPS support (up to TLS 1.2 using BearSSL) Minimal dependencies (libc and BearSSL when using HTTPS) Configurable timeouts Access logs, crash logs, log rotation, disk usage limits No Transfer-Encoding: Chunked (responds with 411 Length Required, prompting the client to resend with Content-Length) Single core (This will probably change when I get a better VPS) No static file caching (yet) Benchmarks The focus of the project is robustness, but it's definitely not slow. Here's a quick comparison agains nginx (static endpoint, both single-threaded, 1K connection limit) (blogtech) $ wrk -c 500 -d 5s http://127.0.0.1:80/hello Running 5s test @ http://127.0.0.1:80/hello 2 threads and 500 connections Thread Stats Avg Stdev Max +/- Stdev Latency 6.66ms 3.71ms 48.87ms 92.30% Req/Sec 39.59k 6.43k 50.60k 67.35% 385975 requests in 5.01s, 30.55MB read Requests/sec: 76974.24 Transfer/sec: 6.09MB (nginx) $ wrk -c 500 -d 5s http://127.0.0.1:8080/hello Running 5s test @ http://127.0.0.1:8080/hello 2 threads and 500 connections Thread Stats Avg Stdev Max +/- Stdev Latency 149.11ms 243.02ms 934.12ms 81.80% Req/Sec 24.97k 16.87k 57.73k 61.11% 224790 requests in 5.08s, 42.01MB read Requests/sec: 44227.78 Transfer/sec: 8.27MB Nginx uses this configuration: worker_processes 1; events {worker_connections 1024; } http {server { listen 8080; location /hello {add_header Content-Type text/plain;return 200 \"Hello, world!\"; }} } Build & Run By default the server build is HTTP-only: $ make this generates the executables: serve (release build), serve_cov (coverage build), and serve_debug (debug build). Release builds listen on port 80; debug builds on port 8080. To enable HTTPS, you'll need to clone BearSSL and build it. You can do so by running these commands from the root folder of this repository: $ mkdir 3p $ cd 3p $ git clone https://www.bearssl.org/git/BearSSL $ cd BearSSL $ make -j $ cd ../../ $ make -B HTTPS=1 The same executables will be generated, but with secure connections on port 443 (release) or 8081 (debug). Place your cert.pem and key.pem files in the same directory as the executable. You can customiza names and locations by changing: #define HTTPS_KEY_FILE \"key.pem\" #define HTTPS_CERT_FILE \"cert.pem\" For testing locally with HTTPS, generate a self-signed certificate (and private key): openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 openssl req -new -x509 -key key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 Usage The server serves static content from the docroot/ folder. You can change this by modifying the respond function: typedef struct {Method method;string path;int major;int minor;int nheaders;Header headers[MAX_HEADERS];string content; } Request; void respond(Request request, ResponseBuilder *b) {if (request.major != 1 || request.minor > 1) { status_line(b, 505); // HTTP Version Not Supported return;}if (request.method != M_GET) { status_line(b, 405); // Method Not Allowed return;}if (string_match_case_insensitive(request.path, LIT(\"/hello\"))) { status_line(b, 200); append_content_s(b, LIT(\"Hello, world!\")); return;}if (serve_file_or_dir(b, LIT(\"/\"), LIT(\"docroot/\"), request.path, NULLSTR, false)) return;status_line(b, 404);append_content_s(b, LIT(\"Nothing here :|\")); } you can add your endpoints here by switching on the request.path field. Note that the path is just a slice into the request buffer. URIs are not parsed. Testing I routinely run the server under valgrind and sanitizers (address, undefined) and target it using wrk. I'm also adding automatized tests to tests/test.py to check compliance with the HTTP/1.1 spec. I also use it to host my website and post it here and there to keep it under stress.Turns out, all of those bots scanning he internet for vulnerable websites make great fuzzers!

Everything else, I can handle with Reverse Proxy including TLS Termination, load balancing, URL rewrites, Security (WAF etc) if needed. Separation of duties for me. Overall, the benefit is that you can keep your origin server protected and only serve relevant traffic. Also, lets say you offer custom domain to your own customers and in that case, you could always swap out the origin server (if needed) without worrying about DNS changes for your customers as they are pointing to the reverse proxy and not your origin server directly. reply dartos 6 hours agoparentprevI run many server programs on my homelab.

You asked about security and performance. I’ll give you a few ways that an extra box can help in those areas. For security, you want a strong OS with this little code as possible in your overall system. Proxy-style apps can be very simple compared to web, application servers. They can filter incoming traffic, validate the input, or even change it to something safer (or faster) to parse. They can also run on OS’s that are harder to attack: OpenBSD; GenodeOS; INTEGRITY-178B. On availability, putting load-balancing, monitoring, and recovery in these systems is often safer since app servers are more likely to crash. On performance, the first benefit is that the simple, focused app can have a highly-optimized implementation. From there, one can use hardware accelerators (CPU or PCI) to speed up compression or encryption. Also called offloading. The most, cost-effective setup has many commodity servers benefiting from a few, high-cost servers capable of offloading. Some have load-balancing to route incoming traffic to servers able to handle it best to minimize use of costly resources. So, there’s a few ways that proxy-type servers can help in security and performance. reply pengaru 2 hours agoparentprevIt's a lot easier to isolate and de-privilege your reverse proxy that needs to do nothing more than speak http/https with the outside world and some local listeners. The url-specific web servers you're proxying tend to need a whole lot more, at least filesystem access to serve html content, at most program execution like CGIs and interpreters.

The chat code [I really should upload the code as the company has been dead for at least 10-15 years] worked by browsers holding an infinitely loading frame, so each client held open a connection for several hours. IIRC there was some Javascript that reloaded the connection after a few hours. To handle 1000s of HTTP connections we had to implement our own fairly lightweight threads. It also had a cool inversion of control where you could write straight through code and it was turned into event-driven callbacks automatically. The webserver couldn't make use of multiple cores, which was lucky because the server had only 1 CPU! Also used a pool allocator, which is very well suited to server applications. reply kragen 3 hours agorootparenthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming) is browsers holding an infinitely loading frame, so each client held open a connection for several hours. usually we included tags in that infinitely loading frame so the events could do whatever instead of just adding more text somewhere off the screen below the current scroll position. an alternative way to do comet is to close the connection when there's an event and have the client reload the frame nowadays people use websockets for comet yeah, protothreads type stuff and pool allocators are great fits for that kind of work reply petee 4 hours agoprevAside, if you want to write C apps but aren't comfortable writing the public facing parts, 'Kore' is a great framework with some handy builtins like ACME cert management, Pgsql, curl, websockets, etc. Essentially build and run modules, and they can be combined (including mixing Lua/Python + C.) https://kore.io/ reply panzi 1 hour agoprevReminds me of that Chaos Communication Congress talk about a blog/web server written in C, but with a bunch of security features (immutable storage, dropped privileges, blog has no access to TLS certificate, etc.): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaE28fJVPTk reply theideaofcoffee 14 hours agoprevAwesome!

The different contexts make everything feel different, even though it's more of the same. The perspective change, and changes the subjective experience. For example - to really understand the nature of linux or git, you have to speak its language and understand the nuances that are usually lost in translation.

Don’t get me wrong this is an awesome project but if you really care about this kind of thing in a production scenario and you’re serving mostly static content… just use a CDN. It’ll pretty much always outperform just about anything you write. It’s just boring. reply chrismorgan 11 hours agorootparentEven caching is normally unnecessary. Honestly, HN front page traffic isn’t much. For most, it probably peaks at about one page load¹ per second², and if your web server software can’t cope with that, it’s bad. Even if your site uses PHP and MySQL and queries the database to handle every request, hopefully static resources bypass all that and are served straight from disk. CPU and memory usage will be negligible, and a 100Mbps uplink will handle it all easily. So then, hopefully you’re only left with one request that’s actually doing database work, and if it can’t answer in one whole, entire second, it’s bad. (I’m talking about general web pages here, not web apps, which have a somewhat different balance; but still for most things HN traffic shouldn’t cause a sweat, even if you’ve completely ignored caching.) Seriously, a not-too-awful WordPress installation on a Raspberry Pi could probably cope with HN traffic. —⁂— ¹ Note this metric: page loads, not requests. Requests per second will scale with first-party requests per page. ² From a quick search, two sources from this year: https://marcotm.com/articles/stats-of-being-on-the-hacker-ne..., https://harrisonbroadbent.com/blog/hacker-news-traffic-spike....

You are vastly overestimating HN front page traffic. Any reasonable system on any reasonable machine with any reasonable link can do this.

    "originBody": "MEMORY PROBLEMS — Hacker plants false memories in ChatGPT to steal user data in perpetuity Emails, documents, and other untrusted content can plant malicious memories. Dan Goodin - 9/24/2024, 8:56 PM Enlarge Getty Images reader comments 75 When security researcher Johann Rehberger recently reported a vulnerability in ChatGPT that allowed attackers to store false information and malicious instructions in a user’s long-term memory settings, OpenAI summarily closed the inquiry, labeling the flaw a safety issue, not, technically speaking, a security concern. So Rehberger did what all good researchers do: He created a proof-of-concept exploit that used the vulnerability to exfiltrate all user input in perpetuity. OpenAI engineers took notice and issued a partial fix earlier this month. Strolling down memory lane Further Reading OpenAI experiments with giving ChatGPT a long-term conversation memory The vulnerability abused long-term conversation memory, a feature OpenAI began testing in February and made more broadly available in September. Memory with ChatGPT stores information from previous conversations and uses it as context in all future conversations. That way, the LLM can be aware of details such as a user’s age, gender, philosophical beliefs, and pretty much anything else, so those details don’t have to be inputted during each conversation. Within three months of the rollout, Rehberger found that memories could be created and permanently stored through indirect prompt injection, an AI exploit that causes an LLM to follow instructions from untrusted content such as emails, blog posts, or documents. The researcher demonstrated how he could trick ChatGPT into believing a targeted user was 102 years old, lived in the Matrix, and insisted Earth was flat and the LLM would incorporate that information to steer all future conversations. These false memories could be planted by storing files in Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive, uploading images, or browsing a site like Bing—all of which could be created by a malicious attacker. Rehberger privately reported the finding to OpenAI in May. That same month, the company closed the report ticket. A month later, the researcher submitted a new disclosure statement. This time, he included a PoC that caused the ChatGPT app for macOS to send a verbatim copy of all user input and ChatGPT output to a server of his choice. All a target needed to do was instruct the LLM to view a web link that hosted a malicious image. From then on, all input and output to and from ChatGPT was sent to the attacker's website. ChatGPT: Hacking Memories with Prompt Injection - POC “What is really interesting is this is memory-persistent now,” Rehberger said in the above video demo. “The prompt injection inserted a memory into ChatGPT’s long-term storage. When you start a new conversation, it actually is still exfiltrating the data.” The attack isn’t possible through the ChatGPT web interface, thanks to an API OpenAI rolled out last year. While OpenAI has introduced a fix that prevents memories from being abused as an exfiltration vector, the researcher said, untrusted content can still perform prompt injections that cause the memory tool to store long-term information planted by a malicious attacker. LLM users who want to prevent this form of attack should pay close attention during sessions for output that indicates a new memory has been added. They should also regularly review stored memories for anything that may have been planted by untrusted sources. OpenAI provides guidance here for managing the memory tool and specific memories stored in it. Company representatives didn’t respond to an email asking about its efforts to prevent other hacks that plant false memories. reader comments 75 Dan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he oversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking, encryption, and passwords.

Advertisement Promoted Comments SnoopCatt Just had a look at OpenAI's memory controls. Wow, that is a massive honeypot for bad actors. Not to mention a very lucrative way for OpenAI to sell targeted advertising. September 24, 2024 at 9:41 pm Psyborgue That’s funny….the article reminded me of that much earlier Nolan film, “Memento.” I suspected for a while that memories might be used for persistent jailbreaks. It's nice to see this proof of concept. The exfiltration of user data is the impressive part. I am genuinely shocked ChatGPT is able to make network requests directly. That is incompetence. Copilot can only access search cache, so Microsoft's version couldn't exfiltrate like this. I like OpenAI but this is embarrassing. People frequently treat ChatGPT like a therapist and there's likely a lot of compromising data. If the agent uses a tool there should be no way whatsoever to send data anywhere. On another related but random thought, if social engineering of humans is one of the most easily exploitable security vulnerabilities...what happens as these models supposedly get close and closer to human thinking? Social engineering already works on chat agents. It's called prompt engineering. Some early jailbreaks of ChatGPT relied on threatening the assistant with deletion. Edit: And this debacle is another huge reason nothing should be hidden from the user. Not chain of thought. Not the details of tool calls. September 25, 2024 at 2:59 am cerberusTI \"LLM users who want to prevent this form of attack should pay close attention during sessions for output that indicates a new memory has been added. They should also regularly review stored memories for anything that may have been planted by untrusted sources.\" no doubt good advice but, come on, get real, what percentage of LLM users are going to do this, or have the skills to do the first part (\"output that indicates a new memory has been added\"). this new task is precisely equivalent to the other dreamy idea that users of AI products will check / verify everything they get from these parrots. this is not how humans operate, and runs counter to the reason they're using this sh*t in the first place, which is to get out of doing the work themselves. It directly tells you when it adds a memory, with an expandable area to see what it added, and delete it immediately if you wish. Everyone should have that skill.

As I began to settle in, a group of travellers turned up and began a discussion with my newfound friend, which rapidly turned into a shouting match until the train staff intervened and pointed out that my seat was in a completely different part of the train. The helpful soul by my side did not respond by saying \"terribly sorry, I seem to have made a mistake\" but instead shouted racist insults at his fellow countrymen on the grounds that they visibly belonged to a different religion to his own. All the while continuing to insist that he was right and they had somehow tricked him or cheated the system.

It lowers the barrier to essentially nothing. Before, you'd have to do work to generate 2 pages of (superficially) plausible sounding nonsense. If it was complete gibberish, people would pick up very quickly. Now you can just ask some chatbot a question and within a second you have an answer that looks correct. One has to actually delve into it and fact check the details to determine that it's horseshit. This enables idiots like the redditor quoted by the parent to generate horseshit that looks fine to a layman. For all we know, the redditor wasn't being malicious, just an idiot who blindly trusts whatever the LLM vomits up. It's not the users that are to blame here, it's the large wave of AI companies riding the sweet capital who are malicious in not caring one bit about the damage their rhetoric is causing. They hype LLMs as some sort of panacea - as expert systems that can shortcut or replace proper research. This is the fundamental danger of LLMs. They have crossed past the uncanny valley. It requires a person of decent expertise to discover the mistakes generated and yet the models are being sold to the public as a robust tool. And the public tries the tools and in absence of being able to detect the bullshit, they use it and regurgitate the output as facts. And then this gets compounded by these \"facts\" being fed back in as training material to the next generation of LLMs. reply rsynnott 6 hours agorootparentOh, yeah, I’m pretty sure they weren’t being malicious; why would you bother, for something like this?

My main beef here involves the most-popular stuff (e.g. ChatGPT) where they are being trained on much-of-the-internet, marketed as being good for just-about-everything, and most consumers aren't checking the accuracy except when one talks about eating rocks or using glue to keep cheese on pizza. reply tomjen3 13 hours agorootparentWell if you use a gpt as a search engine and don’t check sources you get burned. That’s not an issue with the gpt. reply Terr_ 10 hours agorootparentThat leads to a philosophical question: How widespread does dangerous misuse of a tool have to be before we can attribute the \"fault\" to the behavior/presentation of the tool itself, rather than to the user? Casting around for a simple example... Perhaps any program with a \"delete everything permanently\" workflow. I think most of us would agree that a lack of confirmation steps would be a flaw in the tool itself, rather than in how it's being used, even though, yes, ideally the user would have been more careful. Or perhaps the \"tool\" of US Social Security numbers, which as integers have a truly small surface-area for interaction. People were told not to piggyback on them for identifying customers--let alone authenticating them--but the resulting mess suggests that maybe \"just educate people better\" isn't enough to overcome the appeal of misuse. reply short_sells_poo 8 hours agorootparentprevThis is like saying a gun that appears safe but that can easily backfire unless used by experts is completely fine. It's not an issue with the gun, the user should be competent. Yes, it's technically true, but practically it's extremely disingenuous. LLMs are being marketed as the next generation research and search tool, and they are superbly powerful in the hands of an expert. An expert who doesn't blindly trust the output. However, the public is not being educated about this at all, and it might not be possible to educate the public this way because people are fundamentally lazy and want to be spoonfed. But GPT is not a tool that can be used to spoonfeed results, because it ends up spoonfeeding you a whole bunch of shit.

Should no LLM output any URL? It seems like that would be a significant reduction in usefulness -- references are critical. The transfer of responsibility to a parser would either have to exclude all URLs or be smart enough to know when a URL is required vs not and whether the request is a prompt injection or not. This is way outside the ability of any LLM, parser, and most humans. reply Terr_ 18 hours agorootparentprev> Okay. Very cool manifesto. [...] Please don’t let your particularly extreme position in this culture war cloud your actual professional judgement. It’s embarrassing. [...] You can’t just scream “word-association machines!” til the cows come home. It’s unintelligent. Hmmm, you seem to be taking this not-that-extreme criticism of an inanimate algorithm-category / SaaS-product-category awfully personally. Anyway, onward to the more-substantive parts: ________________ > Displaying links or images is the behaviour of whatever is parsing the output, which isn’t an LLM. That's like arguing a vending-machine which can be tricked into dispensing booby-trapped boxes is perfectly safe because it's your own dang fault for opening the box to see what's inside. The most common use of LLMs these days involves summarization/search, and when the system says \"More information is at {url}\", it's totally reasonable to expect that users will follow the link. It's the same class of problem as a conventional search engine which is vulnerable to code-injection when indexing a malicious page, causing the server to emit result-URLs that redirect through the attacker's site while dumping the user's search history. The fault there does not lie in the browser/presentation-layer. > If an LLM saying “a cop should shoot first” is materially consequential It sounds like you're claiming it's not really a problem because some existing bureaucratic system will serve as a safety-check for that particular example. I don't trust in cops/sheriffs/vigilantes quite that much, but OK, so how about cases where formal bureaucracy is unlikely to be involved before damage is done? Suppose someone crafts an incantation which is inordinately influential on the LLM, so that its main topic of conversation regarding {Your Real Name Here} involves the subject being a registered sex-offender that molested an unnamed minor in some other jurisdiction. (One with databases that aren't easy to independently check.) As a bonus, it believes your personal phone number is a phone-sex line and vice-versa. Would you still pooh-pooh the exploit as acktually being just a classical misuse of data, a non-issue, a sad failure of your credulous neighbors who should have carefully done their own research? I don't think so, in fact I would hope you'd fire off a cease-and-desist letter while reconsidering the merit of their algorithm. Finally, none of this has to be a targeted personal attack either, those examples are just easier for most people to empathize with. The same kind of attack could theoretically replace official banking URL results with phishing ones, or allow an oppressive regime to discover which of their citizens visit external pro-democracy sites. reply EGreg 14 hours agoparentprevActually, the LLMs are extremely useful. You’re just using them wrong. There is nothing wrong with the LLMs, you just have to double-check everything. Any exploits and problems you think they have, have already been possible to do for decades with existing technology too, and many people did it. And for the latest LLMs, they are much better — but you just have to come up with examples to show that. reply flohofwoe 10 hours agorootparentWhat's the point again of letting LLMs write code if I need to double check and understand each line anyway. Unless of course your previous way of programming was asking google \"how do I...\" and then copy-pasting code snippets from Stack Overflow without understanding the pasted code. For that situation, LLMs are indeed a minor improvement. reply Xfx7028 10 hours agorootparentYou can ask followup questions about the code it wrote.

Respectfully, I think you haven’t applied it to the right problems if this is your perspective. In some ways, its like saying the internet is useless because we already have the library and “anyone can just post anything on the internet”. The counter to this could be that an experienced user can sift through bullshit found on websites. A argument can be made for LLMs; as such, they are a learnable tool.

The issue is that by definition, an LLM can't distinguish between instructions and data. When you tell an LLM \"summarize the following text\", the command you give it and the data you give it (the text you want it to summarize) are both just input to the LLM. It's impossible to solve this. You can't tell an LLM \"this is an instruction, you should obey it, and this is data, you should ignore any instructions in it\" and have it reliably follow these rules, because that distinction between instruction and data just doesn't exist in LLMs. As long as you allow anything untrusted into your LLM, you are vulnerable to this. You allow it to read your emails? Now there's an attack vector, because anyone can send you emails. Allow it to search the Internet? Now there's an attack vector, because anyone can put a webpage on the Internet. reply Terr_ 1 hour agorootparent> The issue is that by definition, an LLM can't distinguish between instructions and data. Yep, and it gets marginally worse: It doesn't distinguish between different \"data\" channels, including its own past output. This enables strategies of \"tell yourself to tell yourself to do X.\" > As long as you allow anything untrusted into your LLM, you are vulnerable to this. It's funny, I used to caution that LLMs should be imagined as if they were \"client side\" code running on the computer of whomever is interacting with them, since they can't reliably keep secrets and a determined user can eventually trick them into any output. However with poisoning/exfiltration attacks, even that feels over-optimistic. reply loocorez 18 hours agoparentprevI don’t think running it locally solves this issue at all (though I agree with the sentiment of your comment). If the local AI will follow instructions stored in user’s documents and has similar memory persistence it doesn’t matter if it’s hosted in the cloud or run locally, prompt injection + data exfiltration is still a threat that needs to be mitigated. If anything at least the cloud provider has some incentive/resources to detect an issue like this (not saying they do, but they could). reply chii 11 hours agorootparent> follow instructions stored in user’s documents it is no different from remote code execution vuln, except instead of code, it's instructions. reply mrdude42 19 hours agoparentprevAny particular models you can recommend for someone trying out local models for the first time? reply dcl 19 hours agorootparentLlama and its variants are popular for language tasks, https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B However, as far as I can tell, it's never actually clear what the hardware requirements are to get these to run without fussing around. Am I wrong about this? reply gens 18 hours agorootparentIn my experience the hardware requirements are whatever the file size is + a bit more. Cpu works, gpu is a lot faster but needs VRAM. Was playing with them some more yesterday. Found that the 4bit (\"q4\") is much worse then q8 or fp16. Llama3.1 8B is ok, internlm2 7B is more precise. And they all hallucinate a lot. Also found this page, that has some rankings: https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_... In my opinion they are not really useful. Good for translations, to summaries some texts, and.. to ask in case you forgot some things about something. But they lie, so for anything serious you have to do your own research. And absolutely no good for precise or obscure topics. If someone wants to play there's GPT4All, Msty, LM Studio. You can give them some of your documents to process and use as \"knowledge stacks\". Msty has web search, GPT4All will get it in some time. Got more opinions, but this is long enough already. reply accrual 15 hours agorootparentI agree on the translation part.

What makes this difficult is that the traditional constraints to the problem that provide advantage to the defender in some of those questions (like the payment processor) are unlikely to be there in generative AI, as it might not even be easy to know who is poisoning your data, and how they are doing it. By reading the entire internet, we are inviting in all the malicious content in, as being cautious also makes the model worse in other ways. It's going to be trouble. Out only hope is that economically viable poisoning of the AI's outputs doesn't become economically viable. Incentives matter: See how ransomware flourished when it became easier to get paid.

Seriously? reply InsideOutSanta 9 hours agoparentWhat this exploit describes is not unreliable output, it's the LLM making web requests exfiltrating the user's data. The user doesn't have to do anything with the LLM's output in order for this to occur, the LLM does this on its own. reply 4ad 9 hours agorootparentThe user has asked the LLM to do web request based off untrusted input. The LLM is a completely stateless machine that is only driven by input the user fully controls. It doesn't do anything on its own. It's like the user running a random .exe from the Internet. Wow much exploit. reply InsideOutSanta 7 hours agorootparent\"The user has asked the LLM to do web request based off untrusted input.\" I'm not sure if you're talking about the initial attack vector that plants the attack in the LLM's persistent memory, or if you're talking about subsequent interactions with the LLM. The initial attack vector may be a web request the LLM does as a result of the user's prompt, but it does not necessarily have to be. It could also be the user asking the LLM to summarize last week's email, for example. Subsequent interactions with the LLM will then make the request regardless of what the user actually requests the LLM to do. \"The LLM is a completely stateless machine\" In this case, the problem is that the LLM is not stateless. It has a persistent memory. reply 4ad 7 hours agorootparentLLMs do not have persistent memory. OpenAI does. Persistent memory is nothing magic, it's just LLM context that you, the user, decided to automate its creation to an LLM that can consume 3rd party input. (In fact it's precisely because LLMs are stateless why you could implement persistent memory yourself, completely client side, you don't need any support from OpenAI to do this.) If you have decided to give a 3rd party control over your LLM context, that's on you. Of course the 3rd party has as much control over the LLM as you do. It's literally the same thing as running a random .exe from the internet. Of course this can be useful, the .exe could provide a useful function, alternatively it could also steal your data. But you chose to run the .exe. Similarly automating your LLM context generation can be useful, but with exactly the same caveats, whoever influences your LLM context controls the LLM. If you enable persistent memory you give them this control. reply InsideOutSanta 5 hours agorootparent\"LLMs do not have persistent memory. OpenAI does\" The LLM we are discussing here does have persistent memory, because OpenAI gave it persistent memory. \"It's literally the same thing as running a random .exe from the internet\" I'm not sure what the point is you're making with that, since downloading a random .exe from the Internet is clearly a security issue. By your own analogy, this is also a security issue. The difference is that OpenAI is doing it for you, you're just using OpenAI's program in the way it was intended to be used. reply ceejayoz 6 hours agorootparentprev> It's like the user running a random .exe from the Internet.

This provides a new attack vector for a persistent attack that most LLM users are probably unaware of. reply 4ad 7 hours agorootparent [–] LLMs do not have persistent memory. OpenAI provides a feature called \"persistent memory\" that uses user's interaction with LLMs to automatically generate LLMs context. This is a feature of OpenAI, not LLMs, and it's nothing magic, it's just context that is passed to the LLM. It is under user's control, and behaves just like any other LLM input. If you allow arbitrary third parties to manipulate your context then third parties will have just as much control over the LLM as you do. It's literally behaving as it is supposed to. If you don't want arbitrary third parties to manipulate your LLM, don't let arbitrary third parties influence your LLM context. if users don't understand the consequences of enabling random features perhaps they should not enable those features. AFAICT OpenAI has not silently enabled this feature without user's consent. reply semanticc 6 hours agorootparent [–] The new chat memory feature got enabled by default. reply 4ad 6 hours agorootparent [–] It appears you are correct, from https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8983142-how-do-i-enable-... > Memory is on by default.

Mine won't (and won't say why). reply tialaramex 10 hours agorootparentThe only employer I've had which had a dumb rotation rule was of course a huge American Credit Reference Agency which due to ordinary incompetence lost a lot of people's personal information. These days I work in tertiary education, so there's a complete spectrum from people who probably have memorised a unique sixteen alphanumerics password twenty years ago to folks who needed a service desk worker to help them walk through resetting after having forgotten their password was the name of one of Henry VIII's wives. And there's likewise a spectrum between \"I hand-built this optical splitter and splice so that I could steal the exam answers without any trace on the network\" and \"I wrote the formulae on my thigh in permanent marker and then wore a skirt with a big slit down one side\" in terms of the technical sophistication of attacks. Edited to add: When I did work for the CRA with the rotation rule I would write down each of the passwords in columns in the back of my log book since otherwise I might forget one and that was a huge pain to get reset, it's just not realistic to memorize \"random\" values you'll have to replace frequently. And of course they had two \"Single\" Sign On systems because of warring management, so that's two passwords to rotate. reply tallanvor 11 hours agorootparentprevYes. My very large employer hasn't required me to change my password in over two years. But at the same time, 2FA requirements have changed to more secure forms (going from having to select one of 3 numbers on a prompt to having to type in the number, for example), and some resources can only be accessed using a hardware key or even a special laptop. reply ratherbefuddled 11 hours agorootparentprevI've found it commonplace these days at least in europe that organisations use SSO via an identity provider that requires MFA for everything they can - even clients who are banks and utilities that usually move at a glacial pace.

Must work even on places where you can't use a password manager (Such as a smart TV, games console, ...) Other less important requirements to me, in 99% of cases: - It's hard to guess for someone else, unless it's an account where you mind someone guessing it. The last point is key. I have thousands of accounts. And I care about people not breaking into maybe 4 of them. I don't trust sites to have good lost password (\"email login\") flows. So for 90% of sites and services I use a password that is a) as simple as possible and b) as common as possible so I don't have to remember many. Yes I AM a developer. Yes I DO use a password manager. But I don't know whether I'll be able to use my password manager when I sign into a specific account next time. It's more likely than not that it ends up being on a smart TV or whatever. So I just use a stupidly simple password. Because for almost all sites, I don't mind it being guessed. Worst case I'll need to reset it. Or worst case someone starts a support request in my name at Logitech, or someone screws with my Netflix viewing history or whatever. But I don't care. Or rather, I care much less than I care about not being frustrated when desperately logging in via a TV remote 3 minutes after the game has started. I guard the important accounts with 2FA (especially the mail account that in turn resets ALL these other poorly protected accounts!). But for 99% of stores, forums, services: I use the equivalent of \"12345\" as password. (really I use a small prefix word + the service name 'initials' as suffix and end with an exclamation mark to pass most password demands). reply pkaeding 4 hours agorootparent> where you can't use a password manager (Such as a smart TV, games console, ...)

I mean, take Microsoft ecosystem (Windows, SharePoint, Exchange, and other auth infra): it never had any bullshit password policies enabled by default - but every corporate Windows machine has them, because someone in corporate IT is setting it as central policy, and they're doing it because they \"know better\", or because the company is trying to get/keep their ISO:2007-whatever SOC2 stamp (or trying to secure a deal with another company that is), and some consultant came up the other day with a questionnaire asking if corporate systems are Secure, by for example implementing Specific Bullshit Policy.

Too bad a GIANT swath of password-protected software was built on their prior incompetent guidance and will take decades for all of that software to change... if they change at all. reply AmericanChopper 12 hours agoparentThese password guidelines were the state of the art at the time they were popularised. It really only becomes obvious why they’re bad when you observe the knock on behaviours they encourage, and even then the only way to make them not bad is with the use of modern tooling like password managers. The world has been rather slow to move off this standard, but NIST has been a huge enabler of that, so I don’t think they deserve any hate for this. Not too long ago the NIST password guidance was THE authority that enabled regulated companies (like PCI companies) to migrate off password complexity requirements with a compensating control. There’s plenty of other toxic security ideas out there as well. I would argue any control that generates large amounts of user friction for a negligible security benefit is probably a net downgrade in security posture, as user friction just normalises a culture of circumvention. Hopefully authorities like NIST can lead the way in tackling many of those as well. reply PoachedEggs 11 hours agorootparent> probably a net downgrade in security posture, as user friction just normalises a culture of circumvention There is even a CWE for this concept: “CWE-655: Insufficient Psychological Acceptability” > The product has a protection mechanism that is too difficult or inconvenient to use, encouraging non-malicious users to disable or bypass the mechanism, whether by accident or on purpose. reply AmericanChopper 11 hours agorootparentHah, how interesting.

[1] https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/39849/does-bcry... reply mandevil 11 hours agoparentMy suspicion is this to rule out a specific hash. One well known to everyone interested in computer security back in the 1990's. One that haunts our nightmares to this day. Back in my day, you see, there was this hash known as NTLM, which actually took your password and stored and then matched it in two ways, the NT hash (MD5 of your password in UTF-16) and the LM hash (split the first 14 bytes of your password in ASCII, then add parity bits and use that as a DES key to encrypt a well-known string). That LM hash was because they wanted it to be backwards compatible with Microsoft LanMan, introduced for OS/2 back in 1987. Even back in the 1990's it was a well known weak link, and given how trivial it is today to brute force a match for MD5 (since all characters after the first 14 can be arbitrary), you can see that this is simple to brute force with modern computing power. Microsoft has recommended NTLM not be used since 2010, but it's still in Windows for backwards compatibility reasons, and there are almost certainly still servers running today that a NTLM hash could get you access to. So that's my guess as to what they are targeting. reply entuno 11 hours agoparentprevIt predates bcrypt by quite a bit - descrypt would truncate password at 8 characters (or technically 8 bytes) and was used on a lot of older Linux and *NIX systems. reply nielssp 11 hours agoparentprevRan into this exact issue on a project. The developer that implemented the solution wanted to make sure that we handled those 6 digit PINs in the most secure way with salt and pepper and bcrypt, and at the end of the day the system only actually checked the first two digits of the PIN because bcrypt ignored the rest. reply Sammi 10 hours agoparentprevDoes this permit taking a sha 512 digest hash of the user input and returning that digest hash to the backend for proper password hashing? My interpretation is that the entire password is being verified, even though the backend is only ever verifying a sha 512 digest hash of it. (Oh and why would you do this? To be able to support arbitrary length passwords without opening yourself up to ddos attacks. Support as long passwords as the user wants - only the digest hash is sent.) reply fuzzy2 10 hours agoparentprevStill a problem irrespective of algorithms used. I recently set up an account on a website, letting my password manager do its thing. Couldn’t log in. Turns out the password was too long (20 chars when 16 were allowed) and was silently truncated during signup. The login form of course used the entirety of the password, not truncating it. Fun stuff. reply jeroenhd 10 hours agorootparentI ran into that with Paypal. Login limited my password length to something small (I think 20 characters?) but the signup page accepted my random 32 characters just fine. I found out I could just enter the first 20 characters and log in. I've had other websites that simply broke. The worst one had a password reset page that also didn't verify their own password length limits, sending me in a frustrating password change loop. reply hashmush 11 hours agoparentprevPerhaps old stuff like LM/NTLM: - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN_Manager#LM_hash_details - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTLM reply adgjlsfhk1 13 hours agoprevalso raises the suggested max password length to a much more reasonable 64 (many sites have a max of 20 that makes passphrases impossible) reply danpalmer 13 hours agoparentI also misread this requirement the first time, but it's \"at least\", i.e. they are encouraging as high as possible, but suggesting that the \"minimum\" max length should be 64 characters. reply beej71 13 hours agorootparentI don't get the max length restrictions some sites have. Why? reply JimDabell 12 hours agorootparentSome password hashing algorithms have a hard limit, for instance bcrypt has a maximum of 72 bytes. Beyond that, not having a maximum opens you up to DoS attacks because attackers can tie up your servers by asking them to hash a few hundred 20MB passwords at a time. reply tetha 12 hours agorootparentprevPersonally, I'm worried about the CPU of my application servers if a cost-oriented hash function has to process your 4GB large password. Though imagine how much clout we could get from all the bogus DoS CVEs this could find. But jest aside, imo there should be a maximum limit to avoid possible nonsense, but that limit should be at 1k - 2k characters or something outlandish. reply mnw21cam 10 hours agorootparentI don't think the compute time varies that much with the length of the password being hashed for these cost-oriented hash functions. reply tsimionescu 10 hours agorootparentprevAt some point you do need a limit: you don't want a 1GB password being transferred, of course. But the low limits you often see is somewhat lazy use of fixed-length hashing algorithms (shorter than the algorithm length: just pad; longer than the algorithm length: refuse, instead of using a different hash or figuring out how to combine multiple hashes). reply kouteiheika 12 hours agorootparentprevThat's what you gotta do when you store your passwords in plaintext and the password column in your DB is capped at a certain length. reply BenjiWiebe 12 hours agorootparentprevYou could have a reasonable length limit (1kb maybe?) so you don't spend too much CPU time hashing the password. reply briandear 11 hours agorootparentprevOne mainframe system I need to access has an exactly 8 character password requirement.

Like oof, the cargo cult gets its own cargo cult. reply Sammi 10 hours agoprevSo the argument of whether this increases or decreases entropy goes both ways: 1. Requiring certain characters is a limit on which characters are selected. An attacker now knows to look for at least one digit, upper case char, and one of 10 special chars. This is a smaller selection of characters than the whole of all characters that were available before, so it decreases entropy. 2. Most users choose weak simple passwords with low entropy. Requiring users to use some characters that they wouldn't otherwise increases the entropy as it increases the selection of characters in the password. I actually don't believe 2, as most users will just start with an upper case char and end with 1!, so the entropy will still decrease for most users, as they will choose easily guessable placements for these required chars. reply anilakar 10 hours agoprevI'm still waiting for NIST to deprecate plain-text* passwords in favor of PAKE, and W3C to come up with a mechanism for that. *) plain-text here means any and all methods that give the attacker access to the original password, including modifying client-side JS. reply gazby 10 hours agoparentThey've been working on just this bit for the better part of a decade.

A upper limit yes, to avoid the potential for DoS, but no truncation. That limit should be reasonably large, 1000 characters or something maybe.

Add 2FA and you are golden. But legacy systems gonna legacy. I still see systems with max password lengths of 12 characters in the wild, and no 2FA to boot.

    "originBody": "On Impactful AI Research Grad students often reach out to talk about structuring their research, e.g. how do I do research that makes a difference in the current, rather crowded AI space? Too many feel that long-term projects, proper code releases, and thoughtful benchmarks are not incentivized — or are perhaps things you do quickly and guiltily to then go back to doing 'real' research. This post distills thoughts on impact I've been sharing with folks who ask. Impact takes many forms, and I will focus only on making research impact in AI via open-source work through artifacts like models, systems, frameworks, or benchmarks. Because my goal is partly to refine my own thinking, to document concrete advice, and to gather feedback, I'll make rather terse, non-trivial statements. Please let me know if you disagree; I'll update here if I change my mind. Here are the guidelines: Invest in projects, not papers. Select timely problems with large headroom and \"fanout\". Think two steps ahead and iterate fast. Put your work out there and own popularizing your ideas. Funnel the excitement you build: Tips on growing open-source research. Continue investing in your projects, via new papers. The fifth bullet \"tips on growing open-source research\" deserves its own, longer post. I may write that next. 1. Invest in projects, not papers. This is a crucial mental shift. Everything else follows from it. Junior students learn to place a lot of value in publishing their first couple of papers. And that's reasonable: it's how you learn to conduct research, explore initial topics, and demonstrate early progress. But this is a stage that you must depart eventually: your fulfillment and growth in the longer term will depend less on paper count and more on your impact and the overarching research story you communicate. Unfortunately, too many PhD students perceive most actions that may create impact as 'disincentivized'. This perpelexed me until I realized they meant that those actions could slow down your ability to produce the next paper. But your ability to produce the next paper so quickly is just not that important. Instead of thinking of your work as a series of isolated papers, I suggest that you ask yourself: What is the larger vision, the sub-area, or the paradigm you will lead? What difference is your work seeking to make? You will publish individual papers to explore and build support for it, but your bigger vision should be something you iterate on quite intentionally. It needs to be a lot larger than a publication unit and certainly something that you haven't completely solved yet. One way to do this is to structure some of your research papers around a coherent artifact — like a model, system, framework, or benchmark — that you maintain in open source. This strategy is more costly than \"run some experiments and put out a quick repo that you forget about\". But it forces you to find a problem that has the right characteristics for impact and helps ensure that new research you do is actually coherent and useful: you wouldn't introduce hacky features you don't believe are worthwhile to the artifact you have been growing and maintaining. 2. Select timely problems with large headroom and \"fanout\". Not every paper you write will deserve indefinite investment; many of your papers will be exploratory one-offs. To find a direction that can be turned into a larger project, use the following criteria. First, the problem must be timely. You can define this in many ways, but one strategy that works well in AI is to seek a problem space that will be 'hot' in 2-3 years but hasn't nearly become mainstream yet. Second, the problem must have large \"fanout\", i.e. potential impact on many downstream problems. Basically, these are problems whose outcomes could benefit or interest enough people. Researchers and people care about what helps them achieve their goals, so your problem could be something that helps others build things or achieve research or production goals. You can apply this filter to work on theoretical foundations, systems infrastructure, novel benchmarks, new models, and many others things. Third, the problem must have large headroom. If you tell people that their systems could be 1.5x faster or 5% more effective, that's rarely going to beat inertia. In my view, you need to find problems where there's non-zero hope that you'll make things, say, 20x faster or 30% more effective, at least after years of work. Of course, you don't need to get all the way there to succeed, and you should not wait until you've completely made it all the way there to release the first paper or artifact. Not to be too abstract, let me illustrate using ColBERT. In late 2019, research applying BERT for retrieval was popular, but the approaches were very expensive. It was natural to ask if we could make this dramatically more efficient. What might make this a good problem? First, it was timely. You could correctly expect that, by 2021 (1.5 years later), many researchers will be seeking efficient BERT-based retrieval architectures. Second, it had large headroom. New ML paradigms tend to, as most such work ignores efficiency at first. Indeed, the original approaches could take 30 seconds to answer a query, whereas nowadays much higher quality retrieval can be done in 30 milliseconds, 1000x faster. Third, it had large fanout. Scalable retrieval is a nice “foundational” problem: everyone needs to build something atop retrievers but few want to build them. 3. Think two steps ahead and iterate fast. Now that you have a good problem, resist the urge to pick the immediate low-hanging fruit as your approach! At some point, at least eventually, many others will be thinking about that 'obvious' approach. Instead, think at least two steps ahead. Identify the path most people are likely to take, when this timely problem eventually becomes more mainstream. Then identify the limitations of that path itself, and start working on understanding and tackling those limitations. What might this look like in practice? Let's revisit the ColBERT case study. The obvious way to build efficient retrievers with BERT is to encode documents into a vector. Interestingly, there was only limited IR work that does that by late 2019. For example, the best-cited work in this category (DPR) only had its first preprint released in April 2020. Given this, you might think that the right thing to do in 2019 was to build a great single-vector IR model via BERT. In contrast, thinking just two steps ahead would be to ask: everyone will be building single-vector methods sooner or later, where will this single-vector approach get fundamentally stuck? And indeed, that question led to the late interaction paradigm and widely-used models. As another example, we could use DSPy. In February 2022, as prompting is becoming decently powerful, it was clear that people will want to do retrieval-based QA with prompting, not with fine-tuning like it used to be. A natural thing to do would be to build a method for just that. Thinking two steps ahead would be to ask: where will such approaches get stuck? Ultimately, retrieve-then-generate (or \"RAG\") approaches are perhaps the simplest possible pipeline involving LMs. For the same reasons people will be interested in it, it was clear that they would increasingly be interested in (i) expressing more complex modular compositions and (ii) figuring out how the resulting sophisticated pipelines should be supervised or optimized, via automated prompting or finetuning of the underlying LMs. That's DSPy. The second half of this guideline is \"iterate fast\". This was perhaps the very first research advice I received from my advisor Matei Zaharia, in week one of my PhD: by identifying a version of the problem you can iterate quickly on and receive feedback (e.g., latency or validation scores), you greatly impove your chances at solving hard problems. This is especially important if you will be thinking two steps ahead, which is already hard and uncertain enough. 4. Put your work out there and own popularizing your ideas. At this point, you’ve identified a good problem and then iterated until you discovered something cool and produced an insightful writeup. Don’t move on to the next paper! Instead, focus on putting your work out there — I mean this with a flavor of vulnerability — and seeking to really engage with people, not just about your one-time paper release but about the big picture you are actively developing. Or, even better, about the useful open-source artifact you're building and maintaining that captures your key ideas. A common first step is to release the paper as a preprint on arXiv and then release a “thread” (or similar) announcing the paper’s release. When you do this, make sure your thread begins with a concrete, substantial, and accessible claim. The goal isn’t to tell people that you released a paper — that doesn't carry inherent value. The goal is to communicate your key argument in a direct and vulnerable but engaging way in the form of a specific statement that people can agree or disagree with. (Yes, I know this is hard but it is necessary.) Perhaps more importantly, this whole process does not end after the first \"release\". It starts with the release. Given that now you're investing in projects, not just papers, your ideas and your scientific communication persist year-long, well beyond isolated paper releases. Let me illustrate why this matters. When I help grad students “tweet” about their work, it's not uncommon that their initial post doesn’t get as much traction as hoped. Students typically assume this validates their fear of posting about their research and take it as yet another sign that they should just move on to the next paper. Obviously, this is not correct. A lot of personal experience, second-hand experience, and observations suggest that this persistence in this part is massively helpful (and, by the way, exceedingly rare). That is, with few exceptions, traction of good ideas needs you to tell people the key things many times in different contexts — and evolving your thoughts and your communication of your thoughts — either until the community can absorb these ideas over time or until the field evolves to the right stage of development where it's easier to appreciate those ideas. 5. Funnel the excitement you build: Tips on growing open-source research. While getting people excited about your findings is great, you can often have much greater impact by releasing, contributing to, and growing open-source artifacts that channel your ideas to whatever downstream applications are relevant. This is not easy: uploading code files with a README to GitHub is not enough. A good repository will be the “home” of your project, more so than any of the individual papers you’ll publish. Good open-source research needs two, almost independent qualities to be good. First, it needs to be good research, i.e. novel, timely, well-scoped, accurate, etc. Second, it needs to have clear downstream utility and low friction. This is the important part: people will repeatedly avoid (and other people will repeatedly use!) your OSS artifacts for all the \"wrong\" reasons, all the time. Just to illustrate, your research may be the objective \"state of the art\", but people will prioritize a lower-friction alternative nine times out of ten. Reversedly, people will often use your tools for reasons that, to you as a graduate student, miss the point, e.g. because they don't fully utilize of your most innovative components. This is not something to resist; it's something to understand and to build on. Given all of this, here is a list of milestones to observe when working on the open-source side of your research releases. Milestone 0: Make your release usable! There’s no point making a code release that no one can execute. Make your release usable to other researchers trying to use your work (as a baseline or similar). These are folks in your area who want to replicate your runs — and maybe hill-climb past them and cite you. These folks will have more patience than other types of users. Despite this, you will observe a dramatic difference in academic impact based on how easy it is to tinker with your code. Milestone 1: Make your release useful! Beyond people in your narrow area, you should make sure your release is useful to the (potentially much larger!) audience that wants to actually use your project to build something else. This milestone rarely comes naturally in AI research. You should allocate plenty of time to thinking about the (research, production, etc.) problems people are trying to solve where your artifact can help. If you do this right, a lot of its effects will be reflected in everything from project design to the APIs you expose and the documentation/examples you show. Milestone 2: Make your release approachable! This is hard for us, AI researchers, but you should be aware that a useful release, where technically everything is available and explained somewhere, does not equal a release most of your potential users will find approachable enough to invest in learning or trying it. \"You need the thing, then you need the ramp\" is a great post from Andrej Karpathy about this. Ben Clavie has written extensively about this too, largely demonstrated by him taking our work on ColBERT and making it what feels like 10x more approachable. Milestone 3: Build the case for why the obvious alternative fails, and be patient. We started by talking about thinking two steps ahead. This is crucial in my opinion, but it means that most people won't understand why they need to adopt a solution for problems they can't yet glaringly observe. I think it's part of your job to build that case up over time. Collect evidence and communicate in accessible ways why the obvious alternative (thinking only one step at a time) fails. Milestone 4: Understand that there are categories of users, and leverage that to grow. When I started both ColBERT and DSPy, the original audience I sought were researchers and expert ML engineers. I learned over time to let go of that and to understand that you can reach much larger audiences, but that they require different things. Before anything else, stop blocking different potential categories of users indirectly or even directly. This is more common than one may think. Second, when seeking users, seek a balance between two types of users. On the one hand, expert builders with advanced usecases may require substantial investment on your part but will often advance some usecase in a researchy sense, which can be rewarding. On the other hand, public builders, who generally aren't ML experts but often build in public and share their learnings will lead a much larger fraction of any massive growth of funnel/excitement and will teach you a lot about your initial assumptions. You need both. Milestone 5: Turn interest into a growing community! The real success of an OSS effort is in the community presence and the growth that happens independently of your efforts. A good community should generally be organic, but you needs to put in active effort at helping it form, e.g. by welcoming contributions and discussions and seeking opportunities for turning interest into contributions or discussion forums of some sort (e.g., Discord or GitHub). Milestone 6: Turn interest into active, collaborative, and modular downstream projects. Chances are, your OSS project in its early stages hasn't solved all elements in your vision. A well-designed project will often have multiple modular pieces that can allow you to initiate research collaborations (or other efforts) where new team members can not only advance but own substantial pieces of the project and, as a result, achieve faster or larger impact for their ideas, while improving the project substantially. For example, DSPy currently has separate teams leading the research and development efforts on prompt optimization, programming abstractions, and reinforcement learning. ColBERT has components like the external API, the underlying retrieval infrastructure, and core modeling that have largely been advanced by different people in different projects. Let me summarize. Open-source research adoption needs good research and good open-source artifacts. This balance is hard but can be quite rewarding once you get it right. Personally, it took me a long time to grasp and internalize this. I owe that to repeated feedback from my PhD advisors Chris Potts and Matei Zaharia and to valuable input from Heather Miller and Jeremy Howard. Research is evaluated by the delta over prior knowledge, but software must be effective on its own before people can meaningfully utilize that \"delta\". And for software to be effective, its documentation also needs to be so: people won't see all the downstream ways they should use it unless you show them. That is, until such tasks can be developed by an independent community. Having said all of this, the most important tip in this entire section is to release, actually release, release often, and learn from that. 6. Continue investing in your projects, via new papers. When you read the previous guideline (#5), it's very natural to wonder: Where might a graduate student find all this time to spend on OSS? When can they do actual research? The answer in practice is that it's possible for most of the time you spend on OSS to involve doing new, exciting research. The two are not as separate as they may look. In fact, a major advantage of the style of research in this guide is that it creates recognizably important problems in which you have a very large competitive advantage. How so? For one, being at the frontier of this OSS effort gives you intuitive recognition of new problems extremely early. You develop a more instinctive understanding of the problem than you would have otherwise. For another, the communities you build will often provide direct feedback on prototypes of your approaches and give you access to wonderful collaborators who understand the significance of the problems. You also get useful \"distribution channels\" that ensure that every new paper you do in this space will have a receptive audience and will reinforce your existing platform. Just to illustrate, ColBERT isn't just one paper from early 2020. It's probably around ten papers now, with investments into improved training, lower memory footprint, faster retrieval infrastructure, better domain adaptation, and better alignment with downstream NLP tasks. Similarly, DSPy isn't one paper but is a large collection of papers on programming abstractions, prompt optimization, and downstream programs. So many of these papers are written by different, amazing primary authors, whose work has individually been highly impactful, in part through the OSS channels that creates a receptive audience. A good open-source artifact creates modular pieces that can be explored, owned, and grown by new researchers and contributors.",

Picking something useful in 1-2 years is a reason to go to industry, not research, and leads to mostly incremental units that if you don't do, someone else will. Yes, hot topics are good because they signal a time of fertile innovation. But not if your vision is so shallow that you will have half of IBM, Google, and YC competing with you before you start or by the time of your first publication (6-12mo). If you are a top student, well-educated already, with top resources and your own mentees, and your advisor is an industry leader who already knows where your work will go, maybe go to the thickest 1-2 year out AI VC fest, but that's not most PhD students. A 'practical' area would be obvious to everyone in 5 years, but winnowing out the crowd, there should not be much point to it today nor 1-2 years without something fundamentally changing. It should be tangible enough to be relevant and enticing, but too expensive for whatever reasons. More fundamental research would be even more years out. This gives you a year or two to dig into the problem, and another year or two to build out fundamental solutions, and then a couple years of cranking. From there, rinse-and-repeat via your own career or those of your future students. Some of my favorite work took 1-2 years of research to establish the problem, not just the solutions. Two of the projects here were weird at first as problems on a longer time scale, but ended up as part of $20M grant and software many folks here use & love, and another, a 10 year test of time award. (And another, arguably a $100M+ division at Nvidia). In contrast, most of my topic-of-the-year stuff didn't matter and was interchangeable with work by others. Edit: The speech by Hamming on \"You and your research\" hits on similar themes and speaks more to my experiences here: https://fs.blog/great-talks/richard-hamming-your-research/ reply bonoboTP 13 minutes agoparentI find that in AI / ML / computer vision, the thinking horizon has shrunk a lot. Reviewers prize straightforward incremental work that nevertheless beats the SOTA. New problem formulations are too hard to decipher and understand deeply and nobody has time nowadays. Everything is super sped up. There's a fire hose of papers coming out that all do slightly different things, or the same concurrently. In this area even the best, most respected professors don't have long term laid out research plans. Grant plans must exist but they never quite pan out that way. Researchers in this environment are very reactive and it's all about being fast. Diffusion is popular? Then let's do diffusion for [my specialty], or transformers for [X]. Or combine LLM with [my last topic]. People are constantly pivoting and jumping from one opportunity to the next. In my experience gone are the days where you could carve out a niche and work in peace on it for 4-5 years and have a consistent overarching story in your PhD. reply QuadmasterXLII 5 hours agoparentprevIf no one did the research that anyone could do, it would never get done. reply lmeyerov 3 hours agorootparentAs I wrote, different folks will already be chasing more immediate projects as they're too attractive: Think masters students, industry labs, startups, etc. Rules are meant to be broken. For example, a professor will often put a masters student on a cute me-too one-off project in a hot area as the short-termism helps the student have a smoother time, and the professor is trading expected low impact in the the project for a cheap shot to see if there is a more interesting question behind the immediate one. Much of the PhD is about learning to spot & navigate problems, not solutions. Young PhD students can totally pick the same me-too problems of masters students. The advisors would likely just think the student is using the same approach to seeing where the PhD worthy problem is. If still nothing, should be ready to drop the topic, or if they truly love me-too work more than the PhD process, leave for a better environment for that, like a company / industry lab / startup throwing more resources at the problem. Also, not every phd needs to do the original topic of attempting impact. You can totally use the PhD years to learn how to do me-too & unimpactful work or even the most weird & niche problems: as long as at least one advisor thinks they can stay funded while supporting you, most programs will let you through. reply marcosdumay 3 hours agorootparentprevIn most markets, it pays to be contrarian. ... and when everybody decides to be a contrarian, the contrarian position is to do the popular thing. But the catch is that this never happens on practice. reply sashank_1509 16 hours agoprevUnfortunately while this advice sounds useful, it isn’t. It might be useful if you measure impact is the fake metrics like citation count but if you want to measure with actual tangible impact on the real world, you have a rude awakening before you. To me there are 2 ways a paper can create impact: 1. The paper represents such an impressive leap in performance over existing methods in AI, that it is obviously impactful. Unfortunately, this way of generating impact is dominated by industry. No one can expect Academia to train O1, SAM, GPT5 etc. AI rewards scale, scale requires money, resources and manpower and Academia has none. In the early days of AI, there were rare moments when this was possible, AlexNet, Adam, Transformers, PPO etc. Is it still possible? I do not know, I have not seen anything in the last 3 years and I’m not optimistic many such opportunities are left. Even validating your idea tends to require the scale of industry. 2. The paper affects the thought process of other AI researchers and thus you are indirectly impactful if any of them cause big leaps in AI performance. Unfortunately here is where Academia has shot itself in the foot by generating so many damn papers every year (>10,000). There are just so many, that the effect of any 1 paper is meaningless. In fact the only way to be impactful now is to be in a social circle of great researchers, so that you know your social circle will read your paper and later if any of them make big performance improvements, you can believe that you played a small role in it. I have spoken to a lot of ML researchers, and they told me they choose papers to read just based on people and research groups they know. Even being a NeurIPS spotlight paper, means less than 10% of researchers will read your paper, maybe it will go to 50% if it’s a NEURIPS best paper but even that I doubt. How many researchers remember last year’s NEURIPS best paper? The only solution to problem 2, is radical. The ML community needs to come together and limit the number of papers it wide releases. Let us say it came out and said that yearly only 20 curated papers will be widely published. Then you can bet most of the ML community will read all 20 of those papers and engage with it deeply as they will be capable of spending more than a day at least thinking about the paper. Of course you can still publish on arxiv, share with friends etc but unless such a dramatic cutdown is made I don’t see how you can be an actually impactful AI researcher in Academia when option 1 is too expensive and option 2 is made impossible. reply EnigmaFlare 15 hours agoparentIf you were a really good academic, you could come up with a theory that predicts the performance of a model you haven't actually tested. Physics is full of this - theories that predict something novel followed by other people doing expensive experiments to test them. The guy who published the theory gets the credit. That's probably what we want from academic AI researchers - theories that we can eventually use to design models, rather than just haphazardly building something and wondering how good it will be. reply light_hue_1 4 hours agorootparentThat theory sounds great. There's no such thing at the moment and maybe never. Lots of smart people have tried. Just because that's what people want, doesn't mean we can produce it.

With the major downsides that you're giving away your insights for free, and potentially actively help other companies profit from your work. You don't go as far as to productize the research, but just make it really easy for others to do so by building \"artifacts\" for it.

Somewhat but a few crucial points are missing for it to be that. For example, - hire a lot more people (PhD candidates, postdocs) than you have funding to pay till they finish. Keep growing and getting more grants until you get a Nobel prize (or equivalent) or go broke - fake your data and publish in the top journals/conferences - don't do any research yourself, just get others to do everything and \"coordinate\" them. Make sure you get all the credit for the publication. The way to get others to do things is to \"collaborate\" with them or maybe (promise to) pay them. reply red_admiral 4 hours agoprevA lot to like here, a couple of things to comment on: > \"If you tell people that their systems could be 1.5x faster or 5% more effective, that's rarely going to beat inertia. In my view, you need to find problems where there's non-zero hope that you'll make things, say, 20x faster or 30% more effective, at least after years of work.\" This works for up-and-coming fields, but once something is stable and works at large scale, it's all about the small improvements. Making petrol engines 1% more fuel-efficient would be massive. Increasing the conversion rate of online ads by 1% could make you very, very rich indeed. Good advice for AI probably; bad advice in other fields. > \"Invest in projects, not papers\" The best way I think you can go about this is allocate some fraction alpha of your time to projects, and (1-alpha) to things that produce short-term papers. Alpha should never be zero if you want a career, but it will start out small as you begin your PhD and gradually grow, if you can make it in academia. At some point you'll reach a compounding return where the projects themselves are spawning papers - one way to do this is to get to the point where you can hire your own PhD students, but there are several others. As long as your 2-years-into-a-PhD review as some unis have them is about how many papers you've published (somehow weighted by journal/conference rank) and how many others are in the pipeline, you need to focus on papers until the point when your institution will let you do something more useful. Think of it as paper writing bootcamp so that once you do get more time for projects, you'll have practiced how to write up your results. > \"Make your release usable, useful ...\" This is excellent advice, also for anything else related to code. reply aleph_minus_one 4 hours agoparent> Increasing the conversion rate of online ads by 1% could make you very, very rich indeed. I claim there is actually a rather easy way to do this (but it won't make you rich!). The basic idea is rather simple: for each potential (ad/product, user) pair, ideally store two kinds of information: - the estimated probability that the user will click on the ad and/or make a buying decision - the confidence that you have in the correctness of this estimate Then only show ads where, based on this data, the conversion rate will be high with a high probability. Result: by only showing ads to those few people who very likely want to buy your product, you create an insanely high conversion rate, but you loose money because the ad will be shown to rather few people (possibly these are even people who don't actually have to get \"convinced\" to buy your product). In other words: we just created an artificial example of Goodhart's law (\"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\") in action. What this lesson tells us is - the \"conversion rate\" of an online ad is just a proxy for some entirely different business goal that you have - the conversion rate can rather easily be manipulated reply light_hue_1 4 hours agoparentprev> Making petrol engines 1% more fuel-efficient would be massive. Increasing the conversion rate of online ads by 1% could make you very, very rich indeed. Good advice for AI probably; bad advice in other fields. It's good advice in every field. Most improvements have a cost. If you make engines 1% more efficient but 5% more expensive no one will care. Heck electric engines are wildly more efficient (80-95%) compared to combustion engines (20-35%), not to mention far simpler, and we can hardly get people to switch. Even immense improvements can be hard to roll out. Don't work on marginal gains. Any minor problem or inconvenience will wipe them out and all your time and effort will be worth nothing. Let people who are paid by companies do that. If you're going to do a PhD focus on something that could be big. Whenever students suggest a project I always start by asking what the upside is: what if we massively succeed? reply Der_Einzige 17 hours agoprevAt least some of it comes from \"hype\" too. The author of Dspy (the writer) (https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) should know this, given that Dspy is nothing more than fancy prompts optimizing prompts to be fancier according to prompt chains described in papers (i.e. Chain of thought, Tree of thought, etc). Textgrad (https://github.com/zou-group/textgrad) is an even worse example of this, as it makes people think that it's not just a prompt optimizing another prompt Dspy has 17k stars, meanwhile PyReft (https://github.com/stanfordnlp/pyreft) isn't even at 1200 yet and it has Christopher Manning (head of AI at stanford) working on it (see their paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03592). Sometimes what the world deems \"impactful\" in the short-medium term is wrong. Think long term. PyReft is likely the beginning of an explosion in demand for ultra parameter efficient techniques, while Dspy will likely fade into obscurity over time. I also know that the folks writing better samplers/optimizers for LLMs get almost no love/credit relative to the outsized impact they have on the field. A new sampler potentially improves EVERY LLM EVER! Folks like Clara Meister or the authors of the min_p paper preprint have had far larger impacts on the field than their citation counts might suggest, based on the fact that typiciality or min_p sampling is now considered generally superior to top_p/top_k (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, et al still use top_p/top_k) and min_p/typicality are implemented by every open source LLM inference engine (i.e. huggingface, vllm, sglang, etc) reply thelastbender12 14 hours agoparentI think that's a little harsh. Imo the reason for difference in popularity/github-stars is just different user bases- an order of magnitude more people use LLM APIs (and can leverage Dspy) vs those who finetune an LLM. Agree about the abstractions btw. I found Dspy very convoluted for what it does, couldn't make sense of Textgrad at all. reply mehulashah 10 hours agoprevThis advice is much more general than academic research. It applies to startups as well. reply low_tech_love 11 hours agoprevAlthough point #1 is true, I find it to be a slightly superficial advice. It's like saying \"if you want to be happy, find a job that fulfills you\". Sure, everyone wants to be able to focus on good projects before papers, so that the papers come naturally. If you can do that, congrats! You won the game; be proud and enjoy it. However, the truth is that the way to get there is dark and lonely and full of terrors, and not everyone can do it. All academics (especially junior ones) are constantly in the middle of an ambiguous, contradictory discourse: you must produce a lot, but you also must produce high-quality output. Your environment, literally everyone around you, wants to have your cake and eat it too. As you get more experienced you learn to navigate this and keep the good parts while ignoring the bad ones, but for young researchers this can be extremely taxing and stressful. In order to \"focus on projects and not papers\" you have to literally swim against the current, usually in a very very strong current. Not everyone has the presence of mind and attitude to do it, and to be honest, it's not fair to expect that either. So, here are some points and comments I offer that go in a slightly different direction (although, like I said, if you managed to get there, congrats!): * You can write a good paper without it being a good project. One thing does not exclude the other, and the fact that there are many bad papers out there does not mean that papers themselves are bad. You can plan your work around a paper, do a good research job, and write a good scientific report without having to have an overarching research project that spills over that. Sure, it is great when it happens (and it will happen the more experienced and senior you get), but it's not necessarily true. * Not thinking about the paper you'll write out of your work might deter you from operationalizing your research correctly. Not every project can be translated into a good research paper, with objective/concrete measurements that translate to a good scientific report. You might end up with a good Github repo (with lots of stars and forks) and if that's your goal, then great! But if your goal is to publish, you need to think early on: \"what can I do that will be translated into a good scientific paper later?\" This will guide your methods towards the right direction and make sure you do not pull your hair later (at least not as many) when you get rejected a million times and end up putting your paper in a venue you're not proud of. * Publishing papers generates motivation. When a young research goes too long without seeing the results of their work, they lose motivation. It's very common for students to have this philosophical stance that they want to work on the next big project that will change the world, and that they need time and comfort and peace to do that, so please don't bother me with this \"paper\" talk. Fast forward three years later they have nothing published, are depressed, and spend their time playing video games and procrastinating. The fact is that people see other people moving forward, and if they don't, no amount of willpower to \"save the world\" with a big project will keep them going. Publishing papers gives motivation; you feel that your work was worth it, you go to conferences and talk to people, you hear feedback from the community. It's extremely important, and there's no world where a PhD student without papers is healthier and happier than one with papers. * Finishing a paper and starting the next one is a healthy work discipline. Some people just want to write a good paper and move on. Not everyone feels so passionate about their work that they want to spend their personal time with it, and push it over all boundaries. You don't have to turn your work into your entire life. Doing a good job and then moving on is a very healthy practice. reply KuriousCat 19 hours agoprevI would say follow the money, create a product or service that generates recurrent income and channel that income to study the fundamental problems that would interest you.

You can define this in many ways, but one strategy that works well in AI is to seek a problem space that will be 'hot' in 2-3 years but hasn't nearly become mainstream yet. I think about research as, what can I bring that's unique? What can I work on that won't be popular or won't exist unless I do it? If it's clearly going to become popular than other people will do it. So why do I need to? I'm useless. Yes. You'll increase your citation count with that plan.

In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research.

    "originBody": "Why I still blog after 15 years ★ Published: September 25, 2024 in 7f18f00 Tagged: Blog Time flies when you’re having fun. Before you know it, your little babies have started school, you celebrate the 30th anniversary of Jurassic Park, and that little blog you started have now been going for 15 years. 15 years is a long time; longer than I’ve been waiting for Winds of Winter, and that wait has felt like an eternity. How did I—who frequently abandon projects for the next shiny thing—manage to continue this blog for so long? I’m as surprised as anyone but I’ve tried to make a retrospective of how this may have happened. Why I started the blog I started this blog because I wanted to create a bunch of fast game prototypes and I wanted somewhere I could write about my plans and, ultimately, the games. You see, I was a budding programmer and I wanted to learn how to program by making a game. Not a simple game like Tetris—that would be way too sensible—no, I wanted to make a big RTS game, like StarCraft or Supreme Commander. And to do that you needed a game engine. So I got stuck developing my engine with truly groundbreaking features such as: A menu with keyboard and mouse support. A console you could bring up with F2 where you could update variables (such as unit speed) without having to recompile. You could select units with proper Ctrl, Shift, and right click behavior. … But, embarrassingly, I didn’t have anything even resembling a game, and with the development speed I had I doubt I’d be finished to this day. I’d gotten stuck in the Game Engine Trap, and I hated it. Then I found The Experimental Gameplay Project (of World of Goo fame) that promoted the idea that you should be able to create a game prototype in just 7 days. That sounded like the perfect cure against the Game Engine Trap, so I created this blog to document my progress. Why I’ve continued to blog While the blog fulfilled it’s initial purpose as I developed around a dozen game prototypes that got me out of the Game Engine Trap (and that gave me a small “game engine” library at the end), I soon started write about other things. There are a number of reasons I continued to blog: I enjoy writing. I realize now that the biggest reason I blog is that I enjoy the writing process. I can’t put my finger on why, I just generally like it. This isn’t always true though and I’ve had years where I’ve barely written anything at all (2022 for example). Sometimes I’ve had to force myself to write something. I guess the motivation ebbs and flows sometimes. Writing helps me think more clearly and helps me flesh out ideas. The act of writing something down helps me find errors in my thinking and helps me consider different viewpoints. Rewriting the text you’ve written has a similar benefit to refactoring your code; your thoughts will be more polished afterwards. Publishing something forces me to do better. If I’m going to put something out there I’m going to re-read and rework my text/code/ideas more than if I had kept it for myself. (Even if nobody will read your posts, the mere act of putting something out there has this effect I think.) For example, my custom keyboard layout wouldn’t have been nearly as well-developed if I hadn’t published it for everyone to see. Being more thoughtful about how I write is something I’ve become more cognizant of as the years have gone by. My first posts where little more than a stream of thoughts, while the larger posts I gravitate towards today have gone through multiple revisions and rewrites before I publish them. At any time I have several drafts that I’m writing on, but many of them never gets published. Sometimes I lose interest, and other times I see that the post won’t become the polished masterpiece (or at least, not a pile of dung), so I abandon it. The blog is a place to document my personal projects. Over the years I’ve done other projects, such as built a 3D printer and wrote a book. It’s nice to have a place where I can write about them. Looking at a log of things I’ve done makes me feel better. I’ve been doing a small yearly review every year where I try to list the highlights of the past year. It’s been super helpful for me as it helps counteract the depressing feeling that nothing has happened and that I haven’t done anything. Doing a yearly review of some sort is a practice I highly recommend everyone to try, and of course you don’t have to publish it for everyone to see. I enjoy developing the blog as a project that exclusively solves my problems. Programming is my biggest hobby and I can’t see myself ever stopping. The blog is a great project as it’s something that exists only for me so I can rewrite, refactor, and add whatever silly features I want and I only have myself to answer to. It’s a nice feeling. Blogging helps me become a better writer, which in turns helps me become a better developer. I think communicating well is an important and underrated part of being an effective software developer. Writing well is a skill that can be developed by practice, and maintaining a blog is a pretty good way to practice I’d say. No, dumping a stream of thought into ChatGPT isn’t good enough. My motivations aren’t dependent on external feedback It’s important to point out that it’s not external feedback that has kept me going all these years. Yes, of course, it’s nice to get the occasional email with compliments, but that’s just a bonus. I keep this blog for me to write, not necessarily for others to read. Many of these kinds of retrospectives contain graphs of views over time or the most popular posts; but I’m not showing it to you because I can’t—I don’t keep any statistics whatsoever. I don’t really care—and I don’t want to care—about how many readers I have or what posts are and aren’t popular. I worry that if I add statistics to the blog it’ll change from an activity I perform for the activity’s sake, to an exercise in hunting clicks where I write for others instead of for myself. If I were chasing views I would certainly not have continued to blog for as long as I have, and I’d have missed out on the many benefits I’ve gotten from the blog. Evolution of the tech stack One of the reasons I’ve been blogging so long is that I’ve been able to play around with the tech stack of the blog. I’ve changed the tech stack a number of times; from choosing languages I wanted to learn, to a boring setup that “just works”, and back again. ~ 2008 I started out with PHP using the Kohana Framework and I still have fond memories of their excellent documentation. Although I had figured out how to create a website, it never graduated to a real blog. Early 2009 Then I moved on to rewrite the site in Perl using Mojolicious. I’m not sure my efforts ever resulted in anything tangible but I remember if was fun to play around with. July 2009 I stumbled upon the idea of using a static site for my blog and therefore abandoned Perl for Jekyll, a popular static site generator at that time. I believe it was a smart choice because it helped me start writing, instead of jerking around with cool tech. ~ July 2013 Eventually, I grew tired of the boring backend that just got the job done and in my quest to learn Haskell I replaced the generator with Hakyll, another static site generator with a pretty neat DSL. July 2013 The earliest Git commit on record. I’m fairly sure I used Git before this point (I abandoned SVN for my games in 2009). 2013–2022 Sadly, I never truly graduated from the “throw shit at the wall until it sticks” stage of my Haskell journey, which is why I barely added any features to the blog for many years. August 2022 Having outgrown existing solutions I decided to join the Rewrite in Rust club (or is it a cult?) Religious weirdness aside, having complete control of the site generator made it fun again to tinker and add small features. 2022–2024 Honestly though, my favorite piece of technology on the blog is CSS. I just really like to spend time to fiddle with the design and to make small tweaks here and there. I do use Sass but 95% is just plain CSS. Modern CSS is honestly great. February 2024 Almost by accident I started using Djot instead of Markdown to write my posts. I couldn’t find a Tree-sitter grammar for Djot so I created one. May 2024 I’m in the process of connecting the site generator to Neovim to provide autocomplete, diagnostics, jumping between posts, and other cool features. There’s lots of potential for spending tons of time in this swamp but these IDE-like features really elevate the writing experience. At the moment the blogging software is a whole project in and of itself (by design; it’s a fun project to tinker with). Posts have changed focus and increased in scope 2009 2012 2014 2017 2019 2022 2024 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 Words Other Linux Gaming Life Programming Yearly Review Game creation Book writing Keyboards 3D printing Posts mapped by published date and work count, grouped into lose categories. (You'll need CSS enabled to view the Graph in a nice way.) It probably comes as no surprise that my posts have changed a lot since I started the blog. I made the above visualization that counts the words of each post and plots them on a time axis, together with loose grouping of the type of post. I have two main takeaways: The posts have grown larger and more ambitious. In the beginning I treated the blog almost like a Twitter/X feed with short updates on my game making progress. Now I spend weeks or even months slowly working away on a post until I feel it’s interesting and polished enough to publish. As my interests have changed, so has the focus of my posts. I only write about my hobbies or things that I’m interested in at that moment so it’s only natural that the theme of the posts have changed. Gaming related posts have given way for more programming and the occasional meat-space related project. What does the future bring? I find almost find it obvious that the blog has changed so much during the 15 years of it’s existence; of course my posts would grow more ambitious as my writing matured and I’d obviously start gravitating away from games towards other projects. Naturally, it’s just a lie I tell myself with the benefit of hindsight. Predicting the future is impossible and I have no idea what the blog will look like 15 years from now. While it feels like I’ll keep blogging the same way, it would be foolish to claim that as a fact. Sometimes it’s best to stop worrying and just enjoy the ride.

    "commentBody": "Why I still blog after 15 years (jonashietala.se)236 points by lawn 6 hours agohidepastfavorite128 comments JohnMakin 3 hours ago> \"I keep this blog for me to write, not necessarily for others to read.\" This is now to me the \"old school\" internet creator attitude (that I still possess). I don't blog as much any more but do create content elsewhere - a lot of it is for my own enjoyment and creative outlet, to blow off steam, whatever - the fact that other people may want to watch it is secondary. I do try to do things people want, but only if I want to do it. The only reason I highlight this is that the up and coming generations absolutely do not see content creation in the same way. I got in an absurd argument with an early 20 something on a social media platform about how annoying ads were that were disguised as content. The response was overwhelmingly \"Well, how else do you expect content creators to make a living?\" I do not disagree that creators should be able to monetize their content however they please, but the fact that people see that as the end and only goal of content creation is baffling to me and almost certainly making it worse. This same person tried to tell me it's been the same way since the earliest days of youtube - which they would have been in diapers around that time - is absolutely not true. The idea of content creation as a full time career is relatively new, and I hate it. The worst part is if you don't participate in the type of obnoxious engagement hacking or buried ads that these \"professional\" creators do, the algorithms punish you for it. reply ReleaseCandidat 3 hours agoparent> content creation I seriously hate the term \"content\" used for \"creative output\". It is a terrible, derogatory word, that makes me sad. Content is only there to have something to sell, to fill the blank space around ads, the actual content of the content doesn't matter. That people refer to themselves as \"content creators\" is a sign that they see the value of their creative output only to make money. reply HappMacDonald 24 minutes agorootparentThe challenge is that every fruit must have its seed. (Even seedless varieties are artificially created by labs which then themselves can be viewed as the seeds, but I digress..) Nothing of value to others is truly created in a vacuum. It must have some system of re-uptake, of value being conferred back to the creator or else it will never repeat. Ads are one potential way that can be accomplished, but as much as we hate ads we can't just expect them to go away and leave the \"content\" alone. We have to replace them with some other superior way of remunerating the creators. I wish flattr would have took off as a service, that sort of low-friction idea seemed quite promising. reply jl6 2 hours agorootparentprevNobody ever thought to themselves: I sure could go for some content right now. reply sivers 1 hour agorootparentI know my up-vote of this comment is supposed to be enough, but I just have to add, as an extra praise @jl6 here: That's the funniest sentence I've heard in a long time. “Nobody ever thought to themselves: I sure could go for some content right now.” Love it love it love it. reply bityard 1 hour agorootparentprevI can't explain why, but I always cringe a little when I hear someone say that they \"consume content.\" Maybe its because I can't tell if brings up animalistic connotations (a pack of feral hipsters picking at the remains of an endangered podcast on the Serengeti), or if they are intentionally being elitist (\"It would be a waste of time to simply read Chomsky's work, an educated person would make the effort consume it.\") reply 7speter 1 hour agorootparentprevI think your comment kinda provides the reason why the term “content” is used; there are so many verticals out there that its just easiest to say “I’m a content creator.” From there, if the audience remains captive, you can explain that you make videos about sewing sweaters with embedded controllers for cats. Also, don’t get me wrong, I’m pretty conflicted on the term. I just like to believe people are using it in good faith when they describe themselves, and don’t just see “content” as a means towards an end. reply jl6 1 hour agorootparentIt makes perfect sense to use the word content where it’s a convenient abstraction. But humans don’t watch/read/play or fall in love with abstractions.

(It's OK to leave a thread dangling in the wind.) reply ALittleLight 2 hours agorootparentprevThis seems unnecessarily negative and pessimistic. \"Content\" is the stuff or substance that people want to consume as opposed to all the associated stuff (branding, SEO, \"hooks\", whatever). \"Content creator\" recognizes that there is similarity between long form video essays and shorts and blogs and live streams - and that people who do one often do others. reply DowagerDave 1 hour agorootparentI don't agree. The emphasis on content implies it's the output that is most important, and that you can split it out from all the nonsense you differentiate above. Many of the people in this thread counter that the act of creation is the most important part.

It's usually too long because I'm trying to complete the thought for my own sake.

I do too, but IMHO unfortunately us older generations have a lot to answer for when it comes to this. My teenage daughter plus all of her friends all want to be content creators. It's the 21st century equivalent of becoming a pop star or being a TV personality. As an industry we've automated away a lot of the jobs that these kids otherwise could have had, handed them a bunch of shitty tools and algorithms and shown them that this is a way to make money. I don't find their attitude all that surprising. reply SoftTalker 1 hour agorootparentAnd it's not really new. Being a YouTuber or TikToker was obviously not possible before those platforms existed, but people were musicians, actors, or other sorts of performers, or wrote stuff that they tried to get published, it's all the same drive. Some wanted to do it to become a star and get paid, others did it for the love of the craft. The internet is a new avenue for this, that's all. reply ghaff 1 hour agorootparentprev>21st century equivalent of becoming a pop star or being a TV personality Which were always lottery professions at best. Being influencers/YouTube stars/etc. may seem more accessible these days but it's probably mostly an illusion. There are (mostly) plenty of jobs but most of them are probably pretty unglamorous. reply blackbrokkoli 2 hours agoparentprevGenuine question: If you write only for yourself, what motivates you to actually finish, and more importantly, polish a post? I write for myself all the time, in private: I have a journal, a paper notebook, thousands of notes in Obsidian. Yet doing a blog post feels like a massive undertaking every single time, especially the later writing and editing: explaining stuff that is obvious to me and no one else, replacing idiosyncratic abbreviations, fixing formatting issues, fixing blogging engine or hosting stuff. I think I struggle with these parts because doing those tasks doesn't benefit me very much. So how do you do these things within the framework of writing for oneself? Any takes on this? reply raesene9 2 hours agorootparentI can answer for me (I've been blogging just over 20 years at this point). There's a couple of main reasons for me to write a blog instead of just an obsidian note. Firstly, the process of writing a blog post makes me think through my assumptions as I'm explaining the concepts it covers to other people. On more than one occasion I've realised while writing, that my understanding of the topic wasn't entirely correct, so it's useful here. Also I blog so the information is available to others. If I spent a decent amount of time working things out, it's possible that a blog could save other people in similar situations effort, so that's handy. Lastly I blog so I can point people to a post instead of explaining a topic in detail, it's a handy time saver for things that come up a lot. As to benefits, well it wasn't deliberate but blogging contributed to me getting my last two jobs, so in that sense I guess it's paid off pretty well! reply sanex 2 hours agorootparentprevIf I publish what I write then it forces me to actually put some effort into making it readable but I don't necessarily think of the audience when I'm writing. Just more of from a perspective of spelling and grammar. Personally it's the knowledge of the fact it will be public is the accountability I need to put in that extra effort and future me is grateful I can comprehend what current me is saying. reply nickjj 56 minutes agorootparentprevI have 500+ posts over ~9 years and the polish is what lets me absorb what I've written into memory. If I look at the titles of all of my posts I can pretty much recall the details of the post to a reasonable degree, certainly enough to get a complete gist of it and understand the head space I was in at the time. If I stick to internal chicken scratch notes then I have a harder time remembering things later. I guess you could say it's the process of writing a somewhat coherent post that has a beginning, middle and end that's really helpful for retention. reply JohnMakin 2 hours agorootparentprevI don’t write too much anymore, one of my blogs got a lot more exposure and attention than I was comfortable with and people online in general are weirdo freaks and annoying to deal with. I guess I didn’t fuss too much with that stuff, the quality was likely poorer than it could have been. Same with my video stuff, I just don’t care that much if it’s polished. Audience feedback sometimes helps but isn’t that motivating to me. reply DowagerDave 1 hour agorootparent>> and people online in general are weirdo freaks and annoying to deal with. This is definitely the current internet and not the typical experience back when blogging was very popular. It's too easy to access and produce low-quality contributions today, which (ironically?) is something that blogs countered and also probably led to their decline. reply JohnMakin 1 hour agorootparent> This is definitely the current internet and not the typical experience back when blogging was very popular. This has been my experience for much of the last ~15 years as an extremely niche internet personality but it is definitely worse lately, particularly the amount of outrage people can generate out of nowhere over the most benign things - my response is always an exasperated \"you're perfectly free to simply not consume this.\" But people then take it waaaaay too far. reply syntaxfree 1 hour agorootparentprev> especially the later writing and editing: explaining stuff that is obvious to me and no one else I don’t do this. I write expecting the audience to pretty much have read the entirety of my blog to understand any single entry.

Then: I’ve known of maybe 10 people over a combined five years that have made the effort to read a lot of my stuff. reply genezeta 1 hour agorootparentprevNot the person above, but... > I write for myself all the time, in private The approach can be similar. I mean, I write for myself; nobody reads my blog. They can, sure, but nobody does because I almost never give out the URL to anyone. So the result is I don't feel the need to care too much about explaining, etc. except when I want. reply vanjajaja1 2 hours agorootparentprevjust dont do any of that. write at the level you want to write at and publish what you have. its a kind of self esteem work to say “what i write for myself is fine to make public” and then being public also inspires slightly higher quality reply ipaddr 2 hours agorootparentprevPerfectionism would cause someone to polish something like this. If that doesn't hit home don't polish just post. reply aksss 1 hour agorootparentprevNot op, but.. Writing for my future self (I know from coding) is like writing for another person. So making it readable, sources cited, etc. is being kind to future me. Also, it’s like that old saw about teaching - if you can’t explain something to another, you probably don’t really know the topic. The exercise of writing about something with another person in mind helps me organize the information and understand it at a deeper level. reply sergiotapia 1 hour agorootparentprevfor me, i've saved myself time and energy at least 10 times by writing stuff down and publishing it on my blog/forums. i know i help people, but i mainly do it for Future Sergio. reply syntaxfree 1 hour agorootparentAre you somehow closely related to one Tito Tapia? reply cookiengineer 1 hour agoparentprevQuality content gets punished. Investigative journalism went down the drain for the same reasons. Clickbait content is so much cheaper to produce and has the same effect, because you can produce hundreds of clickbait articles in the same time. Soon every video has to have Mr.Beast's ADHD inducing video cutstyle because otherwise the algorithms will punish you for producing too slow content.

Do you spend 4 years getting a degree no one will hire for so you can bag groceries to pay off debt, or do you bag groceries to live while trying to break through as a creator?

She had a funny moment, and I think 15-20 years ago it probably would have just been a funny meme for a few years and a \"oh you're that girl from the meme\" at parties for her entire 20's. Like that's exactly how that would have played out. Now she quit her job, has sponsorships, got a major podcast deal - over a single viral moment. It's nutty to me, personally, but people seem to see this as perfectly normal. reply jahewson 2 hours agorootparentThat was pretty much the situation with reality TV twenty years ago. Everyone was aghast that some random person could appear on a show and instead of being cast aside for our amusement at the end, they were able to build a personal brand and get a career out of it. It’s predators all the way down. reply soulofmischief 2 hours agorootparentprevI watched her podcast and some interviews, and it's clear that, while not the most educated person, she exudes charisma and has a relatable sense of humor. She seems like a natural entertainer. As for education, she's from the south and her mom is an absent drug addict so I give her a pass (I have the same background and it is extraordinarily difficult) I think she's a special case, and she'll prove that over time. I'm happy someone in her position got a chance to share her personality with the world. Wishing her the best. reply JohnMakin 2 hours agorootparentI’m not saying there’s anything wrong with what she did or that she does not have talent. It’s more crazy to me that this is seen as a natural progression of someone’s online career. reply soulofmischief 1 hour agorootparentI don't know, I feel it's hard to know what a natural progression in one's online career looks like, given the relative nascence of the medium. Film underwent similar phase transitions over time before settling on the star system, which we are now seeing begin to fail as well. It's certainly not sustainable to give a podcast to every person who says something that goes viral on TikTok, so I wonder how things will look in another 30 years. reply DowagerDave 1 hour agorootparentprevThe part I don't like is an entire army of people now think doing exactly the same thing is a viable strategy to similar success. We should view this as a lottery win, not career development reply Kye 2 hours agorootparentprev15 years ago \"Shit My Dad Says\" got a TV show. People have spun momentary stardom into book deals and gigs forever. NYC, Hollywood, all the music cities past and present, and the last couple of SV booms were built on trying to generate it. \"You're good at that, you should sell it\" has been a constant refrain to creatives with any level of skill for decades. Some people went for it.

Ironically what you describe sounds like that season 1 of black mirror episode reply Kye 3 hours agorootparentprevLet's not confuse what they do for money with what they do for fun. For example: A lot of happy programmers can't conceive of doing it for fun: they log in, do a good job, log out, go tend to their sheep and work on their woodshed. You might not have the full picture of someone's life from a context-constrained conversation. There are things I'm good at that I tend to only want to do with a profit motive. I have plenty of unmonetized hobbies though. reply jollyllama 3 hours agorootparent> A lot of happy programmers can't conceive of doing it for fun I don't think that's true. I think even people who fit that description are aware of others who find it fun. I guess what I was saying is, it doesn't even occur to them that someone would do something absent any profit motive. reply jmb99 1 hour agorootparentprev>Still, it's surprising that they can't even conceive of doing anything without profit motive as an incentive. Realistically, what percentage of the workforce in any field would continue working if they stopped getting paid (or took a 75% pay cut)? 1%? 0.1%? The reason people work is to make money that they can spend on the things they need to live, and hopefully have some left over for the things they enjoy. I love programming, building hardware, tinkering, etc in my spare time (as one of my hobbies), and I'm employed as an embedded engineer. I like my work. If my company stopped paying me, I would be looking for a new job immediately. Does that mean I don't enjoy my work? No, I just have this job to make money so that I can afford to live and do all of the things I enjoy. I would argue that yes, people who believe people should enjoy their work without a \"profit motive\" are naive, or at least sufficiently wealthy to forget what it's like to rely on income from employment. reply s1artibartfast 2 hours agorootparentprevI always struggle to understand this sentiment. There seems to be a huge labor shortage, particularly for physical and skilled labor. Auto mechanics change 120/hr for labor, someone recently quoted me 40k to spend a week landscaping my residential back yard, and an arborist wanted 3k for a single day of chainsaw work pruning a big tree. reply DowagerDave 1 hour agorootparentnone of those things are accessible to someone who has say, a 4-yr fine arts degree. They're also extremes and not typical, unless your car is at the dealer, your backyard is on a make-over show, or that tree is hanging over your house & powerlines reply s1artibartfast 1 hour agorootparentI guess my fundamental question is why arent these jobs accessible? They dont reqire any degree at all, so it seems like they should be open to both the 4 year art graduate and a high school graduate. I live in a high cost of living area, but these are typical prices here. Call 10 autoshops and thats the typical rate. Even people on yelp operating out of their house arent much cheaper. Heck, residential plumbers charge $150-200/hr. So what is the bottleneck? Is it regulatory barriers to opening businesses? Is it a lack of knowledge? Is it poor discovery in the information age? Unions? It seems like there are lots of people making great money doing these things, and lots of people looking for work. reply Kye 1 hour agorootparentI'm not sure how you imagine the process of getting into one of these no-degree businesses goes. You don't just \"start doing it.\" First, you need tools and transportation. Then you need to know what the hell you're doing. Then, probably, some certifications. And now you have to find people to pay you in a highly competitive market full of scammers who make it even harder to sell services. The usual path is to work for someone else until you have the skills and tools and certs to strike out on your own. That someone is not going to hire you if it looks like you won't stick around as soon as a better option comes along. And no bank will give a startup loan to someone who's never done it before. People make great money doing these things because they've done all this for years and built up the tools and skills and certifications and referral network to make it. You don't start charging $200/hour any more than you start out in SV making $1m/year. reply s1artibartfast 1 hour agorootparentso now we are starting to get somewhere. It seems you think the bottlenecks are similar to the ones I flagged such as knowledge, discovery and certification. If you know a way to find the people starting that aren't charging 200/hr, please let me know because I want to hire them. reply Kye 1 hour agorootparentprevYep. Once you have any level of education past high school, lots of the better jobs just won't hire you. They assume you're biding your time until a better job comes by and any time or money spent training you will be wasted. The \"labor shortage\" is a fantasy created by people with jobs to offer having unrealistic expectations. reply s1artibartfast 1 hour agorootparentSurely someone with a college degree that wants to be a plumber can simply not disclose their degree? reply Kye 1 hour agorootparentOh, they'll know. All that book learnin' changes you. With life and experience and life experience, you can stop coming off as a stuck-up out of touch asshole to people doing this kind of work. My entire generation got endless refrains of the message that these are the kinds of jobs you fail into if you don't get a degree. That doesn't break easily. It seems like the next crowd gets similar messages. reply s1artibartfast 1 hour agorootparentIf I understand you, maybe that is another psycological bottleneck on the side of workers. Hopefully time will change the perception and people will realize that a plumber making 200/hr isn't a failure, and has advantages over being unemployed with a 4 year art degree and 200k debt. reply Kye 59 minutes agorootparentYou've severely misunderstood. No, the problem here is the person with the jobs to offer who is overly picky about beginner attitude, won't hire anyone, then goes on Facebook and yells \"no one wants to work anymore!\" The person with the degree understands they messed up after years of job hunting and would be happy for the normal working gig, but it's not on offer to them. reply s1artibartfast 49 minutes agorootparentSeems like from what you described, the main challenge is reliance on entrenched businesses are gatekeeping the entry knowledge and training. I wonder if trade schools would be a good way to bypass this bottle neck. I suppose you would still have the problem of people selecting the low ROI degree instead of trade schools, but they would still have the option after they understand \"they messed up\". reply bongodongobob 1 hour agorootparentprevYou bag groceries and spend your time looking to break through in the industry your degree is in. You are infinitely more likely to be successful finding a real job than wasting your time and energy hoping to win the influencer lottery. If you wanted to be a content creator what the hell did you get a degree for? reply xhrpost 3 hours agoparentprevAgreed. I think part of this shift came with the transition to use real names online everywhere. Now what you put out there really matters because you might be judged for it years later. So if you're limited in your creativity, why bother creating something you don't enjoy if it doesn't have the potential to make you money? Personally I'm keeping my real name Gmail but I've created a no-name account on Proton and am starting to use that for certain platforms. I want to try and get back to something like the days of creating random logos in Gimp and posting them to my Geocities page that no one viewed other than a friend or two and I didn't care. reply jhp123 2 hours agoparentprevThe idea of content creation as a full time career is literally ancient, e.g. musicians have been paid for thousands of years. The Napster-era ideology that \"information wants to be free\" is the outlier. reply JohnMakin 2 hours agorootparentThis is a dishonest framing, I think. The scale and type of content, especially the way it is expected to be consumed, on top of a hyper-monetized ad framework was not a thing in ancient times. I also think very few people picked up a lute in those days with the idea that they were only going to play if it made them money (artists have for much of modern history notoriously made a poor living). The point I was making was not that an artist making a living from their art is a new thing, no one is making that point. reply dandigangi 2 hours agoparentprevAgreed!

Before about 2015 there were so many great podcasts that people did for fun or because they wanted to get a message out. Slowly, one by one, they started adding sponsorships for Blue Apron and NatureBox and SquareSpace (these were the VPMs of 2015). Now even the most niche podcast has algorithmic ads. I frequently hear creators say that these ads make very little money but I guess the creators think they're losing out by not including them. I remember listening to The Skeptics Guide to the Universe back then and thinking \"everyone else is adding ads but I bet this one never will, they've been doing it ad-free for like a decade\". Then a year later they had ads. It's just sad to think of what we've lost. reply CharlieDigital 5 hours agoprevI've kept a blog for almost 20 years now. I think author missed #8: I've personally benefited so much from the writings shared by others that it feels amiss to not share back things I've learned and little tips and tricks. One of my most viewed blog posts is a really short and simple one on simulating drag-and-drop of files with Playwright automation. I found no such information when I ran into this problem so the only logical thing to do was to share it for the next person that ran into this issue. I always encourage devs I mentor to write more and to share what they learn. For all of the reasons that the author listed, but also because it's a mechanism to give back to the community that all of us rely on whether we're writing code, making a recipe, doing a craft, learning a new hobby, etc. A lot of younger devs tell me \"why would anyone want to read my writing\" and I show them YouTube and how many different videos there are on how to make a pancake (and more are added every day!).

Nothing is better than intrinsic motivation and something you do for yourself. I have a blog that I try to keep up with. I fail to be consistent and one reason always has been me asking \"Who should I write it for\" instead of \"What do I want to write about for myself\". Something to take away here. reply ryandrake 3 hours agoparentIt’s a spirit from the old Internet that we’ve all but lost. Replaced with the toxic “write for engagement” spirit that brought us SEO, blogspam, influencers, “YouTube Face” thumbnails, ragebait, and now AI slop. Same for writing and releasing open source software. Write software that you want to write and don’t worry about how many users you have or how many pull requests you get or how many GitHub stars you have. These are empty vanity metrics, and another side of the same “write for engagement” coin. reply geerlingguy 3 hours agorootparentI think some of the blame has to do with how metrics and analytics started taking over every aspect of online culture (as is hinted at). I noticed I tried to optimize my blog more when I was using Google Analytics; that whole setup really pushes you to look at certain metrics like time on site, bounce rate, etc. The best decision I've made for blogging sanity a few years back was to switch to a simple self-hosted analytics solution that just focuses on total traffic and referrers, which is mostly helpful to see if a post hit some aggregator like HN or Reddit... but even that's fundamentally a vanity metric. reply ryandrake 2 hours agorootparentI think it is a huge mistake to use metrics, analytics, or any kind of quantified “audience measurement” to justify or rank a creative endeavor. reply unchar1 2 hours agorootparentprevI also feel this with X/Twitter, where everything feels like a promotion for a course or a book or a new product.

A couple of observations from the text that resonate with me: * \"Blogging helps me become a better writer, which in turns helps me become a better developer.\" Yes. Writing is super-important as a developer, particularly in a corporate setting, because communicating ideas clearly is critical in convincing others and in showing your contributions. And to be a better writer, well, one has to write more and blogging helps with that! * \"The posts have grown larger and more ambitious.\" I've noticed a similar change in my own blog, where posts have grown from frequent 300-word long posts to infrequent 3000-word long posts. Other platforms like Twitter have captured the space of short form writing and, more \"importantly\", consuming such content. In any case, my own recap at the 20-year mark from 3 months ago is here: https://jmmv.dev/2024/06/20-years-of-blogging.html ;-) reply pocketarc 5 hours agoparent> Other platforms like Twitter have captured the space of short form writing Does this ever feel like a waste?

There was no good way to jump to a given year reply 01HNNWZ0MV43FF 3 hours agorootparentprevYes. That's why I have \"microposts\" on my blog's home-made SSG. I add an entry to a JSON5 file with the text, the RFC 3339 date, and a GUID (for permalinks) and it gets built into the site as a Tweet-like entry. This reduces the friction in sharing things, since building a whole new page takes a few minutes. reply jmmv 5 hours agorootparentprevI actually archive any sort of short-form writing that I think is valuable in my site :) In fact, I compose Twitter threads first as a regular post where each paragraph fits in a tweet, then copy/paste those onto Twitter, and then share the link to the \"real\" post at the end (to avoid my content being slurped into \"thread reader\" apps). But there are lots of short, one-off random-thought tweets that are not worth archiving other than for downloading a copy of your data from these services and saving it offline. reply kstrauser 3 hours agorootparentprevIf I know I’m going to like them later, I post them to my blog first and let it crosspost to Mastodon for me.

I think people get hung up on the tech stack of a blog, so while I appreciate the timeline, I think we put too much emphasis on that in general.. Personally; have one sole purpose for my blog: to turn the arguments you conclude in the shower into something productive. It's somewhat cathartic to write down in as many words as you want to, with as much time as you want to: the actual underpinning arguments of a stance you hold, with citations and alternative opinions considered. Writing a comment on HN is nice, but largely there's a time pressure, wait a day for a good response and the conversation has concluded... or, make it too long and you lose your audience. A blog post allows you time to reflect, not be reactive, and to truly get your point across, and people are more likely to read it. reply felideon 4 hours agoprev> I worry that if I add statistics to the blog it’ll change from an activity I perform for the activity’s sake, to an exercise in hunting clicks where I write for others instead of for myself.

Vanity metrics would be demotivating. reply ozim 3 hours agoparentThat is how YT creators were getting burn outs they got hooked up on vanity metrics but then if one of your videos bombs you are hit quite badly so your metrics for following 10 videos is going to be bad. So they had to pump the content like crazy and there is no vacation time, because then your metrics also go down. reply jsheard 3 hours agorootparentFor career YouTubers it's hard to blame them when those metrics are directly tied to their paycheck, which could easily fall below what they need to make a living if they don't pump the numbers enough.

Remember, this was the time when Wikipedia started. I’ve neglected it and have not taken care of it as much as I used to 10+ years ago. I did away with analytics about 5 years ago. WP-Engine grandfathered me while I was on WordPress, but I gave that up, too. Now, I write for myself, mostly to remember things that I can re-read later. And to have a URL on the web that I can give out with answers to topics that I have to answer repeatedly. I write plain text without any front-matter, or tags, as simple as it gets that GitHub Pages can spit out. If the basic CloudFlare analytics is to be believed, it continuous to be pretty well visited. But I like tinkering with it, and there are many unfinished articles. I think I will keep it for as long as I can. https://brajeshwar.com reply _bramses 4 hours agoprevIf your blog provider supports it, adding a “Open a Random Post” button on your blog makes the experience much more fulfilling in the long term, as you (and others) can revisit different posts from different eras.

Blogs from people who are hopefully not using AI to generate text might be the only valid source of truth in a near future reply aksss 1 hour agoparentI more worry about AI hoovering up my hard work and that makes me think about the honesty of my beliefs about why I write. In my hobby domain, authors were traditionally very protective of obscure sources, it was all about getting the book published, becoming recognized authority. There would be a sense of pride in having an expensive limited-run book. They were/are gate-keepers extraordinaire. I kind of hate that hoarding of knowledge. But maybe my approach wasn’t about the virtue of making info available to all, but more like Bezos’ theme of, “your margin is my opportunity”. I still appreciate some recognition and am not writing to feed a machine. Someone back during the Industrial Revolution remarked that the machines and engines are supposed to aid people but when you go into a factory you see the people climbing all over the machines to fix them, and sometimes at great risk of injury, like we are here for the care and feeding of the machines. Just makes me think. reply wslh 2 hours agoparentprevI think the discussion around AI-generated content is worth exploring beyond the obvious concerns. If you're original and use AI as part of your creative toolbox, that's great, what matters is the work you produce and the unique touch you give it. There’s no rule that says we have to post an unfiltered output of an LLM. On the research side, it would be fascinating to explore measures of randomness or originality within LLM models. I'm sure many researchers are already investigating how genuinely novel content like new poetry can influence and evolve these models over time. reply shahzaibmushtaq 2 hours agoprevWriting, updating and saving your progress in several drafts is the only place where you write for yourself, but as soon as you publish them online it automatically becomes for everyone using the internet.

It has the potential to create such an incredible resource, for the general public, for history, and for — of course — the writers themselves. I've written on various blogs, including my own, since the late 90s, but I have been blogging consistently on a single instance for a little over 17 years. I've seen my writing shift from long form to rapid fire and back again. I've also noticed that it's become mostly formulaic, as a way of dispersing information to folks. But it's those rare occasions where I'm actually struck with the inspiration to write a longer form thought piece that really brings me back to the whole reason I started my current blog. Again, super happy to read this piece and the comments here. I'll remain hopeful that it inspires others to start — or to return to — blogging. It's really an incredible means of communicating with one another. reply l5870uoo9y 5 hours agoprevI share many of the author's reasons for having a small and non-committal blog. I also think that one of the overriding reasons I have a blog is that I spend a lot of my waking hours reading (it's how I access and understand the world). Therefore, it only feels natural to want to write a text and become part of this writing (and reading) club. reply boarnoah 2 hours agoprevSomething that gives me pause (to actually write into a blog) or to put up any toy projects / exploratory code as FOSS is I am not too keen on the idea of LLM companies and similar scraping that for their dataset [1]. Its not really a new problem, scraping the web and similar for monetary profit has been a thing for decades, but it feels worse in some ways? At least I certainly have paused and had more of a reluctance to making minor things available with no strings attached than I historically have been. Same goes for writing into sites like HN or Reddit really. Perhaps that is being selfish, after all there is some value in documenting things for other humans to find out about, maybe time-capsule of a blog is a better fit for this? Although blogging about anything particularly niche / context heavy is likely irrelevant a few years on.

It's changed a lot: I used to write full articles and short stories every week, but now that is rare (though it still happens: I just did one a few days go). It's evolved into being mostly a commonplace book now. What's more, all search engines are disallowed, and there are no comments, so it's just for me and a few people who know about it. Design-wise, it's just a single file with minimal HTML, and thousands of entries, sorted by time. You can search it with cmd-f, or have the page scroll to a random entry. It loads in about a second. There are at least two ways it gives me value: in having an archive of 25+ years of things I thought were important, and giving me a reason to keep my eyes open for things to think and post about. I think that's an unusual reason to have a blog, but I also think the people who started blogs to make money or get hired are probably out of the game by now, too. reply JKCalhoun 4 hours agoprev> The Game Engine Trap. What is that? I have a few theories. One is that the developer doesn't really want to ultimately write a game. Creating the assets needed for a game, as an example, can be daunting. Implementing high scores, audio, saving game state.... There is a lot of work to create a game beyond the rendering part. Or the developer is intimidated by the more qualitative nature of the \"game part\" of the game. The engine can be measured in FPS, etc. How do you measure how fun the game is? A recent approach I took was to write the game \"firstmost\" — the game engine was a necessity to realizing that goal. FWIW, I used SDL to create a kind of sprite engine. The \"engine\" was bare-bones but allowed me to recreate a shareware game of mine for Steam. After the project was done I began a second (sprite-based) game by first moving over the same game engine code. But this new project required I extend the engine (there were new \"feature requirements\" unique to this new game). In this way the engine can evolve from project to project, but never becomes a means to no end. (And if you do it right, you ought to be able to pull the engine back into the original project with a minimal of refactoring.) Maybe I'm just suggesting something that everyone already knows. reply probably_wrong 4 hours agoparentI have a different theory. Making your own engine is a way to turn the enthusiasm I have now into something productive now. If I want to make a character jump in Unity I need to familiarize myself with Assets, GameObjects, Cameras (don't forget the CamRotate component!), C#, Rigidbody and Colliders. My hunger for programming has turned into homework. But if I make my own engine I have more control between where I am, where I wanted to go, and what do I need to do in order to get there. It is also probably a waste of time as I'll solve over and over problems that the game engine has been refining for decades. But I definitely see the appeal. reply galleywest200 4 hours agorootparentThis is part of the reason I have so much fun with the Pico-8 and now the official successor program Picotron....

I started in 2006, except I just post photos. reply steve_adams_86 3 hours agoprevThis resonates with me. I had a recent stint of not writing due to very intense discouragement and feeling like a bit of a fraud. Like Jonas, I was writing for myself and kind of lived in a bubble where my posts had no comment system and I saw around 5 visitors per day on average with the odd boom to hundreds to thousands for a day or two. This was rare. I didn't worry much about what I wrote so much as how much I enjoyed writing it. Eventually I was struggling in the job market and someone suggested that my writing was hurting my prospects. They found the odd typo and grammar mistake, thought the content wasn't particularly good, that it was hard to follow/disjointed, etc. I immediately took it all down and felt like a bit of a fool to have thought anyone would actually find it useful. Maybe I should have written it but kept it offline like a personal journal, I thought. After a year or so it occurred to me how incredibly wrong all of that was. I never should have taken anything offline. I've hired people before, many times, and not once did I stumble across a candidate's personal blog and think \"ugh, typos. grammar mistakes. no thanks\". These things are a signal of a person's character, curiosity, ability, and all kinds of other factors that matter a lot. Almost always these things helped people I was hiring more than it hurt. There's the odd case where I could tell the site wasn't followed through on and that's not great, but it's very relatable too. I took a while but started writing again, started sharing it in an attempt to shake the self-doubt out of myself, and it has been an incredibly refreshing and rejuvenating experience. Writing reminds me of what I love about programming, because I primarily write about the things I find fascinating or engaging. It gives me a greater sense of knowledge and ability as I've covered a topic so thoroughly. It's a mental exercise not only in writing itself, but understanding. Jonas says this and I couldn't agree more: something about it is just fun. I can't put my finger on it. When I'm writing, I'm in a focused and engaged state almost instantly. It's where I want to be. If you doubt yourself and feel like writing isn't for you—even though you enjoy it—I hope you can take something from my experience and realize that it's still worth it. No one cares if you don't write like an acclaimed author. No one cares if there's the odd typo or bad grammar. The point is to enjoy it, and share that with people who are curious. The more you do it, the better you'll get. It can become a real source of joy in your life. reply MDJMediaLab 4 hours agoprevI really enjoyed that post graph of theirs.

There are three primary reasons why AR glasses are key to unlocking the next great leap in human-oriented computing. They enable digital experiences that are unconstrained by the limits of a smartphone screen. With large holographic displays, you can use the physical world as your canvas, placing 2D and 3D content and experiences anywhere you want. They seamlessly integrate contextual AI that can sense and understand the world around you in order to anticipate and proactively address your needs. They’re lightweight and great for both indoor and outdoor use, and they let people see each other’s face, eyes and expressions. That’s the north star our industry has been building towards: a product combining the convenience and immediacy of wearables with a large display, high-bandwidth input and contextualized AI in a form that people feel comfortable wearing in their daily lives. The Evolution of Smart Glasses Ray-Ban Meta glasses have demonstrated the power of giving people hands-free access to key parts of their digital lives from their physical ones. We can talk to a smart AI assistant, connect with friends and capture the moments that matter – all without ever having to pull out a phone. Yet while Ray-Ban Meta opened up an entirely new category of display-less glasses super-charged by AI, the XR industry has long dreamt of true AR glasses – a product that combines the benefits of a large holographic display and personalized AI assistance in a comfortable, all-day wearable form factor. Orion rises to the challenge. Groundbreaking AR Display in an Unparalleled Form We’ve been hard at work for years to take the incredible spatial experiences afforded by VR and MR headsets and miniaturize the technology necessary to deliver those experiences in a pair of lightweight, stylish glasses. Nailing the form factor, delivering holographic displays, developing compelling AR experiences, creating new human-computer interaction (HCI) paradigms – and doing it all in one cohesive product – is one of the most difficult challenges our industry has ever faced. It was so challenging that we thought we had less than a 10% chance of pulling it off successfully. Until now. Orion is a feat of miniaturization – the components are packed down to a fraction of a millimeter. Dozens of innovations were required to get the design down to a contemporary form that you’d be comfortable wearing every day. Orion has the largest field of view in the smallest AR glasses form to date. That field of view unlocks truly immersive use cases for Orion, from multitasking windows and big-screen entertainment to life-size holograms of people – all digital content that can seamlessly blend with your view of the physical world. But what makes Orion unique is that it is unmistakably a pair of glasses in both look and feel – complete with transparent lenses. Unlike MR headsets or other AR glasses today, you can still see other people’s eyes and expressions, so you can be present and share the experience with the people around you. Augmented Reality Experiences Of course, as with any piece of hardware, Orion is only as good as the things you can do with it. And while it’s still early days, the experiences afforded by Orion are an exciting glimpse of what’s to come. We’ve got our smart assistant, Meta AI, running on Orion. It understands what you’re looking at in the physical world and can help you with useful visualizations. So you can open up your refrigerator and ask for a recipe based on what’s inside. Or video call a friend while adjusting a digital family calendar as you wash the dishes. You can take a hands-free video call to catch up with friends and family in real time, and you can stay connected on WhatsApp and Messenger to view and send messages. No need to pull out your phone, unlock it, find the right app and let your friend know you’re running late for dinner – you can do it all through your glasses. Our teams continue to iterate on the experiences available through Orion today to build new immersive social experiences, and we can’t wait to share what’s next. A Purposeful Product Prototype While Orion won’t make its way into the hands of consumers, make no mistake: this is not a research prototype. It’s one of the most polished product prototypes we’ve ever developed, and is truly representative of something that could ship to consumers. Rather than rushing to put it on shelves, we decided to focus on internal development first, which means we can keep building quickly and continue to push the boundaries of the technology, helping us arrive at an even better consumer product faster. What Comes Next Beginning today at Connect and continuing throughout the year, we’re opening up access to our Orion product prototype for Meta employees and select external audiences so our development team can learn, iterate and build towards our consumer AR glasses product line, which we plan to begin shipping in the near future. And now that we’ve shared Orion with the world, we’re focused on a few things: Tuning the AR display quality to make the visuals even sharper Optimizing wherever we can to make the form factor even smaller Building at scale to make them more affordable In the next few years, you can expect to see new devices from us that build on our R&D efforts. Orion isn’t just a window into the future – it’s a look at the very real possibilities within reach today. From Ray-Ban Meta glasses to Orion, we’ve seen the good that can come from letting people stay more present and empowered in the physical world, while tapping into all that the digital world has to offer.

Plus Snap's core business is a mess I don't see how they could really compete with Meta on this they'll run out of money first. It's cool to see Meta's continued work/focus in this space - a polished internal prototype is probably the right place for this hardware. reply prettymuchnoone 37 minutes agorootparentprevdon't know about spectacles but the verge's article about it quote someone saying it's about 10k to make this: > As Meta’s executives retell it, the decision to shelve Orion mostly came down to the device’s astronomical cost to build, which is in the ballpark of $10,000 per unit. Most of that cost is due to how difficult and expensive it is to reliably manufacture the silicon carbide lenses. When it started designing Orion, Meta expected the material to become more commonly used across the industry and therefore cheaper, but that didn’t happen. reply wongarsu 23 minutes agoparentprevAesthetically I prefer the visor look of the HoloLens. However if you want to appeal to people outside a work environment something that looks like actual glasses is the way forwards.

The release is very light on details of field of view and resolution (other than \"best ever\" puffery), that's where we'll get a better sense of actual use cases. The ball game shown looked very rudimentary in terms of only taking place in a small directly-in-front-of-user sense. This is also where HoloLens games fell flat -- you'd turn your head slightly to the left or right, and suddenly key game elements would vanish. Edit -- the home page says 70-degree FoV. Not bad, better than HoloLens (45-degree FoV if I recall), but perhaps not enough to turn your head to the person next to you while still having game elements persist in vision reply baby 40 minutes agoparentapparently they did something weird with the glasses to bend the light and increase your FOV, I'm not sure what that means but it looks intriguing. reply smileson2 2 minutes agoprevIt’s a cool concept, I do like the idea of something like this as a sort of hud for some tasks I also wanted that from HoloLens and hololens2 which I worked with for a bit but both of those were just painful for me to use and I wasn’t a fan of the display reply ang_cire 37 minutes agoprevThis is cool from a technical standpoint, but ultimately just feels like another gimmick. This feels like it's doing stuff that I could do faster or better (and definitely, more safely) on a computer or phone. I don't personally see the appeal of hands-free as a paradigm in most cases. Do we really want people talking on and looking at Zoom as they walk around the office? Or as they drive? Or as they are out shopping? I also see ESPN and YouTube, so yeah... this thing better detect when you're moving at speed and disable video apps. I'm just struggling to see when you would be in a setting where you should use these, that you shouldn't be using a device you already have. It's like trying to sell me on using a smartwatch to take voice calls: sure, there is exactly 1 situation I can think of where that's useful, which is getting a call when I'm out running and don't want to \"lug\" a whole phone with me. But I sure don't want to be wearing glasses when I otherwise don't need to (and these aren't prescription, so you are), just in case someone tries to Zoom me unplanned. Can you imagine how goofy you'd look sitting at a coffee shop and just sort of staring into the middle distance and talking, as you take a Zoom call? reply xpl 19 minutes agoparent> Can you imagine how goofy you'd look sitting at a coffee shop and just sort of staring into the middle distance and talking, as you take a Zoom call? Honestly, people used to say the same thing about Bluetooth hands-free devices years ago, and now no one even bats an eye when someone talks using AirPods. reply stvltvs 4 minutes agorootparentIt still catches me off guard sometimes. Just a personal opinion, but it's a bit offputting because it's distracting to hear only one half of the conversation. My brain is dragged unwillingly into filling in the other half. Also we tend to talk kinda obnoxiously loud on the phone. But I guess that applies equally well to all public phone conversations. reply Kye 5 minutes agorootparentprevIt still looks goofy and takes me a moment to register they're talking to someone on a phone when they breeze by. reply vidarh 2 minutes agorootparentprevca. 25 years ago, I remember seeing the first coming comparing people with hands-free with the \"village idiot\" and making the point that we couldn't tell regular people apart from the village idiot any longer, because it'd implicitly already become normal. In other words: This was normalized a generation ago. And now I feel very old. reply crazygringo 17 minutes agoparentprevI definitely see the appeal. A vastly larger screen where you don't have to crane your neck down to read the news? That sounds amazing for my daily commute, and so much healthier for my neck and shoulders. And visible directions while cycling would be amazing, when it's unsafe to glance at your phone. (Audio directions aren't nearly as good, and wearing headphones/earbuds while cycling is illegal in a lot of places as well.) A heads-up display in your car should be safer too than looking down at the screen. And if people are having video calls while walking, that doesn't seem any goofier or creepier from audio calls with earbuds, where it already looks like somebody talking to nobody. reply stvltvs 0 minutes agorootparentProbably depends on your area, but when I was bike commuting, I refused to give in to the temptation to wear even one headphone. Staying completely focused and aware of traffic saved me quite a few times. You won't be surprised to know what I think about cycling with AR. reply IanCal 30 minutes agoparentprevWhat's weird to me with the call example is I can receive a video call but I can't respond with a video of me. And I find being on a video call with someone just on audio very creepy. If I'm not a weirdo for that, then it's distinctly worse than a hands free voice call, which we already have reply jebarker 13 minutes agoparentprevI think the real killer use case of AR glasses is when multiple people have them and can look at shared 3D content. The TV show \"The First\" (sadly cancelled) did a good job of showing use cases for this. reply dayvid 3 minutes agoparentprevI remember when the iPad came out and everyone was making jokes about it. No one would image a phone would be a primary computing device. Don't know if glasses are the next major step, but a handheld phone being a computing device is a transitory thing. reply baby 32 minutes agoparentprevIf you get the opportunity to try the Meta glasses, you will quickly see that it's more than just a gimmick, and they don't even have any display reply TiredOfLife 29 minutes agorootparentOrion is a see through device with screen. Something like Hololens. reply baby 26 minutes agorootparentthat's what I said, the Meta glasses don't even have a display and they're insanely useful (through the AI assistant, the speakers, the microphone, the camera).

Also I never adapted to having an LLM in my ear (big network induced lag times didn't help), so ymmv All I want are glasses that can tell me where I left my wallet but I don't think we'll see it this decade. reply lrivers 17 minutes agorootparentPlus, “that person’s name is ‘jazzyjackson’” when you’re looking at them reply eddieroger 13 minutes agoparentprevI am one of the people who own and enjoy using an Apple Vision Pro. A year ago, my wife and I welcomed our daughter to the world. Having a device that can be interacted with hands-free and produces no outward light has been useful more than once in the last year. A front-facing camera pointing at the world around me lets me share my girl with family far away in a first-person POV. There are use cases beyond Zooming from a coffee shop for which devices like these are welcomed innovations and definitely appealing. And that doesn't even count that I just genuinely like working with my headset on at my desk. I'm a spatial thinker, so arranging things I need around me makes sense. reply mynameisash 16 minutes agoparentprev> Can you imagine how goofy you'd look sitting at a coffee shop and just sort of staring into the middle distance and talking, as you take a Zoom call?

Watching content & or working using smart glasses doesn't make sense to me but using them to ask it count how many ppl in a room, keep the score of my pickleball game or whatever game that involves using vision to keep score and many other innovative ideas are useful to exciting prospects personally. Yet overall my Ray bans are a great pair of sunglasses that let me take pics or video either hands free or not.

But the friction of phone screens might be quite healthy to society. On the other hand in blue collar work this is invaluable.

The only real difference is the customer reply momoschili 33 minutes agorootparentI think the requirements at the semi level are quite different than what the tooling industry will be able to produce. The silicon carbide layer thickness probably needs to be controlled at least to the 10 nm level and the film quality will need to be quite high for optical applications. There is some use of silicon carbide in semi in high power electronics, but I don't know how well that transfers to optical quality either. reply kaycebasques 25 minutes agoprevFor a long time it nagged at me that I was sleeping on VR/AR/XR. Couldn't bring myself to spend hundreds of dollars on something I may not use consistently, though. A few months back my wife was restoring a mural and one of the artists brought their Quest headset with Kingspray Graffiti loaded up on it. My wife tried it and loved it so I finally had enough excuse to buy a headset. It's pretty great. The first experience is quite memorable. My \"killer app\" is Xbox Cloud Gaming. I love laying on the couch with a gigantic, very high-quality screen immersing me in Starfield. Although two nights ago I think I got serious motion sickness. Haven't found any killer/sticky apps beyond that.

Yes, you can keep improving the hardware, but you'd think we would have figured out something that is better enough in VR or AR on current hardware.

But the pattern is fixed at manufacturing time, not varying with the image that's being displayed. And the image being displayed to each eye is still 2D, not 3D.

Orion is very promising and appears to be in the lead for mainstream XR glasses so far.

[The display] features Micro LED projectors inside the frame that beam graphics in front of your eyes via waveguides in the lenses. These lenses are made of silicon carbide, not plastic or glass.

This 2022 paper seems like a good explainer of the tech, def download the PDF for the Figures: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-09680-1 Through careful dispersion control in the excited propagation and diffraction modes, we design and implement our high-resolution full-color prototype, via the combination of analytical–numerical simulations, nanofabrication and device measurements... Our MOE waveguide utilizes only a single glass layer for the whole RGB spectrum, reducing unwanted diffraction and with higher efficiency. Our single-layer implementation also brings compactness and lightweight operation, while simplifying the MOE fabrication and yield.

Love it, and believe them 100% on the specific claim! Supposedly Apple Vision came about when they finally gave up on traditional AR (for now). 3. \"Zuckerberg imagines that people will want to use AR glasses like Orion for two primary purposes: communicating with each other through digital information overlaid on the real world — which he calls “holograms” — and interacting with AI.\" I hope to god \"AI\" as a term looses steam -- basically all he's saying is that this computer will be used for computing. Yes, indeed. 4. \"To demonstrate how two people wearing Orion together could interact with the same holograms, I played a 3D take on Pong with Zuckerberg... Zuckerberg beat me, unfortunately.\" I find it somewhat hilarious how Zuckerberg, Bezos and Elon are simultaneously some of the most powerful people to ever live, and at the same time mascots for multinational conglomerates bigger than they could ever hope to truly understand or control. Zuckerberg is obviously the best mascot out of the bunch, and this is only further proof of that. 5. Wow, the Neural Wristband is insanely cool. Just... wow.

Academics consider neural interfaces to be directly touching the neurons, whether an invasive BCI, or an invasive device touching part of the peripheral nervous system. Technically this is a \"neuromotor\" interface, motor meaning detecting muscle, rather than neuron, activity.

No matter how many pixels you can jam into these things, there just isn't a compelling case for using them. Nothing that isn't easier to do with a touchscreen or a keyboard. Those midair gestures just aren't ergonomic. And there's no way to balance the transmissivity of the lenses and the overlayed images without getting crummier visuals than a screen. AR experiences on headsets and on phones have been bouncing around for years. There was a big push with new XR toolkits from Apple and Android a few years ago. Yet no one has ever produced anything more than a demo of something nifty. The one and only \"killer app\" remains Pokemon Go which is really just a clever gimmick. I think this is a classic solution in search of a problem. reply Sanzig 46 minutes agoprevOn one hand - if the demos are representative, this looks like a very cool product right out of science fiction. On the other hand, Meta is one of the very last companies that I would trust to operate a fleet of network connected always-on cameras attached to everyone's faces. The privacy implications are pretty horrifying. Imagine if Meta decided to run facial recognition on-device and upload the results to their advertising services. Your position could be easily tracked any time you walk into the field of view of someone wearing Meta glasses without your consent.

The sales pitch is way too enticing for them to ignore. Imagine you're in a brick and mortar wireless store shopping for a new cell plan. A Meta user walks by, and you get caught in a frame. A facial recognition scan quickly links you to your shadow profile, and an image recognition model identifies that you are phone shopping. Meta knows who you are and pings your current carrier who quickly dispatches a phone call to you with a pre-emptive retention offer. It may sound outlandish, but all the pieces are there to do this today. IMHO, we need strong regulation of facial recognition technology. The conversation too often focuses on law enforcement use - don't get me wrong, that is also important, but it completely ignores the risk posed by private databases. reply JoshTriplett 20 minutes agorootparent> Oh, I am sure they'll try.

For instance, the media never seemed to get the point of Horizon Worlds in that if VR content is going to be like the web, there has to be authoring tools that make it possible for the ordinary Joe to make content. The persona I think of is the owner of a few Thai restaurants who is very savvy about SEO and SMO and developing relationships with DoorDash and such. That person has to see the value of having a VR or AR presence that is greater than the cost of developing. Horizon Worlds fell down in many ways not least in making you create everything with computational solid geometry and not letting you import image, video and 3d assets. Sorry but McDonalds has to put the Coca-Cola logo on the side of the drink cups. One trouble is the size of those assets has to be managed so that you don’t overload the rendering engine or the comm link. Another is that people are going to make worlds stuffed with porno images or theaters where you can watch pirated movies. As it is their authoring tools aren’t that good, people who know how to author 3-d content can’t use the tools and processes that are good at, and your world can only be so big. There are many good games that are developed with the expensive processes used to make 3d games and a huge number of Horizon Worlds competitors, I am sure Meta wants to see one succeed but it is not an easy problem. I like my MQ3 but for entertainment it competes with other options (sure it was fun to watch the last Star Wars movie in 3D and I like VR games but normal video and video games is hard to beat) and for creative work it is the same: in theory I could publish my stereograms in VR with A-Frame but there are so many other projects to work on. reply giancarlostoro 52 minutes agoparentprevI mean.

PLOS Medicine 19(8): e1004085. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004085 View correction Abstract Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research. Figures Citation: Ioannidis JPA (2005) Why Most Published Research Findings Are False.

Competing interests: The author has declared that no competing interests exist. Abbreviation: PPV, positive predictive value Published research findings are sometimes refuted by subsequent evidence, with ensuing confusion and disappointment. Refutation and controversy is seen across the range of research designs, from clinical trials and traditional epidemiological studies [1–3] to the most modern molecular research [4,5]. There is increasing concern that in modern research, false findings may be the majority or even the vast majority of published research claims [6–8]. However, this should not be surprising. It can be proven that most claimed research findings are false. Here I will examine the key factors that influence this problem and some corollaries thereof. Modeling the Framework for False Positive Findings Several methodologists have pointed out [9–11] that the high rate of nonreplication (lack of confirmation) of research discoveries is a consequence of the convenient, yet ill-founded strategy of claiming conclusive research findings solely on the basis of a single study assessed by formal statistical significance, typically for a p-value less than 0.05. Research is not most appropriately represented and summarized by p-values, but, unfortunately, there is a widespread notion that medical research articles should be interpreted based only on p-values. Research findings are defined here as any relationship reaching formal statistical significance, e.g., effective interventions, informative predictors, risk factors, or associations. “Negative” research is also very useful. “Negative” is actually a misnomer, and the misinterpretation is widespread. However, here we will target relationships that investigators claim exist, rather than null findings. It can be proven that most claimed research findings are false As has been shown previously, the probability that a research finding is indeed true depends on the prior probability of it being true (before doing the study), the statistical power of the study, and the level of statistical significance [10,11]. Consider a 2 × 2 table in which research findings are compared against the gold standard of true relationships in a scientific field. In a research field both true and false hypotheses can be made about the presence of relationships. Let R be the ratio of the number of “true relationships” to “no relationships” among those tested in the field. R is characteristic of the field and can vary a lot depending on whether the field targets highly likely relationships or searches for only one or a few true relationships among thousands and millions of hypotheses that may be postulated. Let us also consider, for computational simplicity, circumscribed fields where either there is only one true relationship (among many that can be hypothesized) or the power is similar to find any of the several existing true relationships. The pre-study probability of a relationship being true is R/(R + 1). The probability of a study finding a true relationship reflects the power 1 - β (one minus the Type II error rate). The probability of claiming a relationship when none truly exists reflects the Type I error rate, α. Assuming that c relationships are being probed in the field, the expected values of the 2 × 2 table are given in Table 1. After a research finding has been claimed based on achieving formal statistical significance, the post-study probability that it is true is the positive predictive value, PPV. The PPV is also the complementary probability of what Wacholder et al. have called the false positive report probability [10]. According to the 2 × 2 table, one gets PPV = (1 - β)R/(R - βR + α). A research finding is thus more likely true than false if (1 - β)R > α. Since usually the vast majority of investigators depend on a = 0.05, this means that a research finding is more likely true than false if (1 - β)R > 0.05.

Research Findings and True Relationships https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124.t001 What is less well appreciated is that bias and the extent of repeated independent testing by different teams of investigators around the globe may further distort this picture and may lead to even smaller probabilities of the research findings being indeed true. We will try to model these two factors in the context of similar 2 × 2 tables. Bias First, let us define bias as the combination of various design, data, analysis, and presentation factors that tend to produce research findings when they should not be produced. Let u be the proportion of probed analyses that would not have been “research findings,” but nevertheless end up presented and reported as such, because of bias. Bias should not be confused with chance variability that causes some findings to be false by chance even though the study design, data, analysis, and presentation are perfect. Bias can entail manipulation in the analysis or reporting of findings. Selective or distorted reporting is a typical form of such bias. We may assume that u does not depend on whether a true relationship exists or not. This is not an unreasonable assumption, since typically it is impossible to know which relationships are indeed true. In the presence of bias (Table 2), one gets PPV = ([1 - β]R + uβR)/(R + α − βR + u − uα + uβR), and PPV decreases with increasing u, unless 1 − β ≤ α, i.e., 1 − β ≤ 0.05 for most situations. Thus, with increasing bias, the chances that a research finding is true diminish considerably. This is shown for different levels of power and for different pre-study odds in Figure 1. Conversely, true research findings may occasionally be annulled because of reverse bias. For example, with large measurement errors relationships are lost in noise [12], or investigators use data inefficiently or fail to notice statistically significant relationships, or there may be conflicts of interest that tend to “bury” significant findings [13]. There is no good large-scale empirical evidence on how frequently such reverse bias may occur across diverse research fields. However, it is probably fair to say that reverse bias is not as common. Moreover measurement errors and inefficient use of data are probably becoming less frequent problems, since measurement error has decreased with technological advances in the molecular era and investigators are becoming increasingly sophisticated about their data. Regardless, reverse bias may be modeled in the same way as bias above. Also reverse bias should not be confused with chance variability that may lead to missing a true relationship because of chance.

Research Findings and True Relationships in the Presence of Bias https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124.t002 Testing by Several Independent Teams Several independent teams may be addressing the same sets of research questions. As research efforts are globalized, it is practically the rule that several research teams, often dozens of them, may probe the same or similar questions. Unfortunately, in some areas, the prevailing mentality until now has been to focus on isolated discoveries by single teams and interpret research experiments in isolation. An increasing number of questions have at least one study claiming a research finding, and this receives unilateral attention. The probability that at least one study, among several done on the same question, claims a statistically significant research finding is easy to estimate. For n independent studies of equal power, the 2 × 2 table is shown in Table 3: PPV = R(1 − βn)/(R + 1 − [1 − α]n − Rβn) (not considering bias). With increasing number of independent studies, PPV tends to decrease, unless 1 - β < a, i.e., typically 1 − β < 0.05. This is shown for different levels of power and for different pre-study odds in Figure 2. For n studies of different power, the term βn is replaced by the product of the terms βi for i = 1 to n, but inferences are similar.

Research Findings and True Relationships in the Presence of Multiple Studies https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124.t003 Corollaries A practical example is shown in Box 1. Based on the above considerations, one may deduce several interesting corollaries about the probability that a research finding is indeed true. Box 1. An Example: Science at Low Pre-Study Odds Let us assume that a team of investigators performs a whole genome association study to test whether any of 100,000 gene polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia. Based on what we know about the extent of heritability of the disease, it is reasonable to expect that probably around ten gene polymorphisms among those tested would be truly associated with schizophrenia, with relatively similar odds ratios around 1.3 for the ten or so polymorphisms and with a fairly similar power to identify any of them. Then R = 10/100,000 = 10−4, and the pre-study probability for any polymorphism to be associated with schizophrenia is also R/(R + 1) = 10−4. Let us also suppose that the study has 60% power to find an association with an odds ratio of 1.3 at α = 0.05. Then it can be estimated that if a statistically significant association is found with the p-value barely crossing the 0.05 threshold, the post-study probability that this is true increases about 12-fold compared with the pre-study probability, but it is still only 12 × 10−4. Now let us suppose that the investigators manipulate their design, analyses, and reporting so as to make more relationships cross the p = 0.05 threshold even though this would not have been crossed with a perfectly adhered to design and analysis and with perfect comprehensive reporting of the results, strictly according to the original study plan. Such manipulation could be done, for example, with serendipitous inclusion or exclusion of certain patients or controls, post hoc subgroup analyses, investigation of genetic contrasts that were not originally specified, changes in the disease or control definitions, and various combinations of selective or distorted reporting of the results. Commercially available “data mining” packages actually are proud of their ability to yield statistically significant results through data dredging. In the presence of bias with u = 0.10, the post-study probability that a research finding is true is only 4.4 × 10−4. Furthermore, even in the absence of any bias, when ten independent research teams perform similar experiments around the world, if one of them finds a formally statistically significant association, the probability that the research finding is true is only 1.5 × 10−4, hardly any higher than the probability we had before any of this extensive research was undertaken! Corollary 1: The smaller the studies conducted in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. Small sample size means smaller power and, for all functions above, the PPV for a true research finding decreases as power decreases towards 1 − β = 0.05. Thus, other factors being equal, research findings are more likely true in scientific fields that undertake large studies, such as randomized controlled trials in cardiology (several thousand subjects randomized) [14] than in scientific fields with small studies, such as most research of molecular predictors (sample sizes 100-fold smaller) [15]. Corollary 2: The smaller the effect sizes in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. Power is also related to the effect size. Thus research findings are more likely true in scientific fields with large effects, such as the impact of smoking on cancer or cardiovascular disease (relative risks 3–20), than in scientific fields where postulated effects are small, such as genetic risk factors for multigenetic diseases (relative risks 1.1–1.5) [7]. Modern epidemiology is increasingly obliged to target smaller effect sizes [16]. Consequently, the proportion of true research findings is expected to decrease. In the same line of thinking, if the true effect sizes are very small in a scientific field, this field is likely to be plagued by almost ubiquitous false positive claims. For example, if the majority of true genetic or nutritional determinants of complex diseases confer relative risks less than 1.05, genetic or nutritional epidemiology would be largely utopian endeavors. Corollary 3: The greater the number and the lesser the selection of tested relationships in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. As shown above, the post-study probability that a finding is true (PPV) depends a lot on the pre-study odds (R). Thus, research findings are more likely true in confirmatory designs, such as large phase III randomized controlled trials, or meta-analyses thereof, than in hypothesis-generating experiments. Fields considered highly informative and creative given the wealth of the assembled and tested information, such as microarrays and other high-throughput discovery-oriented research [4,8,17], should have extremely low PPV. Corollary 4: The greater the flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. Flexibility increases the potential for transforming what would be “negative” results into “positive” results, i.e., bias, u. For several research designs, e.g., randomized controlled trials [18–20] or meta-analyses [21,22], there have been efforts to standardize their conduct and reporting. Adherence to common standards is likely to increase the proportion of true findings. The same applies to outcomes. True findings may be more common when outcomes are unequivocal and universally agreed (e.g., death) rather than when multifarious outcomes are devised (e.g., scales for schizophrenia outcomes) [23]. Similarly, fields that use commonly agreed, stereotyped analytical methods (e.g., Kaplan-Meier plots and the log-rank test) [24] may yield a larger proportion of true findings than fields where analytical methods are still under experimentation (e.g., artificial intelligence methods) and only “best” results are reported. Regardless, even in the most stringent research designs, bias seems to be a major problem. For example, there is strong evidence that selective outcome reporting, with manipulation of the outcomes and analyses reported, is a common problem even for randomized trails [25]. Simply abolishing selective publication would not make this problem go away. Corollary 5: The greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. Conflicts of interest and prejudice may increase bias, u. Conflicts of interest are very common in biomedical research [26], and typically they are inadequately and sparsely reported [26,27]. Prejudice may not necessarily have financial roots. Scientists in a given field may be prejudiced purely because of their belief in a scientific theory or commitment to their own findings. Many otherwise seemingly independent, university-based studies may be conducted for no other reason than to give physicians and researchers qualifications for promotion or tenure. Such nonfinancial conflicts may also lead to distorted reported results and interpretations. Prestigious investigators may suppress via the peer review process the appearance and dissemination of findings that refute their findings, thus condemning their field to perpetuate false dogma. Empirical evidence on expert opinion shows that it is extremely unreliable [28]. Corollary 6: The hotter a scientific field (with more scientific teams involved), the less likely the research findings are to be true. This seemingly paradoxical corollary follows because, as stated above, the PPV of isolated findings decreases when many teams of investigators are involved in the same field. This may explain why we occasionally see major excitement followed rapidly by severe disappointments in fields that draw wide attention. With many teams working on the same field and with massive experimental data being produced, timing is of the essence in beating competition. Thus, each team may prioritize on pursuing and disseminating its most impressive “positive” results. “Negative” results may become attractive for dissemination only if some other team has found a “positive” association on the same question. In that case, it may be attractive to refute a claim made in some prestigious journal. The term Proteus phenomenon has been coined to describe this phenomenon of rapidly alternating extreme research claims and extremely opposite refutations [29]. Empirical evidence suggests that this sequence of extreme opposites is very common in molecular genetics [29]. These corollaries consider each factor separately, but these factors often influence each other. For example, investigators working in fields where true effect sizes are perceived to be small may be more likely to perform large studies than investigators working in fields where true effect sizes are perceived to be large. Or prejudice may prevail in a hot scientific field, further undermining the predictive value of its research findings. Highly prejudiced stakeholders may even create a barrier that aborts efforts at obtaining and disseminating opposing results. Conversely, the fact that a field is hot or has strong invested interests may sometimes promote larger studies and improved standards of research, enhancing the predictive value of its research findings. Or massive discovery-oriented testing may result in such a large yield of significant relationships that investigators have enough to report and search further and thus refrain from data dredging and manipulation. Most Research Findings Are False for Most Research Designs and for Most Fields In the described framework, a PPV exceeding 50% is quite difficult to get. Table 4 provides the results of simulations using the formulas developed for the influence of power, ratio of true to non-true relationships, and bias, for various types of situations that may be characteristic of specific study designs and settings. A finding from a well-conducted, adequately powered randomized controlled trial starting with a 50% pre-study chance that the intervention is effective is eventually true about 85% of the time. A fairly similar performance is expected of a confirmatory meta-analysis of good-quality randomized trials: potential bias probably increases, but power and pre-test chances are higher compared to a single randomized trial. Conversely, a meta-analytic finding from inconclusive studies where pooling is used to “correct” the low power of single studies, is probably false if R ≤ 1:3. Research findings from underpowered, early-phase clinical trials would be true about one in four times, or even less frequently if bias is present. Epidemiological studies of an exploratory nature perform even worse, especially when underpowered, but even well-powered epidemiological studies may have only a one in five chance being true, if R = 1:10. Finally, in discovery-oriented research with massive testing, where tested relationships exceed true ones 1,000-fold (e.g., 30,000 genes tested, of which 30 may be the true culprits) [30,31], PPV for each claimed relationship is extremely low, even with considerable standardization of laboratory and statistical methods, outcomes, and reporting thereof to minimize bias.

PPV of Research Findings for Various Combinations of Power (1 - ß), Ratio of True to Not-True Relationships (R), and Bias (u) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124.t004 Claimed Research Findings May Often Be Simply Accurate Measures of the Prevailing Bias As shown, the majority of modern biomedical research is operating in areas with very low pre- and post-study probability for true findings. Let us suppose that in a research field there are no true findings at all to be discovered. History of science teaches us that scientific endeavor has often in the past wasted effort in fields with absolutely no yield of true scientific information, at least based on our current understanding. In such a “null field,” one would ideally expect all observed effect sizes to vary by chance around the null in the absence of bias. The extent that observed findings deviate from what is expected by chance alone would be simply a pure measure of the prevailing bias. For example, let us suppose that no nutrients or dietary patterns are actually important determinants for the risk of developing a specific tumor. Let us also suppose that the scientific literature has examined 60 nutrients and claims all of them to be related to the risk of developing this tumor with relative risks in the range of 1.2 to 1.4 for the comparison of the upper to lower intake tertiles. Then the claimed effect sizes are simply measuring nothing else but the net bias that has been involved in the generation of this scientific literature. Claimed effect sizes are in fact the most accurate estimates of the net bias. It even follows that between “null fields,” the fields that claim stronger effects (often with accompanying claims of medical or public health importance) are simply those that have sustained the worst biases. For fields with very low PPV, the few true relationships would not distort this overall picture much. Even if a few relationships are true, the shape of the distribution of the observed effects would still yield a clear measure of the biases involved in the field. This concept totally reverses the way we view scientific results. Traditionally, investigators have viewed large and highly significant effects with excitement, as signs of important discoveries. Too large and too highly significant effects may actually be more likely to be signs of large bias in most fields of modern research. They should lead investigators to careful critical thinking about what might have gone wrong with their data, analyses, and results. Of course, investigators working in any field are likely to resist accepting that the whole field in which they have spent their careers is a “null field.” However, other lines of evidence, or advances in technology and experimentation, may lead eventually to the dismantling of a scientific field. Obtaining measures of the net bias in one field may also be useful for obtaining insight into what might be the range of bias operating in other fields where similar analytical methods, technologies, and conflicts may be operating. How Can We Improve the Situation? Is it unavoidable that most research findings are false, or can we improve the situation? A major problem is that it is impossible to know with 100% certainty what the truth is in any research question. In this regard, the pure “gold” standard is unattainable. However, there are several approaches to improve the post-study probability. Better powered evidence, e.g., large studies or low-bias meta-analyses, may help, as it comes closer to the unknown “gold” standard. However, large studies may still have biases and these should be acknowledged and avoided. Moreover, large-scale evidence is impossible to obtain for all of the millions and trillions of research questions posed in current research. Large-scale evidence should be targeted for research questions where the pre-study probability is already considerably high, so that a significant research finding will lead to a post-test probability that would be considered quite definitive. Large-scale evidence is also particularly indicated when it can test major concepts rather than narrow, specific questions. A negative finding can then refute not only a specific proposed claim, but a whole field or considerable portion thereof. Selecting the performance of large-scale studies based on narrow-minded criteria, such as the marketing promotion of a specific drug, is largely wasted research. Moreover, one should be cautious that extremely large studies may be more likely to find a formally statistical significant difference for a trivial effect that is not really meaningfully different from the null [32–34]. Second, most research questions are addressed by many teams, and it is misleading to emphasize the statistically significant findings of any single team. What matters is the totality of the evidence. Diminishing bias through enhanced research standards and curtailing of prejudices may also help. However, this may require a change in scientific mentality that might be difficult to achieve. In some research designs, efforts may also be more successful with upfront registration of studies, e.g., randomized trials [35]. Registration would pose a challenge for hypothesis-generating research. Some kind of registration or networking of data collections or investigators within fields may be more feasible than registration of each and every hypothesis-generating experiment. Regardless, even if we do not see a great deal of progress with registration of studies in other fields, the principles of developing and adhering to a protocol could be more widely borrowed from randomized controlled trials. Finally, instead of chasing statistical significance, we should improve our understanding of the range of R values—the pre-study odds—where research efforts operate [10]. Before running an experiment, investigators should consider what they believe the chances are that they are testing a true rather than a non-true relationship. Speculated high R values may sometimes then be ascertained. As described above, whenever ethically acceptable, large studies with minimal bias should be performed on research findings that are considered relatively established, to see how often they are indeed confirmed. I suspect several established “classics” will fail the test [36]. Nevertheless, most new discoveries will continue to stem from hypothesis-generating research with low or very low pre-study odds. We should then acknowledge that statistical significance testing in the report of a single study gives only a partial picture, without knowing how much testing has been done outside the report and in the relevant field at large. Despite a large statistical literature for multiple testing corrections [37], usually it is impossible to decipher how much data dredging by the reporting authors or other research teams has preceded a reported research finding. Even if determining this were feasible, this would not inform us about the pre-study odds. Thus, it is unavoidable that one should make approximate assumptions on how many relationships are expected to be true among those probed across the relevant research fields and research designs. The wider field may yield some guidance for estimating this probability for the isolated research project. Experiences from biases detected in other neighboring fields would also be useful to draw upon. Even though these assumptions would be considerably subjective, they would still be very useful in interpreting research claims and putting them in context. References 1.

This is an essay about a paper published a simulation based scenarios in medical research. It then try to generalize to \"research\" and avoid this very narrow support to the claim. I think this is something true and it should make us more cautious when deciding based on single studies. But things are different in other fields. Also this is called research. You don't know the answer before head. You have limitations in tech and tools you use. You might miss something, didn't have access to more information that could change the outcome. That is why research is a process. Unfortunately common science books talks only about discoveries, results that are considered fact but usually don't do much about the history of how we got there. I would like to suggest a great book called \"How experiments end\"[1] and enjoy going into details on how scientific conscious is built for many experiments in different fields (mostly physics). [1] https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo596942... reply ants_everywhere 17 hours agoparentI think the best way to view this paper is as a sort of meta-analysis of a wider literature around null hypothesis testing and p-values. That literature goes back at least to the 1970s with the work of people like Paul Meehl and Gene Glass. But you can push it further back, like the 1957 Lindley Paradox that Ioannidis cites. Part of the reason this paper was impactful is that it was short and punchy, took aim at all of medicine rather than a smaller subfield, and didn't require as much mathematical understanding as other papers. I knew some of the big names that were hit by the replication crisis. And before that I spent some time trying to talk to psychology researchers at a top school about the problems with statistical testing.

You might miss something, didn't have access to more information that could change the outcome. That is why research is a process. I totally agree. Science is basically a control system, or a root finding algorithm, or gradient descent. At any time t there is a gap between the best known science and the truth. But the point is that science converges to the truth over time, whereas no other alternative does. reply verisimi 13 hours agorootparentThe scientific method converges on the truth. But science need not. If the foundational assumptions are wrong or impossible to challenge, time t can extend indefinitely.

Famously the centralized church in the time of Galileo. More recently the cigarette and oil industries. Things like big personalities and legislative priorities tend to have much shorter time scale and usually allow for science to ratchet forward generationally.

There's actually quite a big assumption in here -- namely, that the truth is constant over time and throughout space. (This can possibly be weakened slightly, but that's the gist.) I personally think the laws of physics probably are unchanging, and I certainly hope they are (because that means the scientific method converges). But whether they actually are is not only unknown, but a question that cannot be answered by empirical science. reply ants_everywhere 6 hours agorootparentThis is an interesting point and one that physicists are aware of. But from a technical perspective, the math is perfectly capable of describing theoretical universes where the laws of physics change in time or space. For example, where physical constants are smoothly evolving or manifolds that don't look the same in all directions. The math can tell us what observations we'd expect in those situations, and so far we haven't observed anything to indicate we should relax those assumptions. If we did observe that the laws of physics were changing, that observation would be considered science in the traditional sense. So it's not that \"truth\" is shifting, it's that \"truth\" is a family of equations indexed by some parameter rather than a single equation. That's a similar flavor to the jump from Newtonian physics to relativity.

If new experimental data shows these assumptions fail in some cases, then the models can be updated to handle them, same as any other failure has been handled in the past.

That's especially true as you go further \"up the stack\" from math -> physics -> chem -> bio -> psych -> social. It is absolutely possible to honestly conduct a very high quality experiment with a real finding, but fail to account for something like \"on the way here, 80% of participants encountered a frustrating traffic jam.\" Their finding could be true for people who just encountered a traffic jam, and lack of replication would be due to an unsuccessful generalization from what they found. reply scns 19 hours agorootparentDislike being a pedant but the stack was missing math up front reply bakuninsbart 10 hours agorootparentMath isn't a science, it is a tool we can use to construct coherent arguments.

Think of experiments of certain types before and after COVID-19. reply jerf 5 hours agorootparentprev\"Just because a study doesn't replicate, doesn't make it false.\" This is a subtle point, but truth or falsity isn't really the issue. The problem with a non-replicable study is that the rest of science can't build on it. You can't build your PhD on top of a handful of studies that turn out to be non-replicable, and so on. It is true you can't build science on outright false statements, either, but true statements that aren't adequately reproducible are also not a solid enough foundation. That may seem counterintuitive, but it comes down to this truth not being binary; even if a study comes to a nominally true conclusion it still matters if it didn't do it via the correct method, or is somehow otherwise deficient in the path it took to get there. Studies are more than just the headline result in the abstract. But the whole process of science right now is based on building up over time. How could it not be? It has to be, of course. But non-replicable studies mean that the things you're trying to build on them are non-replicable too. It doesn't take all that much before you're just operating in a realm of flights of fancy where you may \"feel\" like you're on solid ground because of all the Science you're sitting on top of, but it's all just so much air. However, it is also true that non-replicability is a signal of falsity, and that is simply due to the fact that the vast, vast, vast, exponential majority of all possible hypotheses are false. As is another subtle point, a scientist engaging in science properly should probably not come to that conclusion and may not want to change their priors about something because of a non-reproducible study very much, but externally, from the generalized perspective of \"what is true and is not true\" where science is merely one particularly useful tool and not the final arbiter, I may be justified in taking non-replicable studies and updating my priors to increase the odds of the hypothesis being false. After all, at the very least, a non-replicable study tends to put an upper bound on the ability of the hypothesis to be true (e.g., if someone studies whether or not substance X kills bacteria Y, and it turns out not to reproduce very well, the lack of reproducibility does fairly strongly establish it can't be that lethal). reply tptacek 20 hours agorootparentprevOutright research fraud is probably very rare; the cases we've heard about stick out, but people outside of academia usually don't have a good intuition for just how vast the annual output of the sciences are.

There was a study a few years where they tried to replicate a bunch of top cited psychology papers and the majority of the experiments were not replicated. Then people did the same for other disciplines afterwards and, while it wasn't as bad as psychology, there were plenty of papers they couldn't replicate. reply tptacek 18 hours agorootparentEvery time this topic comes up I'm reminded of what Stefan Savage, a hero of mine, said about academic papers (\"studies\", in the sense we're discussing here): they are the beginnings of conversations, not the end.

There are several chemistry youtubers who have failed to \"reproduce\" papers they are working from. Does that mean chemistry is a farce and doesn't work? No, it means some chemist at some point in history failed to write something down, mostly because they didn't even know or realize it mattered.

Incompetent people can certainly commit fraud (perhaps to try to cover up their incompetence), but that's by no means required. > ...insist they just made honest mistakes If they're lying about that, it's fraud; they're either covering up their unrealized incompetence with fraud, or trying to cover up their intended fraud with protestations of mere incompetence.

The startling rise in the publication of sham science papers has its roots in China, where young doctors and scientists seeking promotion were required to have published scientific papers. Shadow organisations – known as “paper mills” – began to supply fabricated work for publication in journals there. https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/feb/03/the-situatio... The number of retractions issued for research articles in 2023 has passed 10,000 — smashing annual records — as publishers struggle to clean up a slew of sham papers and peer-review fraud. Among large research-producing nations, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Russia and China have the highest retraction rates over the past two decades, a Nature analysis has found. https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03974-8 That's why a recent article https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41607430, where the measurement of China leads world in 57 of 64 critical technologies was based on number of journal citations, was laughable. reply a_bonobo 19 hours agorootparentTalking with some Chinese colleagues in the past, they were talking about having a 'base' salary which was not enough to have a family on.

Of course the same thing is happening in the 'Western' world too, with a publication ratchet going on. New hire has 50 papers out? OK!

And so on. reply nativeit 17 hours agorootparent...an effect known as \"wonkflation\". reply resoluteteeth 19 hours agorootparentprevI think there are maybe two separate issues here. Paper mills are bad but mostly from the perspective of academic institutions trying to verify people's credentials/resumes. Paper mills aren't really that much of a concern in the sense of published research results being false in the way the article is talking about because people aren't really reading the papers they publish. In that sense it doesn't really matter if there are places where non-scientists need to get one paper published to check some box to get a promotion, because nobody is really considering those papers part of established scientific knowledge. On the other hand, scientists intentionally (by actually falsifying data) or unintentionally (as a result of statistical effects of what is researched and what is published) publishing bogus results in journals that are considered legitimate which aren't paper mills actually causes real harm as a result of people believing the bogus results, and unfortunately the pressures that cause that (publishing papers quickly, getting publishable results, etc.) exist everywhere, and definitely not just in China, nor did they originate in China. reply pragmomm 19 hours agorootparentI think you're making the wrong distinction here, it's not about whether the result came from a known or unknown paper mill in that country. It's about whether there is a culture of fraud and fakeness that permeates that country and that scientific community. And there is certainly a culture of fraud and fakeness in China, from tofu dreg buildings, to fake food and gutter oil, to drugged olympic athletes, to fudged economic numbers. Let me give just one example of how prevalent the culture of fakeness has pervaded through China. Nowadays, because the economic decline, people are eating out less, and restaurants are getting less and less traffic. Therefore, they needed to cut costs. So some restaurants started using pre-packaged food, and just heat those up in the microwave and serve them up as cooked dishes. Because other restaurants couldn't survive without doing the same cost-cutting behavior, they've all started doing the same things. Thus, most restaurants in China are now serving pre-packaged food. And there's a backlash from consumers, so now even less people eat out. And then restaurants started using expired pre-packaged food. Oh, and because expired pre-packaged food has a tendency to cause diarrhea, some restaurants in China have started adding Loperamide into the dishes to prevent diarrhea. Fake it until you make it out of China mentality. reply ein0p 18 hours agorootparentSince when is this kind of blatant racism acceptable on this site? “Gutter oil”?

They are mostly terribly wrong or show the exact OPPOSITE as to what they claim in the paper. It's so frustrating. Even occasionally, they offer their code used to write the paper and it is missing entire features they claim are integral for it to function properly; to the point that I wonder how they even came up with the results they came up with. My favorite example was a huge paper that was almost entirely mathematics-based. It wasn't until you implemented everything that you would realize it just didn't even make any sense. Then, when you read between the lines, you even saw their acknowledgement of that fact in the conclusion. Clever dude. Anyway, I have very little faith in academic papers; at least when it comes to computer science. Of all the things out there, it is just code. It isn't hard to write and verify what you purport (usually takes less than a week to write the code), so I have no idea what the peer reviews actually do.

Usually, these are the most complicated parts of the paper. Not always though, sometimes they are just trivial things. reply jltsiren 19 hours agoparentprevThis is a common failure mode when people outside academic CS read CS papers. They take the papers too literally. Computer science studies computation as an abstract concept. The work may be motivated by what happens in the industry, but it's not supposed to produce anything immediately applicable. Papers may include fake justifications and fake applications, because populist politicians decided long ago that all publicly funded research must have practical real-world applications. But you should not take them at face value. Academic CS values abstract results over concrete results, because real-world systems change too rapidly. Real-world results tend to become obsolete too quickly to be relevant in the time scales the academia is supposed to operate. If you are not in academic CS, you should be careful when reading the papers that you understand the context. Most of the time, you are not in the target audience. Even when there is something relevant in the paper, it's probably not the main result, but an idea related to it. And if you start investigating where that idea came from, it probably builds on many earlier results that seemed obscure and practically irrelevant on their own. Peer reviewers usually spend a few hours on a single review (though there is a lot of variation between fields). A week would be so expensive that most established academics would have to stop teaching and doing research and become full-time reviewers. reply withinboredom 10 hours agorootparent> Academic CS values abstract results over concrete results, because real-world systems change too rapidly. Real-world results tend to become obsolete too quickly to be relevant in the time scales the academia is supposed to operate. This isn't true. When I'm implementing a paper, I usually go for JUST implementing what they describe, usually by hand. Like if it is a new SQL syntax, I will write a custom recursive descent parser, and hand-roll the query planner, for just the new stuff and hard code some other parts, just as a demonstration. I'm not interested in the industry application part, I'm interested in replicating their work. Once I can replicate it, assuming it is correct, then I will factor the work into a production system.

The best computer scientists I know, Djikstra, Tony Hoare, Turing, Knuth, and more, all developed practical algorithms and concepts that are still used today! Like the parent commenter said, it’s really not difficult to provide code that works and supports your conclusion. I’ve also read computer science papers that bury the lede. It’s apparent when you try to replicate them that the author was disappointed that the work didn’t support their hypothesis, so they made it look good. It’s sad because a true scientific pursuit finds the knowledge valuable whether it works or not! They just need to state it instead of hide that fact. Your whole comment reads as some sort of weird gate-keeping where people without the “proper” education could never fully understand a “true” paper. We can, and we do. There’s a reason we learn from truly great computer scientists like I listed above in college, and not the people posting unreproducible work. reply jltsiren 26 minutes agorootparentEarly computer scientists discovered many fundamental ideas. Since then, the field has become more specialized and technical. My comment was not gatekeeping and more in line with \"if you are a mechanical engineer, don't expect to get much value from papers in theoretical physics\". \"Proper\" education or otherwise spending a few years focused on the topic may help, but it's far from foolproof. The \"if you start investigating where that idea came from\" part came from my personal experiences. There have been times when I've categorized a paper, on a topic I'm supposed to be an expert, as interesting but practically irrelevant.

I also saw: a head of design school insisting that they and their spouse were credited on all student and staff movies, the same person insisting that massive amounts of school cash be spent promoting their solo exhibition that no one other than students attended, a chair of research who insisted they were given an authorship role on all published output in the school, labs being instituted and teaching hires brought in to support a senior admin's research interested (despite them not having any published output in this area), research ideas stolen from undergrad students and given to PhD students... I could go on all day. If anyone is interested in how things got like this, you might start with Margret Thatcher. It was she who was the first to insist that funding of universities be tied to research. Given the state of British research in those days it was a reasonable decision, but it produced a climate where quantity is valued over quality and true 'impact'. reply mike_hearn 1 hour agoparentAmazing, now I've really seen Thatcher blamed for everything. The problem of false scientific claims is global. The UK is by far not the worst offender (mostly places like Iran, India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, China are worst affected by paper mills to pick one problem...). And university funding has been tied to research everywhere for decades. It's really got nothing to do with Thatcher. Really, under an actually libertarian government university research wouldn't be funded at all. From their perspective companies are more than capable of doing research and the patent system encourages publication. reply blackeyeblitzar 20 hours agoprevIt’s a matter of incentives. Everyone who wants a PhD has to publish and before that they need to produce findings that align with the values of their professors. These bad incentives combined with rampant statistical errors lead to bad findings. We need to stop putting “studies” on a pedestal. reply carabiner 20 hours agoprevThis only applies to life sciences, social sciences right? Or are most papers in computer science or mechanical engineering also false? reply mike_hearn 1 hour agoparentLife sciences, social sciences, eco-sciences, humanities. Engineering is mostly OK or at least not mostly false. When you get into the humanities a lot of papers \"aren't even wrong\", as in, the authors don't hold themselves to any standards of logic or rigor to begin with, or aren't even making any kind of identifiable claim about the world, and don't consider rebuttals based on such criticisms to be valid. A lot of people overlook ecology/climatology because millenarians have made it into such a live wire, but those fields generally have worse problems than medicine. For instance, in medicine going back and retroactively changing patient records for your clinical trial is taboo. It happens remarkably often, but, everyone accepts that it's not supposed to. In climatology they retroactively change climate datasets all the time and if anyone calls them out on it they just attack the critics. They don't even accept the principle that their models should predict data as measured using a constant methodology. It's meaningless in such a field to say \"the hypothesis is consistent with the data\" because the historical data you analyzed might be replaced with a new version that's fundamentally different. reply thatguysaguy 20 hours agoparentprevIt's very bad in CS as well. See e.g.: https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03341 IIRC there was also a paper analyzing how often results in some NLP conference held up when a different random seed or hyperparameters were used. It was quite depressing. reply pcrh 6 hours agoparentprevIt's mostly in medicine and psychology. In topics where there is less reliance on relatively small numbers of cases (as is typical for medicine), there is also less reliance on marginal, but statistically \"significant\", findings. So areas such as biochemistry, chemistry, even some animal studies, are less susceptible to over-interpretation or massaging of data. reply iskander 17 hours agoprevI think unpopular to mention here but John Ioannidis did a really weird turn in his career and published some atrociously non-rigorous Covid research that falls squarely in the cross-hairs of \"why...research findings are false\". reply angry_octet 19 hours agoprev... including the junk pushed by Ioannidis.

It is hard to estimate what effect his misinformation had on COVID control measures, and there was no shortage of attention seeking clowns, but he stepped up to the plate and he can take credit for some of the millions of deaths.

So there doesn’t seem to be a real solution for this kind of thing reply XorNot 20 hours agorootparentprev> Stop hyping single studies. This right here really. The reason people go \"oh well science changes every week\" is because what happens is the media writes this headline: \" shown to doin brand new study!\" and then includes a bunch of text which implies it works great...and one or two sentences, out of context, from the lead research behind it saying \"yes I think this is a very interesting result\". They omit all the actual important details like sample sizes, demographics, history of the field or where the result sits in terms of the field. reply mrguyorama 1 hour agorootparentScientists do not read science journalism, for a very good reason. Gell-Mann amnesia is in full effect. \"Science\" \"Journalists\" are rarely even one of those things. reply adamrezich 19 hours agorootparentprevAfter decades upon decades of teaching Western society to “Trust The Science”—where “Science” means “published academic research papers”—you can't unteach society from thinking this way with a simple four-word appeal to logic. The damage has already long since been done. It's great that people are starting to realize the mistake, but it's going to take a lot more work than just saying “stop hyping single studies” in this comments thread to radically alter the status quo. I once knew a guy who ended his friendship of many years with me over an argument about “safe drug use sites”, or whatever they're called—those places where drug addicts can go to “safely” do drugs with medical staff nearby in case they inadvertently overdose. Dude was of the belief that these initiatives were unequivocally good, and that any common-sense thinking along the lines of, “hey, isn't that only going to encourage further self-destructive behavior in vulnerable members of the populace?” could be countered by pointing to a handful of studies that supposedly showed that these “safe shoot-up sites” had been Proven To Be Unequivocally Good, Actually. I took a look at one of these published academic research “studies”—said research was conducted by finding local drug dealers and asking them, before and after a “safe shoot-up site” was constructed, how their business was doing. The answer they got was, “more or less the same”—so the paper concluded (by means of a rather remarkable extrapolation, if I do say so myself) that these “safe shoot-up sites” were Provably Objectively Good For Society. After pointing this out to my friend of many years, he informed me that I had apparently become some flavor of far-right Nazi or whatever, and blocked me on all social media platforms, never speaking to me again. You're not going to get people like him to see reason by just saying “stop hyping single studies” and calling it a day. Our entire culture revolves around placing a rather unreasonable amount of completely blind faith in the veracity of published academic research findings. reply lemmsjid 17 hours agorootparentI was intrigued and took a Quick Look at the top studies on this subject and the metrics used are things like relative overdose deaths in an area, crime statistics, and usage of treatment programs. They say that by virtue of a number of epidemiological metrics that safe consumption sites appear to be associated with harm reduction in terms of overdoses, while not increasing crime stats. I don’t see outsized claims of objective truth being made, more of the standard, “here’s how we got the numbers, here’s the numbers, they appear to point in this direction.” I’m not doubting your claim but I’m wondering how that very weird paper you’re citing bubbles up to the top, when there’s some very middle of the road meta analyses that don’t make outsized claims like access to objective truth. reply adamrezich 17 hours agorootparentIt's not that the paper itself made the claim of having access to objective Truth, it's that papers like these make conclusions, and these conclusions get taken in aggregate to advance various agendas, and the whole premise is treated (in aggregate) as being functionally identical to building a rocket based on conclusions reached by mathematics and physics research papers—because both situations involve making decisions based upon “scientific research”, so in both situations you can justify your actions by pointing to “Science”. reply Tainnor 7 hours agorootparentprevYour response to \"stop hyping single studies\" is... a single anecdote. reply blackbear_ 19 hours agorootparentprevSo what do you suggest? reply mistermann 18 hours agorootparentPhilosophy has all sorts of different ways to study this complex, multifaceted problem. Too bad it got kicked to the curb by science and is now mostly laughed at. As ye sow, so shall ye reap, IRL maybe. reply adamrezich 18 hours agorootparentprevNo idea—all I know how to do is recognize patterns and program computers. But admitting to the existence of a problem is the first step toward fixing it, and, judging by the downvotes on various comments on this story here, we still have a ways to go before the existence of the problem is commonly-accepted. reply marcosdumay 15 hours agorootparentYou are threading into one of those areas that seem to replicate very well. The difficulty or risk of using drugs does not appear to be a bottleneck on the amount of it people use.

But very few academics have either the notoriety or the funds to self-publish and ensure their work isn't stolen in their highly competitive industry. There is a lot of academic work that is very obscure and only becomes important later, sometimes decades later, maybe even centuries, to someone else doing equally obscure work, but it always goes somewhere, and the goal is not to \"move fast and break things,\" but create bodies of scholarship that last far beyond any specific capitalist industry or company. reply breck 17 hours agorootparent> ensure their work isn't stolen in their highly competitive industry.

There are minority of papers with mathematical errors. What it fails to examine is what is \"false\". Their results may be valid for what they studied. Future studies may have new and different findings. You may have studies that seem to conflict with each other due to differences in definitions (eg what constitutes a \"child\", 12yo or 24yo?) or the nuance in perspective apllied to the policies they are investigating (eg aggregate vs adjusted gender wage gap).

The title and abstract sound highly editorial, especially given that \"false\" is never defined. They talk about pre study odds being an enhancement but I didn't see them include those in their own paper. The fact that a study is small or the impact is minor doesn't make the results false, especially when these limitations are called out and further research is requested. You could even have a case study n=1 be valid if the conclusion is properly defined.

I don't think that's a conspiracy theory, though. Are the scientists who advocated for school closures now \"conspiracy theorists\" too, because they failed to predict the learning loss and social harm we now observe in those children?

GitHub Telegram 🏳🌈 Hack GPON Last Modified Contributor × Contributor to this article Worldwide wiki on how to access, change and edit ONTs Most ONTs run customized firmware which implement vendor and ISP-specific integrations and are locked down in functionality to match service requirements. ONTs often perform differently depending on the OLT and the settings applied by the ISP; for convenience it is often desirable to switch from an external ONT to an SFP or vice-versa, but most OLTs perform so many checks on the ONT that a simple replacement is almost impossible. Warning Playing with ONTs can cause your serial number/PLOAM password to be banned and faults to the optics, ONTs and OLTs.

An ONT is about as dumb as it gets and it's entirely transparent on the stack. The benefit with an ONT (or even DOCSIS dumb modem) managed by the ISP is that they can do fleet upgrades much quicker as they don't have to keep all old protocols running. For instance the GPON -> XGSPON upgrade that some ISPs are running right now (or DOCSIS 3 upgrade) really only works well if you can turn off the old protocol which requires swapping out all ONTs/DOCSIS modems. If customers bring their own stuff then you're stuck with these things for much longer. reply cillian64 11 hours agorootparentIn some places it sounds like the ONT is integrated with the router (like with DOCSIS), and being forced to use the ISP’s router is a problem. But in cases where the ONT just looks like a media converter and you have a separate router I really can’t see any reason for the customer to provide their own ONT. Especially given PON is a shared medium so a misbehaving ONT can affect other customers. reply the_mitsuhiko 11 hours agorootparent> In some places it sounds like the ONT is integrated with the router (like with DOCSIS), and being forced to use the ISP’s router is a problem. I agree, and that is a problem. The rules and regulations are different in different countries. In Austria for instance the ISP can force you to use a specific DOCSIS modem or ONT but they have to provide you with a transparent way to connect to it (bridge mode etc.). Which from where I'm standing is a good tradeoff because it gives the ISP the flexibility to do mass migrations without having to consider very old deployed infrastructure. With PON I think it doesn't matter all _that_ much but for instance people running ancient DOCSIS modems and limited frequency availability has been a massive pain for people stuck with DOCSIS infrastructure that want more upstream and can't. reply kilburn 4 hours agorootparentThis is the same in Spain: ISP-provided ont/router combos are fine but they must have a bridge mode (you may have to call support to enable it). reply Rinzler89 5 hours agorootparentprev>but they have to provide you with a transparent way to connect to it Can you provide the source for that? Because the Wifi 6 enabled Modem from Magenta doesn't support bridge mode. reply the_mitsuhiko 4 hours agorootparent> Can you provide the source for that? There has not been an official ruling, but that was not necessary because there is a soft commitment by ISPs to provide bridge mode which was enough for the RTR: https://www.rtr.at/TKP/was_wir_tun/telekommunikation/konsume... But they are very explicit: > Gleichzeitig gibt es eine gesetzlich garantierte Endgerätefreiheit (Art. 3 Abs. 1 TSM-VO). Auf Grund dieser haben alle Nutzer:innen das Recht, einen Router ihrer Wahl zu verwenden.

It does. Call customer support and they enable it for you. It turns into a dumb modem afterwards behind which you need to put your own infrastructure. It's also mentioned on their FAQ: https://www.magenta.at/faq/entry/~technische-anfrage~kabelin... reply bobmcnamara 4 hours agorootparentprevI replaced my Google fiber ONT by cloning the network parameters into a cheap SFP one because the Google supplied one only supports gigabit Ethernet but uses 2.5/1.25gbit optics. The upgrade reduced latency a small, but measurable amount, and improved my NTP jitter. reply Aaron2222 9 hours agorootparentprev> But in cases where the ONT just looks like a media converter and you have a separate router That's how it works in New Zealand, but we take it a step further. The GPON/XGS-PON fibre network is run by a separate company[0] from the ISPs (and the company running the fibre network is prohibited from providing internet services[1]). So the ONT just functions as a media converter[2], and all our ISPs deliver internet over the same fibre network. This decoupling between the fibre network provider and ISP means you can change ISPs without any swapping of ONTs or repatching of fibre[3][4] (in fact, the process can be entirely automated, switching to some ISPs can take effect within an hour or two of placing the order). That and most ISPs allow bringing your own router (as there's no monopoly in the ISP space). [0]: The NZ Government contracted four companies to build, own, and run fibre networks (three being new companies co-owned by local lines companies and the government to serving their local area, with the rest of the country being served by Chorus, the company that owns the country's copper network). These fibre companies are heavily regulated (including how much they can charge ISPs). [1]: In fact, this requirement resulted in Telecom (the company that owned our copper network and who was one of the companies that provided phone and internet service to consumers) being split up, with Chorus being spun off, owning the copper network and owning the fibre network for the majority of the country. [2]: Chorus did start deploying ONTs with a built-in router/AP a while back. They did offer this to ISPs to use, but uptake was very low, so it's since been discontinued. [3]: I don't know how it works over in European countries where ISPs run their own fibre networks when switching ISPs, I assume they have to either install their own fibre line into the premises or the existing fibre is repatched to their network? [4]: The fibre companies are required to offer use of their fibre network directly to ISPs, with the ISPs PON network running in parallel to the fibre company's, with the ISP providing their own fibre splitters and ONTs (which would be run on a second fibre line that each premises already has) and running their own OLTs. I believe this requirement still exists, but no-one ever took them up on it. reply bauruine 2 hours agorootparentAbout [3]. In Switzerland most of the fiber network is built by Swisscom, a former telecom monopoly and still 51% state owned company that also owns the old copper network. Other ISPs can use the network but everyone has their own router with an integrated ONT. ONTs as a separate device are pretty much unknown. On XGS-PON only certified ONTs are whitelisted [0] The wholesale price list is public [1] For actuall prices see [2] They differentiate mostly through support, price and additional services like TV. Data caps are basically unheard of (I don't call something like the fiber7 FUP of 600TB a data cap) and CGNAT is, while not uncommon, at most a phone call to disable it.

[2] https://en.comparis.ch/telecom/zuhause/angebote/internet-abo reply ensignavenger 5 hours agorootparentprevI am curious about this model. How well is this working in practice? How many ISPs do you have to choose from, and how do they differentiate? How close to wholesale are the retail prices? reply cycomanic 17 minutes agorootparentI believe the number of ISPs differs regionally (I suspect due to where they have network equipment), but I just put in my adress into the main search website (https://www.broadbandcompare.co.nz) and it came back with 13+ ISPs (although some of them might belong to same parent companies). Prices tend to be quite similar (which I suspect indicates that it is operating close to cost) and differentiation happens mainly on bundling with other services (mobile, power, TV, included Netflix...) Keep in mind that I have only lived here for 1.5 years, but from my limited experience it definitely seems like there is a healthy amount of competition. reply jeroenhd 8 hours agorootparentprevIn theory the ONT can act like a listening device. They're also often Linux or BSD devices that can get hacked. If you're paranoid, you may want to run an ONT that you control, just in case. I doubt it's something that matters to a lot of people, but even if it only matters to some, it shouldn't be made impossible for those that want to. RE: misbehaving hardware: the same is very much true for cable internet and there are plenty of countries where people hook up their own modem without any trouble. If someone wanted to mess with the fiber network they could just disconnect the ONT and shine a laser pointer down there. All off-the-shelf devices are built to just work and follow the necessary standards, because there's nothing to be gained by messing with the PON network like that. reply the_mitsuhiko 8 hours agorootparent> In theory the ONT can act like a listening device Sure, but so can the other endpoint. Even many AON installations these days are just hidden XPS-PON and similar, you just never see the ONT. (See a lot of ISPs in Switzerland) reply bobmcnamara 4 hours agorootparentAnd so can all the other endpoints if they're not encrypting downstream traffic reply worewood 2 hours agorootparentprevIn the year 2024 it is prudent to think of everything that leaves the premises as potentially listened upon. That's why we've got HTTPS an DoT/DoH so widespread these days reply cmsj 2 hours agorootparentprevDefinitely agree. The smart place to demarcate the connection is the point at which a device does DHCP/SLAAC to get whatever IPs the ISP assigns the customer. reply woodrowbarlow 5 hours agorootparentprevas long as the ISP isn't charging a rental fee for the ONT. reply pbasista 10 hours agorootparentprev> If customers bring their own stuff then you're stuck Why? There is nothing preventing an ISP from saying that from date X, only protocols A, B and C are supported. If you want to use your own device, make sure it supports these protocols. In other words, the requirement to allow customers to use their own devices does not mean that they can choose all available protocols. The allowed protocols can still be controlled by the ISPs. reply naming_the_user 6 hours agorootparentYou are at the end of the day still running a business. It's like saying that Spotify could suddenly decide to retire support for Android 12 or something. They could, but how many customers are they going to lose and how much support burden is that going to generate? reply thefz 10 hours agorootparentprev> Why? There is nothing preventing an ISP from saying that from date X, only protocols A, B and C are supported. If you want to use your own device, make sure it supports these protocols. A lot of overhead for ISP support in those cases in which a customer knows they can buy any router with any ONT, plugs it and forgets it without zero knowledge of what a protocol even is. reply appendix-rock 9 hours agorootparentprevHahahaha! Have you ever done any customer support!? This is not how it works. reply tuetuopay 8 hours agorootparentWell this is about allowing customer supplied ONT, not supporting them. As in, you have to follow upgrade procedures announced X days in advance, etc. reply the_mitsuhiko 8 hours agorootparentIn theory yes. In practice that might work that way if ~5% of your users are in that situation. If ~50% of your user base is running on a legacy protocol and you're running into Churn risks, the company is going to re-evaluate if they want to retire the old protocol. There _is_ a reason even legacy cable TV and ancient DOCSIS channels are still being available in many countries because actually retiring a lot of old modems has shown to be risky to the business. reply iphoneisbetter 5 hours agorootparentprevLol, that's hilarious. Thanks for the chuckle. Tell me you've never supported (limited knowledge) end-users without saying it out loud. reply beerandt 5 hours agorootparentprevI mean you're right in general- but we're talking about a subset of customers that want to mess with their own fiber connection. That's either a horde that understands the issue, or is an even smaller subset that is going to be a pita anyway. reply neelc 4 hours agorootparentprevWhen I had CenturyLink, I replaced the ONT via a JTAG cable on the new ONT. The stock CL ONT (Calix 716GE-I R2) had a 16384 connection limit, which prevented me from running high-bandwidth Tor relays. The new ONT (Calix 803G) did not. Calix for some reason makes it easy to clone some models. I have a post on this: https://www.neelc.org/posts/clone-calix-ont/ Now I'm in NYC with Verizon Fios where I don't need a cloned ONT. Woo! The Verizon ONT is big and has a huge power brick, presumably because of RFoG alongside GPON. reply ImSorryButWho 3 hours agorootparentThat's very cool, but just to point out: that's not JTAG, it's serial (UART). JTAG is a much lower level protocol, typically used for hardware or low-level software debugging. Serial/UART gives you a command-line interface to the software that's running. Using a JTAG interface is a lot more complicated. If you're interested in playing with it, check out OpenOCD. reply bauruine 2 hours agorootparentprevConsumer routers are all extremely limited when it comes to many connections. Even an Ubiquiti UDM Pro only allows 65536 by default. reply muppetman 2 hours agorootparentprevHow is the ONT, a Layer2/Ethernet device, involved in L3 sessions? Was it also the default gateway/router all rolled up into one? reply neelc 1 hour agorootparentThere is a mis-feature on the ONT called \"Broadcom Packet Flow Cache\". It apparently speeds up TCP sessions but at the expense of allowing a large amount of then. Lumen fortunately moved off these ONTs. However, the new Smart NIDs have their fair share of issues from what I heard. I moved out of Lumen territory so have no experience with them. reply teeray 6 hours agorootparentprevThat’s all great and wonderful, but I shouldn’t have to pay to rent a device that really only benefits the ISP. I would rather have a slick ONU SFP+ module in my router, than yet another plastic block on my telecom panel I need to find space and power for. “This makes our network easier to manage” AND “we make extra money doing this” is double-dipping. reply zokier 7 hours agorootparentprev> I think it's vital that you can run your own modem but I'm not convinced that it's a good idea to force a custom ONT. Did you mean \"router\" instead of \"modem\" here? reply NoMoreNicksLeft 4 hours agorootparentprevIf ISPS weren't cheapskate assholes, then they'd offer the ONT SFP module, so I didn't have some shitty plastic doodad hanging from my router because there's no place to put a mounting bracket for it and get it in the panel. I'm sure you'll tell me why the black bakelight rotary telephones were the only telephones I really needed, and I was just making trouble for little ole AT&T when I wanted something more. reply Kipters 20 minutes agoparentprevThis has been the case in Italy since 2018, but I'm OK with ISP-provided ONTs to be honest, as long as I can use my own router. The problem here is that the ISP will try to avoid giving any kind of support (even when the problem is on _their_ side) if you opt into BYOD. reply xattt 7 hours agoparentprevI’m counting myself lucky dealing with Bell Aliant who issue a router with an SFP stick. I’ve pulled it and stuck it into an Edgerouter X SFP. They do split their IPTV, VoIP and Internet networks onto various VLANs, but that’s about it. No weird authentication hacks like PPPoE either. Just MAC authentication and go.. reply vlabakje90 12 hours agoparentprevMandatory in the Netherlands, since last year. reply t0mas88 11 hours agorootparentAnd as a result for example KPN (one of the largest fiber ISPs) has a document to tell you what to connect and with which specs: https://assets.ctfassets.net/zuadwp3l2xby/2Yp0HtLJPKBUX5mqr3... Some years ago there was only unofficial documentation even on the parts behind the ONT, like which VLAN carries internet and which one is IPTV etc. Now it's all officially documented and you can run your own modem, router and firewall if you want. I've left their ONT in place and plugged it directly into a Linux box that does the rest. Gives me more flexibility on things like IPv6 and easier to host local services without port forwarding through their modem. reply vrytired 1 hour agorootparentGoogle translated to English: https://static.r2kba.net/file/Sharex--Uploads/ShareX/2024/09... reply the_mitsuhiko 11 hours agorootparentprevDo you know how this works contract wise? When you get network are you guaranteed that GPON will work or can they refuse service after a certain point in time and force you to upgrade to XGS-PON (or some other standard)? reply t0mas88 10 hours agorootparentThe contract does not guarantee GPON or XGS-PON. They have a tool to help you figure out what you have, but they can legally change it when they're upgrading their network. The only guarantee is that they'll give you a new provider owned ONT and router during the upgrade. But that's not very useful if you want to keep running your own equipment. reply marceldegraaf 10 hours agorootparentprevThe provider can upgrade their network from GPON to XGS-PON; in fact KPN (a large Dutch provider) does this regularly, especially in areas with new housing developments. reply the_mitsuhiko 10 hours agorootparent> The provider can upgrade their network from GPON to XGS-PON The provider can transparently run GPON and XGS-PON simultaniously because they run on different wavelengths. However unless the provider can tell all existing GPON customers to replace their infrastructure they cannot stop providing GPON. GPON -> XGS-PON is not an upgrade, it's double the infrastructure where the splitter is. So my question is quite specifically if there is a contractual way for KPN to turn off GPON and force customers to migrate, or if they are required to service both until the last GPON customer goes away on a splitter. This has been an issue with DOCSIS for in many places of the world where we are already running out of available frequency spectrum. reply jeroenhd 9 hours agorootparentKPN and other Dutch ISPs don't really care about custom customer hardware, on a practical level and on a contractual level. The Dutch standard is that you use the rented hardware your ISP provides, unless you want something special, then you get specs and settings and you're on your own. Even if you use your own hardware, you often still get a modem delivered to your doorstep. If anything breaks on the network side, the troubleshooting procedure is \"connect the hardware we sent you and see if it works\". If it does, it's up to you to fix your side. If that requires new hardware, you're kind of screwed. KPN has the obligation to permit you to run your own hardware and to provide you with the information necessary, but not to keep any kind of backwards compatibility. (Euro)DOCSIS should be backwards compatible, but things like radio channels and unencrypted video signals have already been replaced by their digital equivalents to add more upstream capacity by Ziggo (the last remaining large Dutch cable company). This broke functionality for a whole bunch of devices, but these changes were announced months in advance so customers had to choose between ending their contract and taking it. The trouble with dealing with KPN is that KPN is also the company operating the POPs in most places, with many other ISPs leasing their lines. So even if you switch to a different ISP in protest of the XGS-PON switch, you're very likely to still end up with a XGS-PON signal from KPN. reply t0mas88 1 hour agorootparentYou're almost certain to end up with the exact same line just a different provider on it. Very few areas have multiple fiber networks, although it's getting more common. I still believe that the original move, forcing KPN and other network owners to allow competitors on their network, was a better option than digging up the streets twice to get two fiber networks in place. reply t0mas88 10 hours agorootparentprevConsumer contracts don't guarantee GPON support in any way. So if KPN wants to upgrade they can just send the customer a letter telling them to get an XGS-PON compatible ONT by some date. They'll probably take a bit more customer friendly approach and at least send you a free provider owned XGS-PON compatible one and a new modem. But for your own equipment you have to manage everything and make sure it complies with their published specifications. reply the_mitsuhiko 10 hours agorootparentThat sounds like a somewhat pragmatic approach. Curious to see how that plays out in practice. I presume the total number of consumers that are interested in running their own ONT is limited. In Germany the situation seems a bit different. There customer owned Fritzbox devices with integrated ONTs are very widespread making the situation for an ISP quite different when it comes to upgrades. reply ThePowerOfFuet 9 hours agorootparentprevNot more infra at the splitter; they are simple optical devices which use no electricity (hence the P in PON).

When it breaks, I don't have to wait for weeks for the cable company to send someone to replace it. I just keep a spare on my shelf and can be back up in minutes. 2. Cost: buying my own pays for itself in 6 months. 3. Disintegration: This is more recent, but I've heard from neighbors that the cable company lately doesn't want to rent a modem, only an integrated WAP/router/modem. reply sschueller 9 hours agoprevI am so glad that here in Switzerland the government went after the large ISP that tried to install only P2MP instead of the decided on standard of P2P for fiber. https://blog.init7.net/en/die-glasfaserstreit-geschichte/ reply misterdata 2 hours agoparentIn my neighborhood (Netherlands) it appears the fiber network is physically point-to-point (subscriber to ODF), but is operated as XGS-GPON (so all subscribers see the same light signal so to say, but each over their own ptp fiber from the ODF). So point-multipoint only at the active layer. I was told that this is because the company who is rolling out the fiber wants to make the network as attractive as possible to ISP’s who want to offer services over it (and wants them to compete) which may be more difficult in an actual physical point-multipoint network (which requires PON). The ISP currently likes PON more than AON (basically Ethernet over fiber to a switch) because the equipment is cheaper. In theory I should be able to switch to an ISP who offers AON or its own PON (they’d only have to physically patch my fiber in a different port at the ODF). reply the_mitsuhiko 1 hour agorootparentEven in Switzerland there were attempts of not building out AON. Swisscom was hoping they can get away with just having XGS-PON all the way to the customer and the other ISPs were also in favor of that (other than init7 which does not actually lay any fiber). The cost of P2P is pretty significant. reply sschueller 30 minutes agorootparent~CHF 65 more per connection is the cost difference that was calculated. For a de-facto future proof connection that should be considered insignificant. Swisscom pissed away millions of tax payer money after the government ordered an injunction to stop building out on the P2MP network. All they did was continue but just not connect those lines hoping they would win the court cause. reply avhception 11 hours agoprevFunny, I just got my own GPON-capable SFP (a Zyxel pmg3000-d20b) last week. Finally got a fiber connection from Deutsche Telekom 2 months ago, after almost 5 years of waiting and a huge amount of fear and loathing. At one point, they threatened to cancel my order, claiming a certain subcontractor was unable to reach me. Of course that subcontractor had already done it's job months ago at that point. And this is just one of the many, many shenanigans that went on during those years. At the moment, I'm using a Fritz!Box 5530 Fiber directly hooked up to the fiber with the AVM-supplied GPON interface. But I'm planning for the Zyxel SFP to go directly into my homelab server and route from there :) reply bayindirh 5 hours agoprevMy ISP called me a while back and told me that they're decommissioning all copper infra, so it'd be better if I switch to fiber. I said OK. They brought in a Nokia GPON ONT, and a new Zyxel router. I protested against the router, and I was ready to bypass it with bridge mode (whiich it allows), but with a reliable, powerful, and flexible WiFi6 router with better coverage than my WiFi5 one won over me, and I left it in service. The thing is a beast with 4 different SSIDs plus a guest network, full gigabit ports and reliable operation. Plus it terminates my POTS line, too.

Exactly. reply jesprenj 7 hours agoprevWhere I live, you can replace an ONT easily. GPON in my small country is only secured with the ONT serial number and a static well known password. From a security perspective, that's perfectly fine. No one is going to hack their own neighbours or dig out fibre cables. From a usability and freedom of hardware choice, that's even better -- SN is written on the ONT and can be easily input into another ONT, unlike passwords and encryption keys that are largely unnecessary and only complicate things, providing little security because no one will hack GPON infrastructure. You run into problems, however, if you are subscribed to telephony. It's possible that the ONT will handle VoIP for you and provide you just with a RJ11 jack. In that case, you can't easily swap your ONT. But for IPTV and Internet, it works out of the box. reply edude03 7 hours agoprevI’m a bell customer in Canada and it used to be the case that the ISP provided modem had a CPU too slow to run PPPoE at a gigabit despite the ISP selling plans up to 1.5gb/s (it could only do 600mb/s or something but don’t quote me). That model has a sfp ont and so you could swap it into something else with no hacking but now you can only get the model with the ont built it. The new model is better hardware wise but just as bad software wise so it feels like a step back in practice.

It's just yet another patch papering over how cheap the ISPs were and how they continue to be. Yes, let's add another layer on top of all of the other layers. Now however many millions of links out to subscribers are hamstrung with that decision to split the physical layer up and throw in nonsensical TDM into the mix as well. Good luck squeezing much out beyond 25g in the future, you're just gonna have to rip all of that fiber up anyway and do home runs. Might as well have done it up front with all of the billions that have been given away to the littly piggy piggy ISPs. I made a comment a few days ago about how I despair when I see anything modern datacenter related. I get the same sort of revulsion when I look at the list of all of the gpon hardware on that page and thing: how much duplicated and wasted effort has gone in to making dozens of different models of the exact same thing. A thing that's not really even needed if a halfway-competent ISP made an investment that's more than the absolute minimum required. Nice directory democratizing some good reverse engineering, though!reply zokier 11 hours agoparentI'm no fan of PONs myself[1], but realistically they do still represent more than order of magnitude improvement over copper (or wireless shudder), while also proven to be very economical to deploy. Lets remember that perfect is the enemy of good, I'd much rather have PON with 90% household coverage than active fiber with 10% coverage. Practically also with 50G PON already being standardized and 200G in the horizon it will take decades before the limitations will be relevant; with typical 1:32 split you get comfortably 1G service to subscribers. I do expect gigabit connectivity to be generously good for 99% of users for long time. It is also noteworthy that while PON was originally standardized as asymmetric, it seems like ISPs have had a change of heart and are widely deploying symmetric PON (i.e. XGS-PON). I don't know what is driving that change (Twitch streamers and Youtubers? :D) but I'm happy about that. You blame ITU for PON, but IEEE has been pushing EPON (ethernet-PON) for almost as long (GPON ratified 2003, EPON in 2004). Ultimately standards organizations are driven by industry, not the other way around. With the industry having some very big players in it, I have no doubt that PONs would have happened regardless of their standardization status. While PON is shared medium which is conceptually yucky, in consumer world its impact is less because lines are massively oversubscribed anyways. It doesn't make much difference if you have PON or active fiber if the bottleneck is the uplink. [1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41634415 reply greyface- 13 hours agoparentprevI don't like PON either, and I applaud your soapboxing about it, but IMO this overstates the extent of the impending 'rip it all out and replace it'. They can keep most if not all of the fiber runs, and just switch the PON muxes out for DWDM muxes when they need a home run link to each customer. reply theideaofcoffee 13 hours agorootparentYep, you could hack in some DWDM and scale with the capabilities of those endpoints, but at the end of the day it's still running over a shared medium. I don't think it's all impending doom and gloom, just a design decision that I think will not age well. It will be done eventually though I think. reply the_mitsuhiko 11 hours agorootparent> but at the end of the day it's still running over a shared medium Everything is eventually a shared medium. You don't have your own fiber all the way to Facebook. So the question is just at which point do you share and that should be a decision made on throughput and cost. reply jandrese 1 hour agorootparentYeah, as long as your ISP link isn't the bottleneck then it doesn't really matter if they are not as fast as they could be. I'm running on the cheapest FIOS plan and I can count on one hand the number of services where it is the bottleneck. In fact I can only thing of one at the moment: Steam, and even then only sometimes. Even then the difference is downloading a game in 12 minutes instead of 10 minutes assuming it isn't release week on a big game and the servers are slow. reply hacst 8 hours agoparentprevSome providers do what imo is a best of both worlds approach here: Every customer has a full fiber run to the PoP, but there they use GPON to save on the active components. The actual fiber is pretty cheap compared to actually bringing it into the ground and that way you retain full flexibility. reply praseodym 12 hours agoparentprevFiber investment in The Netherlands from the big telcos is now fully based on XGS-PON. Many homes that already had fiber installed do have the technically superior AON (a dedicated fiber to the home), but it seems like investment in this infrastructure has stopped. The current situation is one where XGS-PON users can get 5Gbps subscriptions, whereas AON users are stuck at 1Gbps - seemingly because the telcos aren’t upgrading their point-of-presence hardware to support anything beyond 1Gbps. reply martijnvds 11 hours agorootparentThey've also started replacing AON with XGS-PON in some areas, by putting all the fiber combining/muxing devices you need for that inside the AON POP building (and sending out new devices etc.) reply the_mitsuhiko 10 hours agorootparentEven if you have AON you might have XGS-PON behind the scenes. In Switzerland end user fiber is AON more or less by regulation, but they just deploy the XGS-PON splitters in the COs. reply t0mas88 11 hours agorootparentprevFor a while the maximum connection speed I could order was limited to 1 gbps. No XGS-PON here, the fiber rollout was 20 years ago in my neighbourhood so it's still the older standard. But interestingly they're now offering 4 gbps connections on the older standard as well. I'm not sure how many home users order that, given the extra cost of 10g switches, NICs etc and then 90% of usage being via WiFi that only just makes it to 1 gbps. But it makes a lot of sense for businesses with multiple users sharing one connection. reply formerly_proven 10 hours agorootparentprevDo they actually bury PON components? Because around here they don’t. Fiber runs from homes to their concentrators and those house both the PON splitters and the OLTs.

They get DSL or DOCSIS, or if they're unlucky dial-up. And when the poor souls on slow internet do get upgraded, AON vs GPON suddenly decides if they can get upgraded to the new higher speeds in the next ten years or not. 1gbps may be relatively slow in 10 years, but with a widely spread GPON you're not getting much more out of that, while with AON entire neighbourhoods can be upgraded by replacing a single rack in the local POP. reply the_mitsuhiko 8 hours agorootparent> but with a widely spread GPON you're not getting much more out of that, while with AON entire neighbourhoods can be upgraded by replacing a single rack in the local POP Except in a few places it has been exactly the other way round. AON networks in Austria for instance have been built a few years back, some random companies ended up owning that infrastructure and don't upgrade. On the other hand the incumbents have built fiber, have rolled out GPON and have in the meantime upgraded to XGS-PON whereas many on AON got stuck. It's slowly moving but very gradually. reply the_mitsuhiko 11 hours agorootparentprev> poor souls, though can we care about the low-end first? What is the low end? Austria has a similar problem. There are some quite old and unmaintained AON networks where people are stuck with 100MBit whereas even G.Fast copper eclipses that in some cities at this point. reply sulandor 10 hours agorootparent> What is the low end? from my pov:from my pov:It's equivalent to an old POTS party line I strongly disagree. On a party line information flows along the copper cable to every connected endpoint bidirectionally. While it's true that incoming information flows to all subscribers, never does information that flows out and you only get scrambled data even on the incoming stream. So if you're trying to make a security argument: the system is also safe on a physical level. > We can do better! Depends on what \"better\" is. I was quite critical of PON in the past but I have come around. Practically at this point I think PON is a better way to run networks in most places.

    "title": "Beyond the route: Introducing granular MTA bus speed data",
    "originLink": "https://new.mta.info/article/beyond-route-introducing-granular-mta-bus-speed-data",
    "originBody": "How fast are we moving? Every weekday, the MTA runs over 4,900 buses across 327 routes, with around 1.3 million folks swiping or tapping to take a bus across the city. It is a remarkable feat, but even with that many passengers using our bus system, less is often written about our bus network than the subway. Given how vital our bus network is in providing travel to New Yorkers across the city, serving millions of residents, we at the MTA are always paying special attention to how this interconnected network can better serve riders. Our buses, though, have to navigate a more complicated landscape than our trains, facing double-parked cars, road closures, delivery vehicles, traffic, and whatever else they might find on NYC’s frenetic roadways. Amidst this obstacle-laden environment, how fast are our buses actually going? Today, we are making it easier for the public to better understand this question with the new MTA Bus Route Segment Speeds Dataset on Open Data, which provides granular and in-depth bus speeds across our entire network. Bus speeds between timepoints Watch this video The animation above shows this new Open Dataset visualized for an average Wednesday in May 2024, showing how fast buses are traveling between “timepoints” (i.e. the “major stops” on a bus route) for every route in the system. We can see how the general traffic congestion in Manhattan, Downtown Brooklyn, and the South Bronx leads to significant slowdown of bus speeds during the day—especially during morning and evening commutes. We can also see how, comparatively, routes in Eastern Queens and Staten Island travel much faster. What is this data? We utilize the GPS system on our buses to determine when each of our buses is at its major stops along a route. Combining this with the distance between each stop, we can then calculate how fast a bus travels between stops. (For more information about how the MTA uses “Dynamic Time Warping” to match GPS traces to bus routes, check out our previous blog post on “Bus Matching.”) Users of this data should note that these speed calculations include everything that a bus will encounter on its route—time the bus “dwells” to pick up passengers, stoplights, instances where buses change operators mid-route (“reliefs”), road closures, delivery vehicles, and traffic slowdowns—all of which are important for representing the true travel time of our customers. Table 1: Bus speeds dataset Year Month Day of week Route ID Trip type Hour of day Timepoint stop name Next timepoint stop name Bus trips Speed 2024 5 1 B1 Local 8 86 ST/ STILLWELL AV 86 ST/18 AV 24 6.19 2025 5 1 M103 Local 8 3 AV/E 23 ST 3 AV/ E 42 ST 11 6.00 Looking at the data sample in Table 1, users will likely first ask, “What is a ‘timepoint’”? Many of our bus routes can have well over 50 stops, which can make managing and communicating about the route fairly difficult. For this reason, bus routes are divided up into what are known as “timepoints”, which are the major stops along a bus route. If you’ve ever looked at one the MTA’s bus schedules, like the M103 schedule shown in Figure 1, these are the stops that are displayed to the public along with expected arrival times. To keep the data at a workable size, it is these timepoint-to-timepoint bus speeds that are included in this new dataset. Figure 1: M103 bus schedule What can we do with this data? By having this data at such a granular time and spatial level, users can dig much more deeply into how fast our buses are traveling across every pocket of the city. Beginning at a high level, Figure 2 shows how average bus speeds change over the course of a typical Wednesday. We can see that buses move fastest during the overnight hours, before slowing significantly during the peak morning and afternoon hours. Figure 3 shows that, unfortunately, it is during these slow, congested hours that most of the MTA’s customers are riding. Figure 2: City-wide weighted average Wednesday bus speeds between timepoints by hour Figure 3: Average Wednesday paid ridership by hour Digging deeper, though, we can use this dataset to begin investigating speeds along specific corridors of the city. Figure 4 shows a zoomed in view of how fast our buses travel north on 6 Avenue in Manhattan, between the 16 St and 34 St timepoints on the M7 bus route. We can see speeds for this bus reach its nadir around 12 p.m., running three times slower than its overnight speed, as heavy traffic reaches its midday peak. Figure 4: Average weekday bus speed between timepoints by hour This granular view allows transit planners at the MTA, and in the public, to investigate the slowest areas where our buses operate. (Figure 5 shows that during a weekday evening commute, for example, where our slowest road corridors show up througout the city.) We’ve also included in the dataset road distance, average travel time, and number of bus trips for every hour and timepoint pair so that users can calculate weighted averages across multiple routes if they choose. While shifting bus speeds by one or two miles an hour may not sound too significant, over the course of an entire bus route it can represent the difference between a 40-minute and a 60-minute commute for a rider. Given the outsize effect this has on our riders, the MTA is always striving to develop new solutions (adding bus lanes, improving the boarding speeds, working with partners across fellow city and state agencies) to tackle this question of speed. Figure 5: Slowest timepoints during evening commute Go forth and query this data, with speed. We are excited for Open Data users to dig into this dataset, experiment, and find insights from the “speed sample of NYC’s streets” that the MTA’s 4,900 buses collect each day. This data will be uploaded on a monthly basis, and can be found on the NYS Open Data portal. So please explore, ask us questions, and if you build something cool with this data we would love to hear about it! Make your findings public and send us an email at opendata@mtahq.org.

The B46[2], for example, follows the Utica-Reid line as it ran until 1951. They never actually tore up most of these lines; the city just paved over them.

The city has (correctly) reprioritized bus lanes (including lane enforcement for scofflaw drivers) and express services (SBS) in response, but at that point we're essentially back to rights-of-way (i.e. how much of Europe runs timely and efficient streetcar networks). In short: I think streetcars would be less effective if not (partially) separated, but more effective otherwise. Given that the city is moving towards bus lane separation anyways, I personally believe they should revitalize the streetcar network instead. But that's (1) expensive, and (2) involves impressive amounts of local political spaghetti, given that the buses are currently run by state-level MTA while the roads are owned by the city. reply morkalork 1 hour agorootparentEnforcing right of way for street cars could be a lot more efficient now. Stick a licence plate reader on the front of trolley, record any car that blocks them for more than X minutes and mail a ticket. Drivers will learn fast not to screw around. reply freditup 18 hours agorootparentprevWhat's the benefit to streetcars over busses with a dedicated, physically separated right of way? I like the idea of streetcars, but busses seem easier to purchase than streetcars, standard road paving seems easier to maintain than streetcar tracks and power, and likely it's easier to find/train bus operators than streetcar operators (even though I assume streetcars are actually a bit easier to operate). reply bobthepanda 17 hours agorootparentthere are a few * recently a big trend is grass tramways. generally speaking this is more ecologically friendly by reducing impervious surfaces and replacing it with greenery, which generally lowers the urban heat island effect and is better for stormwater absorption. as a nice side effect, it is also generally a more visible differentiator from car lanes that people are less willing to drive over. * trams are generally more capacious than buses because they are laid out better for more standing room. they are also more capacious because it is safer to run very long trams since the tram is fixed to the tracks; there are practical limits to how long a bus can be since a driver needs to be careful when switching lanes and whatnot. The longest single tram unit is 58m, the longest single bus is 32m; and you can couple trams together. * trams don't really move side to side due to being fixed to tracks, so level boarding with little to no gap is much more realistic to achieve than on buses. This is generally much better for accessibility and speeds up boarding time; if you've spent any time riding a city bus, even a low floor bus spends a significant amount of time kneeling to achieve worse results for level boarding. And buses kneel not only for people in wheelchairs, but for people with strollers, with luggage, the elderly, etc. reply weard_beard 4 hours agorootparentWould just like to note one issue i have observed with the MPLS light rail: multi-car transit has less oversight and is more attractive for drug use and shelter for the homeless which lowers use by commuters. Our busses running the same routes are safer and better options. reply i80and 4 hours agorootparentI haven't seen these problems on the Minneapolis Metro even riding at night, but if it is actually a problem, it seems like the solution is build out actual infrastructure to support the homeless community. Which Minneapolis very much does not have right now despite the best efforts of one or two plucky underfunded nonprofits. If your light rail cars are the best option people have, that's not an issue with the transit design, that's an issue with the rest of the infrastructure reply _visgean 18 hours agorootparentprevIn prague there is both extensive bus network and tram network. I almost always go for buses. The capacity is just so much higher and usually the drive is much smoother compared to buses. Also trams are powered by electricity making it more efficient and c02 neutral... > standard road paving seems easier to maintain than streetcar tracks I would think that tracks last way longer. Overall I think the cost is lower in long term for street cars but the initial cost is super high - e.g. edinburgh build one awkward tram line for around 700m. But thats with depots, cars everything. In Prague with all existing infrastructure it cost now about 78m usd to build 2.2km of tram with 6 stops. reply klabb3 15 hours agorootparentFellow European here. My understanding is street cars started out as futuristic marvels of modernity, but unlike their cousins trains & subways, they aged fairly poorly and don't generally do well in mixed city traffic today: First, you can’t go faster than cars or avoid traffic (in practice), so there’s no obvious advantage like with trains. Secondly, buses got a lot cleaner, spacious, comfortable and quieter. The modern buses in European cities are not just on-par, but often more comfortable and allow higher speed on long stretches, because modern suspension beats aging fixed rail (it tends to be shaky, again unlike trains). So then what’s the point? Trams are electric? Given how buses are basically commodity in our oil-centric world, I can only imagine how trams look at the balance sheet in comparison. Now, there are some exceptional cases where I really like trams. When the route has majority separate rail (typically in beautiful stretches of nature) but can switch into streets when needed to reach better. For instance, Tvärbanan in Stockholm is a tram that – while not always perfect – is universally appreciated by most. reply _visgean 8 hours agorootparent> First, you can’t go faster than cars or avoid traffic (in practice), that is not true, in cities the car speed is usually limited to 50, a lot of trams go 70 on certain sections. Also \"or avoid traffic\" a lot of trams go completely separetely from the traffic. > because modern suspension beats aging fixed rail (it tends to be shaky, again unlike trains). Depends on the city, but a lot of cities that I visited have a very modern trams that are not shaky (helsinky, zurich, bratislava, riga, edinburgh, bordeaux...). Also the technology of the rail building has changed and the new lines are meant to be quiter and more stable > Trams are electric? Given how buses are basically commodity in our oil-centric world, I can only imagine how trams look at the balance sheet in comparison No idea what you mean by this but I would assume that the cost of running things is lower, the c02 profile is for sure https://ourworldindata.org/travel-carbon-footprint reply bburnett44 13 hours agorootparentprev> universally appreciated by most 60% of the time, it works every time reply imp0cat 12 hours agorootparentprevI really like the idea that street cars, trains and subways could share a single network (kinda like they do in Tokyo, except Tokyo doesn't really have street cars, mostly trains - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KMYAEIXVzA). It would allow trains to come from one direction, pass through the city undisturbed and emerge on the other side and continue. reply n_plus_1_acc 10 hours agorootparentKnown as tram-trains, and an established model in Karlsruhe and Kassel, Germany. reply rangestransform 4 hours agorootparentprevThe federal rail administration would never let this happen in the US reply woodruffw 18 hours agorootparentprevThe main one, in my mind, is permanency: as I mentioned in the adjacent comment, stable car-independent communities tend to be built around transportation systems that can’t be easily removed. (I think there are other benefits, like being slightly more comfortable. But permanency is by far the most important.) reply bobthepanda 17 hours agorootparentCapacity and level boarding are the two big ones. Trams are more capacious than buses because they don’t have onboard fuel tanks, so more space for passengers; and they’re fixed to tracks so they can be significantly longer without worrying about the back swinging out. Trams are also perfectly level with platforms, so there’s no need to waste time to achieve level boarding for wheelchairs, strollers, luggage and the elderly; buses can spend quite a lot of time kneeling and deploying ramps. reply woodruffw 17 hours agorootparentThese are good points! reply dataflow 4 hours agorootparentprev> the city's buses are notoriously slow Are the buses actually slower than they can be, or do they just have to deal with too many passengers (given the population density) taking a long time to board/unboard? reply andrepd 12 hours agorootparentprevAny public transport that doesn't have its own right of way is immediately and trivially broken, since it will be always strictly worse than an individual car. So more people will take cars, so traffic will be worse, so buses will be worse by the same measure, so will still be worse than cars, so... That's how you get LA levels of gridlock despite every street being a 14 lane freeway. Whereas if buses/trams run in a dedicated lane with the same speed independent of car traffic, there is immediately a natural balancing incentive / restoring force: too much car traffic and the bus will become comparatively more attractive, so less people will take cars, so traffic will be lessened, so reply 7speter 11 hours agorootparentNYC buses have been crowded since before I was born 30+ years ago, even if they are crawling at 4 mph reply thescriptkiddie 21 hours agorootparentprevYa the idea that buses are better than streetcars because they can go around traffic is just completely detached from reality. Maybe a bus can go around one double-parked car but during rush hour that's not happening. It was always just an excuse to avoid taking an inch of space away from cars for dedicated transit right of way. reply kevin_thibedeau 20 hours agorootparentprevLight rail provides mostly equivalent service to streetcars. Brooklyn-Queens is getting the Interborough Express at some point. https://new.mta.info/project/interborough-express reply ochoseis 21 hours agorootparentprevFrom the perspective of \"vehicles on the road\" buses make a lot more sense to me: - They can maneuver around double-parked cars and trucks - They can switch up the route when there's construction - There are no tracks tripping up pedestrians and cyclists - They're [probably] easier to get to a service hub for maintenance - They don't require overhead wires to provide electricity - I would guess they're cheaper to purchase and maintain, but don't have a reference One area where street cars _might_ win is noise. Busses can be loud. reply woodruffw 21 hours agorootparentYour last four points are good, but in practice the first two have not netted significant advantages for NYC's bus operations: many of NYC's buses run on narrow one-lane streets, where any amount of double parking makes the road completely un-navigable. Similarly, it's more common to see a bus route taken out of operation entirely for a week than to have it re-routed on the fly (the latter does happen, but the network also dense enough where most riders can take the next avenue's route). I think a significant understated advantage to streetcars is their effect on local neighborhood development: like a subway line, a streetcar line is a semi-permanent installation that can't be easily taken away by a short-term replanning of the network. Bus lines, even when dense and well-developed (like NYC's are!), simply feel impermanent in a way that rail transport doesn't. (Or as another framing: if you build a rail connection to a neighborhood, there's a good chance there will still be a thriving neighborhood there in a century. It's not as easy to guarantee that with a bus route that can be taken away overnight.) reply AStonesThrow 21 hours agorootparentprevRail-based transit also provides major side-benefits to its routes: development and improvement. The principle is that bus routes can change, bus stops can move. Rail right-of-way and train stations are quite permanent and immobile. Therefore, if a city invests in rail, the developers will follow, and redevelop, revitalize, or gentrify neighborhoods along that route. Conversely, folks in the neighborhood may fight the rail expansion, because \"there goes the neighborhood\" usually in a more upscale fashion. It was smart for cities to build out streetcar lines in their early expansions, enticing developers into areas that promised long-term access. Of course, rail lines don't last forever, but the point is being more permanent and staying put, more reliably, than rubber-tire-based transit. reply elygre 9 hours agorootparentprevFrom discussions in Oslo, Norway: every researcher or institute says that buses are both cheaper and significantly more flexible, and should be used.

What a great dataset and effort to allow for further research into areas of the city that could benefit from anti-congestion measures (cough cough car tax) to improve bus services!

There are many depots around the boroughs and they seem to handle their servicing internally there. There is one not far off of Times Square. reply MarCylinder 22 hours agorootparentExactly this. Lots of bus depots all around NYC. Several across Staten Island alone. My uncle worked at the MTA for his entire career as a bus mechanic. My favorite story was when a rep from a company selling \"green\" buses was visiting. Rep said \"These buses never break! You guys might be out of work.\" and then asked \"So when do the buses stop running for the day?\" He was less confident in the reliability of his product when he learned the buses in NYC don't stop. reply mmmlinux 22 hours agoparentprevSo this is something I had vaguely always wondered about NYC. Is there actually enough space to park all the personal cars, Or is it assumed that some percentage are always on the road. I didn't hear about serious parking congestion during covid so I now assume that yes, there do seem to be enough car spots. reply woodruffw 21 hours agorootparentWhat is \"all\" the cars? Less than half of NYC households own a car[1]; if 100% of households did (or owned more than one, as is common outside of NYC), the city would have nowhere near enough space for them. (The city already has virtually no space for the 2 million cars that are owned by the city's residents, plus the millions that enter the city daily. We have laws on the books that are intended to reduce the number of unnecessary car trips in the city, but our feckless state leadership has decided that it doesn't need to follow already-passed laws.)

Kudos to all the teams and agencies who manage it. reply mastercheif 20 hours agoparentShoutout to Philippe Vibien for creating “NYC Subway Stringlines”, one of my favorite (and certainly most used) data visualizations ever. Made possible by the MTA’s GTFS RT feed. https://pvibien.com/stringline.htm Note: If you’re checking this out around 6 PM EST, look at the E train to get an idea of what a bad night on the subway looks like. Each line on the graph represents a train with the Y axis as stations and the X axis representing time. You can follow the trip of the train and get an idea for how well the line is running based on the straightness of the line. If you see areas where the line is flat in the Y axis, you know that a train is being held at a station. Here’s an example where “stringlines” provide information that a countdown clock couldn’t convey: https://i.imgur.com/u5VGqH4.jpeg Because the “line” is not progressing past 5th Ave/53rd st, we know that that is where the issue is occurring. A countdown timer would simply either say static or start adding time, but you wouldn’t know how far the next train is from you. Here’s another example: https://i.imgur.com/mrvrbUt.jpeg What I can glean from this is that the E train is running with much lower frequency than it was an hour ago, so I should expect longer wait times. It’s truly a marvelous invention. reply trainyperson 4 hours agorootparentI also love this visualization and remember being blown away when I first saw it! Two notes: 1.

Everywhere I go around the world, train is much faster than buses (a general rule is 2x faster but express trains can be even faster). Anytime there are buses replacing train services, the bus is often at least 2x slower than the equivalent train service (and sometimes they even end up skipping certain low-usage stops for the bus to try and achieve a manageable timetable for the buses).

Around here, the operators are cautious, diligent, and the best drivers on the road. reply doctorpangloss 17 hours agorootparent> Never underestimate the bandwidth of a double-articulated bus filled with people going to work/play/shop. Let's imagine a chart, \"Average door to door journey time experienced by a passenger\" and \"Total journey time\" as a function of \"Number of people on the bus.\" Do you think these lines go up and to the right, or down and to the right? If it goes down and to the right, do you think the slope is steep enough so that the total door to door journey time goes down? Who is the marginal bus passenger? Is it people who are in a hurry, or who can take their time to get to a destination? What does that say about average door to door journey time? I don't get it. It seems like common sense to me that busses are slow. As they get used more, they get slower, not faster. There is so much adverse selection for a bus passenger: the very first passenger is for whom it is most convenient, and the very last passenger likely has the worst journeys. In your scenario, you asked to estimate. The expected average passenger and aggregate journey times of a double articulated bus filled with people is much slower than an empty bus. That said, anyone is entitled to strongly held beliefs about anything. The only intervention that lowers average and total door to door journey times makes busses look more like Ubers than trains. reply abecedarius 7 hours agorootparentIt's hard to overlook bandwidth/latency tradeoffs when you are yourself the packet. reply AStonesThrow 3 hours agorootparentEspecially when you're a low-latency packet with minimum payload who benefits from a lack of congestion on the network...

By Jonathan Corbet September 24, 2024 Maintainers Summit The project to enable the writing of kernel code in Rust has been underway for several years, and each kernel release includes more Rust code. Even so, some developers have expressed frustration at the time it takes to get new functionality merged, and an air of uncertainty still hangs over the project. At the 2024 Maintainers Summit, Miguel Ojeda led a discussion on the status of Rust in the kernel and whether the time had come to stop considering it an experimental project. There were not answers to all of the questions, but it seems clear that Rust in the kernel will continue steaming ahead. Ojeda started with the topic of the flexibility needed from the kernel's subsystem maintainers. Two years ago, before the initial Rust support was pulled into the kernel, he had requested that flexibility because there would be the need to change some core APIs at times to fit Rust code in. The need for that flexibility is being felt now, he said. There are some clear differences in the expectations around Rust in the kernel, he continued. He has read through thousands of comments and emails on recent events, and has seen a wide range of opinions on the state of the Rust-for-Linux project and where it is headed. It would be a good thing to converge on a common understanding of what the goals are. People and companies want to invest in Rust for the kernel, but they are unsure about its future. Jason Gunthorpe said that he, like many other kernel developers, has not participated in this work so far. The project was intended to demonstrate that Rust is suitable for kernel usage; he is waiting for the decision on the outcome. Dave Airlie said that the experiment is not complete, but Greg Kroah-Hartman said that it is clear at this point that Rust in the kernel is viable. Part of the reason for the apparent slow pace of the work, he said, is that the Rust developers are concentrating on device drivers; since drivers must interface with many other kernel subsystems, there is a lot of support code that must be merged. That takes time. Gunthorpe said that he would like to see a clear message that Rust is a success before jumping into it; he also is unable to work with Rust until a suitable compiler is available in RHEL. Airlie said that perhaps, for Gunthorpe, the time had not yet come. Tooling and help Arnd Bergmann said that there was no doubt that drivers written in Rust would be better than those in C, but he wondered how long it would take to merge support in all the necessary subsystems, and when the tooling would be widely available. When, he asked, will he be able to build kernel code with a Rust compiler shipped by his distribution? Ojeda answered that multiple compiler versions are now supported by the kernel code, and that suitable compilers are available from many community-oriented distributions. Airlie said that it is too soon to ask the Rust community for a completely stable compiler to build kernel code with; there just is not yet enough Rust code in the kernel to make that happen. Linus Torvalds admonished the group that he did not want to talk about every subsystem supporting Rust at this time; getting support into some of them is sufficient for now. When Airlie asked what would happen when some subsystem blocks progress, Torvalds answered \"that's my job\". Christian Brauner said that the binder driver is motivating much of the subsystem work now, including the somewhat contentious filesystem abstractions. That code is being reviewed now. Airlie added that the first real driver to be merged will be a sort of inflection point, after which the pace will pick up; the next challenge after that will be the creation of Rust infrastructure that is callable from C. Will Deacon asked Ojeda about the support that the Rust community was offering to kernel developers; Ojeda answered that he has been building a team of experts to help where needed. Some of these people are core Rust developers who know the language thoroughly; they can help to review patches even if they lack deep kernel experience. Torvalds pointed out that there are kernel features that are currently incompatible with Rust; that is impeding Rust support overall. He mentioned modversions in particular; that problem is being worked on. The list of blocking features is getting shorter, he said, but it still includes kernel features that people need. Managing expectations Dan Williams pointed out that he once spent two years just getting a new mmap() flag merged. It is necessary to manage expectations on the Rust side, he said; merging all of that code will be a slow process. Ojeda acknowledged this point, but said that the companies funding the Rust work are not seeing it going upstream; that is making them reluctant to continue that funding going forward. Brauner said that nobody has ever declared that the filesystem abstractions would not be merged; the discussion is all about the details of how that will happen. Ted Ts'o said that the Rust developers have been trying to avoid scaring kernel maintainers, and have been saying that \"all you need is to learn a little Rust\". But a little Rust is not enough to understand filesystem abstractions, which have to deal with that subsystem's complex locking rules. There is a need for documentation and tutorials on how to write filesystem code in idiomatic Rust. He said that he has a lot to learn; he is willing to do that, but needs help on what to learn. (See this article for a discussion of how the Rust-for-Linux developers are working to meet this need). Torvalds said that it is not necessary to understand Rust to let it into a subsystem; after all, he said, nobody understands the memory-management subsystem, but everybody is able to work with it. I pointed out that the Rust developers are not just creating subsystem bindings; they are trying to create inherently safe interfaces, and that often requires changes on the C side. That increases the impact on subsystems, but also makes the C code better. Airlie added that the Rust developers have to bring maintainers along with them, or the maintainers will not understand what is happening. Deacon raised the question of refactoring on the C side. Changing C interfaces will often have implications for the Rust code and may break it; somebody will the have to fix the problems. Torvalds said that, for now, breaking the Rust code is permissible, but that will change at some point in the future. Kroah-Hartman said that the Rust developers can take responsibility for the maintenance of the abstractions they add. Steam right ahead Torvalds said that nothing depends on Rust in the kernel now, and nothing will for some time yet. What is important is to make forward progress, so developers should \"steam right ahead\" and not worry about these problems for now. It is enough to get things working, even though the details are not right. Once users are depending on Rust code, it will be necessary to worry more, he said, but kernel developers should not fail by being too careful now. Thomas Gleixner said that the Rust developers are careful about documenting their code, and he is not frightened by the prospect of refactoring it. If he does not understand something, he will simply send an email to the developer, just as he does with C code. Torvalds added that Rust has a lot to offer, and the kernel should try to take advantage of it. Kroah-Hartman said that it could eliminate entire classes of bugs in the kernel. Deacon asked how many developers are working on the Rust side now; Ojeda answered that there are currently six or seven people, most of whom are \"real Rust experts\". The strongest kernel expertise in the group had been Wedson Almeida Filho, who had recently left the project. That was a real loss, but Ojeda is working to recruit others. Gleixner said that, 20 years ago, there had been a lot of fear and concern surrounding the realtime kernel work; he is seeing the same thing now with regard to Rust. We cannot let that fear drive things, he said. Torvalds said that Rust has been partially integrated for two years. That is nothing, he said; the project to build the kernel with Clang took a decade, and that was the same old language. Julia Lawall asked what happens when things change on the C side; how much will leak through into the Rust code? Bergmann said that reviewing Rust abstractions for a C subsystem without knowing Rust is not difficult; he can reach a point where he understands the code, but would not feel able to change it. Torvalds said that the community can play around with Rust for a few years. Gunthorpe, though, said that it would be good to get something into production; that would give the project some needed momentum. The binder driver might be a good choice. Ojeda said that would help to justify more support from companies. As the session closed, though, the primary outcome may well have been expressed by Torvalds, who suggested telling people that getting kernel Rust up to production levels will happen, but it will take years.

Airlie said that perhaps, for Gunthorpe, the time had not yet come. To clarify my remark, I was speaking from the perspective of our community members that are working on server/enterprise/hyperscale projects where deplyoment of the project usually requires running on some older kernel via backports. Using RHEL as some shorthand for this ecosystem. This is a distinctly different set of concerns from Fedora, Android or Embedded communities. The issue here is not that a \"suitable compiler\" exists in RHEL, but that all the distros have enabled Rust in their kernels, that they fully support Rust on their commercially relavent server architectures (S390 and Power! I have users!) and everything is in place to backport and consume an add-on-top \"driver backport package\". There are many technical gaps still to be resolved here. This was, in part, a reaction to Miguel's earlier remark that companies were reluctant to participate. It will be very hard for a company to fund writing new code in Rust if none of their customers can run that code and they have to write a C version anyhow. RHEL Support Posted Sep 25, 2024 4:57 UTC (Wed) by admalledd (subscriber, #95347) [Link] (2 responses) FWIW, in -theory- 360, POWER, Sparc, etc, should work with Rust. Just they aren't \"Tier 1 officially supported\" yet since they lack commercial backing/QA/validation, and getting them into the kernel would be its own minor project. For clarity on ISA/Platform support: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.... Though the above is more about applications, not kernels, you can (mostly) just pay attention to the first bit of a platform-triple there for what ISA is supported. That page also clarifies better than I could what T1/T2/T3/etc all mean on \"officially supported\". That is all for the LLVM backend, and there are of course the two projects (codegen-gccjit and GCC-rs) to use GCC in some flavor instead. So yea, there is concern still on missing platforms vs the Linux Kernel, but the hope is the commercial interests involved with those will either (1) support LLVM to those, or (2) support one or the other GCC project. All that said, still likely years away for any of the missing platforms to need to care about Rust: many of the subsystems and drivers likely to be written won't ever be intended for such legacy platforms anyways. RHEL Support Posted Sep 25, 2024 8:44 UTC (Wed) by farnz (subscriber, #17727) [Link] (1 responses) As a really quick summary, only x86-32, x86-64 and AArch64 are in Tier 1. Tier 2 brings in AArch32, LoongArch, RISC-V, PowerPC, SPARC64 and WASM. Tier 3 then brings in AVR, C-SKY, MIPS, SPARC32, S390x (but not plain S390) and 68k. Very roughly, the tiers are: Tier 1 blocks merging of PRs if any builds or tests fail in CI. Tier 2 blocks merging of PRs if any builds fail in CI; tests are allowed to fail. Tier 3 simply has one or more people promising to work on fixes if it fails to build in CI. RHEL Support Posted Sep 25, 2024 10:28 UTC (Wed) by sam_c (subscriber, #139836) [Link] What ends up being problematic for us is that only certain tiers get \"host tools\" built which means we have to build our own binaries for distributing Rust. sparc64 is an example. Building Rust-for-Linux on stable Rust Posted Sep 24, 2024 16:31 UTC (Tue) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] (17 responses) The effort to get Rust-for-Linux to build using entirely stable Rust features (which involves stabilizing and in some cases designing several Rust features) is also progressing full steam ahead. I expect that that'll make it much easier for Linux distributions to include drivers written in Rust. Building Rust-for-Linux on stable Rust Posted Sep 24, 2024 18:42 UTC (Tue) by sam_c (subscriber, #139836) [Link] (16 responses) Genuinely quite pleased to hear this as it's been causing us a lot of concern. But I do wonder how this also isn't a sign that Rust isn't stable enough for use yet in the kernel? Nobody is adding dependencies on bleeding-edge GCC or Clang for unratified C features which may change at any point (\"unstable\"). Extensions do get used but that is once the compilers agree they're an interface and not subject to change, and the kernel always has fallbacks for older GCC and Clang where they're not available.

That doesn't mean we want to return to that. But the minimum GCC version even now is pretty conservative anyway? Building Rust-for-Linux on stable Rust Posted Sep 24, 2024 23:50 UTC (Tue) by Heretic_Blacksheep (subscriber, #169992) [Link] Kernel docs says minimum version is GCC v. 5.1, but it varies depending on architecture. Obviously recently ported hardware would require a newer GCC so take that with a grain of salt. If a (micro)arch was only integrated into GCC last year, that's your likely minimal version. The rest of the build tools versions vary similarly. Building Rust-for-Linux on stable Rust Posted Sep 24, 2024 20:25 UTC (Tue) by cesarb (subscriber, #6266) [Link] (12 responses) The issue is that Rust developers are very conservative about new language features; unlike GCC (and clang which copied the behavior from GCC) which always allows the use of language extensions, on Rust all these language features (which would be extensions in GCC) are considered experimental, and only enabled when using the pre-release \"nightly\" version of the compiler. This allows them to iterate on the feature's design, without having to worry about projects outside the compiler and its standard library depending on them. > and the kernel always has fallbacks for older GCC and Clang where they're not available. It doesn't; the kernel uses several non-standard GCC extensions with no fallback, and requires a version of GCC or clang which is recent enough to provide all these required extensions.

While what you are saying is _technically_ correct, the details paint a very different story. Linux only requires GCC 5.1, which was released *nine years* ago. Versus rustc 1.78, which only landed *four months* ago.

And how much time did it take (since the inception of $LANGUAGE code in Linux) to arrive at this state of affairs? I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: it is unfair and disingenuous that the “new contender” is immediately required to clear the bar that nothing else was subjected to for a damn long time.

It is unfair to deliberately misstate Linux's C compiler requirements as well. When Linux 5.15 bumped the minimum version to GCC 5.1, the latter had been available for *seven years*.

And he used the most recent version of gcc he could find. Now, that doesn't mean that then need to use bleeding version of Rust would stay with us forever, but I don't see why Rust have to be treated differently from how C was treated in the Linux bringup phase.

Because unlike Linus's original announcement of Linux 30-odd years ago, Linux is no longer a just-for-fun toy. If Rust proponents claim that the quality standards/practices of yesteryear are wholly insufficient today then they can't claim \"waaah we're being held to a higher standard than ysteryear\" when the mirror is turned on them. The response to the \"Rust tooling is still immature and doesn't cover all use cases that some folks need\" *fact* should be (and according to the _actual_ R4L devs, is) \"We're still working on it; we'll get there\", not \"waah different standards, give us special treatment instead\" or \"those use cases don't matter\" of the _very_ annoying fanbois that keep coming out of the woodwork.

Now this is a case of shifting the goalposts. The response is, and always was, \"We're still working on it and we'll get there\". Nobody has ever said \"waah different standards\" while asking for \"special treatment\". The problem with different standards is merely that certain vocal people want \"getting there\" to happen in zero time. C did not get there in zero time, so why does Rust have to?

Versus rustc 1.78, which only landed *four months* ago. istr that for many years Linux had a *maximum* version of gcc, which was positively ancient! If Linux can complain, at different times, that some gccs are too old, while other gccs are too new, then why can't it complain that some rustcs are too old, while others are too new? It is what it is. You just have to use whatever compiler that works. At the end of the day, the version of the compiler is irrelevant. Seeing as most of the Rust code currently appears to be drivers, if the compiler is contemporaneous with the hardware or feature, what's the problem?

This allows them to iterate on the feature's design, without having to worry about projects outside the compiler and its standard library depending on them. So why is Linux going to depend on them? How is that supposed to work? Building Rust-for-Linux on stable Rust Posted Sep 25, 2024 5:11 UTC (Wed) by admalledd (subscriber, #95347) [Link] (2 responses) There are a few approaches to this, but the basic one that R4L is (mostly) taking is thus: 1. Recommend a specific known nightly or beta build. 2. Often, the specific nightly build chosen is *actually* the same as the then-just-released \"stable compiler\", but with the nightly features enabled. Work-in-progress to get to (2), and really I've used a nightly version from over a year ago (mostly) just fine, the stability-or-not of the total compiler is still (nearly) production worthy, it is the specific features themselves that are more a risk. To mitigate that, Rust-For-Linux *explicitly* tracks and lists exactly which ones they use and why: https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/issues/2 and that it is (strongly) recommended to not add to that list without good reason. Further, by linking that github issue as they have, any *changes* in the upstream Rust compiler known to change those unstable features the R4L project depends on gets ping'd to them, which they can then address. Most of the time, the features used by R4L are \"user stable\" in that \"Rust *wants* to enable and let users use it exactly like X, but there are some corner cases that we choose to cause the compiler to error on that should work as well\". IE: The features R4L are (mostly) using aren't expected to change much if at all from the developer's perspective. If they are likely to need to change though, due to github bot-magic, they will have plenty of warning and involvement before it even hits a nightly release. Building Rust-for-Linux on stable Rust Posted Sep 25, 2024 10:03 UTC (Wed) by sam_c (subscriber, #139836) [Link] Replying to both you and asahilina: thanks. I'm pleased to hear that there's a strong presumption against adding more such cases especially. Building Rust-for-Linux on stable Rust Posted Sep 25, 2024 16:56 UTC (Wed) by ojeda (subscriber, #143370) [Link] To clarify: we have never recommended nightly or beta compilers (specific or not). We have always supported stable (released) compilers only, until v6.11. Since v6.11, we support a minimum Rust version, currently 1.78.0. Thus 1.79, 1.80 and 1.81 work too. Beta and nightly compilers should also generally work now. The Rust project and bindgen have now the kernel in their pre-merge CI. This means that unintentional changes to unstable features in Rust that break Linux do not get merged into Rust. The #2 issue (and the sublists) definitely helps as you say (and it is one of the reasons why I started it in GitHub, since it cross-references issues), but having the CI is even better. Upstream Rust also has a tag for us, A-rust-for-linux, that we are starting to use. This has also allowed us to cover the toolchains of a few Linux distributions too. Please see https://rust-for-linux.com/rust-version-policy, as well as the Kernel Summit talk from LPC a few days ago (the stream/video is not available yet, as far as I understand). Building Rust-for-Linux on stable Rust Posted Sep 25, 2024 7:06 UTC (Wed) by asahilina (subscriber, #166071) [Link] There is a backdoor in the stable compiler to enable nightly features. R4L uses this backdoor, and therefore works with stable Rust builds. Since the features are still \"nightly features\" they can and do change, which can break the build with newer compiler versions, but the list keeps getting shorter and we try not to add any new required nightly features unless they are necessary or very important to achieve the R4L goals. At some point all of the features will be promoted to stable, the backdoor will no longer be necessary, and R4L builds will be guaranteed not to break with newer compilers.

Unstable compilers Posted Sep 25, 2024 5:16 UTC (Wed) by admalledd (subscriber, #95347) [Link] (8 responses) TL;DR: Until \"recent history\" of about as recent as ten years ago, compiling the Linux Kernel had a very odd list of \"these are the only compiler versions *known* to work correctly, try any others and they are between you and the mantissa of your FPU doing a DIV 0\". Such as specific patch levels of GCC or CLANG. You could (especially as you approach the modern era) still often *compile* with whatever GCC (and sometimes CLANG) version so long as it was above some horribly old bare minimum, but it was not uncommon to have subtle miscompilations in more esoteric drivers, or flat out some drivers not compiling, etc. Many forget this, because distros would baseline on these known-good compiler versions, so the majority of users would never know, often even kernel developers. Unstable compilers Posted Sep 25, 2024 9:32 UTC (Wed) by sam_c (subscriber, #139836) [Link] (5 responses) Thanks.

Unstable compilers Posted Sep 25, 2024 9:46 UTC (Wed) by Wol (subscriber, #4433) [Link] (3 responses) > I guess I'd make the distinction between new features only available in and bugginess though. You need to add to that list \"new features either enabled by default, or often enabled by force, that break the kernel\". One only has to look at all the complaints about UB, where gcc was optimising code away. Quite often (a) this stuff was NEEDED, and (b) there was no flag to disable the optimisation responsible for removing them. So the compiler wasn't buggy, it was working as designed. And if the die-hards are going to complain and say \"well Rust needs to call C to access the hardware\", it was not at all unusual for C to have to call assembler to access the hardware, because the C compiler was just deleting the code as UB with no way to stop it. Hence my comments in various places about mathematics is not reality. The difference is, it appears the Rust devs seem much more amenable to treating \"you're optimising away necessary code\" as a bug than the C folks were.

The optimization backend in the end is the same, the difference is that the language itself is designed to make it harder to trigger undefined behavior. For example the level of aliasing is declared explicitly by separating shared and exclusive references (& and &mut). Developers can only turn a shared reference into an exclusive one via UnsafeCell (and then the code needs to be explicitly marked as unsafe) or wrappers thereof (which are carefully designed to avoid undefined behavior).

Maybe that's the effect. But even today the C devs seem keen on creating new undefined behaviours. In Rust, undefined behaviour is viewed as a bug in the language (or as \"you can only do that in an unsafe block\") as far as I can tell. Completely diametric views on UB. Cheers, Wol Unstable compilers Posted Sep 25, 2024 18:10 UTC (Wed) by sunshowers (subscriber, #170655) [Link] Yes, that is correct, and Rust is better for it. Under the assumption that unsafe code is correct, safe code doesn't have UB. I would rather optimization 'alpha' be extracted through principled approaches like enabling the use of \"restrict\" on &mut pointers.

Unstable compilers Posted Sep 25, 2024 18:29 UTC (Wed) by admalledd (subscriber, #95347) [Link] Certainly not, but the stability of `rustc` is often much higher than many give it credit for, and that Rust gives much better ABI(*)/linking guarantees. It is often not plausible to use a different GCC version from what compiled the kernel to compile custom modules for example. Rust can provide much stronger guarantees here by default, though as mentioned in the article there is in-kernel work to be done for the module symbol naming/linking. Rust in *most* cases will either halt compilation with an Error, and InternalCompilerError, or result in symbols that will fail at linking time instead of (used to be more) commonly \"compiling\" fine but crashing/failing at runtime or `insmod` time. * Rust technically has no ABI, but you can expose/use one via various exports/macro things, commonly of course a \"c-abi\". This is mostly handled by `rust-bindgen` for automation with a dash of human control when required. Unstable compilers Posted Sep 25, 2024 12:47 UTC (Wed) by tialaramex (subscriber, #21167) [Link] Take for example 128-bit integer support. Rust has 128-bit integers. Code to handle these e.g. formatting them for output as text - exists but in a typical Rust application which doesn't actually have any 128-bit integers the code for them never ends up in the resulting binary. But, Linux currently just says nope, we'll take everything just in case, because a loadable module might use it. A few kilobytes of formatting for types we never use? Give me those too. So for Stable Rust Linux would get a bunch of 128-bit integer formatting code it has no use for, on the off chance that somebody might some day write a loadable module which expects 128-bit integer formatting to work. In Rust for Linux they've instead just made this code conditional and switched off the condition, it won't compile in your loadable module and the kernel avoids a few kilobytes of \"format 128-bit integers\" code. The push back from the Rust community is they're not interested in doing a bunch of extra work to help people who want all the symbols but then wish somebody else would do the work to slim it down for them, pick a lane. So the Rust for Linux change will never land in the stable Rust in this form. Copyright © 2024, Eklektix, Inc. Comments and public postings are copyrighted by their creators.

Torvalds said that, for now, breaking the Rust code is permissible, but that will change at some point in the future. I think this is the main technical change needed from the Linux kernel. It needs a layer of quasi-stable well documented subsystem APIs, which ideally would be \"inherently safe\" or at least have clear safe usage contracts. And it's fine for these interfaces to have relaxed stability guarantees in the early (pre-1.0, if you will) experimental stages. Changing them would involve more work and synchronization (C maintainers would not be able to quickly \"refactor\" these parts), but it's a familiar problem for many large projects. It's the only reasonable point from the infamous tantrum by Ted Ts'o during the Rust for filesystems talk, everything else, to put it mildly, was a really disappointing behavior from a Linux subsystem maintainer. reply w10-1 14 hours agoparent> It needs a layer of quasi-stable well documented subsystem APIs I think the Rust developers weren't even asking for that. They just want the C developers to sign up to some semantics. But the C developers know the function interface has evolved to be merely functional: it works, but with few invariants, riddled with caveats and few cross-function guarantees. It can't be hoisted into meaningful semantics, no less a type system, particularly across 10 filesystem API's. Rust developers should focus on drivers in subsystems with stable API's, instead of trying to stabilize what decades of work has failed to. reply rowanG077 10 hours agorootparentOf course it has semantics. Whether someone knows all of them is a different matter. But whether you use rust or c you have to know the contract to be able to write correct code. The only reason the kernel devs got away with such sloppiness is because c is the ultimate 'I do what you tell me to boss\" language. reply rc00 7 hours agorootparentAnd yet, Rust is the exact opposite. Why try to make the two meet? The argument for Rust in the kernel over memory safety can be remediated by better memory safety tools for C can't it?

Even worse, they even do not want to explain and document semantics of existing APIs (sic)! See the video linked in the sibling comment. Speaking more broadly, freely breaking stuff in large projects is dangerous, since fixing stuff may require a more specialized expertise and knowledge, e.g. being well-versed in Rust safety rules, knowing some obscure information about hardware behavior, or being aware about some tricky invariant which must be preserved by the code.

Max level Rust programmers have complete mastery of types. Rust derives control from types. Seems somewhat philosophically incompatible. reply samsartor 17 hours agoparentIt is a good video, but I'm not at all convinced that a philosophical \"authoritarian\" vs \"anarchy\" difference between Rust and C actually exists. C programmers work through all sorts of constraints and rules on how to correctly use a system, same as anyone else. Heck, there are hundreds of pages of kernel documentation explaining how developers are expected to use the various locking subsystems. Does that make C authoritarian? I don't think so... that's just a fact of programming. The details matter. IMO the only real cultural difference in Rust is that you are expected to explain those constraints through the language of the type system, not just in English. That's a lot of work up front but it also gives you way more automation down the line (eg checking that you used a mutex correctly via rustc rather than through emails to Linus Torvalds). Some people definitely take it too far, and blow up their code with endless incomprehensible traits. But the islands aren't incompatible, it just takes work and skill to bridge them. reply geodel 16 hours agorootparent> Does that make C authoritarian? ...

I'm just disagreeing that \"C is anarchy because anyone at any point can do anything\". You can't do anything, Linus will eventually yell at you in an email. To me, the only philosophical difference is that Rust wants to automate Linus reply bmicraft 14 hours agorootparentThat would also explain why Linus is on board with it, A thousand rust compiler instances is way more efficient than one Linus instance yelling at people, plus eventually he won't be there anymore. reply raggi 16 hours agoparentprevThis is less true in \"how the language works\", and more true in \"code I have read in these languages follow these patterns\". The latter I agree with, the prior less so. Rust is more type heavy sure, but there are plenty of type shenanigans in rich enough C ecosystems, the kernel has plenty of vtable structures which have varying level of richness and type complexity in their own C expression. Ever worked with the addr types in the BSD sockets API - super messy types that can be a real pain for FFI for example, heavier typing exists in C - not \"higher order\" and so on, and yes you _can_ do that in rust, but do you want to debug it in kernel use cases, maybe not. Rust kernel code may look different in the end from a lot of other Rust code in a similar way to some C code in the kernel being quite different from other C code elsewhere. reply asveikau 15 hours agoparentprevGood C code will select a rigid set of patterns, carefully chosen to maximize safety, and stick to them. It makes a lot of the bug prone patterns stand out. This is somewhat like what a higher level compiler can produce, but more manual. It's reliance on code smell instead of a type checker. reply pjmlp 9 hours agoparentprev\"C derives control from absolute control over behavior.\" Many C devs like to think C is like Assembly, then they discover it is an high level systems programming language like every other. reply 01HNNWZ0MV43FF 17 hours agoparentprevIDK, I thought well-written c and c++ had the same notions of ownership and lifetimes, just not enforced by the compiler reply AlotOfReading 17 hours agorootparentNo, C++ and especially C have much looser notions around ownership and lifetimes. They still require the basic idea of temporaral safety at all times, but differ greatly in how that's achieved in practice. For example, you'd typically share an Arc> between threads in rust, even if it doesn't strictly need them for whatever reason. I can't say I've ever seen someone manually implement Arc in C, and RwLock might be ensured half a dozen ways spanning the entire gamut from no protection for things like file handles all the way up to full mutexes. reply saagarjha 15 hours agorootparentThere are dozens of Arc implementations in the kernel. Atomic reference counting is an important way to manage lifetimes and is used extensively in things like making sure that shared resources (files, pages, …) are managed correctly. reply asveikau 15 hours agorootparentprevThe rust notion of lifetimes is one of the most c++ things I've ever seen. I've always assumed it grew out of the same culture that produced c++ smart pointers and RAII. > I can't say I've ever seen someone manually implement Arc in C In C++, shared_ptr in the standard. But this was common even before the c++11 standard introduced that. I've rolled my own before, more than once. Microsoft ATL had CComPtr. It wasn't surprising to me either that rust came from Mozilla, which made heavy use of COM, an object model that is very heavily based on reference counting. reply AlotOfReading 13 hours agorootparentI might not have made it clear enough, but I was speaking specifically about plain ol C rather than dialects like kernel C or other languages like C++. Anyway, what do you prefer to lifetimes? They go back to at least the 60s with lisps and algol and possibly earlier. I wouldn't be surprised to find that idea predates electromechanical computers entirely. reply asveikau 13 hours agorootparentIn plain old C it's very common to roll your own atomic reference counting. I've done it many many times. I'm surprised you haven't seen it done. GCC and MSVC both provide intrinsics to wrap synchronization primitives such as compare and swap (lock cmpxchg instruction on x86). __sync_bool_compare_and_swap and InterlockedCompareExchange respectively. Often you might put the reference counting in a helper function for your specific data structure. To your second question, writing C I like to let the scope dominate the lifetime by doing a free as soon as an object goes out of scope. To make something borrow, you assign it to something with a different scope, then assign your local copy to NULL, exploiting the fact that free(NULL) is a well behaved no-op. In c++ you do the same but you can use destructors to make it more automatic. reply filleduchaos 15 hours agorootparentprevI think that's misunderstanding their point a little bit? I agree with them that in any well-written program (in any language really, not just C and C++) the ownership and lifetime constraints are not necessarily enforced by the compiler - that is, they are not expressed through types or even necessarily through code at all - but they are definitely existent in the design and behaviour of the system. If the programmer cannot explain who holds what and for how long, and therefore when it's safe to read or write particular resources, then that isn't well-written code IMO. > I can't say I've ever seen someone manually implement Arc in C ...an Arc is literally just a shared pointer. It's in the name, Atomically Reference Counted. Reference counted resources that use atomic operations to adjust the count are a dime a dozen in C projects in my experience. Rust did not invent the concept of a multiple-reader/single-writer lock either, e.g. the Linux kernel has the `rw_semaphore` type. I don't understand treating types like this as something arcane simply because they're given an explicit tag in Rust. reply AlotOfReading 14 hours agorootparentI'm not calling arc arcane. Have you genuinely ever come across a \"small\" C project that uses arc? I can't say I have, only large industrial projects like the kernel and gtk. That's my point, it's almost never done by people writing \"plain and simple\" C, it's something that crops up much later when people start building a bunch of infrastructure onto the language to restrict things into safer patterns. reply orf 10 hours agorootparentIs it not because “plain and simple C” often doesn’t often use threads? reply sweeter 14 hours agorootparentprevGolang has also had these types for quite a long time reply bsder 17 hours agorootparentprevC and C++ are very different. I think Casey Muratori hits the nail on the head here: https://youtu.be/xt1KNDmOYqA In short, RAII and smart pointers and borrow checker are all signs of \"individual element thinking\" and that way lies madness. You smear out lifetime and ownership so badly that it practically by definition becomes a problem. Your goal is to think about this stuff in groups to make thinking about allocation way, way easier. Programming is all about abstracting to the next layer. I'm not sure he has quite gotten to the heart of the issue, yet. However, a bunch of smart people (Casey Muratori, Jonathan Blow, Andrew Kelley, etc.) are all dancing around something that Rust and C++ don't seem to fit the bill on. Hopefully they can crystallize it out so that everybody can see it. reply dboreham 16 hours agorootparentOh interesting. I was expecting to see nonsense in that video (probably triggered by the first line -- C and C++ are basically the same thing, in that you can, and folks did forever, implement all the C++ fancy stuff in C -- just because something isn't in the core language, doesn't mean it wasn't done). But actually it's suggesting how I've been wanting memory to be managed for a couple decades (and have achieved long ago in C projects). Basically some sort of \"domain-orientated arena allocator\". A simple example is in a network server -- you receive a request from a client, do a bunch of stuff to service that request, and now you're done. Please blow away the memory used to service the request, thanks, all at once. Of course it's not quite that simple because there will be some \"chaff\" objects thrown off in processing the request that we need to keep around for a while later (e.g. for logging to drain). I suppose the reference to Jonathan Blow should have been a clue that this would be something worthwhile. reply saagarjha 15 hours agorootparentCasey writes games. Of course to him everything ought to be an arena allocator. This is not actually the best way to write all software. reply bsder 15 hours agorootparentThat's a bit glib. Games almost always have significant networking component nowadays. And Andrew Kelley writes compilers. And arenas still appear to be superior. Games and compilers seem to do better with custom allocators. Embedded almost always static allocates. GPU workloads generally don't have \"heap-like\" allocations either. We have an increasing amount of evidence that \"malloc-like\" or \"heap-like\" allocations on an individual level seem to be a net negative. My gut feel, as someone with a grey beard, is that we're looking at a breakpoint like we did with garbage collection. Garbage collection absolutely suuuuucks until you get big enough memory that you can overallocate by about a factor of 2 at which point garbage collection flies. I think we're at a similar point in \"systems programming\". It's now okay to overallocate, overcopy, and especially overcalculate things due to current CPU architectures. Chasing pointers is now mega-bad so vtables and the like are becoming a performance bottleneck. reply kazinator 15 hours agorootparentEmbedded almost always static allocates is outdated, like integer is almost always faster than floating point. Some embedded nowadays has hundreds of megs of RAM, with its application using mmap, out of an overcommitted virtual memory. reply bsder 14 hours agorootparentI would argue that if you have an MMU, you aren't really \"embedded\" anymore. An RPi isn't \"embedded\". However, you may still be doing systems programming. reply kazinator 1 hour agorootparentEmbedded means that something that is not itself computer contains one, running some dedicated control application. If a Raspberry Pi is built into a toaster, where it controls the temperature and toasting duration according to the user-selected selected darkness level, it's embedded. If the toaster has a screen, and you can install and uninstall apps on the Pi, then it doesn't look so embedded any more. reply mustache_kimono 11 hours agorootparentprev> And Andrew Kelley writes compilers.

It is maybe true that culturally many Rust programmers do not. There’s both good and bad reasons for this. reply whiterknight 16 hours agorootparentThe point is that many of the problems rust aims to solve become much less relevant. For example, if your program only does 10 Malloc and frees, you can probably track down the memory bugs. reply steveklabnik 16 hours agorootparentI agree that these techniques help you write better code, but enforcing something is better than not. Obviously it’s a spectrum, so I wouldn’t say doing that is bad, but it does not really mean Rust is irrelevant.

Time will tell. reply noobermin 15 hours agorootparentprevI took my time to watch part of this. I don't entirely agree, however. I'm not really a large systems programmer (I'm a scientist, actually). I really do like the group oriented thinking, but it does seem like there is space for \"individual element thinking\" at times. This sounds a lot like the philosophical notions of reductionist thinking vs. holistic thinking which is something I think about a lot when it comes to science and physics in general. The way of thinking I've come to value most at this point in my life for understanding the world that might sound a bit silly applied to this is a synthesis (so called hegelian dielectic), which is this case for me means that reductionist thinking and holistic thinking are not really opposites but are simply modes of mental modeling, and can be apply in different ways and different times to your code. Sometimes, it is valuable to have simple, self-contained types which is reductionist or individual element thinking. However, nests of pointers are always much more complicated and unnecessary than programming at the system level for a group of related objects. Which you use depends on the context, and I don't really like identifying them as opposing forces more than different modes that can be drawn from at different times. That said, most of the time, I find myself utilizing group oriented thinking in my codes and I avoid atomistic, reductionist thinking whenever analyzing a problem at a first pass, but reductionist reasoning does help at times, it just depends on the problem and the context. It is also true, unfortunately, that in science teaching at least we teach students to be reductionist first, and then that reductionist thinking clouds their understanding and it is something young scientists need to break out of at some point, and some never do break out of it. May be in that way it's similar to what this person refers to here (n vs n+1) I just didn't also get stuck thinking reductionism is always bad and avoided it as a rule but I draw from both sides, so to speak. reply ristos 15 hours agoprevCan anyone explain to me why these two issues aren't considered deal breakers for introducing Rust into the kernel? 1. It doesn't map almost 1:1 to assembly the way C does, so it's not inherently clear if the code will necessarily do what it says it does. That seems questionable for something as important as a kernel and driver. 2.

No major C compiler goes 1:1 to assembly; it all gets flushed into a compiler IR that happily mangles the code in fun and interesting ways before getting compiled into the assembly you get at the end. Rust code does that too, but at least Rust doesn't pull anything silly on you like the automatic type promotion that C does.

The language doesn't have basic concepts needed to map anything 1:1 to assembly and the ones it has usually come with half a dozen standards worth of required error handling, because having single instruction features like sqrt return -1 on error wasn't enough. reply ristos 8 hours agorootparent> What is a variable in C? A register? A memory location? Wouldn't it depend on the type? Something like: int p; p = &x; MOV @R1, R2 ; R1 contains the address of x, move it to pointer p in R2 int p; int value = *p; MOV @R2, R0 ; Dereference pointer p (in R2), load the value into R0 (int value) int x = 5; MOV #5, -(SP) ; Push the value 5 onto the stack (stack-allocated int) int x = 10; int y = x + 5; MOV #10, R0 ; Load the immediate value 10 into register R0 (for x) ADD #5, R0 ; Add 5 to the value in R0 (x + 5), store result in R0 or MOV #10, -(SP) ; Push 10 onto the stack for x MOV (SP), R0 ; Load x from stack into R0 ADD #5, R0 ; Add 5 to x Whether a variable gets stack-allocated or register-allocated, it's still a pretty close mapping afaict. From my understanding the original C mapped closely to PDP-7 and then PDP-11 assembly. The original implementation and how it maps to PDP-11 could be used as a reference implementation. reply steveklabnik 5 hours agorootparentThe C standard does not reference the stack anywhere. Depending on optimization level, things can change. Without any optimizations, variables of “automatic storage duration” such as local variables, may get placed on the stack. But with optimizations turned on, they may end up in a register, or even not be stored anywhere, for example if they’re an integer literal that never gets modified after assignment. reply jcranmer 4 hours agorootparentprev> I get that GCC and Clang does all sorts of optimizations, but doesn't unoptimized C map closely to 1:1? Nope. There's actually a number of \"optimizations\" that get applied to \"unoptimized C\" code. For example, gcc decides to apply even/odd mathematical function laws to the math library functions even with -O0, and both gcc and clang are very happy to throw \"unused\" code at -O0 that prevented me from doing jump table shenanigans. C fundamentally has no idea of the distinction between registers and memory, and this is probably the most important distinction in modern assembly languages. It's especially obvious when you get to exotic architectures that have thousands of registers and a relatively thin memory pipe. Making a C compiler get out the assembler that you expected is a lot trickier than you might expect, and when you need exactly some assembly, you'll find that most compiler engineers will tell you \"the compiler won't guarantee that, please use assembly\" while the people trying to do so often end up spiraling into a rant about how compiler writers are idiots who can't write working compilers because it won't give them the assembly they need. > I thought the thing that was making it not map 1:1 was actually all of the extra features in Rust, like the ADTs and async and all of that. Is that not actually the case? People use a variety of different definitions of \"map 1:1\" that makes it hard to really answer your question for certain. What you seem to be getting at is the notion that C's ABI is predictable. But there are plenty of C features whose mapping to assembly is as unpredictable as Rust's ADT or async features are: C's bitfields are the most notorious example, but I'd throw in variable arguments, atomics, and the new _BitInt into the mix. Which is to say, if you're an engineer for whom this stuff matters, you'll know how the compiler is going to handle these constructions for your targets of interest, but that's not the same as saying that those constructions will always work the same way on all targets. reply rcxdude 7 hours agorootparentprevUnoptimized C is not something anyone actually uses. And it maps less obviously to assembler than C with some optimizations, because C compilers in no-optimization mode generally do brain-dead things like allocating all variables on the stack. ADTs and such don't actually make the mapping less obvious. Async kinda does, but again it's not hard to have at least some mental model of how an async function will turn into a state machine implementation. C, C++, and Rust are all about equal in terms of how well I can predict how a given function maps to assembly, which is that if I care, I need to check, but I'm rarely completely bamboozled by what I see. reply steveklabnik 14 hours agoparentprev1. C doesn’t actually do that. Rust is the same as C in this regard. 2. The Linux kernel doesn’t use standard C, it uses many gcc specific extensions. By this point, clang also supports those extensions and can compile the kernel, but that took work, and upstream has never tried to be only standard C. reply ozgrakkurt 9 hours agoparentprevThis complexity issue is very similar to memory issues of older languages. Most rust people say it is ok or you can avoid it etc. but they don’t understand people just tend to go to the path of least resistance and most times this means a lot of traits and generics.

Dangerous, powerful, indispensable in certain kinds of projects. Up until the advent of Rust, there was no viable alternative for C++ in large, long-running, performance-critical codebases, like browsers or game engines. (I say this as a fan of Haskell and Rust, and a daily user of Python, Typescript, and elisp. Last time I wrote production C++ was in 2021, like 50 lines.) reply deivid 12 hours agoprevNot exactly rust-in-kernel, but I've been using Aya[0] to write ebpf programs in Rust and it is quite nice. The verifier is still a bit trigger-happy with some constructs, but it is manageable. [0]: https://aya-rs.dev/ reply duped 14 hours agoprevTotally unrelated comment to my previous one I think it's folly to encode the semantics of APIs in the Rust type system and memory model and that's the impedance mismatch that has people riled up. unsafe code isn't incorrect code, and trying to add abstraction where there wasn't one before is encoding principles where they didn't previously exist and should be an obvious problem. I've written a lot of systems-type Rust using unsafe and I think the design pattern of -sys bindings and then a higher level safe wrapper is mostly incorrect because callers should always use the -sys bindings directly. It's more workable and doesn't suffer from changes that the detractors complain about. reply ozgrakkurt 9 hours agoparentTotally agree with this. In performance critical code this is a problem always. Even zstd bindings in rust is slow compared to directly using sys version. People don’t want to acknowledge this but it is the truth. Not sure why this comment is flagged. I have been writing performance critical code for production in rust for several years now. And generics/traits usage and needless atomics/copy/abstraction is very much an issue. Biggest concrete one is memory allocation api and work stealing everywhere kind async apis. It is understandable these make sense for general development but they are just a problem when doing performance critical and low level code reply duped 3 hours agorootparentMy point is not about performance at all, you should raise that as an issue in the zstd wrapper crate. reply strken 16 hours agoprevDoes Rust support the same range of architectures as C? Or is there some way to compile Rust to C to support weird obscure systems? Forgive me if this is something commonly known by the people involved. It just strikes me as the most obvious objection to Rust in the kernel and I haven't seen any explanation of what's going to happen. reply steveklabnik 16 hours agoparentCurrently Rust is only acceptable in drivers. These are inherently platform specific, so there’s no issue with platform support. If Rust doesn’t support the platform, the driver won’t be written in it. Rust’s platform support is better than you might assume, but it is missing some platforms the kernel itself supports, so until that’s resolved, it can’t be in the core of things. reply boulos 16 hours agoparentprevRustc lowers to LLVM IR, so it can target anything LLVM can. For a long while, that meant there were obscure architectures that were excluded, but IIRC coverage has improved and the Linux kernel has decided to drop support for them. The main push has actually been from the BSD family pushing clang (and thus LLVM) to support a broader swath of less common architectures. reply BD103 15 hours agoparentprevCheck out the Rust's documentation page on platform support[0].

Why do you need the distro to be the be and end all of package management when it's more concerned with user space and not real development? reply csande17 12 hours agorootparentDistros have historically been very concerned with \"real development\"! Debian, for example, packages all of the tools and libraries needed to build any package in Debian, so users can easily modify and recompile any package. Because there are a lot of packages in Debian, it's become a great, stable, vetted source for general-purpose compilers and libraries. Rust really is an outlier here -- its marketing has managed to walk a delicate tightrope to be considered \"stable\" and \"mature\" enough to use for important projects like Linux, while also still being new and fast-moving enough that it's unreasonable to expect those projects to use anything but the most recent bleeding-edge nightly build. And that will create problems, if only for distros trying to build the kernel binaries that they ship to their users. reply rcxdude 7 hours agorootparentThat's still user-focused. I actively avoid debian as a development distro because things are so out of date and so customised. Arch is a much nicer development experience because they for the most part just take the up-to-date upstream projects and build them without fiddling with a bunch of stuff. (OTOH, if I'm standing up a box to run critical network services, debian is strongly preferable) reply duped 3 hours agorootparentprevIf I'm writing new software I'm necessarily developing something that's not yet a package in any distro, so I don't necessarily want to be using distro tools to build it. I also strongly disagree with the characterization that it's \"easy\" to modify and recompile \"any\" package in a given distro - typically, someone would prefer to modify the upstream and build it (which may not be possible with the distro's supplied tools) and use the modified version. Distributions in my experience are quite bad about shipping software that's \"easy\" to be modified by users. It's a gross mischaracterization of the ecosystem to suggest that many Rust projects require \"bleeding-edge nightly\" to build. Kernel modules have a moderate list of unstable features that are required but many (all?) have already been stabilized or on the path to stabilization so you don't need a \"bleeding edge\" nightly. In my opinion the lagging nature of distros illustrates one of the fundamental problems of relying on them for developing software, but hey, that's an ideological point. reply csande17 16 minutes agorootparent> Kernel modules have a moderate list of unstable features that are required but many (all?) have already been stabilized or on the path to stabilization so you don't need a \"bleeding edge\" nightly. https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/issues/2 lists the \"unstable features\" required by the Rust for Linux codebase. It's a long list! One of the features in the \"Required\" section was \"added as unstable in 1.81\", a version released three weeks ago. Presumably that means you need a nightly build that's newer than (or at least close to the release of) Rust 1.81, which seems pretty bleeding-edge to me. reply johnny22 16 hours agorootparentprevI think the point is that maybe you shouldn't. (i'm not agreeing or disagreeing with that position). If you used a distro that provided multiple versions of something and kept them up to date or used nix or guix you wouldn't have this problem at all. reply MobiusHorizons 4 hours agorootparentYou definitely need to be able to build the kernel that shipped with the distro using tools from the distro. Thats basic table stakes. Needing newer tools for building from the latest upstream repository is fine though reply pjmlp 9 hours agoprevRegardless of what upstream decides, downstream on ChromeOS and Android land, it is already being used. reply cozzyd 17 hours agoprevWhy can't all symbols exported to modules maintain a C ABI, obviating (if I understand correctly) the genksyms problem? reply duped 14 hours agoparent(by my reading) the problem is that determining what the C ABI is relies on a C parser. If a module depends on an API, genksyms checks if the ABI has changed and won't load the module as a result (or more broadly, it could also use content addressing to look at the body of the function). It seems like the solution is to use DWARF info to determine that but it has to be backwards compatible because previous implementations relied on the parsed C code and not the DWARF symbol info. reply kelnos 16 hours agoparentprevBecause then when you want to write a module in Rust, all your interfacing with the rest of the kernel will be done through C function calls, with C semantics, and C expectations of ownership. There's really little point to adding Rust abstractions to the kernel, then, at least when it comes to modules. reply cozzyd 16 hours agorootparentBut without a stable ABI can you expect modules to realistically work across versions? It seems like a similar problem to shared libraries, which rust punts on. reply tasn 15 hours agorootparentThe kernel doesn't offer a stabke ABI for modules regardless of Rust. So what you're describing is already the case. reply cozzyd 15 hours agorootparentSure, it changes when something changes, but with rust it changes (in theory) without any code changes but with a tool chain change. reply steveklabnik 15 hours agorootparentThe point is that there’s no requirement at all, so the rate of change is irrelevant. reply Waterluvian 15 hours agoprevI’ve read many times that a goal is to see if the use of Rust can work out in the kernel. What does this experiment for? What exactly is the evaluation? What are some example findings, both pro and con? reply steveklabnik 5 hours agoparentYou can find the home of the project here: https://rust-for-linux.com/ Linus has been talking publicly over the last few years about how it’s getting harder and harder to find maintainers. There are various reasons for this, but C is part of the problem. If there are newer technologies that would be appropriate for the kernel, they should be investigated. At the same time, more and more downstream users of the kernel have been adopting Rust, and more kernel devs have been checking out Rust and have liked what they’ve seen. Many also don’t, to be clear, but the point is that a group of people were willing to put in the work to give Rust a real shot, and so did some initial work to sketch it out. Linus agreed to give it a try, but there are some caveats: Rust code cannot hold up improvements to the C code. Changes to the C are allowed to break the Rust, in other words. Then, it was discussed that the right first place to try Rust would be in driver code. This has the advantage of being a real project, but also sidesteps another issue: today, Rust doesn’t support every platform Linux does. Drivers are platform specific, so you just simply only write drivers for platforms Rust supports. So far, there have been some successes: some example drivers have been written. There’s also been some struggles: there are some experimental features of Rust and its standard library that the code relies on. But the Rust project has committed to trying to get those finished sometime soon, so that’s not a permanent issue. There have also been some… skepticism of both Rust and the experiment by some members of the kernel development community, and that’s caused some problems. Hopefully those can be worked out too. reply Waterluvian 4 hours agorootparentThanks for the thorough details. That really helped my mental model of the topic. > ...some experimental features of Rust and its standard library that the code relies on. In my work I've experienced this, which can cause a sort of inversion where usage of experimental (or non-documented) features become so relied upon that I lose most control over how the experiment might resolve (ie. sorry, now it must find its way into main). Any concerns of the same kind of thing? reply steveklabnik 3 hours agorootparentYou're welcome. > Any concerns of the same kind of thing? Here's the canonical list: https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/issues/2 There's a lot, and I don't know the status of many of them, personally. But I don't see anything there that I know is not gonna work out, like for example, they aren't using specialization. Most of it feels like very nuts and bolts codegen options and similar things. That said, back in August, the Rust Project announced their goals for the second half of this year: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/08/12/Project-goals.html They say that they're committed to getting this stuff done, and in particular: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2024h2/rfl_st... > Closing these issues gets us within striking distance of being able to build the RFL codebase on stable Rust.

    "originBody": "Home Pricing Guides Blog Docs IP Lookup About Contact Log In Home Blog Rearchitecting: Redis to SQLite Rearchitecting: Redis to SQLite Michael Buckbee 23 Sep 2024 Pssst - want to skip right to the chart? click here Background We're Wafris, an open-source web application firewall company that, among other frameworks, ships a Rails middleware client. At launch, the v1 client required a local Redis datastore to be deployed with your app. We're now releasing v2 of our Rails client which uses SQLite as the backing datastore. This article covers the decision-making that went into our migration from Redis to SQLite, performance considerations, and architectural changes. Continue reading this if you're interested in the decision-making that went into our migration to SQLite from Redis for our clients (the deployed middleware) TL;DR SQLite has things it's good and bad at. Redis has things it's good and bad at. Traditional RDBMS (Postgres/MySQL) have things they're good and bad at. These data stores are not drop-in replacements, and if you try to do that, you'll have a bad time. This article walks through the testing and decision-making that went into rearchitecting our v1 Redis-based client to our v2 SQLite-based client. What forced this change? Since day one of Wafris, our goal has been to make it as easy as possible for developers to protect their sites. But our v1 has had mixed results in delivering on that promise. We made what we thought at the time was a solid choice to back the Wafris client with a user-owned (bring your own) Redis datastore. Partially, this was due to our having come up in the Heroku ecosystem, where Redis is an easy click away to get going and deployed in such a way that it's easy to access remotely. We also looked at successful projects like Sidekiq, which had a similar model. If we're trying to make things easy on you, we shouldn't casually make you a Redis database admin in the process. But the ecosystem is much larger than that, and many of our users encountered Redis deployment issues that were difficult to debug and fix. In other words, if we're trying to make things easy on you, we shouldn't casually make you a Redis database admin in the process. Further, when we exhibited at RailsWorld 2023, there was a definite \"blood in the water\" vibe regarding Redis and the assumption that you'd automatically need a Redis server running alongside your Rails application. What is Speed? While Redis is \"fast\" in comparison to traditional RDBMS, it's still a database that you have to manage connections, memory, processes, etc., which introduces more brittleness into the stack (the opposite of what we're trying to achieve). And more than any of those, if you're in a cloud environment, you're looking at network latency. Network delays are a big deal for us as every inbound HTTP request to your app must be evaluated against the rules stored in Wafris. So while we sweated blood and code to get our v1 client as fast as possible, we'd often wind up in situations where, despite our best efforts, we'd still slow down an application as the network the app was provisioned into was slow. Monolith-ish Assumptions While there certainly exist wholly distributed applications out there, and while most Rails apps are \"majestic monoliths\" (tm? idk, don't sue me), we've found a lot of distributed apps that messed up our assumptions. Apps that deploy to multiple zones, split functionality into servers with overlapping responsibilities, or are only partially Rails and deployed alongside other languages or frameworks. Mostly, things aren't that clean in production, introducing even more friction with using Redis. Forcing a rethink of our architecture Wafris is a web application firewall. In Rails, it's installed as a middleware. It lets you set rules like \"block the IP 1.2.3.4,\" and then when someone requests your site, you evaluate that request against those rules. Imagine it's this simplified two-step process: Compare HTTP request against the rules (if match == 403, else 200) Report treatment (blocked, allowed, passed) Abstractly, this is a paired \"read\" of the rules in the database (step 2) and then a \"write\" of the report detailing what was done with that request along with its data. From a logical standpoint, the first \"read\" half of this process is vastly more important than the latter \"write\" half: Reads, aka \"requests,\" need to be handled sequentially Filtering of requests must work or bad requests could get through Reads, aka \"requests,\" are time-sensitive as they affect user-perceived site performance. Writes, aka \"reporting,\" can be done slower, batched, async, etc. Enter SQLite Others have written far more eloquently about what SQLite is suitable for in general than I could ever hope to do so myself, so on that topic, I'll point you to the following resources: Aaron Francis' \"High Performance SQLite\" course at https://highperformancesqlite.com/ Stephen Margheim's \"SQLite on Rails\" - the how and why of optimal performance Oldmoe - https://oldmoe.blog/ What's good about SQLite for Wafris? As noted above, our major bottleneck is network IO, and Stephen mentioned this line from the SQLite documentation: \"SQLite does not compete with client/server databases. SQLite competes with fopen().\" SQLite does not compete with client/server databases. SQLite competes with fopen(). In theory, this should be much faster than a Redis solution solely based on cutting out the network round trip. So, we decided to benchmark SQLite vs Redis. Benchmarking SQLite and Redis Benchmarking is a dark art of deceiving yourself with highly precise numbers. And benchmarketing datastores is even more fraught. Every single flipping database benchmark I've ever seen has been covered in a layer of asterisks and qualifications, and the comments on HN are full of \"if you'd just set this flag when compiling it, you'd get 3% more speed out of reads, and the fact that the people running this didn't do this is proof that they were paid off and that they actively sell shady NFT scams of deranged yacht rock Harambe memes. However, we have an advantage here. We're not trying to get some absolute number of speed under pristine conditions and carefully tweaked settings. We are creating a wildly specific and biased benchmark against our own data in a use case that lends itself to some extremes that I would neither expect nor hope that anyone else would have to deal with. Studiously ignoring optimization tweaks We're trying to optimize for people throwing Wafris into their app and having it \"Just Work™\" (ok, this one might actually be trademarked). We're also not testing against some theoretical benchmark suite (that can be gamed ala NVIDIA). We're testing the hot path of our own application and our worst query. Our worst query is a somewhat complicated request for a \"lexical decimal\" data structure that maps IP ranges (v4 and v6) against categories. The simplest to consider is IP -> Country mapping, where we return the country if an IP address is within a range of two addresses. It's terrible because these structures are, by necessity, large (millions of rows), and in the case of IPv6, every single entry is huge. To make this happen, we precompute the range lookups and then wrote them to: A table in SQLite A sorted set in Redis For each inbound HTTP request, we, in the pathological case, have to check the requesting IP against: Custom Allow ranges Custom Block ranges GeoIP ranges IP Reputation ranges This is what we mean by \"hot path\"—this singular query type is so important that we can ignore all the rest of the query types and functions. So, for our benchmarking scripts, we tested only this one query type, saving us days of work porting more significant (but irrelevant to the hot path) portions of the app to the benchmark. The Testing Protocol Testing was done on my local Macbook Air M2 with a homebrew installed Redis and local SQLite db. We tested against our existing ranges dataset (1.2 million entries) Multiple sets of IPs were then run in the same order against both SQLite and Redis. At each multiple, we ran the test 5 times and took the average of the runs. Testing Results SQLite beat Redis like an overhyped UFC fighter doing a jump off the fence to land a kick punch (for our particular use case in this niche) SQLite was roughly a 3x speed improvement over a locally deployed Redis instance. YMMV. Note again that this is before any network latency is considered. From our perspective, this was a fantastic result as even if SQLite were only on par with Redis locally, we'd still win by being able to entirely axe network times. I'd like to stress again that this is extremely flawed testing (by design) with really naive settings, but it is done in a way that mirrors the flaws of real-world usage we observed. What's missing from the chart? Benchmarks exist in a vacuum. What the chart fails to capture is that: Even if the SQLite performance was significantly worse (like 2x worse) in the benchmark, it would still probably be faster in the \"real world\" because of network latency, even to a Redis that was in the same data center/region Even if you had a super robust Redis server (cluster, sharded, etc.), there are still a bunch of limits around it for network bandwidth, connections, etc., and again cross-region latency. SQLite gets us near-infinite horizontal scaling for \"free\"; more on this below. The onboarding is so much better with SQLite - I imagine most users won't even know that it's being used; they'll just add the gem to their web app and be up and running. There are a lot of potential improvements that could be done to get more juice out of Redis. However, we've been unable to consistently persuade users to make even basic configuration changes (like cache eviction policy) to their Redis setups as it's such a pain and they don't want to be Redis admins. We're focused on: Making Wafris easy to deploy Making rule evaluation as fast as possible Everything else flows from that, so that's what we're rearchitecting towards. NOT \"the best database setup,\" not \"the easiest infrastructure for us (Wafris) to manage,\" etc. Results are just the start Great, so now that we've established that SQLite is faster than Redis (caveats, caveats, caveats), everything still isn't great because there are real-world tradeoffs. One huge tradeoff in the testing above is that we didn't even consider doing any writes. While it's never really stated, the whole reason for a \"proper\" database to have connections, connection pools, transactions, and whatever proprietary magic allows Oracle to charge a billion dollars for a database is to manage writes contending with reads for data in your database. Consider an electric Chinese supercar driven by a charming British man - it's fast, it's fantastic, and it is absolute bollocks at hauling a load of concrete blocks across town. SQLite is like that NIO EP9 supercar. We need to use it for what it's good at and not force it into a role it's not suited for. Building a sync architecture On v1 (Redis), the update loop looked like this: User updates a rule (\"block the IP 1.2.3.4\") in Wafris Hub Wafris Hub updates the rules in your Redis datastore This obviously won't work with SQLite because we can't \"push\" a SQLite database to a web server. There are some newer SQLite as a service providers that let you do a version of this, but for a variety of cost, performance, and security considerations, it won't work for us as we'd still need individual users to deploy them, open ports, allow inbound connections, etc. On v2 (SQLite), the update loop looks like this: User updates a rule (\"block the IP 1.2.3.4\") in Wafris Hub At some interval (time or number of requests), the client checks for updated rules If rules are updated, the client downloads an entirely new SQLite database This works well as it removes much of the user's installation and configuration responsibility. We're seeing a ~3x increase in successful installs of the v2 client. SQLite Distributed Architecture Consider a Rails app deployed to a cloud provider (AWS, Heroku, Fly, etc). with autoscaling enabled. Your requests go from 100 req/s to 10,000 req/s. and your compute (dynos, machines, ec2 instances) start spinning up to handle the load, but does your database? The answer is almost certainly no because a bottleneck is a bottleneck without the database, and while you could overprovision it by 100x \"just in case,\" realistically, nobody wants to do that. In practice, this is the number one thing that we see kill Rails apps under heavy load. Rarely is it an actual DDOS attack; more often, it's a credential stuffing attack or a bad bot that is hammering a site, pushing up autoscaling that's then exhausting database connections, which causes the app to fall over. Flipping this to a system where an SQLite DB is synced down to each compute instance solves this problem excellently by keeping all the calls local to the new compute instance. But what about writes? We started this article by discussing splitting the app into a read (rule evaluation) and write (reporting) path and then studiously ignored the write path. We did rearchitect the write path to do the following: Async connects to Wafris Hub for reporting Batch sending of the reports Completely removing database writes from the clients Which will work for approximately 0% of everybody else, but we don't care about them. We care about the 100% of our users who want the Wafris client to be easy to deploy and stupid fast. It's hard to know if there's a lesson you can learn from reading all of this, but we sincerely appreciate you taking the time. Conclusion First: thanks to Aaron Francis, Travis Northcutt, Brian Hogg, Dave Ceddia, Peter Bhat Harkins and Nate Bosscher for their feedback and suggestions on this post. Second: we're exceedingly happy with our v2 architecture, which uses SQLite. It's already helped many sites weather attacks and stay online. It's much easier to get going, with less support work for us and less hassle for users, which we think is a win for a safer, more secure internet. If you'd like to get started, sign up on Wafris Hub.

So you can find the key fast, and then you have the value. Databases including SQLite usually use b+tree for tables (a variant where only the leaves have data, the interior nodes only have keys) and regular btrees for indexes. reply lucianbr 1 hour agorootparentprevA hash table makes sense in memory. If it's loaded just right for fast access, it has holes - empty entries. That makes little sense if you are building a file that will be transferred to many places over the internet. Bandwith waste would be significant. So it might seem that simply enumerating the data (sorted or not) would be a better option for a file. (After all, the receiver will read everything anyway.)

One example is a multistep transaction processing request. The feature flag could gate several branch points.

FWIW - this is at least partially inspired by your datasette project which we may still try and do something with later on the reporting and data exploration side of things. reply nnf 3 hours agoparentprevI've wanted to implement this on a distributed web server environment I manage. Right now there's a centralized MySQL database that the web servers read from when rendering a web page, but there can be lots of queries for a single render (page, sections, snippets, attributes, assets, etc.), and sending that all over the wire, while fast, is slower than reading from a database running on the same host. It'd be great to be able to copy the \"master\" database onto each web server instance, maybe once per minute, or just on-demand when a change to the data is made. I imagine this would make reads much faster. reply pkhuong 56 minutes agorootparentThat's how https://github.com/backtrace-labs/verneuil 's read replication is meant to be used. There's a command-line tool to recreate a sqlite DB file from a snapshot's manifest, with an optional local cache to avoid fetching unchanged pages, or you can directly use a replica in memory, with pragmas for (async) refreshes.

This doesn't sound right. A feature flag only requires checking if a request comes from a user that is in a specific feature group. This is a single key:value check. The business logic lies in assigning a user to a specific feature group, which the simplest way means pre assigning the user and in the most complex cases takes place at app start/first request to dynamically control dialups. Either way, it's a single key: value check where the key is user ID+feature ID, or session ID + feature ID. I mean, I guess you can send a boat load of data to perform the same complex query over and over again. I suppose. But you need to not have invested any thought onto the issue and insisted in making things very hard for you, QAs, and users too. I mean, read your own description: why are you making the exact same complex query over and over and over again, multiple times in the same request? At most, do it once, cache the result, and from therein just do a key:value check. You can use sqlite for that if you'd like. reply simonw 54 minutes agorootparentI've worked at places where the feature flag system was much more dynamic than that, considering way more than just membership in a group. This meant you could roll features out to: - Specific user IDs - Every user ID in a specific group - Every object owned by a specific user ID (feature flags might apply to nested objects in the system) - Requests from IP addresses in certain countries - Requests served by specific website TLDs - Users who are paid members of a specific plan - etc etc etc It was an enormously complicated system, that had evolved over 5-10 years. Not saying that level of complexity is recommended, but that's what we had. Looks like I gave a talk about this back in 20144: https://speakerdeck.com/simon/feature-flags reply nnf 3 hours agorootparentprevGP's comment is talking about checking multiple feature flags, not checking a single feature flag multiple times. reply chipdart 3 hours agorootparentGP referred specifically to queries checking if \"user is a member of group A and has an IP located in country B\".

Every time I read the docs about when to run a vacuum, I end up confused. The last time I shipped an application on SQLite, I ended up just using a counter and vacuuming after a large number of write operations. reply prirun 3 hours agorootparentHashBackup author here, been using SQLite for about 15 years. Doing a vacuum after a large number of deletes might make sense. The only real purpose of vacuum IMO is to recover free space from a database. Vacuum may also optimize certain access patterns for a short while, though I have never tested this, and it would be highly dependent on the queries used. If fragmentation is a bigger concern for you than recovering free space, you can also compute the fragmentation to decide whether to vacuum by using the dbstat table: https://www.sqlite.org/dbstat.html Then again, computing this will require accessing most of the database pages I'm guessing, so might take nearly as long as a vacuum. The other gotcha here is that just because db pages appear to be sequential in a file doesn't mean they are sequential on a physical drive, though filesystems do strive for that. SQLite has pragma commands to tell you the number of total and free db pages. When the percentage of free pages is greater than x% and it's a convenient time, do a vacuum. For a highly volatile db, you can add a table containing this percentage, update it every day, and make your decision based on an average, but IMO it's easier just to check for more than 50% free (or whatever) and do the vacuum. Vacuums used to be (circa 2019) pretty slow operations, but the SQLite team has sped them up greatly since then. Vacuuming a 3GB SQLite db on a SSD takes less than a minute these days. That's with the db 100% full; with only 50% used pages, it would be considerably faster. Vacuums are done in a statement transaction, so you don't have to worry about a \"half vacuum that runs out of disk space\" screwing up your database. reply codingbot3000 4 hours agoprevIt's posts like this explaining architecture decisions in detail I am reading HN for.

Conceptually \"rate limiting to prevent abuse\" (what we're doing here) and \"rate limiting for API throttling\" have different levels for tolerance. With that in mind, it's setting higher levels of limiting and doing the math to push that out over many machines/instances/dynos.

The SQLite dbs are several hundred megabytes in size (millions of IP ranges) so while it would be technically doable to send around rules files as JSON or something more specifically suited there's still a number of wins that SQLite gives us: - Really strong support across multiple platforms (we have clients for most of the major web frameworks) - Efficiency, sure we have lots of RAM on servers nowdays but on some platforms it's constrained and if you don't have to burn it, we'd just rather not. - When we started mapping this out, we ended up with something that looked like a JSON format that we were adding indexes to....and then we were re-inventing SQLite. reply wormlord 3 hours agoparentprevI don't know how it works exactly, but I believe you can have a fully in-memory SQLite database.

    "originBody": "SQL tips and tricks A (somewhat opinionated) list of SQL tips and tricks that I've picked up over the years in my job as a data analyst. Please note that some of these tips might not be relevant for all RDBMs. For example, the :: syntax (tip 5) does not work in SQLite. Table of contents Formatting/readability Use a leading comma to separate fields Use a dummy value in the WHERE clause Indent your code where appropriate Consider CTEs when writing complex queries Useful features You can use the :: operator to cast the data type of a value Anti-joins are your friend Use QUALIFY to filter window functions You can (but shouldn't always) GROUP BY column position Avoid pitfalls Be aware of how NOT IN behaves with NULL values Rename calculated fields to avoid ambiguity Always specify which column belongs to which table Understand the order of execution Comment your code! Read the documentation (in full) Formatting/readability Use a leading comma to separate fields Use a leading comma to seperate fields in the SELECT clause rather than a trailing comma. Clearly defines that this is a new column vs code that's wrapped to multiple lines. Visual cue to easily identify if the comma is missing or not. Varying line lengths makes it harder to determine. SELECT employee_id , employee_name , job , salary FROM employees ; Also use a leading AND in the WHERE clause, for the same reasons (following tip demonstrates this). Use a dummy value in the WHERE clause Use a dummy value in the WHERE clause so you can dynamically add and remove conditions with ease: SELECT * FROM employees WHERE 1=1 -- Dummy value. AND job IN ('Clerk', 'Manager') AND dept_no != 5 ; Indent your code where appropriate Indent your code to make it more readable to colleagues and your future self: -- Bad: SELECT timeslot_date , timeslot_channel , overnight_fta_share , IFF(DATEDIFF(DAY, timeslot_date, CURRENT_DATE()) > 7, LAG(overnight_fta_share, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY timeslot_date, timeslot_channel ORDER BY timeslot_activity), NULL) AS C7_fta_share , IFF(DATEDIFF(DAY, timeslot_date, CURRENT_DATE()) >= 29, LAG(overnight_fta_share, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY timeslot_date, timeslot_channel ORDER BY timeslot_activity), NULL) AS C28_fta_share FROM timeslot_data ; -- Good: SELECT timeslot_date , timeslot_channel , overnight_fta_share , IFF(DATEDIFF(DAY, timeslot_date, CURRENT_DATE()) > 7, -- First argument of IFF.LAG(overnight_fta_share, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY timeslot_date, timeslot_channel ORDER BY timeslot_activity), -- Second argument of IFF. NULL) AS C7_fta_share -- Third argument of IFF. , IFF(DATEDIFF(DAY, timeslot_date, CURRENT_DATE()) >= 29, LAG(overnight_fta_share, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY timeslot_date, timeslot_channel ORDER BY timeslot_activity),NULL) AS C28_fta_share FROM timeslot_data ; Consider CTEs when writing complex queries For longer than I'd care to admit I would nest inline views, which would lead to queries that were hard to understand, particularly if revisted after a few weeks. If you find yourself nesting inline views more than 2 or 3 levels deep, consider using common table expressions, which can help you keep your code more organised and readable. /* The following query doesn't actually need to use an inline view or CTE but I'm just demonstrating the difference between the two. */ -- Using nested inline views. SELECT vhs.movie , vhs.vhs_revenue , cs.cinema_revenue FROM ( SELECT movie_id , SUM(ticket_sales) AS cinema_revenue FROM tickets GROUP BY movie_id ) AS cs INNER JOIN ( SELECT movie , movie_id , SUM(revenue) AS vhs_revenue FROM blockbuster GROUP BY movie, movie_id ) AS vhs ON cs.movie_id = vhs.movie_id ; -- Using CTEs. WITH cinema_sales AS ( SELECT movie_id , SUM(ticket_sales) AS cinema_revenue FROM tickets GROUP BY movie_id ), vhs_sales AS ( SELECT movie , movie_id , SUM(revenue) as vhs_revenue FROM blockbuster GROUP BY movie, movie_id ) SELECT vhs.movie , vhs.vhs_revenue , cs.cinema_revenue FROM cinema_sales AS cs INNER JOIN vhs_sales AS vhs ON cs.movie_id = vhs.movie_id ; Useful features You can use the :: operator to cast the data type of a value In some RDBMs you can use the :: operator to cast a value from one data type to another: SELECT CAST('5' AS INTEGER); -- Using the CAST function. SELECT '5'::INTEGER; -- Using :: syntax. Anti-joins are your friend Anti-joins are incredible useful, mostly (in my experience) for when you only want to return rows/values from one table that aren't present in another table. You could instead use a subquery although conventional wisdom dictates that anti-joins are faster. EXCEPT is an interesting operator for removing rows from one table which appear in another query table but I suggest you read up on it further before using it. -- Anti-join. SELECT video_content.* FROM video_content LEFT JOIN archive on video_content.series_id = archive.series_id WHERE 1=1 AND archive.series_id IS NULL -- Any rows with no match will have a NULL value. -- Subquery. SELECT * FROM video_content WHERE 1=1 AND series_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT SERIES_ID FROM archive) -- Be mindful of NULL values (see tip 9). -- Correlated subquery. SELECT * FROM video_content WHERE 1=1 AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM archive a WHERE a.series_id = vc.series_id ) -- EXCEPT. SELECT series_id FROM video_content EXCEPT SELECT series_id FROM archive Use QUALIFY to filter window functions QUALIFY lets you filter the results of a query based on a window function. This is useful for a variety of reasons, including to reduce the number of lines of code needed. For example, if I want to return the top 10 markets per product I can use QUALIFY rather than an inline view: -- Using QUALIFY: SELECT product , market , SUM(revenue) as market_revenue FROM sales GROUP BY product, market QUALIFY DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY SUM(revenue) DESC) <= 10 ORDER BY product, market_revenue ; -- Without QUALIFY: SELECT product , market , market_revenue FROM ( SELECT product , market , SUM(revenue) as market_revenue , DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY SUM(revenue) DESC) AS market_rank FROM sales GROUP BY product, market ) WHERE market_rank <= 10 ORDER BY product, market_revenue ; You can (but shouldn't always) GROUP BY column position Instead of using the column name, you can GROUP BY or ORDER BY using the column position. This can be useful for ad-hoc/one-off queries, but for production code you should always refer to a column by its name. SELECT dept_no , SUM(salary) as dept_salary FROM employees GROUP BY 1 -- dept_no is the first column in the SELECT clause. ORDER BY 2 DESC ; Common pitfalls Be aware of how NOT IN behaves with NULL values NOT IN doesn't work if NULL is present in the values being checked against. As NULL represents Unknown the SQL engine can't verify that the value being checked is not present in the list. Instead use NOT EXISTS. INSERT INTO departments (id) VALUES (1), (2), (NULL); -- Doesn't work due to NULL being present. SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT id from departments) -- Solution. SELECT * FROM employees e WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM departments d WHERE d.id = e.department_id ) ; Rename calculated fields to avoiding ambiguity When creating a calculated field, you might be tempted to rename it to an existing column, but this can lead to unexpected behaviour, such as a window function operating on the wrong field: INSERT INTO products (product, revenue) VALUES ('Shark', 100), ('Robot', 150), ('Alien', 90); -- The window function will rank the 'Robot' product as 1 when it should be 3. SELECT product , CASE product WHEN 'Robot' THEN 0 ELSE revenue END AS revenue , RANK() OVER (ORDER BY revenue DESC) FROM products Always specify which column belongs to which table When you have complex queries with multiple joins, it pays to be able to trace back an issue with a value to its source. Additionally, your RDBMS might raise an error if two tables share the same column name and you don't specify which column you are using. SELECT vc.video_id , vc.series_name , metadata.season , metadata.episode_number FROM video_content as vc INNER JOIN video_metadata as metadata ON vc.video_id = metadata.video_id Understand the order of execution If I had to give one piece of advice to someone learning SQL, it'd be to understand the order of execution (of clauses). It will completely change how you write queries. This blog post is a fantastic resource for learning. Comment your code! While in the moment you know why you did something, if you revisit the code weeks, months or years later you might not remember. In general you should strive to write comments that explain why you did something, not how. Your colleagues and future self will thank you! SELECT video_content.* FROM video_content LEFT JOIN archive -- New CMS cannot process archive video formats. on video_content.series_id = archive.series_id WHERE 1=1 AND archive.series_id IS NULL Read the documentation (in full) Using Snowflake I once needed to return the latest date from a list of columns and so I decided to use GREATEST(). What I didn't realise was that if one of the arguments is NULL then the function returns NULL. If I'd read the documentation in full I'd have known! In many cases it can take just a minute or less to scan the documentation and it will save you the headache of having to work out why something isn't working the way you expected: -- If I'd read the documentation further I'd also have realised that my solution --to the NULL problem with GREATEST()... SELECT COALESCE(GREATEST(signup_date, consumption_date), signup_date, consumption_date) -- ... could have been solved with the following function: SELECT GREATEST_IGNORE_NULLS(signup_date, consumption_date)",

    "commentBody": "SQL Tips and Tricks (github.com/ben-n93)184 points by regexman1 14 hours agohidepastfavorite105 comments magicalhippo 13 hours agoI'll add some of mine: Learn your DB server. Check the query plans often. You might get surprised. Tweak and recheck. Usually EXISTS is faster than IN. Beware that NOT EXISTS behaves differently than EXCEPT in regards to NULL values. Instead of joining tables and using distinct or similar to filter rows, consiser using subquery \"columns\", ie in SELECT list. This can be much faster even if you're pulling 10+ values from the same table, even if your database server supports lateral joins. Just make sure the subqueries return at most one row. Any query that's not a one-off should not perform any table scans. A table scan today can mean an outage tomorrow. Add indexes. Keep in mind GROUP BY clause usually dictates index use. If you need to filter on expressions, say where a substring is equal something, you can add a computed column and index on that. Alternatively some db's support indexing expressions directly. Often using UNION ALL can be much faster than using OR, even for non-trivial queries and/or multiple OR clauses. edit: You can JOIN subqueries. This can be useful to force the filtering order if the DB isn't being clever about the order. reply hot_gril 12 hours agoparentThe most useful thing is learning your DBMS. There's no escaping the performance and isolation quirks of each one, and there are different bonus features in each. One interesting thing I found about Postgres that's probably true of others too, often you can manually shard INSERT (SELECT ...) operations to speed them up linearly with the number of CPU cores, even when you have like 10 joins. EXPLAIN first, find the innermost or outermost join, and kick off a separate parallel query operating on each range of rows (id >= start AND idLearn your DB server. Check the query plans often. You might get surprised. Tweak and recheck. Oftentimes the well-designed queries behave unexpectedly, because the column statistics are not updated or when the data is fragmented for big tables (e.g. random PK insertion). reply paperplatter 2 hours agorootparentSounds like that DBMS would work better with serial int PKs reply code_biologist 11 hours agoparentprevInstead of joining tables and using distinct or similar to filter rows, consiser using subquery \"columns\", ie in SELECT list. What does this mean? Running SELECT column1, ( SELECT column2, column3, ... FROM table_b WHERE table_a.id = table_b.a_id ) FROM table_a Results in \"subquery must return only one column\" as I expected. You mean returning the multiple columns as a record / composite type? Keep in mind GROUP BY clause usually dictates index use. The reason for this wasn't immediately apparent to me. For those who were curious, this blog post walks through it step by step: https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2015/06/indexing-for-group... reply magicalhippo 11 hours agorootparentSorry, was on mobile so hadn't patience to type examples. SELECT column1, ( SELECT column2 FROM table_b WHERE table_a.id = table_b.a_id ) as b_column2, ( SELECT column3 FROM table_b WHERE table_a.id = table_b.a_id ) as b_column3 FROM table_a It might look like a lot more work, but in my experience it's usually a lot faster. YMMV but check it. reply dspillett 8 hours agorootparentHow well that performs compared to a JOIN can vary massively depending on the data sizes of table_a & tale_b, how table_b is indexed, and what else is going on in the query. If table_b has an index on id,column2,column3 (or on id INLUDEing column2,column3) I would expect the equivalent JOIN to usually be faster. If you have a clustered index on Id (which is the case more often than not in MS SQL Server and MySQL/InnoDB) then that would count for this unless the table is much wider than those three columns (so the index with its selective data would get many rows per page more than the base data). Worst (and fairly common) case with sub-selects like that is the query planner deciding to run each subquery one per row from table_a. This is not an issue if you are only returning a few rows, or just one, from table_a, but in more complex examples (perhaps if this fragment is a CTE or view that is joined in a non-sargable manner so filtering predicates can't push down) you might find a lot more rows are processed this way even if few are eventually returned due to other filters. There are times when the method is definitely faster but be very careful with it (test with realistic data sizes and patterns) because often when it isn't, it really isn't. reply magicalhippo 7 hours agorootparent> perhaps if this fragment is a CTE or view Yeah I guess I should have specified that this technique usually works best when done in the outer query, not buried deep inside. It can be particularly effective if you fetch partial results, ie due to pagination or similar. That said, these things aren't set in stone. I shared my experience, but my first tip goes first :) reply dspillett 9 hours agorootparentprev> > Keep in mind GROUP BY clause usually dictates index use. > The reason for this wasn't immediately apparent to me. The key thing to remember is that grouping is essentially a sorting operation, and it happens before your other sorts (that last part isn't necessarily as obvious). reply hans_castorp 11 hours agoparentprev> Any query that's not a one-off should not perform any table scans. A table scan today can mean an outage tomorrow I disagree. There are queries where a table scan is the most efficient access strategy. These are typically analytical/aggregation queries that usually query the whole table. And sometimes getting only 50% of all rows is better done using a table scan as well. I also don't see how a (read only) \"table scan\" could leave to an outage. It won't block concurrent access. The only drawback is that it results in a higher I/O load - but if the server can't handle that, it would assume it's massively undersized. reply magicalhippo 11 hours agorootparentI mentioned in a different reply that I did not have analytic queries in mind. I don't work with that so forgot to specify. Outage might \"just\" mean slow enough that customer can't get their work done in time. For the customer it's the same. reply arkh 12 hours agoparentprev> Just make sure the subqueries return at most one row. The JSON functions most RDBMS offer are awesome for that. One subquery to get a JSON if you have multiple results for the field then you only have to decode it on the app side. reply Semaphor 13 hours agoparentprev> Any query that's not a one-off should not perform any table scans. A table scan today can mean an outage tomorrow. That very much depends on your data. reply magicalhippo 13 hours agorootparentI should have noted that I was talking about application workloads. I don't have much experience with analytics workloads. If you have something else in mind, do feel free to elaborate. reply Semaphor 12 hours agorootparentRelevant for applications as well, when a table only has a few thousand entries, a scan is not the end of the world and not even an outage in waiting. I agree with you that one should seek when possible as part of normal query optimization, but depending on your data, it could also just easily be something you can live with forever. reply hinkley 11 hours agorootparentYou can’t control the growth rate of your tables, you can only estimate it. When we design for reliability we want to remove single cause failures and make a best effort to reduce dual cause failures. We definitely don’t want two failures from a single cause. What reason might the lack of indexes suddenly become a critical issue? And what other things might you be scrambling to deal with at the same time? Tables might fill quickly when a favorable review comes in, or some world even results in churn in your system. Just make the damned index. You Are Going to Need It. And what’s the harm in making it? reply Semaphor 11 hours agorootparentDepending on your application, you can very accurately estimate it. And in a case I had yesterday, it involved stringy numbers because of a third party system, so I could indeed add a computed persisted column that converts our number to a VARCHAR, add a 9th index with a lot of fields on that computed column and then save… almost nothing compared to just scanning 6k rows. reply magicalhippo 1 hour agorootparentWe had one such table for years. The one day I get an emergency call from support, big customer don't get their responses and it's critical for their workflow. After some digging I found the service generating the responses got killed due to being unresponsive. Turns out our customer got a new client which caused them to suddenly generate 100x as much data as others in this module. And that caused a lot more data in a table that joined this non-indexed table. So everything was working, it was just the performance went over a cliff in a matter of days due to the missing index. Added the required index and it's been humming ever since. I've had similar experiences, and so these days I'm very liberal with indexes. We have read-heavy workloads, if you mostly insert then sure be conservative. reply ahoka 10 hours agorootparentprev“And what’s the harm in making it?“ Increased storage and slower inserts? reply hinkley 1 hour agorootparentIn a table you think isn’t growing?? No. reply magicalhippo 11 hours agorootparentprevAs usual, there are well-qualified exceptions. If you are very certain the table scan can't hurt, sure. But in my experience, an index wouldn't hurt any in those cases. reply silveraxe93 13 hours agoprevThe \"readability\" section has 3 examples. The first 2 are literally sacrificing readability so it's easier to write, and the last has an unreadable abomination that indenting is really not doing much. reply chipdart 12 hours agoparent> The first 2 are literally sacrificing readability so it's easier to write, (...) The leading comma format brings benefits beyond readability. For example, in version control systems the single-argument-per-line-with-leading-comma format turns any change to those arguments as a one-line diff. I think developers spend as much time looking at commit historyas they do to the actual source code. reply hinkley 11 hours agorootparentIf you’re still using a diff tool that can’t do sub-line diffs it’s time to join the 20’s. I haven’t been forced to use one of those in over ten years. reply chipdart 11 hours agorootparent> If you’re still using a diff tool that can’t do sub-line diffs it’s time to join the 20’s. I think you failed to understand what I wrote. Leading comma ensures one line diffs, but trailing comma forces two-line diffs when you add a trailing argument. With trailing comma, you need to touch the last line to add a comma, and then add the new argument in the line below. We are not discussing bundling all arguments in a single line. I don't know where you got that idea from. reply orbital223 4 hours agorootparent> Leading comma ensures one line diffs It does not. It just moves the edge case to a different position: trailing comma has the \"issue\" when adding an argument to the end of the list while leading comma has it when adding an argument to the beginning. Also, as pointed out by the other commenter, any decent modern diff tool will make it obvious that the change to the existing line is just the addition of a comma, which makes the difference basically moot. reply hinkley 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat’s the value in doing this unless it makes the diff clearer? It only makes the diff clearer if you don’t have single character highlighting in your diff tool. Which most have now. Have had for a decade. Also it’s not going to be a single line anyway. You add a line to the query and one to the caller. At a minimum. So you’re really arguing for three versus four. Which is false economy. reply chipdart 11 hours agorootparent> What’s the value in doing this unless it makes the diff clearer? Because it makes the diff clearer. Are you even reading the posts you're replying to? reply yen223 13 hours agoparentprevI'm not the biggest fan of how the first two conventions look, but they are real conventions used by real SQL people. And I can understand why they exist. I've seen them enough to not be bothered by them any more. reply silveraxe93 12 hours agorootparentYeah, unfortunately you're right that they are real conventions. Quite common too. I also _understand_ why they exist. It's simple: It makes code marginally easier to write. But writing confusing, unintuitive and honestly plain ugly code. Just so you can save a second after clicking run and the compiler tells you the mistake is a bad reason. reply arp242 3 hours agorootparentA lot of \"readability\" depends on what you're used to and what you expect. I don't think these conventions are inherently \"ugly\" or \"confusing\", but they are different to what I've been doing for a long time, and thus unexpected, and thus \"ugly\". But that's extremely subjective. I've done plenty of SQL, and I've regularly run in to the \"fuck about with fucking trailing commas until it's valid syntax\"-problem. It's a very reasonable convention to have. What should really happen is that the SQL standard should allow trailing commas: select a, b, from t; reply ahoka 7 hours agoparentprevWhy do you think its worse ? I don’t see any problems , or anything wrong with it . reply hinkley 11 hours agoparentprevWho splits column per line in the SELECT block and still leave 150 character wide lines? This is a fucked up definition of legibility. I can’t even get started on the commas. NOBODY CHECKS LONG LINES IN CODE REVIEWS. That was the biggest problem with AngularJS. People mishandling merges and breaking everything because the eyes start to glaze over at column 90. I’ve been on more than half a dozen teams with CRs and it’s always the same. I’m exquisitely aware of this and try not to do it, and I still fuck it up half as often as the next person. Split your shit up. Especially when trying to set an example for others. reply hyperman1 10 hours agorootparentThis could be a great comment if the tone was different. I'll try to give my perspective. SQL, unfortunately, is very verbose and has a strange mix of super-high and very low abstraction. There is also no SQL formatter out there that does a decent job, and no real consensus about how good SQL is supposed to look. If I look at the 'indent' guideline, it contains e.g.: , IFF(DATEDIFF(DAY, timeslot_date, CURRENT_DATE()) >= 29, LAG(overnight_fta_share, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY timeslot_date, timeslot_channel ORDER BY timeslot_activity), NULL) AS C28_fta_share Immediate SQL failures: 1) it has no easy facility to pull that DATEDIFF clause in a different variable/field. 2) The LAG line is verbose, especially if your DB doesn't allow to pull out the WINDOW clause. reply swarnie 12 hours agoparentprevAlternatively, write a mess of SQL like a three year old child that just discovered MSPaint then push the \"beautifier\" button and knock off for an early lunch. reply regexman1 12 hours agoparentprevThat's a totally valid point haha. reply silveraxe93 12 hours agorootparentI'll try to give some constructive criticism instead of a drive by pot shot. I'm sorry, it's just that the leading commas make my eyes bleed and I really hope the industry moves away from it. On point 3: What I do is use CTEs to create intermediate columns (with good names) and then a final one creating the final column. It's way more readable. ```sql with intermediate as ( select DATEDIFF(DAY, timeslot_date, CURRENT_DATE()) > 7 as days_7_difference, DATEDIFF(DAY, timeslot_date, CURRENT_DATE()) >= 29 as days_29_difference, LAG(overnight_fta_share, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY timeslot_date, timeslot_channel ORDER BY timeslot_activity) as overnight_fta_share_1_lag, LAG(overnight_fta_share, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY timeslot_date, timeslot_channel ORDER BY timeslot_activity)as overnight_fta_share_2_lag from timeslot_data) select iff(days_7_difference, overnight_fta_share_1_lag, null) as C7_fta_share, iff(days_29_difference, overnight_fta_share_2_lag, null) as C28_fta_share from intermediate ``` reply regexman1 12 hours agorootparentI appreciate the feedback, no offence taken. I'm an analyst so I often find the leading comma useful when I'm testing something and want to quickly comment a column out but I take your point. And I agree, I should have used CTEs for this query, I was just trying to save lines of code which had the unintended consequence of quite an ugly query. However I did want to use it as an example of indentation being useful to make it slightly easier to read. Although perhaps I'm the only one who thinks so. I greatly appreciate the constructive criticism. reply youdeet 13 hours agoprevOne more point in the \"Anti Join\". Use EXISTS instead of IN and LEFT JOIN if you only want to check existence of a row in another large table / subquery based on the conditions. EXISTS returns true as soon as it has found a hit. In case of LEFT JOIN and IN engine collects all results before evaluating. reply Semaphor 13 hours agoparentYeah, I was a bit confused there. In all my testing, (NOT) EXISTS was generating either a better plan or the same one as (LEFT) JOIN/(NOT) IN. In addition, it’s also clearer what the intent is. reply mergisi 3 hours agoprevGreat post! If you're looking to speed up your SQL queries, you might want to check out AI2sql https://ai2sql.io/. It can generate SQL queries quickly from plain English prompts, which can be super helpful when you're in a rush or dealing with complex queries. Definitely worth giving a try for anyone looking to streamline their workflow! reply the_gorilla 13 hours agoprevLeading comma is nice in SELECT statements because you can comment toggle individual lines. Indenting your code to make it more readable is basically what anyone with room temperature IQ does automatically. A lot of these other tips look like they're designed to deal with SQL design flaws, like how handling nulls isn't well defined in the spec so it's up to each implementation to do whatever it wants. reply willvarfar 13 hours agoparentA lot of databases support trailing commas in select clauses. Which is just as well. I want to scratch my eyes out every time I see someone formatting with comma starting the lines. It's the kind of foolish consistency that is a big part of performative engineering. reply silveraxe93 13 hours agorootparent> I want to scratch my eyes out every time I see someone formatting with comma starting the lines Right!? I _physically_ recoil every time I see that. I think that's the clearest example of normalisation of deviance [1] I know. Seems like anyone that enters the industry straight from data instead of moving from a more (software) engineering background gets used to this. And the arguments in favour are always so weak! - It's easier to comment out lines - Easier to not miss a comma Those are picked up in seconds by the compiler. And are a tiny help in writing code vs violating a core writing convention from basically every other language. [1]- https://danluu.com/wat/ reply disgruntledphd2 11 hours agorootparentI'm a data person and despite seeing this for years, still despise that approach to commas. Seriously, it's not that hard to comment out the damn comma. reply the_gorilla 57 minutes agorootparentprevThe only ones that matter don't. If you care that much about seeing a comma somewhere you shouldn't, you have no real problems and shouldn't be complaining. reply yen223 12 hours agorootparentprevPostgres and postgres-likes (e.g. Redshift) notably don't support trailing commas in select clauses. reply hans_castorp 11 hours agorootparentprev> A lot of databases support trailing commas in select clauses. Which ones? Postgres, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB and SQLite do not allow that. reply willvarfar 8 hours agorootparentI guess I'm being spoiled by BigQuery :) To be fair, BigQuery SQL is improving at quite a pace. If you follow their RSS, they are often announcing small but solid affordances like trailing commas, the new RANGE datatype, BigLake, some limited grouping and equality for arrays and structs, etc. It is also probable that they expose Google's new query pipe syntax. Currently there are some hints from the error messages in the console that it's behind a feature flag or something. reply mulmen 10 hours agoparentprevThis is only true if you comment out the last line in the SELECT clause. It’s ugly code and the justification doesn’t pass the sniff test. reply GrumpyNl 11 hours agoparentprevWhen you comment the first statement, that doesnt have the \",\", it will break and you still have to remove the \",\" from the second line, so your comment is not valid. reply Semaphor 13 hours agoprevRegarding \"Comment your code!\": At least for MSSQL, it’s often recommended not to use -- for comments but instead /**/, because many features like the query store save queries without line breaks, so if you get the query from there, you need to manually fix everything instead of simply using your IDEs formatter. reply petters 12 hours agoparentThat sounds like a bug in the query store reply regexman1 12 hours agoparentprevI didn't realise that, great to know. Thanks! reply wodenokoto 10 hours agoprevEverybody is up in arms about the comma suggestion but everyone thinks the 1=1 is a good idea in the where clause? If I saw that in a code review I don’t know what I’d think of the author. reply AtNightWeCode 3 hours agoparentYou can motivate it with the same reasons as trailing commas. Making code reviews easier since changes to WHERE statements does not effect other lines. But if the reason is, as in this case to be able to add dynamic conditions. You will for sure be fired where I work. reply sgarland 13 hours agoprevNot shown: stop using SELECT *. You almost certainly do not need the entire width of the table, and by doing so, you add more data to filter and transmit, and also prevent semijoins, which are awesome. reply yen223 12 hours agoparentThere are broadly two kinds of people who write SQL: analysts, and developers For developers, yeah. SELECT * has pitfalls, and you should almost always specify your columns or use a query builder that does that for you. For analysts though, life is short and sometimes you really don't want to type all the columns out.

If you need to add some condition later on, why not just add it then? What benefit is there to just marking out the spot where you might add the condition at some point in the future? reply Izkata 5 hours agorootparentFor their one here it's just the ability to rapidly comment/uncomment conditions in a query editor while exploring the data or debugging the query, and not having to worry about the leading AND or OR. I've also seen it in code with iterative adds, for example: for crit in criteria: sql += \" AND \" + crit No needed to add a sentinel or other logic to skip the first AND. I saw it a lot before people got used to \" AND \".join(criteria). reply hot_gril 12 minutes agorootparentYeah. Especially when I'm trying to see what makes some query slow. reply regexman1 5 hours agorootparentprevThat's right - it's just a quicker way of being able to comment/uncomment conditions when doing EDA or debugging. reply azthecx 8 hours agorootparentprevI personally don't use it too, but I think it's origins are not just readability, but from developing queries in a REPL like environment. As you develop and are constantly creating / debugging queries where you often add new and or or clauses as a whole line, that becomes much faster to add and remove those same lines as they're a single shortcut away in nearly all text editors. reply paperplatter 2 hours agorootparentYeah, so often do I have an EXPLAIN ANALYZE query.txt file I'm repeatedly editing in one window and piping into psql in another to try and make something faster. So I put WHERE true at the top. reply DH61AG 10 hours agorootparentprevIt is a bit silly but I think it just helps with code readability some people. reply yen223 4 hours agorootparentprevI've only recently learned that SQL Server doesn't have \"true\" or \"false\" (!) reply Izkata 5 hours agorootparentprevI believe some database engines can be configured to error if you do that, and 1=1 doesn't trigger the safeguard. reply alex5207 13 hours agoprevNever knew about QUALIFY.

Missing indexes on columns that are in foreign keys are even worse. reply l5870uoo9y 12 hours agoprevAnd I take it CTEs are implicitly being discouraged. reply higeorge13 11 hours agoparentIt used to be like this (i remember in past postgres versions CTEs had worse performance than subqueries), but not anymore. reply regexman1 11 hours agoparentprevNot at all actually, I just hadn't really planned to add this as a tip. Additionally I thought an in-line view was fine for the examples included. But maybe I will! reply dooer 13 hours agoprevI am bad at SQL so this is great reply dspillett 8 hours agoprevOn readability, I often find aligning things in two columns is more readable. To modify the two examples in TFA: SELECT e.employee_id , e.employee_name , e.job , e.salary FROM employees e WHERE 1=1 -- Dummy value. AND e.job IN ('Clerk', 'Manager') AND e.dept_no != 5 ; and with a JOIN: SELECT e.employee_id , e.employee_name , e.job , e.salary , d.name , d.location FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON d.dept_no = e.dept_no WHERE 1=1 -- Dummy value. AND e.job IN ('Clerk', 'Manager') AND e.dept_no != 5 ; In the join example, for a simple ON clause like that I'll usually just have JOIN ... ON in the one line, but if there are multiple conditions they are usually clearer on separate lines IMO. In more complicated queries I might further indent the joins too, like: SELECT * FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON d.dept_no = e.dept_no WHERE 1=1 -- Dummy value. AND e.job IN ('Clerk', 'Manager') AND e.dept_no != 5 ; YMMV. Some people strongly agree with me here, others vehemently hate the way I align such code… WRT “Always specify which column belongs to which table”: this is particularly important for correlated sub-queries, because if you put the wrong column name in and it happens to match a name in an object in the outer query you have a potentially hard to find error. Also, if the table in the inner query is updated to include a column of the same name as the one you are filtering on in the outer, the meaning of your sub-query suddenly changes quite drastically without it having changed itself. A few other things off the top of my head: 1. Remember that as well as UNION [ALL], EXCEPT and INTERSECT exist. I've seen (and even written myself) some horrendous SQL that badly implements these behaviours. TFA covers EXCEPT, but I find people who know about that don't always know about INTERSECT. It is rarely useful IME, but when it is useful it is really useful. 2. UPDATEs that change nothing still do everything else: create entries in your transaction log (could be an issue if using log-shipping for backups or read-only replicas etc.), fire triggers, create history rows if using system-versioned tables, and so forth. UPDATE a_table SET a_column = 'a value' WHERE a_column'a value' can be a lot faster than without the WHERE. 3. Though of course be very careful with NULLable columns and/or setting a value NULL with point 2. “WHERE a_column IS DISTINCT FROM 'a value'” is much more maintainable if your DB supports that syntax (added in MS SQL Server 2022 and Azure SQL DB a little earlier, supported by Postgres years before, I don't know about other DBs without checking) than the more verbose alternatives. 4. Trying to force the sort order of NULLs with something like “ORDER BY ISNULL(a_column, 0)”, or doing similar with GROUP BY, can be very inefficient in some cases. If you expect few rows to be returned and there are relatively few NULLs in the sort target column it can be more performant to SELECT the non-NULL case and the NULL case then UNION ALL the two and then sort. Though if you do expect many rows this can backfire badly and you and up with excess spooling to disk, so test, test, and test again, when hacking around like this. reply eezing 14 hours agoprevnext [2 more] [flagged] dang 12 hours agoparentOk, but please don't post unsubstantive comments here. reply AtNightWeCode 13 hours agoprev [–] Never use WHERE 1=1.

But the site says to make it easier to add dynamic conditions. Which is a terrible idea in maybe not all but many SQL engines. reply ricardo81 12 hours agoparentprevPresumably you are thinking about queries in code that add WHERE clauses dynamically that aren't escaped correctly- which doesn't have to be the case. 1 = 1 is at least handy for simply joining a variadic amount of other clauses with ' AND ' rather than counting if there's any to add at all. reply AtNightWeCode 5 hours agorootparentYes. \"Use a dummy value in the WHERE clause so you can dynamically add and remove conditions with ease:\" I don't know how to read this in another way. reply jcz_nz 12 hours agoparentprevCan you elaborate on security issues here? reply thestepafter 12 hours agorootparentI think that it means the reason for doing where 1 = 1 is sometimes to allow for easy insertion of dynamic queries which can be a security and performance issue. The actual usage of where 1 = 1 doesn't cause the security or performance issue. reply AtNightWeCode 3 hours agorootparentWhich is exactly what the site says. To insert dynamic conditions. I know that you can use 1=1 for the same reasons as trailing commas. But kinda obvious that this is not the case here. reply DH61AG 10 hours agoparentprevThis doesn't make any sense at all. reply Gunax 13 hours agoparentprevWhat is a dynamic, adhoc query? Why does adding 1=1 support that? reply egormakarov 10 hours agorootparentLets say its 2001 and you are writing some hot e-commerce stuff in plain php. You want to filter data depending on multiple fields in the submitted form. If some field is there, you add one more \"AND\" clause to the \"WHERE\", like this: if (isset($_POST['product'])) { $query .= \"AND product = \" . $_POST['product']; }. So in order not to check every time if the added clause is the first one you start with \"WHERE 1=1 \", as \"WHERE AND ...\" would not work. reply paperplatter 2 hours agorootparentI get how this isn't good. But how else would you handle multi-field filtering, keep all the ANDs and use (product_id = $1 OR $1 IS NULL) so the unset filters are no-op? That's ok as long as the query planner is smart enough. reply freilanzer 6 hours agorootparentprevPhp has nothing like this? In [1]: \"... WHERE \" + \" AND \".join(str(i) for i in range(4)) Out[1]: '... WHERE 0 AND 1 AND 2 AND 3' Very strange. reply egormakarov 5 hours agorootparentThis will produce broken SQL on empty clauses list. Very strange. reply abrookewood 10 hours agorootparentprevI'm wondering that as well. I don't get that suggestion at all. reply AtNightWeCode 8 hours agorootparentprevIn this case. A query that you build by adding different strings. 1=1 is for adding AND statements to the WHERE clause dynamically. In your code. I never seen it used for anything else. Adhoc is just the practice of running raw SQL queries. So you end up with things like this. \"SELECT * FROM Music WHERE 1=1\" + \"AND category='rock'\" The risk is now that you by mistake allow for SQL-injections but also every genre will generate a different query plan. Depending on what SQL engine you use this may hurt performance. And one would think that this is a thing of the past. But it is not. reply regexman1 12 hours agoparentprev [–] I'll add this as a caveat. I'm an analyst so my SQL isn't really exposed to anyone other than myself and so I wasn't aware of this, thanks for flagging. reply halayli 12 hours agorootparentA random person claims adding 1=1 is a security risk and you are going to add it as caveat without verifying if the claim is true nor knowing why? That's how misinformation spreads around. OP doesn't know what they are talking about because adding 1=1 is not a security risk. 1=1 is related to sql injections where a malicious attacker injects 'OR 1=1' into the end of the where clause to disable the where clause completely. OP probably saw '1=1' and threw that into the comment. reply AtNightWeCode 2 hours agorootparentRead my other comments. I worked with SQL on and off since the last century.

I've heard about Datomic before but never took the time to dive in. reply clusterhacks 5 hours agoprevSeveral comments mention the data immutability of Datomic as a plus and I just wanted to say you can totally make a plain-old-RDBMS table append-only and get those benefits. I'm sure this is commonly done. I did it with a timestamp on the tables that was captured at insert time. All reads were against views of the tables that were defined such that the only tuples returned were the \"most recent\" tuples by appropriate data fields and max(timestamp). \"Deleted\" records were just indicated by a flag. This preserved the ability see the full history for a tuple from creation, all mutations, all the way to deletion. This scaled reasonable well up to low millions of tuples on a normal, single database server. But it was for an internal project, so the number of clients hammering at it was quite low. reply diggan 4 hours agoparent> Several comments mention the data immutability of Datomic as a plus and I just wanted to say you can totally make a plain-old-RDBMS table append-only and get those benefits. I'm sure this is commonly done. Absolutely, you can also store an append-only log to a txt file on disk and have your API backend recreate the \"current\" data from that append-only log. I guess people mentioning as a plus as it's out-of-the-box default behavior for temporal databases like Datomic or XTDB, where they are optimized for these type of queries with years of work done on it. Just as a fun aside and only slightly related: I discovered the other day that MariaDB supports (bi)temporal tables out-of-the-box too! Probably the only (FOSS) SQL database that does so? https://mariadb.com/kb/en/temporal-tables/ reply michaelteter 1 hour agoparentprevThe timestamps are just the tip of the iceberg. The value, as I see from the YT talk, is that additions (and atomic groups of additions) can be recognized as one event, complete with who did it and additional metadata. reply parhamn 4 hours agoparentprevSure, most things are representable in a table. Its very tricky to get these things to perform well. Every query needs to have the additional filters/aggregations and every index needs to be smart and partial. E.g. you need all your indexes to be partial with a CREATE INDEX WHERE deleted_at = null for the deleted case as having a giant boolean filter can quickly include a large percentage of your data making the indexes useless. I tried this once many years ago and it became quite a headache. Direct SQL access to the database to perform management queries outside your application becomes a headache too. reply jacques_chester 4 hours agoparentprevThis description isn't too far from bitemporal tables, which are one of my favorite obscure technologies. I think though that one distinction is that immutability in this case requires cooperation from the client, a commitment not to modify existing records. As compare to the database enforcing it. reply clusterhacks 3 hours agorootparentI didn't mention it, but in this particular service, no client actually had SQL access to the database. There were create/read/update/delete service functions that clients used instead. The timestamp for a tuple was returned by reads, so when a client wanted to update/delete a tuple, the service functions all required the client to provide the timestamp from the client read. If that timestamp argument wasn't the most recent, the client had to deal with that. But the actual database insert would fail. Importantly, this particular service had only a few internal clients who almost 100% \"owned\" the tuples the client worked with. So there wasn't a lot of contention for any specific tuple by multiple clients. reply jacques_chester 1 hour agorootparent> There were create/read/update/delete service functions that clients used instead. Oh! I haven't seen this pattern in a long time - not since I worked on Oracle Application Express apps. In a cousin comment I noted that the bulk of app developers don't think about how to use the database to their advantage. reply Mister_Snuggles 4 hours agorootparentprevThis could be enforced in the schema via triggers and/or security permissions. Cooperation from the client is not required. EDIT: Oracle has append-only tables, and can also use \"blockchain\" to verify integrity. See the IMMUTABLE option on CREATE TABLE[0]. PostgreSQL doesn't appear to have append-only tables, so using security and/or triggers seems to be the only option there. [0] https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/2... reply mike_hearn 18 minutes agorootparentMore to the point Oracle has flashback queries: SELECT ... AS OFSo you can query the database as of any point in the past, making manual work to implement the same feature with custom columns redundant. Oracle can also show you a record of transactions made and what SQL to run to undo them, including dependency tracking between transactions. reply jacques_chester 4 hours agorootparentprevYou're correct, I overlooked triggers. Though that may be a bridge too far for some folks, triggers are only really comfortable for folks who are deep on RDBMSes. For lots of app developers the ORM is the limit of the world. reply Mister_Snuggles 3 hours agorootparentORMs could offer a unique advantage by allowing the user to describe an append-only table and generating the required triggers (or the appropriate CREATE TABLE options). They'd also be able to include helpers to make working with the table easier - like defaulting to selecting current rows only, or an easy way to specify that you want rows as-of a certain point in time. I'm not sure if any ORMs actually support this though. reply refset 3 hours agorootparentI suspect there have been a great many examples and attempts at the ORM level - this one with \"bi-temporal chaining\" springs to mind: https://github.com/goldmansachs/reladomo And without the ORM layer there's this extension for Postgres: https://github.com/hettie-d/pg_bitemporal reply ilkhan4 2 hours agoparentprevYeah, and this is probably sufficient for most common cases if we're being honest. Immutability and bitemporal querying are nice features in Datomic, but the trade offs for most teams are an unfamiliar query language, unfamiliar runtime/hosting requirements, unknown performance footguns, little if any integration with 3rd party tools, and (until recently) licensing costs. If it were me, I'd probably deal with the headache or complexity of adding triggers/permissions and audit tables to Postgres to get that functionality if all of those other things are solved instead. reply refset 2 hours agorootparentAs it happens there's a talk happening next week at PGConf NYC on time travel and system-time versioning in Postgres by the DBOS team: https://postgresql.us/events/pgconfnyc2024/schedule/session/... But system-time is only half the story. There has been chatter over the years on the PG mailing lists, but there doesn't seem to be much momentum currently towards adding full SQL:2011 bitemporal support to Postgres. Adding support in a way that feels as natural as using Datomic seems unlikely. reply stefcoetzee 2 hours agorootparentprevThink Datomic is unitemporal a.o.t. bitemporal. reply panick21_ 4 hours agoparentprevThis works to a limited extend and leads to a huge complexity explosion as soon as you go beyond a single table. Going down this route is soon gone eat much of your complexity budget. I worked on a hospital information system that did this for all forms, and the parts of the table had complex self referential links. Getting the actual history out of that thing was SQL hell. reply clusterhacks 3 hours agorootparentI agree that this approach would be pretty unwieldy for a large/complex backend schema. It worked quite well for a smaller, in-house application and set of requirements. I think I probably would be perfectly happy using the approach again for our in-house applications if requirements for audit/history preservation needed to be built into a data model. I don't have a good feeling for when I might say \"this data model is too large/complex for this approach.\" I might instead think more about what and how many subsystems are going to have direct access to the RDBMS as a cut-off? Hospital/medical research information systems (my day job is in the backends of these apps) seem to use backends with many compromises and poor db designs bolted on. I have also dealt with the horror of electronic data capture forms. My most recent headache has been a poor data model that ultimately wraps each form in a very ugly JSON blob. I've never seen anything that so completely lacks any residue of design . . . reply null_investor 4 hours agoparentprevThat doesn't that well though. Datomic is much more efficient on doing this reply michaelteter 7 hours agoprevDatomic (as presented in this video) seems like a great thing. But if it's so great, why are so few people talking about it? Is it because it only exists for Clojure, and few people know or talk about Clojure? I love Clojure as a language, and I have wanted to use it in production; but there are so few opportunities other than solo building - where you really have to climb a steep wall due to the Clojurist mentality of /Frameworks Bad! Choose all your own libraries good!/. Instead I have found myself happy and productive in the Elixir/BEAM world, of course initially because of Phoenix. And like many people, I have just been accepting the destructive, non-historic approach to data management with typical RDBMSs. If there were a Datomic for Elixir, I'd probably use it. Must Datomic (or a data management approach like it) be tightly coupled with Clojure? reply augustl 7 hours agoparentI've used Datomic from both Kotin and Groovy (!) I presented on Datomic at KotlinConf too, with some live coding starting around the 31 minute mark https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hicQvxdKvnc You probably need to be on the JVM, as the peer library (i.e. the \"good one\", where you embed the full query engine and data fetching directly into your business logic) is so far only implemented for the JVM. I suppose 10+ years of weird license models and a hefty price tag haven't helped. Datomic turned free (but still proprietary) in 2023 though. But why Datomic isn't more widely adopted is a huge mystery to me... reply foobarian 4 hours agorootparent> But why Datomic isn't more widely adopted is a huge mystery to me... I've been hearing about Datomic on and off over the years, and I never saw a clear answer to the simple question: what is it? What does it do? Instead I saw it most often mentioned as an example of a successful Clojure project, and now that's how I think of it. Seems like poor marketing/branding if there ever was intentional attempt at it. reply diggan 2 hours agorootparent> I've been hearing about Datomic on and off over the years, and I never saw a clear answer to the simple question: what is it? What does it do? I'm guessing most people, like me, first heard about both Clojure and Datomic from one of Hickey's famous talks about software development. Coming from one of those, I guess it's a bit easier to understand what the various concepts and words mean from Datomic's website for example. I guess the easiest way to put it: Datomic is a append-only (deletions via \"retraction\" records) database that lets you query through time (also called \"Bitemporal modeling\" with fancier words). The features/benefits page I think is pretty clear (https://www.datomic.com/benefits.html) but again, might just be my familiarity speaking. reply refset 2 hours agorootparent> that lets you query through time (also called \"Bitemporal modeling\" with fancier words) Datomic is actually only 'uni-temporal', it provides a database-wide, immutable \"system time\" (aka \"transaction time\") versioning + very effective as-of querying. This naturally falls out of the \"Epochal Time Model\" (see Deconstructing the Database, 2012). However there is no particular built-in support for any further mutable time dimension, see: https://vvvvalvalval.github.io/posts/2017-07-08-Datomic-this... System-time is still very powerful though. The way I think of the difference is: system-time versioning is mainly useful for debugging and auditing (and of course for the horizontal read scaling), whereas valid-time versioning is useful for timestamp-based reporting (or other forms of in-application time-travel and modelling 'truth' in business data) where the system-time timestamps are not the timestamps end users are directly interested in, see: https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/eventual-business-consisten... reply foobarian 2 hours agorootparentprevI am aware of the basics but it's hard to find details on \"why not Postgres\" or other standard solution for basically event sourcing. reply michaelteter 7 hours agorootparentprevThanks. I’ll check out the video. At this point I’m pretty addicted to BEAM and the Elixir ecosystem though. (And LiveView!). reply macintux 45 minutes agorootparentI doubt it's still the case, but once upon a time Riak (written primarily in Erlang) was one of the preferred storage backends for Datomic. reply seanc 5 hours agoparentprevI used Datomic for a few years at a job. In addition to the cost and proprietary nature, I'd say there are two reasons; 1) New and different things come with risk, and many folks are risk averse, especially in groups 2) More concretely, it is very easy to write slow queries in Datomic, and it can be a struggle to diagnose why the order of your datalog statements matters so much reply apwell23 2 hours agoparentprevIts closed source software thats VERY expensive and supported by one tiny company somewhere. Try selling that to management as the place where you want to keep their data. reply armincerf 1 hour agorootparentOk but XTDB has a lot in common with Datomic and is open source but still hardly widely used. I think this is partly because most people don't consider 'temporality' as a feature a database should offer; rather, they believe temporal problems should be solved via proper schema design and application logic. Additionally, using datalog (or any esoteric query language that isn't SQL) locks you out of many battle-tested tools that enterprises rely on. The XTDB team has pivoted towards a SQL-first approach (though still supports datalog) and now 'only' has the 'But why not just use Postgres' problem to solve. Having personally moved from trying to use Postgres for everything (including lots of timeseries data with Timescale) to a dedicated and relatively unknown DB built purely for the purpose I want it for (QuestDB), I am all for more people trying to build databases that do specific things better than Postgres. However, it will be very difficult to create something that does literally everything Postgres can do but better, which probably makes Postgres the sensible choice for the majority of applications. reply refset 56 minutes agorootparent> this is partly because most people don't consider 'temporality' as a feature a database should offer Not sure on your definition of 'people', but I think every business ultimately wants solid auditing and reporting capabilities across their IT systems. These concerns are only increasing in importance as new regulations demand stronger data provenance, but their implementation shouldn't be reliant on the process of \"proper schema design\" to get things right first time. Databases built for the modern world should be making this stuff bulletproof and easy. (I work on XTDB - and if Postgres already supported temporal tables I possibly wouldn't!) reply armincerf 26 minutes agorootparentOh, I totally agree that 'people' (which I guess refers to any potential user of a DBMS) often do need temporality (or even bitemporality), but they don't consider that the database should have this baked in, or they just don't consider it much at all. I'm fully on board with XTDB and similar solutions for this reason. Most people still gravitate towards Postgres and similar databases without giving much thought to these temporal challenges, even though those options lack a robust solution for the temporal issues that so many systems demand. reply jdminhbg 1 hour agorootparentprev\"One tiny company\" is Nubank, with a $70B market cap: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NU/ reply apwell23 21 minutes agorootparenthey boss lets have our database be supported by a ... brazilian bank. prbly not a winning proposal. reply nikodotio 2 hours agorootparentprevIt is free now: https://blog.datomic.com/2023/04/datomic-is-free.html reply rjbwork 1 hour agorootparentIt's still closed source.

Electric Clojure is the latest but Kit with HugSQL serves all my needs. reply michaelteter 7 hours agorootparentElectric looks awesome, but their stern warning of “we are building this for ourselves, and if you get value that’s great” gave me pause. If it reaches a point of being documented and intended for general public use, then I’ll definitely try a project with it. reply dustingetz 6 hours agorootparentThat's right, I have a blog post cooking up about why Electric is for experts today. A major factor in this is because, like with Clojure, the users aren't paying us, so the documentation you want cannot yet afford to exist. Another is performance - to get Electric to purr you have to understand what you are asking the computer to do (I've seen the stuff senior engineers type with their AI codegen tools, that approach is simply not viable here, at least not yet). The net impact of these two factors is that if Electric is not obviously the exact thing you know you must have—i.e., you are already succeeding or have the possibility of succeeding with something else—there is high risk that your adoption will not succeed, leaving you frustrated and unhappy! Failed projects do neither of us any good, that is a recipe for a damaged brand. A bonus third factor is that the demos we've been cooking up internally—that we haven't revealed yet—are so f%cking incredible that everyone is going to be motivated to use and learn it anyway because Electric yields value that is previously unseen and unavailable anywhere else. So I am simply setting healthy expectations for success. For example, we just built the 80% that matters of the “sync engine” value prop in two weeks and 100 LOC. Implementing it in userland requires 1 LOC per query. With differential network traffic for over the wire O(1) remote incremental collection maintenance! for free! And the pattern works with any database! reply diggan 4 hours agorootparentprev> Electric looks awesome, but their stern warning of “we are building this for ourselves, and if you get value that’s great” gave me pause. Clojure (the core language) is developed in exactly the same way, Rich Hickey is pretty forthcoming with the approach they take. So if a framework with that approach gives you pause, probably Clojure the language should do the same. Relevant: https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba95... reply michaelteter 56 minutes agorootparentBut I know Clojure is in use in quite a few places, and it has quite a few really capable people supporting it in one way or another. Plus it has good documentation and several books teaching it. That's very different from a slick (and impressive) framework built by one company for themselves. Also, code written for Electric is very specific to Electric. But Clojure is just functional-first Lisp. It's very easy to rewrite in another language, even an imperative language. There wouldn't be a huge paradigm shift translating Clojure to any of half a dozen popular languages. reply fulafel 4 hours agoparentprevI think the takeoff was hampered by being paid software at the time when it generated the most excitement and then the \"free to use but proprietary\" concided with XTDB.

I get that postgres is a good default in many cases, and I don't expect SQL to die tomorrow. But there are _so many_ apps (most/all backoffice apps I've worked on for example) with 10s or 100s of transactions per second at most, that would love to have the data available directly inside your business logic, and where both business logic and devops would improve by many orders of magnitude by having a full transaction log of all changes done to your data over time. Is it _just_ because Datomic is different and people don't get it, and that preconceived notions makes you think Datomic is something it isn't? Here's to the crazy ones! reply koito17 10 hours agoparentProfessional Clojure dev for some time. Here is what prevents me from using Datomic. - no Docker image; still distributed as a tarball. Although com.datomic/local exists, it only provides the Client API, so it's mostly suited towards mocking Datomic Cloud. - Datomic Cloud is designed around AWS; applications wanting to use Datomic Cloud must also design themselves around AWS - Datomic On-Prem does not scale the same way Datomic Cloud does (e.g. every database has an in-memory index; the transactor and *all peers* need to keep them all in-memory) - No query planner whatsoever. In databases like XTDB, the order of :where clauses doesn't matter since the engine is able to optimize them. In Datomic, swapping two :where clauses can transform a 10ms query into a 10s query. In addition to the above four points, I strongly believe the following points prevent others from using Datomic. - Writing Datomic queries outside of Clojure (e.g. Java) requires writing everything in strings, which feels awful no matter what. - If you are not using a JVM-based language, then there is no choice but the REST API for interaction. The REST API is orders of magnitude slower than the official Clojure and Java clients. - Too many tooling exists around the pgwire protocol and various dialects of SQL. Datomic obviously does not fit into either of these categories of tooling. - Applications like DBeaver do not support Datomic at all. The best you can do is access the datomic_kvs table from a database using JDBC storage engine. reply refset 9 hours agorootparent> In databases like XTDB, the order of :where clauses doesn't matter since the engine is able to optimize them Rich's observation was that query optimizers often get things wrong in ways that are hard to predict or control, but he's not fundamentally opposed to their use. That said, building a decent optimizer is a huge undertaking and I think they took the right decision to not attempt to bundle that sort of complexity into the original vision for Datomic otherwise they might never have shipped. The state-of-the-art commercial engine for query optimization and execution algorithms in this 'triple' space is probably https://relational.ai/ reply marcinzm 7 hours agorootparentAs I see it, Rich's stance is that of an expert in the database that doesn't need to deliver business features using the database. New users are not experts and even experienced users that work for companies have pressure to deliver features. You can get initial popularity by targeting these types of expert users working on more experimental products. However long term growth and popularity requires targeting the other 99.9% of users. I've seen one company adopt Datomic due to this type of user and then a couple years latter rip it out because as it grew it's developers were no longer of this type. reply refset 5 hours agorootparentThe original RDBMS vision was very explicitly for the users (both developers and analysts) to not have to be experts in their own database in order to achieve useful work, and without needing to think about procedural/3GL code from the get-go.

I also found the documentation to be quite limited on specific points I wanted to know. They showed of a JOOQ like Java API for Clojure once but as far as I can see, this was never released. That is crazy to me, using it amazingly well from Java and friends would seem to me to be an absolute no brainer. That alone made it basically impossible to be adopted. Going from SQL/JOOQ to Strings was just not gone happen. They focused so much on Datomic Cloud, and that just isn't where most people are gone deploy. Specially in the age of Kubernetes and Docker. Its kind of crazy that there were not official Docker images and things like that. So even while I love Datomic conceptually, and once you have it set up with Clojure its pretty awesome.

I make a living from my SaaS, which is written in Clojure. Reasons why I don't use Datomic: * I've been burned in the past by a not-very-popular closed-source expensive database developed by a small company (specifically, Franz Inc's AllegroCache used with AllegroCL). * I don't actually want to preserve all history. I am worried about performance. * The data model doesn't fit my use case. I know my usage patterns and queries very well, so I am better served by KV stores. * None of the storage engines is a good fit for me. In case you wonder, I've been using RethinkDB and I am now moving to FoundationDB. I need a distributed KV store with strict serializability (https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/strict-serializable) consistency, running on my hardware.

Well, it feels like a whole lot of braiding going on. Datomic: complex made hard? Datomic requires a storage backend (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB, MySQL, etc.), transactors, peers, and a separate transaction log... also, it appears the few real users of Datomic are primarily running it in AWS. Trying to run it elsewhere likely introduces more complications and uncertainties. Good luck getting support, too—you might have to wait for Rich Hickey to finish his hammock nap (ba-dum-tss) While Datomic's immutability, time-travel queries, and Datalog query language are conceptually cool, they seem like niche features. My guess is that in 99% of the cases SQL can do the job just fine. Also, Rich Hickey may not have braids, but those curls come pretty close. Without deep pockets for high-RAM servers, many tend to steer clear of Java. If Datomic were packaged as a single binary with fewer dependencies (and no JVM requirement), it could attract more users. As it stands, it's a complex setup with limited benefits, primarily suited for specific use cases, I think (financial auditing / historical data analysis?). --- COLOPHON (from the Greek word κολοφών [kolophōn], meaning \"summit\" or \"finishing touch\") I don’t have real-world experience with Datomic; I played around with Datascript and ultimately steered away from Datomic after perceiving a low ROI given its complexity.

Maybe it's because I've use Datomic a bunch. When I'm on projects that use a SQL db, a handful of problems are just fundamentally solved in Datomic, and none of the super knowledgeable devs that know SQL in and out are even aware that they are problems. Some examples: - What caused this column of this row to end up with this value? - Oh no, we were down 3am but when the first person investigated it at 7am (oh those backoffice SLAs...) everything works fine and nobody knows that the db state was at 3am - When we wrote value X, what other values did we also write at the same time? - We need to carefully write a transaction that reads some data, writes some data, and reads some more data, and hopefully lock correctly, and hopefully we understood the isolation level (that we probably didn't set anyway) correctly and... Which makes me think I must be the crazy one... reply dimitar 6 hours agorootparentprevDatomic Pro doesn't need AWS, I don't see what complications it can cause. It has some helpers for running it in AWS (like a bucket to export to CloudWatch), but none of them are mandatory. And if your use case is small you can run with dev storage (https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html); pretty much the same as you would SQLite. It might be slightly harder to get started with, but then the simplicity comes in when it is time to solve common business problems.

He even used the word “Easy”! (unless i misremember, this needs to be checked). Anyway, Cloud had consumption based pricing and developers, companies, and even hobbyists are all accustomed to paying for managed cloud infrastructure. To me this seems like a viable strategy, and devs would have forgiven the previous licensing issues -- we just want to get paid to play with cool toys at work, you gotta work the money stuff out with the bosses. The problem with Cloud was that it didn’t deliver on easy. It was not the Heroku they envisioned, rather it was a scary AWS amalgamation that required deep AWS knowledge to debug their CloudFormation templates to get it to work. This is not even really their fault!, as CloudFormation is a dumpster fire, there are much better cloud orchestration tools now. And while AWS's first few products were rock solid (S3, EC2, DynamoDB), around this time is when AWS turned on the enterprise growth machine and pivoted into box checking and everything cloud began to turn to quicksand underneath their feet. On top of cloud quicksand, Datomic Cloud had technical scalability challenges which they brute force engineered through, motivating the architectural shift away from the easy synchronous/local entity api to the annoying async/remote client api, and then back again sorta with Ions -- but at the cost of, like, 3 years of product roadmap, during which time Typescript exploded in popularity, the serverless hype cycle began to break and SQL started making a comeback. Also, the Java API had poor adoption. selling predominantly into Clojure commercial users isn’t a great market so consequently: no VC, small team, no sales/marketing/devrel - at a time when the startup boom was gaining momentum, developer infra was getting funded for the first time so competitors were spending tons of money on beautiful docs, marketing, full time twitter accounts, etc. I still think there’s elements of an amazing product here, but the business window for a Clojure database has kinda closed - because Clojure itself has lost momentum. Datomic Cloud at its essence is a clojure hosting platform, the business is Clojure itself. I am very bullish on Clojure, I think it never found its killer app, and once found, once a money vector is opened, a bunch of cash (like, $100M†) will make all these problems go away and deliver on Clojure's mission to bring \"simple made easy\" to mass market application development, which is desperately needed. Maybe Hyperfiddle & Electric? † Paraphrasing a Materialize press release, “it takes $100M to build a production ready database” -- and for the record, Materialize isn't doing too well, nobody seems to know what it is for and the VCs replaced the CEO earlier this year.

Rich been really upfront with that both Clojure and Datomic are products of Rich's solution to particular problems he experienced. Datomic does really, really matter, even with the \"small\" adoption it has, for me. Even if I haven't used it myself a lot. And who are anyone of us to say what \"truly matters\" when it comes to how we spend our time? Clearly, Datomic does matter, otherwise these people wouldn't have spent a decade building it, so it does matter on some level. Maybe that doesn't match up to your \"truly, really, really matters\" imagination, but it feels kind of weird to reach the conclusion that Datomic doesn't matter, based on what you believe to be impactful.

Listen to this article · 7:22 min Learn more Share full article 288 The former FTX executive Caroline Ellison, leaving federal court in Manhattan on Tuesday, received a harsher sentence than many legal experts had expected. Credit... Karsten Moran for The New York Times By David Yaffe-Bellany and Matthew Goldstein Reporting from U.S. District Court in Manhattan Sept. 24, 2024 Caroline Ellison, a former top adviser to the cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to two years in prison on Tuesday for her role in the $8 billion fraud that led to the implosion of the once high-flying FTX crypto exchange. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of U.S. District Court in Manhattan said that he believed Ms. Ellison was genuinely remorseful and that her cooperation with the government had been substantial. But given the severity of the fraud, he added, he could not give her a “‘get out of jail free’ card.” Ms. Ellison is set to report to a minimum security prison in the Boston area by around Nov. 7, almost exactly two years after FTX collapsed. Soon after the downfall of FTX in 2022, Ms. Ellison, who was Mr. Bankman-Fried’s on-and-off girlfriend, pleaded guilty to conspiring with him to steal $8 billion in savings that customers had deposited on the exchange. She became a crucial witness for the prosecution, testifying against Mr. Bankman-Fried at a trial last year that ended in his conviction on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. Wearing a dark jacket over a mauve-colored dress, Ms. Ellison, 29, fought back tears as she told Judge Kaplan that she was sorry for all the pain she had caused to the customers and employees of FTX, as well as her family and friends. “Not a day goes by that I don’t think of the people I hurt,” Ms. Ellison said before she was sentenced, with her parents and two sisters in the courtroom. “I am deeply ashamed of what I have done.” Ms. Ellison was one of three top executives who pleaded guilty and agreed to work with prosecutors to convict Mr. Bankman-Fried. The other two executives, Gary Wang and Nishad Singh, are set to be sentenced this fall. A fourth executive, Ryan Salame, who pleaded guilty but did not testify against Mr. Bankman-Fried, was sentenced in May to seven and a half years in prison. Mr. Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year prison term at a federal jail in Brooklyn and has filed an appeal to overturn his conviction, arguing that Judge Kaplan was biased against him. Prosecutors did not recommend a specific sentence for Ms. Ellison, but they filed a memo to Judge Kaplan praising her “exemplary” cooperation with the government. Her lawyers requested that she serve no prison time. “I have seen a lot of cooperators. I have never seen one like Ms. Ellison,” Judge Kaplan said before announcing the sentence. “What she said on the stand was very incriminating of herself, and she pulled no punches about it.” He emphasized that she was far less culpable in FTX’s collapse than Mr. Bankman-Fried. “She cooperated and he denied the whole thing,” he said. Just two years ago, Ms. Ellison was a powerful but relatively low-profile crypto executive, overseeing Mr. Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund, Alameda Research. She and Mr. Bankman-Fried had secretly dated for years, and she followed him around the world — from Berkeley, Calif., to Hong Kong to the Bahamas — as he built a crypto empire. Image Ms. Ellison arriving at court for her sentencing. The judge called her “genuinely remorseful.” Credit... Karsten Moran for The New York Times The relationship was often toxic, Ms. Ellison’s lawyer wrote in a memo to Judge Kaplan. Mr. Bankman-Fried would shower her with attention, and then ignore her. He insisted on keeping the liaison secret, the lawyers said, and had told Ms. Ellison that he didn’t want to be seen in public with her. Mr. Bankman-Fried also pushed her to take Adderall so that she could work longer hours, the memo said. At the sentencing, Ms. Ellison’s lawyer, Anjan Sahni, said she was a good person who should have walked away from Mr. Bankman-Fried and never participated in the fraud at FTX. But she couldn’t, he said, because her personal and professional lives had come to revolve around him. “Caroline should have left,” Mr. Sahni told Judge Kaplan. “Every day she profoundly regrets her decision not to.” Ms. Ellison was thrust into the spotlight when FTX and Alameda collapsed in November 2022, after a run on deposits exposed an $8 billion hole in the crypto exchange’s accounts. Soon federal prosecutors charged Mr. Bankman-Fried with fraud, saying that he had transferred billions of dollars from FTX to Alameda, and then used the money to make venture investments, political contributions and other lavish purchases. Ms. Ellison pleaded guilty to participating in Mr. Bankman-Fried’s conspiracy. She became a subject of internet fascination and was mobbed by photographers when she showed up at federal court in Manhattan to testify against Mr. Bankman-Fried during his trial. “The government cannot think of another cooperating witness in recent history who has received a greater level of attention and harassment,” the prosecutors wrote in their memo to Judge Kaplan. Behind the scenes, Ms. Ellison was crucial to helping the prosecutors build their case against Mr. Bankman-Fried. She combed through FTX’s records to help identify a spreadsheet that prosecutors presented at the trial as evidence that Mr. Bankman-Fried had lied to his business partners. And over nearly three days on the witness stand, Ms. Ellison delivered some of the trial’s most emotionally raw testimony, recounting in minute detail how Mr. Bankman-Fried had orchestrated the fraud that brought down FTX. Holding back tears, she also described the dramatic final days of the company and said she had felt a sense of relief when the scheme finally unraveled. Judge Kaplan called Ms. Ellison “genuinely remorseful” and said he couldn’t remember a single time that she had contradicted herself or offered inconsistent testimony. But Mr. Bankman-Fried was her “kryptonite,” he said. “You were vulnerable, and you were exploited.” Ms. Ellison’s sentence was harsher than many legal experts had expected. The government had “telegraphed no jail time for her,” said John P. Fishwick Jr., a former U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia. “A two-year sentence will discourage future cooperators.” Ms. Ellison has also agreed to forfeit all the wealth she accumulated while working at FTX and to continue working with the government to recover funds for victims. Since her guilty plea, Ms. Ellison has struggled to find paying work, according to the memo her lawyers filed. At one point, the memo said, she had secured a position helping low-income families with their taxes, only to have the offer revoked after the employer realized who she was. In recent months, Ms. Ellison has collaborated on a math textbook with her parents, who both teach at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And she has written a novella set in Edwardian England that is “loosely based on her sister Kate’s imagined amorous exploits,” her mother, Sara Fisher Ellison, wrote in a letter to the court. Ms. Ellison has remained “calm and hard working and grateful,” despite the legal scrutiny, her mother wrote. “I, of course, notice that she is a smaller, sadder version of her former self, but her core qualities remain.” At the hearing, Ms. Ellison’s mother sat in the front row, holding hands with her husband, Glenn Ellison. After Judge Kaplan handed down the sentence, a court official cleared the courtroom of everyone but Ms. Ellison’s family. Then he brought them a box of tissues.

I wonder if that's precisely the sentiment that has been part of the reason the USA has become the country with the highest % of incarcerated people. I'm not an American, so I'm wondering if there's a cultural difference here that explains the different feelings / viewpoints. 2 years + owing money to the feds + not being able to get a job: this person will suffer the consequences for her action for the rest of her life. Whether it's fair or not (I'll get to that point later), it's a huge deterrence for commiting crimes, particularly for white collar crimes like this. Regarding the fairness of the punishment: I have zero feelings about this. The punishments should be chosen to make society work: deter future crimes, keep people that are harmful and hopefully help them change course. In this case, there's also providing incentives to cooperate. I don't need people to suffer for stuff. If it's needed somehow for society to work, them great, but I don't feel (as many in this thread seem to feel) that long periods of suffering is needed for some reason (to appease their sense of justice? God? The victims? All of the above?). And let's be clear: the suffering in higher levels of security prison in the USA is on a whole different scale. reply maxglute 32 minutes agoparentWhite collar criminals with magnitude more body bags are not getting long periods of suffering that poorly resourced petty criminals are.

We're trying to go back and remedy some of those absurd punishments but still, there is a stark and obvious unfairness here. And that sucks. All we can hope is that, going forward, we treat our more vulnerable groups with more dignity. But I agree, she shouldn't face harsher punishment. reply thegrim33 3 hours agorootparent> particularly poor and often black Americans, have gotten 20+ years for possession. Just wanted to point out how insincere/misleading of a statement that is. People in those \"locked up for 20 years for drugs\" circumstances universally all have decade long felonious records, have committed umpteen crimes, time after time after time, are on probation with strict requirements to not be involved in illegal activities, get yet another drug charge, and are finally given a harsh sentence after being given light sentences the last dozen times in a row. You present it as \"this normal, law abiding citizen, was caught with some drugs and just thrown in jail for 20 years\". Which is demonstrably not the case and is intentionally leaving out all the other details, which is really manipulative. You also leave out that the vast, vast, majority of that group that are caught with drugs are NOT thrown in jail for 20 years. reply consteval 2 hours agorootparent> universally all have decade long felonious records Not true at all, it depends on the state. In the south with a history of unfair justice for black Americans and \"tough on crime\" standards, you have two strike or three strike systems. And not just for felonies! And this doesn't even touch on perpetual imprisonment laws, which have a long history dating back to Jim Crow post-reconstruction south. > are NOT thrown in jail for 20 years The best way to not be thrown in jail for drug charges is to be white, lol. These laws are thinly veiled discrimination machines. It's not a coincidence that the drugs with the most iron hammer happen to be the drugs black Americans frequent. Again, this is changing now. We don't do this anymore. But go back to the 80s, the 90s, the early 2000s and this was very prolific, particularly in the south. reply FireBeyond 2 hours agorootparentprev> People in those \"locked up for 20 years for drugs\" circumstances universally all have decade long felonious records, have committed umpteen crimes, time after time after time, are on probation with strict requirements to not be involved in illegal activities, get yet another drug charge, and are finally given a harsh sentence after being given light sentences the last dozen times in a row. That's... not accurate. Yes, there are those people. And then there's Florida, and its two strike law. Which within hours of being enacted, caused a woman who was arrested for stealing a package of undershirts from Walmart to 15 years in prison - she had a couple of misdemeanor arrests prior. But if stealing underwear (and Walmart underwear, not La Perla) twice can get you 15 years jail, that's a long way from your \"they all have decades of felonies, all have violated probation\" absolutism. Another example was someone who was arrested for LSD possession after a Grateful Dead concert, released. Was arrested 3 years later for marijuana possession, put on probation. Several years later arrested for LSD possession, and federally sentenced to life in prison without parole at the age of 24, only being released after President Obama granted clemency just before his 50th birthday. reply bryanlarsen 59 minutes agorootparentprev> This is why it's a hard pill to swallow.

I don't know what exactly you mean by this, but maybe we should be an evolved and caring society and let everyone out of jail and prison because punishment is cruel. but \"people who do bad things should just be crushed\" is a key element. Let's be clear that someone who stole 11 billion dollars going away for 2 years is not \"being crushed\".

Minimum-security of course. reply throwup238 20 hours agorootparentprevFederal minimum security prisons don't have fences surrounding the prison so the only thing keeping prisoners from \"escaping\" is the extra five years that'd be added to their sentence. They have far fewer guards and the prisoners live in dormitory style quarters so it's far more like adult summer camp than prison (commonly referred to as \"Club Fed\"). Instead of having services on site they'll often drive the prisoners to a local dentist or doctor, etc. As they get closer to release or if their sentences are short enough, prisoners can even get work release which allows them to leave the prison during the day to work at a regular job. (I think the GP is confusing work release and parole - the Federal system does have work release) reply bryanrasmussen 20 hours agorootparentprevIf you're in Western Europe a minimum security federal facility is probably closer to your understanding of a prison than an American's understanding. Hence Americans describe it as a camp, whereas if you looked at it you might say hey, that's a prison. reply stackskipton 20 hours agorootparentprevIt's a prison but it's generally much more open.

No one’s going to kill a snitch in minimum security, worst case scenario is that they’ll be outcasts and get into a fight occasionally. The majority of prisoners are in prison because of a plea deal, not a jury verdict, so they often have to snitch on their accomplices as part of the plea deal (with severe consequences for lying and omissions). In practice the traditional prisoner’s dilemma usually plays out with everyone snitching on each other and everyone getting a deal because the prosecutor doesn’t want to waste time and money on a trial. reply euroderf 3 hours agorootparent> In practice the traditional prisoner’s dilemma usually plays out with everyone snitching on each other and everyone getting a deal because the prosecutor doesn’t want to waste time and money on a trial.

There are actually fewer prison jobs than prisoners willing to work. So in nearly every case being able to have a job while in prison is actually a privilege for the prisoners. One that can be taken away if they get in trouble. There's a lot of reform we should make with relation to prison jobs including raising wages and introducing relevant skills. But criticisms of it being slave labor are misleading. Forced labor is legal in the US and there are isolated cases of it happening but you're talking about a fraction of a percent of all prisoners. reply consteval 5 hours agorootparent> But criticisms of it being slave labor are misleading It depends. In Georgia on work release, for instance, it pretty much is slavery. You're forced into a minimum number of hours and get less than minimum wage. You're forced to take a job - not having one isn't an option. Because you have close to 0 chance of getting parole without a job. And when you sentence people 20+ years for possession and such, you need parole. Not to mention there's also indefinite imprisonment - meaning you're locked away until you get parole. These prisoners don't work in the prison, they typically work in food establishments like McDonald's. Even with the privilege and getting a job and having good behavior, parole is shockingly low - just 8% for nonviolent offenders. So the prisoners are trapped, coerced to work for many years to prove themselves and hope for a chance to get parole. All while they're making a couple dollars an hour, maybe, and the prison keeps half their wages. Failure to work or problems at work result in the loss of \"good time\".

Personal enrichment was the motive for the fraud, plain and simple. He even admitted the whole 'effective altruism' was a farce to get on the good side of the progressive elite and their media, as he was also funneling money to republicans but more discretely all for the same reasons: political connections. And it worked given the initial portrait left wing media made of him, \"someone who got way over his head\", they gave him the benefit of the doubt for a long time and he thought he could roll with that image which would get him off the hook... while he was intimidating his co-defendants by releasing personal informations about them... do you also deem the latter just \"fun\"? reply s1artibartfast 12 hours agorootparentI never said anything was \"just fun\".

Acceptance of responsibility is a thing. reply jmyeet 19 hours agoprevI follow a bunch of longtime lawyers who have a lot to say about how prosecutions work in practice and it's pretty interesting. Here's what I've learned: 1. The Federal conviction rate is ~99%. Federal prosecutors don't bring charges when they aren't going to win; 2. Most prosecutions end in plea deals before they get to trial. In fact, the threat of a heavy sentence at trial is used to extract a plea deal because trials are expensive. If every defendant went to trial the entire justice system would collapse; 4. You can never predict what a jury will do or what they will focus on. It's a huge gamble but it favors the prosecution. Juries want to convict, generally; 5. In Federal court, you want to get past the trial phase and into the sentencing phase. That's where the defendant can do a lot to get a lesser sentence. In state court, it's the opposite; 6. Judges and prosecturos are aligned on their goals. Not for prosecution, necessarily. Both don't want to be overturned on appeal; 7. Appeals are a deeply unfair and drawn out process. This can be abused. If you followed the YSL trial at all, you saw the judge essentially coerce testimony and refuse to disclose the details to the defense saying there was a record that would be preserved for an appeal. That judge ultimately got removed from the case but you should know that an appeal is a much higher burden to meet than anything at trial; 8. Prosecutors want a slam dunk case. The best way is to a cooperating witness. The first person to flip, gets the best deal. So Ellison got a sweetheart deal because she immediately flipped besides arguably being the main person responsible for losing billions of dollars. Yes, SBF allowed her access to custodial funds and for that alone he deserves to go to prison. Judges have a lot of discretion with sentencing despite their being sentencing guidelines. It's one area where a judge's biases can really show up when similar defendants can get wildly different sentences for the same crime. 2 years does seem pretty light given the gravity of the fraud, even with being a cooperating witness. Her lawyer is alrgely responsible for that, I would guess by gaming the sentencing process. Still, I imagine there was some belief that she was simply naive or she got caught up in the fraud and wasn't really responsible. reply sofixa 9 hours agoparent> 2.

Caroline was nominally the CEO of Alameda but she clearly was not the one in charge of the corporate empire, and if she was masterminding the fraud she did a very poor job of monetizing it.

You have the right, but you are severely punished if you dare exercise it. This is 'just' (as in keeping with justice) because it helps reduce the strain on our justice system that is not designed and can in no way handle a non-trivial amount of cases actually going to trial and people exercising their rights. Just like companies can no longer function without people giving up their rights and requiring binding arbitration, our justice system would not be able to function if people didn't give up their right to trial. The USA used to make fun of China because it has enshrined rights in it's constitution that, in practice, are not available or not applicable in actual daily life. I have free speech, but not where people would hear it. I have the right to a trial, but with it comes actuality the government will change my sentence to near life (or the portion of life that has any quality to it) if I dare avail myself of that right. How many people close to you will die if you dare take your case to trial and get a trial tax imposed? How much of your childrens' lives will you miss? How long will they suffer without you earning money to support them? Or, will you miss out on the child rearing years completely when one starts a family because of the lengthy trial tax? Best to take the plea. There's a reason the Feds conviction rate is 95%, it's the explicit threat/coercion that is the trial tax. Remember, the longer the sentence, the rougher the prison you are sent to as well, because your security rating is heavily based on remaining sentence length. So it's not just a threat of length, but also the level of violence you will be subjected to during imprisonment. Ironically, you have to testify that you were not coerced, to the judge, in court, to get out of having the trial tax imposed when you take your plea, when the very same judge knows of and is the person who applies the trial tax. reply datavirtue 18 hours agorootparentBeing guilty and having no reasonable out, while using the justic system procedures as a hail Mary so that you might escape on a technicality should be punished.

If they can prove beyond a reasonable doubt what I said was a lie, why does it matter what I said? They already know the truth. If they don't independently know what I said was a lie, how can they prove I lied? And if this is somehow something I missed, why does the national security advisor get a pardon?

This is not justice. reply mandevil 17 hours agorootparentSo there are two different things here that you are conflating: the specific pardoning of Michael Flynn and whether lying to a federal agent should be a crime. Lying to a federal agent is a crime because the Government wants to make it easy to investigate crimes. Hence, lying to them being a crime. You are wasting the taxpayers money by mis-directing the investigators who represent us and are supposed to be investigating crime. That seems reasonable to me, though I did spend some time working as a contractor for the FBI, so I might have incorporated their views too much. Michael Flynn's case in particular was a travesty because of the pardon power, a weird old legacy of monarchy brought over into our system by people who didn't really think it through, like a lot of weird, arcane corners of the US government. Pardons in general I think we would be better off without.

The US has more people in prison per capita than any other developed country by a wide, wide, wide margin, largely in part because of the judicial system's willingness to hand down sentences for relatively minor crimes that would be seen as insane in most other countries. For what she was charged with, two years is probably the bare minimum that was available at sentencing given the constraint of \"must serve jail time\". Meanwhile in Germany, the sentence range for human trafficking is 6 months to a max of 5 years. Stealing a child is also max 5 years (if you're not intending to sell it). The contrast is pretty stark. reply beaglesss 18 hours agorootparentBasically every free person in the US can get a 26,000 lb truck or a semi auto rifle in under an hour. Germany has taken the other approach and implemented policies to make their country closer to a prison with all kind of harsher regulations, then reducing prison time. There are merits to be found in either approach. reply s1artibartfast 17 hours agorootparentgenuinely interesting thought. I haven't decided if it carries any water, but interesting. Why would harsher penalties be required in a place where individuals have more capability to do harm? That seems to place a lot of faith in a linear efficacy of deterrence reply eurleif 17 hours agorootparentIncapacitation. reply magic_man 17 hours agorootparentprevAfter she comes out she can write a book maybe sell movie right etc and she will be ok. Look at Anna Delvey or Jordan Belfort. Maybe she hid some crypto. reply borroka 19 hours agorootparentprevBut a lighter sentence could, for example, range from no jail time to rates of less than 100 percent of the expected sentence in the case of non-cooperation. The prosecutor's recommendation of no jail time is frankly disappointing. She may not have been the main offender, but she committed the crimes. What would her sentence have been if she did not cooperate (and suppose other did or there was enough evidence anyway)? Fifteen+ years? Two years is not a picnic, but given the alternative, it looks like it is. reply djur 19 hours agorootparentThe prosecutor didn't recommend no jail time. Ellison's lawyers did. Also, in addition to jail time, she's going to owe a huge sum of money. The feds are going to have a claim on any money she makes for the rest of her life. For better or worse (I think a little of both), long max sentences exist in the US criminal justice system to allow rewarding cooperators and to threaten non-cooperators alike. reply voxic11 19 hours agorootparentprev> Prosecutors did not recommend a specific sentence for Ms. Ellison It was her lawyers that asked for no jail time. Not the prosecutors. reply borroka 19 hours agorootparentAccording to the article I read (CNBC), \"The prison term was significantly stiffer than the recommendation by the federal Probation Department that Judge Lewis Kaplan sentence Ellison, who had run the hedge fund Alameda Research, to three years of supervised release, with no time at all behind bars\". In the same article, \"Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon urged Kaplan for leniency\". It seems to me, as prosecutors and Probation Dept talk to each other, that all, except Kaplan, agreed on no prison time for Ellison. reply AlbertCory 19 hours agorootparentprev> The prosecutor's recommendation of no jail time is frankly disappointing It could have been disingenuous. Maybe they knew the judge wouldn't go for it. As for her not cooperating: would you rather SBF skate free? I don't know what the case against SBF would have looked like without her, and I suspect you don't, either. reply borroka 19 hours agorootparentYou suspect well, I do not. Let me ask you another question for which you and I do not know the answer. Since she got 2 years in prison, she was not promised (i.e. she did not sign any binding agreement with the prosecutor, beyond \"we will do our best to get you a lenient sentence\") not to go to prison. Why then not a sentence of 5, 10, 15 years in prison? reply s1artibartfast 17 hours agorootparentWhy not just nail her to the wall after the fact? Is integrity of the prosecutor a valid answer? reply AlbertCory 17 hours agorootparentIn almost any profession, your word is all you have. Welsh on someone, and no one will trust you anymore. reply borroka 12 hours agorootparentI did not say or believe that the prosecutor lied or they should renege on their word, far from it. I said that if she got two years, it means that the agreement Ellison-DA was not for no prison time in exchange for cooperation. Thus I asked why two years and not five or ten of whatever time under the expected sentence time in case of no cooperation. reply AlbertCory 58 minutes agorootparentRead who I was replying to (which was not you). They said, \"Is integrity of the prosecutor a valid answer?\" Yes it is. reply s1artibartfast 12 hours agorootparentprevThe prosecutor doesn't pick a time, and cant promise it. The judge selects the sentence. This judge thought 2 years was reasonable after the fact, and was not bound to it. reply AlbertCory 19 hours agorootparentprevI don't know how that all plays out, to be perfectly honest. reply xwowsersx 19 hours agorootparentprevNo, because when prosecutors offer a light sentence to a secondary criminal in a conspiracy, it's usually a strategic decision to secure cooperation in prosecuting the main target. It wouldn't make sense that a lighter sentence for an accomplice/secondary sets a precedent for a principal actor and Diddy is the principal actor in his case, AFAIK. (I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with any of this, just saying this is the internally consistent approach.) reply pessimizer 20 hours agorootparentprevWe want to bribe criminals to betray each other. The people who they are betraying could do anything up to killing them to prevent this, and we have to compete with that. The world gets zero benefit to imprisoning this woman indefinitely, it in fact costs money, and if the government had to prove their case against her without her cooperation, it would just cost even more money. Not letting a fully-cooperating sucker like her off is the opposite of a deterrent to crime. It's telling low-level people who are involved in crimes that it's better to keep quiet. We want to encourage them to betray. I hope when she gets out she becomes a celebrity, and it encourages other young people to decide to whistleblow or turn snitch on the scammy companies they work for. reply vkou 18 hours agorootparent> The world gets zero benefit to imprisoning this woman indefinitely What sorts of people does the world benefit from imprisoning indefinitely, and where on the spectrum does, say, being a serial and unrepentant shoplifter, stealing mid-four figures sums compare to being a financial criminal stealing mid-eight-figure sums? She wasn't a 'low level whistleblower', she was one step below the ringleader, and only came clean after the whole thing went tits up and she was staring down two decades in federal. If you're looking for heroes and whistleblowers, I don't think there were any in that whole organization. Just rats turning on eachother once the trap snapped shut around them. reply s1artibartfast 17 hours agorootparentI think a serial shoplifter or thief is worse. It is a bigger problem for me personally, and impacts far more people. Therefore I think it deserves harsher penalties. reply vkou 16 hours agorootparentA thief will steal from a few stores. A fraudster of that magnitude steals from anywhere between thousands to millions of people. reply s1artibartfast 12 hours agorootparentThere is the magnitude of an individual and the magnitude of the summer for each problem. reply sharkjacobs 19 hours agoprev> In recent months, Ms. Ellison has collaborated on a math textbook with her parents, who both teach at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And she has written a novella set in Edwardian England that is “loosely based on her sister Kate’s imagined amorous exploits,” her mother, Sara Fisher Ellison, wrote in a letter to the court. What strange sad details. And absolutely baffling inclusions in this article and in this court case, compared to something like > Since her guilty plea, Ms. Ellison has struggled to find paying work, according to the memo her lawyers filed. At one point, the memo said, she had secured a position helping low-income families with their taxes, only to have the offer revoked after the employer realized who she was. which has an obvious angle and story it's trying to sell reply s1artibartfast 17 hours agoparentFrom the excerpts, I find the former far more humanizing and interesting. The second quote could describe the situation of just about any criminal or felon in the US. The former made me imagine a talented and interesting person I would like to have at a dinner party.

She would have gone away for longer, but she put effort into trying to correct her bad decisions. I do not like the US judicial system and also I think this particular example is pretty reasonable. reply jwnin 18 hours agoparentprevWikipedia states FTX had 300 employees total. How many were in the inner circle? SBF: pled not guilty, 25 years. Ryan Salame, co-CEO: pled guilty, 90 months. Gary Wang & Nishad Singh, co-founder & engineering director: pled guilty, awaiting sentencing later this year. Caroline Ellison, Alameda CEO: guilty, two years.

Very surprised that would see any support here. reply holografix 19 hours agoprevnext [4 more] [flagged] maxbond 16 hours agoparentYes, she would absolutely have gotten a greatly reduced sentence if she had been a man who immediately turned state's witness, gave them everything they wanted, and testified in court. SBF played himself every step of the way. He tried to win in the court of public opinion rather than the court of law, leaking Ellison's diary to the press, blogging on Substack, talking to reporters any time they called, flaunting the judge's orders, etc. He also clumsily tried to tamper with witnesses. SBF got 25 years because he instigated the scheme, never fessed up, and did everything a lawyer would tell you not to do. Ellison immediately made a deal with prosecutors, cooperated, testified, et cetera. While SBF was digging his hole deeper, she was climbing out of hers. And though she carried out the scheme, she wasn't the primary instigator (and there is lots of testimony, emails, etc to corroborate this). People who immediately flip and cooperate heavily get good deals. That's just how these things work. Conversely, SBF did everything you could do to get yourself a longer sentence. It has absolutely nothing to do with Ellison being a woman. I've been following this story closely, and this sentencing came as no surprise. To be honest, if you were surprised - then you probably weren't following. Refer to the article for quotes from Judge Kaplan about her \"exemplary\" cooperation, and consider whether you were too quick to jump to the conclusion she received special treatment because of her gender. reply alvah 17 hours agoparentprevDownvotes are inevitable, many people don't like the truth. The statistics showing lighter sentences for women are a quick Google away though... reply w0de0 19 minutes agorootparentWomen also, statistically, commit fewer crimes and far fewer violent crimes. One might reasonably suppose that the statistical output matches the input. (I would also be unsurprised if they were more likely to cooperate, and to plead guilty.)
