There really seems to be no loophole or workaround despite there being huge incentive for there to be one. Every time I click an “Unsubscribe” link in an email (it seems like they’re forced to say “Unsubscribe” and not use weasel words to hide the link) I’m either immediately unsubscribed from the person who sent me the email, or I’m taken to a page which seemingly MUST have a “remove me from all emails” option. The level of compliance (and they can’t even do malicious compliance!) with this is absurd. If these new rules work anything like that, they’ll be awesome. Clearly regulating behavior like this is indeed possible. reply andrewla 3 minutes agoparentThe big difference here is that this was created by an act of Congress, not the result of a regulatory body straining at the limits of its remit. That makes it much more likely to survive administration changes or court challenges. Even now the CAN-SPAM act feels outdated -- I do like the unsubscribe button, but I would like to see email verification made explicitly required. That in order to start emailing you, you need to send an initial engagement email saying that the organization wants to start emailing you, and requiring you to actively opt-in to emails rather than just start sending them. This would both cut down on marketing spam as well as mistaken email addresses. Most reputable websites do email verification where you have to enter a code or click on a link, but I have a surprising number of emails that get sent to me even though I am not the person the emails were aimed at. reply justinpombrio 2 hours agoparentprevUnsubscribe links are a fantastic regulation, but there is a workaround. I must have received at least a dozen emails from Brown after graduating despite unsubscribing to every email they sent. The trouble is they're endlessly creative about the lists they put you on. I'd get one email from \"Alumni Connections\" and then another from \"Faculty Spotlight\" and then another from \"Global Outreach\" and then another from \"Event Invitations, 2023 series\". I'm making those names up because I forget exactly what they were called, but you get the idea. I hope this was in violation of the regulation: surely you can't invent a new mailing list that didn't used to exist, add me to it, and require me to unsubscribe from it individually. They finally stopped after I sent them an angry email. reply ksd482 1 hour agorootparentWhat I have noticed companies do is resume emails after a year or so. They probably think people would forget about unsubscribing them after a year, and for the most part they are right. If I catch any of these email lists not respecting my unsubscribing, I immediately mark them as \"spam\". Gmail then doesn't send them to my inbox anymore. I don't think just one person marking them as spam hurts them, but at least I feel gratified and my ego is satisfied. reply inetknght 1 hour agorootparent> I immediately mark them as \"spam\". Ahh yes, the feel-good response that Google gives you without doing anything substantial to prevent spam from reaching you in the future. reply maccard 47 minutes agorootparentMy experience with the spam button is 1) they never ever go into my inbox again if they do keep sending, and 2) as someone who has had emails marked as spam (from people who actively clicked the sign up to my newsletter button) your ability to send email gets neutered pretty quickly. What is your experience? reply inetknght 27 minutes agorootparent> What is your experience? Reporting spam does not block the email from being received by my client -- it only blocks the mail from being seen in the inbox, but it still shows up in the spam box. I don't send mail that gets reported as spam in the first place. Or, if it does, then I haven't been meaningfully affected because I can still send and receive the email I want to. reply maccard 0 minutes agorootparentI’m not sure what you expect to happen? > I don't send mail that gets reported as spam in the first place. I ran a newsletter where people had to opt in to receiving it. It was announce news for a video game. You only ended up on this list if you entered your email, clicked join list, and then clicked the link in the email we sent to you to confirm subscription. We had a big unsubscribe button at the very top of the email. We still regularly got people who hit report spam on us, presumably as a way of saying g they didn’t want the email anymore. kemitche 57 minutes agorootparentprevWhat makes you say that? In my experience, the spam button works fantastically. There is a gym of some kind that has me on their mailing list, refuses to honor unsubscribe, and sends me probably 2-6 emails a month. They've been doing this for years, but Google correctly gets every single one into spam because I marked one (several?) as spam years ago. Most, if not all, political junk email also ends up in my spam folder after judicious use of the spam button a few years ago. reply inetknght 21 minutes agorootparent> They've been doing this for years, but Google correctly gets every single one into spam because I marked one (several?) as spam years ago.

Like the unsubscribe link simply fails to work; nothing happens when you click on it. reply doctorpangloss 1 hour agorootparentprevInventing a new mailing list and adding you to it is exactly the workaround. Anyway, email delivery is regulated by Microsoft and Google. reply hnburnsy 1 hour agoparentprev>There really seems to be no loophole or workaround despite there being huge incentive for there to be one. Every time I click an “Unsubscribe” link in an email... The loophole is that companies now claim that the email is 'service' related as part of your 'account relationship' so you cannot unsubscribe at all, even though it clearly is for marketing and promotion. reply maccard 46 minutes agorootparentThat’s what the report spam button is for. reply nvr219 15 minutes agorootparentAnd what masked emails are for. I use this with fastmail and my own domain, it’s amazing. reply digging 2 hours agoparentprevI'm super appreciative of what we have, but there's absolutely issues. CAN-SPAM specifies that the link must be clearly marked and suggests using CSS to do so, but the link is still always going to be at the bottom of the email in the smallest font used. It only matters for those of us who know to look for it; many people just have to live with the spam because they don't know it's easy to unsubscribe. Sometimes it's not even going to be underlined or distinguished at all (that may be a violation actually but I'm not going to take them to court over it). There's other dark patterns too, like certain unsubscribe pages requiring you to type/paste your email in to actually complete the process. That is 100% intentional friction, like github making you type the name of a repo into the deletion form. It should also be illegal for unsubscribing. reply lovethevoid 2 hours agorootparentYou don't have to take them to court over it, but you can report them. Also most clients provide an unsubscribe button at the top too. reply nvr219 14 minutes agoparentprevThe best part about requiring them to use the word “unsubscribe” is I can do this email rule: If an email says “unsubscribe” in it, move it to “says-unsubscribe” folder. I look at that email once a week for the false positives. Huge QoL increase. reply mattgreenrocks 5 minutes agorootparentThis is brilliant. You can shunt all the brand email into a single folder. reply inetknght 1 hour agoparentprev> I often think about how unreasonably great the regulations around “Unsubscribe” links in emails are. The sheer number of comments that think the state of \"unsubscribe\" is good is... saddening. I should not have to click a link to \"unsubscribe\" from something that I did not subscribe to.

Imagine how much worse things would be if legit businesses had no reason to make it easy to unsubscribe in such a consistent way like we do today. That other problems also exist doesn't mean this solution for this thing isn't good. reply vel0city 1 hour agorootparentprevSo what, people should only be able to email you if you've previously emailed them? How am I supposed to know who I'm allowed to email? reply inetknght 38 minutes agorootparent> So what, people should only be able to email you if you've previously emailed them? No, people should be able to email me as they would normally. I should be able to block senders, or entire domains. To use a direct example: if I decide that substack is shit because they subscribe people without consent (which is exactly true), then I should be able to block all things from substack and not just a single email address from the domain. If the spammer is operating within the continental US (or any other country with a reasonable court system), then the spammer should be legally and monetarily liable for the time and money wasted. Everything from the second it takes my server to receive the message, to the second it takes to transmit to my email client, to the multiple seconds it takes me to read the headline and/or body, and the time it takes to press the block button -- the energy costs, the hardware cost, the bandwidth cost, my own time's cost, and the cost of lost confidence in the safety of the internet (just as a thief in your home makes you lose confidence in the safety of your neighborhood) -- all of it should be legally and monetarily liable. So when that shit substack email puts on a SendGrid or Mailchimp facade, or goes through some Cloudflare or CloudFront or whatever CDN, those \"businesses\" also get blocked and sued into oblivion because fuck any \"business\" that doesn't want to own the relationship with their customer, and fuck any \"business\" whose customer is not the person they're emailing. So... you want to send me an email? Cool! I hope you will agree that it's legitimate *and wanted*. Because if it's not then I should be able to take you, or your business, to court for wasting my time (and time is money) -- and win on that ground alone. tl;dr: Why do I have such a stark view on this, many might ask? Well let me put it simply: \"legitimate\" spam is indistinguishable from targeted phishing. So that \"unsubscribe\" link that people so proudly claim is a great solution? Clicking it does not improve the spam situation and does increase vulnerability to malicious actors. I'm not going to click on that because it doesn't go anywhere that I recognize and can verify. That \"unsubscribe\" link is worse than a real solution because it's only theatre. reply lazyasciiart 31 minutes agorootparent> then the spammer should be legally and monetarily liable for the time and money wasted You might want to start by addressing physical mail, or advertising billboards, if you want to radically overhaul some of the fundamentals of society. reply inetknght 24 minutes agorootparent> You might want to start by addressing physical mail, or advertising billboards, if you want to radically overhaul some of the fundamentals of society.

It seems rare such acts would pass these days without making substantial compromises for advertisers. Which if it were up to them, we would still be looking for a tiny unsubscribe link at the very bottom in a font color that matches the background. reply IggleSniggle 41 minutes agorootparentWait wait, are you saying you don't need to do that? You and I live in different worlds reply itsdrewmiller 1 hour agoparentprevI don’t think regulation has much to do with their excellence at all - it’s largely ESPs competing to provide a better mailbox experience and using things like that and spf/dkim/dmarc conformance to reduce spam. reply nijave 1 hour agoparentprevThere is additional incentive here. Companies that make it hard to unsubscribe risk being reported as spam which impacts their deliverability. It's in company's best interest to allow a straight forward opt out or risk getting blocked. reply paradox460 1 hour agoparentprevUntil the link tries to redirect through their click tracking service, and is blocked by my firewall. Really dislike that Imo it should be a single header that points to a url that accepts a post payload. Email clients could then surface the link reply Ciunkos 27 minutes agorootparentThere is already a header for that: List-Unsubscribe with the URL, and the List-Unsubscribe-Post to support one-click unsubscribes, which Google and Yahoo began enforcing for bulk senders in February this year. reply afh1 1 hour agoparentprevIn my experience \"unsubscribe\" emails often do not work at all.

Except it clearly works and I've unsubscribed from 99% of emails without ever going to their site? reply danaris 1 hour agoparentprevUnfortunately, it's not foolproof. During the ~20 years that my predecessor in my current job worked in it, it gradually evolved from being primarily a hardware position with a little software development to primarily a software position with a little hardware building. My moderate expertise with electronic hardware helped get me the job, but then I basically never had to use it in the ~15 years I've been here. I still get multiple emails from Electronic Design daily. No amount of attempting to unsubscribe stops them. I've blocked multiple sending email addresses; they rotate them fairly frequently. It's possible I could report them for this (I haven't researched it), but since I think my spam filter has missed maybe 1-2 emails in all that time, it tends not to be worth it. reply Bjartr 1 hour agorootparentReport them here https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/ The FAQ confirms this is the correct place to report email spam https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/faq reply yawaramin 2 hours agoparentprevUh, email unsubscribe links started out great but are now really bad unfortunately :'-( The mailers do all sorts of tricks to make it really difficult to ubsubscribe. Eg, you think you subscribed to one newsletter but they actually subscribe you to many different actual subscriptions with your email address, and give them slightly different names, like 'XYZ News', 'XYZ Updates', 'Stay in touch with XYZ'. Then you are forced to unsubscribe from each of these one by one, and you don't even know if you got them all; there could be more that they could spring on you later. There are now email unsubscribe services, but they don't really work either: https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-email-unsubs... reply TheAceOfHearts 3 hours agoprevIt would be great to see the FTC go against predatory subscription services like Adobe. I'm fuzzy on the exact details, but I think they promoted a yearly subscription that was meant to look like a monthly subscription, where if you cancelled early they would charge you an exorbitant cancellation fee. I'm not sure how these new rules affect them. One recent idea I've had is that many online subscription services should automatically pause if you stop using it. For example: if I go a full monthly billing cycle without watching Netflix then my subscription should automatically pause and allow me to resume it next time I log-in. There's a ton of money that gets siphoned off to parasitic companies just because people forget to cancel their subscriptions or because they're too busy dealing with life. It might not be viable for all companies, but there's definitely a lot of services where such a thing would be possible, given the huge number of customer analytics they collect. Maybe give people the option to disable such a pause feature if they're really determined to keep paying for a service. But a default where subscriptions automatically pause if you're not using them makes a lot of sense from a user perspective. Of course businesses would probably hate such a ruling because it means they can't scam as much easy money. reply cortesoft 3 hours agoparentMan, I remember when Amazon Prime first started, I signed up for the free trial to get free shipping on something. Of course, I forgot about it and didn’t cancel, but then I got an email from Amazon saying, “hey, you didn’t cancel your prime subscription but you also haven’t used it at all, so we are going to not charge you and cancel it for now. Here is how you easily restart your subscription if you end up needing it” It was such a wonderful feeling that clearly impacted me so much I remember it some 20 years later. I gained SO MUCH loyalty to Amazon after that, and sure enough, I restarted my prime subscription a bit later when I got a better job and started ordering more stuff. They made so much more money off me because they sacrificed those few dollars for one month of my subscription fee to show me they weren’t just trying to make me forget to cancel. Amazon today would never do that, of course, but man I think more companies should if they want long term, loyal, customers. reply rootusrootus 1 hour agorootparentEarly Amazon was pro-customer in a way that I think most people have forgotten. Maybe that was always the strategy? They were losing money for years, and maybe that was investing in the company, or maybe it was allowing really large losses to keep customers happy, planning all along to eventually clamp down when people were addicted. And here we are. Their return rate is still pretty terrible, IIRC. I bet they are trying to cut that down. I still see a lot (and I mean a LOT) of obvious Amazon returns in the line at the UPS store, and some of them are quite egregious (I stood behind a lady for 5 solid minutes a couple weeks ago and she was pulling return after return out of a big bag). Maybe Amazon will start firing those customers. reply kulahan 3 minutes agorootparentI think it's more a matter of companies just having different focuses. If you're wondering how to grow your userbase, you're thinking fundamentally differently than if you have an established one and are wondering how to monetize them. reply rtkwe 51 minutes agorootparentprevThe way Amazon was \"losing money\" in the early years was all intense reinvestment though so they could at any point pretty easily tune their profit making by turning down the ridiculous amount of warehouses they were building for one example. reply ssaannmmaann 2 hours agorootparentprevToday's Amazon is doing it's very best to get rid of customers like you and me!

When you subscribe there are three prices given- Monthly, Annual paid monthly, and Annual prepaid. The Annual paid monthly very clearly indicates that there is a fee if you cancel after 14 days. The annual paid monthly is some 33% less expensive than monthly, with the downside that you're committing for a year, or to pay a termination fee if you cancel early. https://imgur.com/a/ldhiEtf This has been extremely clear for years. Like you have to be blind to not see a \"Monthly\" that costs much more at the top, then one called \"Annual billed monthly\" and not have paused to do some diligence. Adobe does a lot of shady stuff, but on this topic we seem to hear the most from careless, thoughtless, or selfish people who think they figured out how to game the system. Kind of like the \"my laptop got stolen out of my car and it had the only copy of all of my important documents and the doctoral thesis I've been working on for seven years\" stories, at some point we have to not be so naive with people's foolishness. reply bongodongobob 15 minutes agorootparentIn addition, when I got bit by this last year trying to cancel, they waived the fee and gave me a year's worth of premium for free. reply tomxor 13 minutes agoparentprev> One recent idea I've had is that many online subscription services should automatically pause if you stop using it Amazon got me on this multiple times for prime, now I always pay for delivery directly, because in the long run it's cheaper. The most recent incarnation of their cancel subscription page had such intentionally shitty UX that I thought I had cancelled, but there were more pages to click through.

I'm not sure how these new rules affect them. I don't think it's the same situation. What Adobe was doing was offering a yearly subscription, charged monthly. If you tried to cancel, it would ask for payment to either cover the rest of the sub or to cover the \"savings\" that the user had obtained by selecting an annual sub rather than a true monthly (can't remember what exactly it tried to charge). It was deceptive as hell, but it's probably not covered by this rule. reply megiddo 1 hour agorootparentI mean, maybe technically. But the \"its yearly with a cancellation fee\" was not qualified in the sales information on the sign-up page. Maybe it was in the fine print. Given that customers are quite used to a monthly fee is a monthly subscription model, it was disingenuous at best. Putting significant terms in the fine print doesn't exactly engender trust. reply llm_nerd 54 minutes agorootparenthttps://imgur.com/a/ldhiEtf There is no fine print. It is extremely clear and obvious. If you see a term called \"Annual paid monthly\", 33% less expensive than a monthly option right above, what possible other interpretation can someone have? reply askafriend 35 minutes agorootparentI'm glad you're bringing screenshots to the conversation because so often people just talk about what they feel without grounding it in anything. What the screenshot makes clear is that you'd have to be a single-celled organism to not understand what you're signing up for... The screen is extremely clear, upfront and even the supposed \"fine print\" is in huge font with any easy link to learn more. reply arrosenberg 20 minutes agorootparentprevI think they clarified it more recently, because the FTC is taking a separate action against them on this specific issue. I doubt there would have been much of an issue if it had been that clear in the first place. https://natlawreview.com/article/ftc-targets-adobe-hidden-fe... reply llm_nerd 10 minutes agorootparentA few years ago it still had the three options (monthly, annual billed monthly and annual prepaid) but didn't -- at least on the first page, though it did when you confirmed your transaction -- have the specific notice about an early termination fee. It still seemed like something where any rational person would ask themselves \"what sort of idiot would pay 33% more for `monthly' when there's this no downside annual paid monthly thing? Got em!\", but I guess there was some argument for being bamboozled. But it is the way it is now for at least three+ years. People are still thinking they're beating the system. Does it try to ensnare users trying to save some money now? Sure, it does. It offers some revenue planning for Adobe in return for a discount. The FTC is basically arguing that there shouldn't be such a discount. reply johneth 2 hours agoparentprev> One recent idea I've had is that many online subscription services should automatically pause if you stop using it. That seems a bit fuzzy to implement, depending on what the service actually does. It's not always clear-cut, like watching a show on a streaming service; for example, what if the service does things in the background for the user too even if they're not actively 'using' it. My compromise would be something like: if the user hasn't actively engaged with your service for X month(s), email/text them a reminder asking if they still want to be subscribed. reply megiddo 2 hours agoparentprevLet me regale you with the story of my Adobe Subscription cancellation. I had been considering learning Illustrator and to align myself, I decided to get a little skin the game. I signed up for the \"monthly\" subscription. I downloaded Illustrator, and this screenshot was my entire experience: https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-prev... Suffice it to say, this didn't meet my expectations. I thus decided to cancel and was presented with a $108 cancellation fee. Boo. I hit up customer service and explained my frustration. I was told that I was going to pay that $108 since I agreed to it. I countered that contracts required consideration and since Adobe had provided no consideration for my valuable cash, no contract had been perfected betwixt us. He was unwilling to see my point. I asked for his contact information for follow-up, which he provided. I then explained to him that after I hung up, I was not only NOT going to pay, but that within 60 days Adobe would cancel the subscription voluntarily on their side and not collect a single further dime from me. His response basically amounted to \"good luck with that.\" So, I got a temporary prepaid credit card number with $5 on it and swapped out the CC on file with Adobe. I then went over to Amazon and spent that $5. Who knows on what. A month goes by, turns out $0 is insufficient for a monthly subscription payment. I get a notice that the balance isn't good. I get several more notices. Then I get a notice that if I don't pay, I'll lose access. At about 60 days, they cancelled the subscription. I took a screen shot and emailed it to the CSR's contact with my \"I told you so\" scrawled on it. I never heard back, but in my mind it was a great victory. Tickertape and swooning ladies. reply Spoom 29 minutes agorootparentGreat story, but you should be careful with this method if you care about your credit. They are arguably within their rights to report this to the credit agencies as an unpaid debt and send it to collections, including the cancellation fee since they can point to the clickwrap contract that states it. reply rootusrootus 1 hour agorootparentprevIIRC the trick with Adobe is to cancel on the web site, and when it says \"but, but, how about this great upgrade?\" you say yes, and then you can cancel your 'new' plan during its introductory period.

This is a growing trend too, reduced or no notification of renewal, even on annual subscriptions, so you get hit with a three digit charge out of nowhere (not that it's not our responsibility to track these things, but many of us do so less than we'd like). reply bluGill 1 hour agorootparentI refuse to sign up for subscriptions in many cases for that reason. Same reason I won't sign up for 6 months no payments or interest for things I'm buying - by paying cash I ensure I won't forget to pay in 6 months and then just get the minimum payment withdrawn.

They have both explicitly called out grocery revenue growth exceeding total costs, both want to go after PBMs to lower drug prices, both want to go after junk fees, both have come out against algorithmic rent pricing, both have called out misclassification of workers. If Harris does want to keep her on I still don't think it's in either of their interests for Harris to stake out a position. It opens the Harris campaign up to attacks on Khan's many court setbacks and erodes whatever bipartisan support Khan still has. Also, Harris doesn't have to do anything to keep her on, if she doesn't appoint anyone then by law Khan will remain acting commissioner indefinitely. reply saturn8601 1 hour agorootparentprevWhile the candidates may not like her, support for her crosses party lines and so there may be enough people to make a stink about it to make it politically unviable.

It's just a way to smuggle in a 100% increase in the purchase price to get an initial buy in for a product. It is super scammy. Heck, I would even take this a step further and say that taxes as well should always be fully included in the topline price. If a company wants to add a breakdown of how much went to taxes, I'm ok with that. The sticker price should always be the full price. reply VBprogrammer 2 hours agorootparentAs a British person this is always so alien when traveling in the US. You could go one step further and suggest that perhaps tips which are practically mandatory should be included in the headline price but that might be a step too far. reply kevincox 2 hours agorootparentI agree that tips are stupid. But they are technically different as you can pay the price without them and be fine. This is unlike \"convenience fees\" and tax which are required but not displayed in the advertised price. I definitely believe that you should be able to purchase something for the advertised price. Maybe that is \"starting at\" but you should be able to check out at that price. reply mholm 2 hours agorootparentprevMany restaurants have tried this, and end up switching back because comparing prices to other restaurants puts them at a disadvantage. I think the only way for it to happen is regulation that forces it. Might as well include taxes in that price too. reply uxp100 1 hour agorootparentStaff often doesn’t like it either. Probably some combination of actually making less money and being overly optimistic about what they would be making if they were getting tips. a bar I was aware of that advertised paying $20+ and hour with no tips switched to a tipped model due to staff complaints. reply bobthepanda 1 hour agorootparentthere would be a rough transition period, but i do believe that in countries where tipping is not the norm, places just pay more to get better stuff the way non-tipped labor already works. one of the breweries i live by recently moved from non-tipped to tip, and it's generally a disliked change from what I hear because most of the time the brewery is open it's not busy enough to make up for the loss in wages, and then people fight over the really busy shifts. reply ruined 1 hour agorootparentprevit sounds like what happened is management simply did not replace the tipped wage with an appropriate flat wage. if management provided a satisfactory wage, nobody would complain. reply datavirtue 1 hour agorootparentprevThe best employees complain loudly. End of discussion on that one. reply perfectstorm 2 hours agorootparentprevtipping culture is so annoying here in the Bay Area. the other day i was at a coffee shop and cashier handed me a device that had suggested tips from 18-22% with no obvious Cancel button. i was infuriated and the cashier had a smug look on her face. she knew what i was looking for and she didn't bother telling me how to skip it. mind you, this was for a coffee to-go order. reply bluGill 1 hour agorootparentI get very annoyed at things like that where there shouldn't be a tip. Tip is for service quality and counter service there is no differentiation in service between different servers. People do go to restaurants and ask for their favorite waiter. There often is a difference in service between different waiters at the same restaurant - enough that I like the ability to pay for good service (if you always give the same tip you are doing it wrong - you should be giving as many 10% tips as 20%. reply parineum 2 hours agorootparentprevThe trouble is that sales tax can be different in every municipality. National advertising would be a nightmare. However, I think prices at brick and mortar stores should be tax included and, when shopping online, if my address is known, the tax should be include as well. I also think \"plus Tax/Tax included\" should be featured more prominently but I think that businesses would likely do that themselves given the conditions above so that, when comparing prices, you would very noticeably see that whether tax was included or not in your price. ie, Amazon would put in green letters near the price \"Tax included\" so when I compared their price to another place I would know why Amazon's price might be higher. reply deanputney 2 hours agorootparentprevTaxes should also be included in the advertised price, then. Just imagine! reply Kon-Peki 2 hours agorootparentThat would be nice, but there is a LOT of background work before that is feasible (in the US). As it currently stands, for many products a vendor would need to know who you are and where you live before they could quote you a total price. That's unacceptable. reply perfectstorm 2 hours agorootparentother countries have figured that out even countries with multiple levels of taxation like in the U.S. it's not an unsolvable problem. reply Kon-Peki 1 hour agorootparent> not an unsolvable problem I never said it was. In fact, I specifically said that there is work to do before making the rule about listing all prices inclusive of taxes. reply Symbiote 1 hour agorootparentprevIn Europe they make a best guess based on IP location, and if logged in using the account address or previous delivery address. Then the price may change at the checkout if you put in a different/unexpected delivery address. reply pirate787 2 hours agorootparentprevActually there's a purpose to keeping taxes separate. Policymakers want the tax burden to be visible, it is not part of price transparency because the vendor has nothing to do with the tax rate. reply matwood 1 hour agorootparentTaxes are also hyper local and can differ between dine in/out making it hard to show the final price up front. reply r00fus 1 hour agorootparentprevUS policymakers want this. Euro/Asian policymakers have moved beyond this - whenever you travel you pay the sticker on the tin. It's a solved problem but we can't make it happen here. Why? reply hansvm 2 hours agorootparentprevInterestingly, in some states it's illegal to post the \"price\" as one including all applicable taxes. reply pirate787 2 hours agorootparentI mentioned the reason in another comment, it's an important govt transparency principle that the tax burden be separate and visible. reply hansvm 1 hour agorootparentYes, but much like cigarette lobbying, you want to look at who's paying for the given outcome. We have cigarette minimum prices because it increases profits for tobacco companies, and we have this fraudulent price reporting nonsense because lower advertised prices result in more sales. Transparency could just as easily be achieved via a tax breakdown on the receipts merchants are already required to provide on request, while correctly advertising what the consumer will actually pay. reply red_trumpet 2 hours agorootparentprevDo you mean states of the USA or states as in \"country\"? Which ones? reply hansvm 2 hours agorootparentI meant states of the USA. It looks like it's not as bad as it used to be (time for me to read a few more laws I guess). A decade ago WA prohibited the practice.

But, implementing this will be an absolute PITA because so many other things are systemically broken. Case in point: cost breakdown from the invoice of an online order a few months ago (with the dollar amounts removed): > Subtotal > Shipping (Economy) > Tax (Solano County Tax 0.25%) > Tax (Vacaville City Tax 0.75%) > Tax (Solano County District Tax Sp 0.125%) > Tax (Solano Co Local Tax Sl 1.0%) > Tax (California State Tax 6.0%) Once your address is known taxes can be calculated. At what point is an after-tax final price to be shown? On an ad? On a targeted Ad? Once you reach the storefront based on unreliable geolocation? (which would be wrong for me, because geolocation bundles two cities here together as one) Once you create an account? At the checkout when you've specified the shipping address? As things tend to happen today, its usually only at the last step. As much as I'd like to see it, I don't see much chance of improving the visibility of final prices without comprehensive systemic tax reform first. The obvious quick solutions aren't exactly fair in the current US system. Imagine a \"quick fix\" of requiring the vendors to price in-a generic taxes for everyone. Just like with credit card system fees, \"simple\" fixes like that that benefit the residents of high-sales-tax states to the detriment of no-sales-tax state residents. While such a system would work for physical stores, they would get hammered if they had to prices on the shelves or signs that were higher than online prices. As much as we all want a fair straight-forward system, I don't imagine it happening any time soon in the US. There are way too many unresolved zero-sum political fights and ideological differences standing in the way. It certainly can be done (eg: Australia) but the circumstances there were very different. reply rootusrootus 24 minutes agorootparentI agree, it is not currently feasible in all cases. But something like AirBNB should be straightforward. Price tags on store shelves also straightforward. As you point out, it's tough for online shopping, at least until you have an established account. For advertising purposes it would be tough. My guess is the only solution (and it would suck and be met with much resistance) would be to make all the taxes based strictly on where the seller is, not where the buyer is. Then the buyer would have to be on hook for use tax instead of sales tax. States would not like this because most people skip paying use tax altogether. Or just get rid of sales tax as a thing, and if you want localized taxes put them on property. That's what my state does (plus income tax). I agree that we're unlikely to see any sane solution in the US in our lifetime. reply adrr 2 hours agorootparentprevPlane tickets show you all included price including taxes/fee. It was part of 2012 regulation requiring full fare disclosure passed in 2012. Telecom/Internet providers ares ones that need to be fixed because companies like Verizon will charge you bogus \"taxes\" like a network portability tax which isn't a tax and they pocket the money. reply FireBeyond 2 hours agorootparentEven then, there's other challenges. With Delta, booking a flight, I see a rough return airfare when I select my outbound leg, that then might be tweaked by my inbound leg choices. Booking with Alaska, I get a fare listed that is only the outbound leg, and then I have to discover the inbound leg price. This often gives the impression that fares are or will be cheaper with Alaska, and then after a few clicks, you realize that they're (mostly) the \"same\". reply ccorcos 1 hour agorootparentprevThere’s actually a way to do this currently: https://jake.tl/notes/2022-05-how-to-airbnb reply the_svd_doctor 3 hours agorootparentprevFor plane that's pretty unfair. If you don't get any ancillary fees, the price you see is almost exactly up to the cent what you pay. Now if you get any extra, sure. But that's a different problem from Airbnb hiding 100% of the cost in mandatory cleaning fees. reply danaris 2 hours agorootparentThe trouble is, without some overriding authority defining what it means to \"have a plane ticket\", what counts as \"included\"? Because anything that doesn't can then be considered an \"add-on\". Carry-on luggage. Meal/snack and beverage service. A pillow and blanket. A seat that's not a middle seat. Even the ability to choose your seat at all. Airlines that want to tighten the screws on their passengers can, in theory, start charging for all of those, and calling them \"paid add-ons\", even under a \"no junk fees\" law, if we don't clearly define what passengers should be able to expect to be included in their ticket. reply alkonaut 2 hours agorootparentThe comparison price for flights should be normalized. Like for example including either a carry on luggage or a checked in bag but not necessarily both, and no reserved seat. If some even cheaper airline wants to sell tickets without carry on or whatever then they’ll have to list the higher price and offer a pleasant surprise of a lower-than-advertised price when the customer completed the booking. reply the_svd_doctor 2 hours agorootparentprevI get you. AFAICT what's included for airlines is basically \"get me from A to B\". There are usually ways to filter out by seat types, though, both on airlines websites and in places like Google flights. In my experience those are also pretty accurate. reply testfoobar 2 hours agorootparentprevThere are some completely new and wacky fee structures though. I recently flew Avelo airlines - baggage fees were a function of when I paid - rising as I got closer to the flight date. reply parineum 2 hours agorootparentprevYou're describing legitimate add-ons though. The most important part about plane tickets is that I get from A to B. If whatever price compare tool I'm using doesn't let me select the add-ons I want, I can at least find the cheapest base price of a few competitors and then go from there. If I need luggage, I can do my own legwork to make sure that I factor that in. reply HDThoreaun 2 hours agorootparentprevNone of those things should be included. I want none and dont want to pay for having access to them.

So close. reply scottyah 0 minutes agorootparentThe government needs to provide a service if we ever want taxes to be included. Taxes vary by city and can even depend on where you live, so sellers wouldn't be able to give you a price until you say where you are and where you're from for some sales. That's why you basically need a third party if you run an ecommerce website, unless you have a team to track down every time a county or city changes their taxes.

Then you just enable or disable payment IDs (perhaps for a limited time, e.g., \"create a payment ID that works for Netflix for the next three months but not after that\"), rather than relying on vendors to decide whether they feel like charging you or not. reply datadrivenangel 3 hours agorootparentThe problem, is that not paying does not get you out of the legal obligation to pay. Most companies won't follow up because the cost isn't worth it, but there are definitely organizations that will go after you or sell your debts to collection agencies... The marginal cost to a gym/ISP of the remaining duration of your contract is basically zero, especially if you're not going to use it, and they can get a few more dollars by being a jackass about it. In aggregate the incentives dominate. reply pbhjpbhj 2 hours agorootparentCancelling of a subscription payment, without simultaneously notifying eg continuation (such as through an alternate payment means), is a clear and unequivocal indication of termination of the agreement for which the payment was being made. A company has a simple avenue to avoid inadvertent cancellation, they just ask the customer \"did you mean to cancel, please contact us by $date to continue your subscription\". But that's preferring the citizen over business interests. reply bluGill 1 hour agorootparentIf it is easy to cancel then you should cancel. However if it is hard have your credit card cancel for you. (not all will, but some will) The advantage is they work for you and can put pressure on merchants to make it easy so they don't have to be the middleman. reply stevenally 3 hours agorootparentprevYes. The problem is the current law. Which needs to be changed. Make these predatory contracts illegal. reply conradev 3 hours agorootparentI don't think these sorts of contracts should be illegal. I think a lot of things around them should be, like gyms requiring you to go in-person to cancel, or offering a terrible phone service to cancel, or marketing it deceptively such that you were unaware it was a contract. But getting a discount in exchange for a longer-term commitment is often a benefit to consumers. I just paid Visible for a year of cellular service up front and it was far cheaper than paying monthly – truly a great deal. I was able to front that money now, but if I paid a slightly higher per-month price in exchange for a year contract, that would be the same but with less money required up front. reply cogman10 3 hours agorootparentThere are contracts that are basically impossible to terminate and offer basically no benefit to anyone, timeshares is a key example of it. A problem with our contract law is that if you get anything out of a contract it becomes really hard to terminate if the terms don't allow for it (a peppercorn). With contracts now being written in dense legalese with multiple pages of terms and conditions, it's not really feasible to expect the common contractor to have a full understanding of exactly what they are signing up for. reply kevin_thibedeau 2 minutes agorootparentA timeshare is purchasing fractional ownership. That's different than purchasing a service. AlexandrB 3 hours agorootparentprev> But getting a discount in exchange for a longer-term commitment is often a benefit to consumers. This is already framing it in marketing terms. You're not getting a discount but being charged an artificial price premium for less/no commitment. This can get especially obscene in places where gyms are required by law to offer monthly membership options but they charge a significant markup if you go that route. All of this has the effect of suppressing competition. reply conradev 1 hour agorootparentIt is absolutely not just marketing: https://commoncog.com/cash-flow-games/ Jump to \"Pre-payments in the Restaurant Industry\" Money now is more valuable than money later, and guaranteed future money is more valuable than no guaranteed future money. reply candiddevmike 3 hours agorootparentprevI don't think this is a bad idea. Each month you would confirm whether you want to continue with the service, and if you say no or don't respond, it stops. If you think this would be annoying, then pay for a year (or more) in advance. This method would in theory reduce/remove the ability for folks to perform mid-month chargebacks under the guise of \"I forgot to cancel\". reply CSMastermind 2 hours agorootparentI don't think you even have to be that extreme. Just make it so that you can remove the authorization of vendors to charge you. You see a vendor charging you for a service you no longer want - click a button and remove their authorization to charge you. reply FireBeyond 1 hour agorootparentYet currently, we have the opposite, financial institutions will \"helpfully\" update your card details with merchants you have recurring charges with. Years ago at Key Bank I even argued with a teller and manager about blocking a recalcitrant merchant from charging our account, \"But you have ongoing charges with them and if we decline the transaction...\" Yeah, that's between me and them, you shouldn't be inserting into this to 'obligate' me to pay. reply 620gelato 1 hour agorootparentprevIndia basically has this - when creating subscriptions, merchants typically create \"mandates\" which specify max amount permitted per month, frequency, and duration. Afterwards, 1) if per month amount is greater than a regulated threshold, manual confirmation is needed. [ This is friction ] , 2) cancelling can be as simple as going to your bank's website and deleting the \"mandate\". In all honesty, this is probably a really balanced approach, but the roll out was a real pain, with banks and merchants collaborating on who supports whom, etc. International payments got screwed completely - to this day, I can't subscribe to nytimes, after almost 2.5 years of this. (A good summary - https://support.stripe.com/questions/rbi-e-mandate-regulatio... ) reply kibwen 3 hours agorootparentprevA number of credit card companies offer virtual card numbers that you can generate to avoid giving out your real number. I agree that it should be more normalized, widespread, and automatic, but it is already possible to start doing this today. reply pbhjpbhj 2 hours agorootparentA problem mentioned is that whilst this cuts off the payment, in law it may not remove the liability to pay, so the company could in future chase you for the payments. reply cvalka 1 hour agorootparentThey never do that reply HDThoreaun 2 hours agorootparentprevCompanies can still send your debt to collections. For this strategy to truly work you can never give the company your real identity. reply rachofsunshine 3 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I was thinking of what I could do with a company Brex card - but I can't with my personal CC, at least not directly through my bank (though as others note apparently Google Pay does this now). reply dspillett 3 hours agorootparentprevIt isn't something I've seen advertised by credit card companies here (UK) but in the US at least some offer virtual cards whereby you can give different vendors a specific virtual card and cancel that if they don't stop taking payments when you want them to. As much as I'm not a big fan of PayPal¹ I use that rather than separate credit card payments/subs for online purchases including subs for things like hosting accounts. Stopping a payment from their web UI seems like it would be easier than arranging a chargeback or calling the CC company to put a block on future payments, and it reduces the number of companies that I hand my credit card details too. When I cancel a service I make sure that the sub is cancelled there as well. I always follow the cancellation procedure at the other end too, unless it is obnoxiously bothersome, as just cancelling the payment method feels like I'm being dickish². ---- [1] I'm not sure that I'd risk a business account with them, and I hardly ever keep a balance there, due to the many stories of accounts being frozen for long periods with litle reason and inadequate review. [2] You might argue that often they'd be more than happy to be dickish, hence the cancellation procedures, but I prefer not to stoop to that level whether they would or not. reply pbhjpbhj 2 hours agorootparentMy PayPal story (in short, search my comments if you want more detail) - I bought a cheap game (payments->automatic payments (https://www.paypal.com/myaccount/autopay/) feature. Last year I had a company (DomainsPricedRight/OwnMyDomain aka GoDaddy) that I last did business (a one time purchase) with 18 years prior (2005), bill me under a new \"subscription\" with no input on my part. PayPal sort of allows you to prevent that but it seems only with companies you have recently done business with. PayPal did do a good job of email notification of the automatic payment and cancelling the \"subscription\" but there is no easy way to reverse the fraudulent payment, so in the end the consumer still gets burned for profit (it was only $1 but how many people had $1 stolen?) reply FireBeyond 1 hour agorootparentAgreed, I had similar where I had signed up for a trial with a subscription, sure, and then went to cancel. \"This can be done by 'manage payments' in PayPal.\" or similar.

If you're a Rust dev, consider getting involved as we apply for the next GSoC in the new year— you could be our intern next summer :) Q3 progress report: https://graphite.rs/blog/graphite-progress-report-q3-2024/ deskr 5 hours agoSome suggestions: I was doing something and then suddently I got a red error message, \"The document cannot be rendered in it current state\", instructing me to click the Node Graph button. 1. I couldn't find that button. Perhaps show a picture of it or just embed it in the error message. 2. Make the error text selectable. 3. Let me report the bug straight from the app? reply noisy_boy 4 hours agoparentI got the same error when I was doing the tutorial (which went quite well) and was doing the steps for circular repeat of the sun rays. Pressing Ctrl-Z undid practically all the work instead of just the last wrong change (not sure what caused it). reply Keavon 53 minutes agorootparentAh yes, good find: the stroke node can only apply to vector data, but when you use the Circular Repeat node, it now produces group data (as it should have always done). The fix is to put the Stroke node first to avoid the type error. I'll see what I can do to update the tutorial with that info, and to try to make the Stroke node more robust so it could apply to all group elements. I'm surprised that Ctrl+Z undid more than one step, I've never seen that before. If you get the chance to reproduce that and write up the steps, please file an issue since we'd like to take a look into that. reply altilunium 3 hours agoparentprevSimply using the brush tool triggered this error for me. reply Keavon 1 hour agorootparentThat's a recent regression, thanks for mentioning that. We'll get that fixed ASAP. I should also mention that the brush tool isn't well-supported and will be fully rewritten early next year. It currently has some quality and performance issues because it has to generate a texture on the CPU of the width and height required by the entire stroke bounding box, which quickly hits a performance wall. reply TechSquidTV 5 hours agoprevImmediately looking at the screenshot and I'm impressed. No further review I can tell this is different. I've always said we need more \"Blender\"-like projects out there to take on Adobe. I see you potentially have plans to take on other apps as well. Following and hoping for your success. reply wg0 15 hours agoprevThis is amazing. I love Inskcapke but I think this tool is too good. It makes me very excited to see tools that are built as web apps because more gravity on web means more capabilities for the web platform which is more open and accessible. Rust is great - amazing. I presume it is compiled to Web Assembly. I'm just wondering how and why these three passionate gifted individuals didn't go Round A, Round B Investor funding, post valuation SAFE, Press briefing route? Been thinking a lot about it lately when I see tons of AI wrappers, open weight fine tuned packaged models and everything in between. Probably passion can't be priced? Happiness is not valuation? reply rachofsunshine 5 hours agoparentI can't speak for OP, but I didn't seek funding for my company because I knew that it would eventually force me to sacrifice the things I value about it in favor of growth. I'd rather run a small company that sustainably does good, honest business than a giant one that hollows itself out for maximum growth. Founders are just as tired of \"ugh, why can't they just stop ruining good things!\" as you are. Or some of us are, anyway. reply swatcoder 4 hours agoparentprevRaising investor money means selling your business before you're even done with it. Sometimes before you've even started it. I mean, that's what all that equity that gets cleaved off represents. And generally, you'll get your worst terms the earlier you solicit those funds. If you don't need those funds, it's (mostly) to your advantage to hold off on raising them until you've got your feet underneath you and a company whose future is less disputable. On the way there, you may even decide not to sell much to investors at all, which makes a big difference if you actually care about either your product or your team. Because your outside investors will rarely care about either and will often convince you to compromise both. They're financiers, and they're there for the money. You should be sure your objectives align with theirs before you sell to them. reply crabmusket 6 hours agoparentprev> I'm just wondering how and why these three passionate gifted individuals didn't go Round A, Round B Investor funding, post valuation SAFE, Press briefing route? Maybe they wanted to work for themselves, not for a VC? reply jokethrowaway 12 hours agoparentprevYou won't get funding for a vector editor. Re: open weight models Most of the innovation happens within companies who use OSS to either appeal to developers or to destroy potential competitors (think Meta spending a fraction of its ad revenue just to ruin the market for OpenAI / Microsoft) Some individuals get grants from VCs who want to make a name in AI for themselves for the cost of peanuts (eg. a16z sponsors some models) At the same time, for wealthy tech people with skills and a well paid job (think 300-500) raising capital is not always an attractive proposition. You'll likely have a lower salary when doing your own startup and if it turns out your open model can't make enough money you'll just have a bunch of worthless equity and 1-2 years of high stress / pressure. reply ChadNauseam 3 hours agorootparentYou could totally get funding for a vector editor. A friend of mine got funding for a node-based video editor. reply wg0 10 hours agorootparentprevFigma comes to mind. But yes, your rest of the analysis follows on the dot and makes perfect sense. reply cozzyd 4 hours agoprevMaybe I'm doing something wrong, but I find it somewhat non-intuitive that each stroke / circle / box is automatically its own layer, rather than the layers being explicit, as they are in Inkscape. That makes the layers essentially useless for me. reply dang 20 hours agoprevRelated. Others?

I’ve been using Illustrator for twenty five years and have been wishing for a node-oriented replacement of the Appearance stack a lot lately. I will have to check it out when you have binaries, I hate web apps. reply egypturnash 19 hours agoparent(Looking at the videos: global color swatches please, it’s super powerful to be able to change everything drawn in a color - fills, strokes, effects, etc - with a few clicks.) reply Keavon 19 hours agorootparentI'm eager for that feature too! The node graph engine recently got the ability to represent that concept, so now I just need to find the time to design and build the UI for it. I utilize that feature a lot in other software so it'll be really helpful to have in Graphite as well. reply egypturnash 4 hours agorootparentIf you don't have a way to bundle up a collection of nodes and apply it to another object or bring it to another document with just a few clicks, that's super powerful too. I rely on that constantly in Illustrator. And constantly grumble at the fact that there's no way to have folders in the Graphic Styles palette where these collections of nodes live, since I can easily have a dozen styles for one character when I'm doing comics. ---- although I just played with it and judging by the state of your layers palette there's clearly a lot of stuff to do in terms of organizing the elements of the document in general - to me, documents contain one of more layers, that contain paths, compound paths, groups of paths, and/or layers, and I can choose to place new paths at the top or bottom of any layer (or inside a clipping path); Graphite just calls every path a \"layer\" and this becomes very unwieldy within a few seconds of drawing shapes. reply skavi 19 hours agoparentprevIs Electron really so different in your experience than a PWA? Personally, I always try to use a PWA when the app is otherwise offered via Electron. If it’s going to depend on a browser engine, it may as well be the one I already have open and update regularly. reply dumbo-octopus 16 hours agorootparentI’d prefer it to be one that the developers have specifically targeted and developed/tested against, especially if there’s any GPU involvement. reply egypturnash 6 hours agorootparentprevI want my applications to live on my computer and be able to do things like say “this new update breaks my workflow, I am rolling back to the last good version until they get this shit fixed”. This has happened multiple times with Illustrator. Also they say \"native\" apps are coming which I am assuming means \"actually talks to the OS properly instead of going through a web browser\", I have loathed Electron apps ever since Evernote got rewritten as a pile of webshit. reply aDyslecticCrow 5 hours agoprevThis looks awesome! It looks like a decent Illustrator alternative with its own identity. Even the basics are more competent than Inkscape. reply mightyham 18 hours agoprevCongrats on releasing such a complex tool, that's a big achievement. Someday, I'd like to try my hand at making my own vector graphics tool that contains a constraint solver. I am just an amateur when it comes to graphic design, but I often find Inkscape incredibly difficult to use. Certain shapes take bizarre combinations of commands to create and once a design is finished it can be hard to make adjustments. I find it much easier to make 2D designs as a fusion 360 sketches because constraining a bunch of lines and curves then playing with measurements is significantly more intuitive and interactive. Also maybe a tool like this already exists and I'm just not aware of it. reply Keavon 18 hours agoparentDefinitely! And in fact, that is on our [roadmap](https://graphite.rs/features/#:~:text=CAD%2Dlike%20constrain...). Maybe you could get involved instead of making something separate. reply kakkun 7 hours agorootparentI'm really looking forward to that. It's something I tried to tackle but unfortunately had to give up on. reply mightyham 18 hours agorootparentprevAwesome! If I ever find the time, I will definitely look into contributing. reply WillAdams 6 hours agoparentprevThe closest thing would be Solvespace --- might want to look at Dune3D. reply mightyham 2 hours agorootparentThose are both 3D CAD programs though, and almost all CAD software supports 2D parametric sketching. I mostly just find strange though that such a ubiquitous feature in CAD, which allows for fast creation and manipulation of 2D shapes, is missing from every vector graphics tool I've used. reply WillAdams 2 hours agorootparentYeah, it would be interesting to see the Solvespace solver ported to Inkscape as it was to Blender as CADsketcher. reply bangaladore 19 hours agoprevI had to re-read your intro paragraph a few times to understand what this is supposed to be. I read it as a replacement for Blender, but upon testing it I was confused as everything was 2D and looks like Photoshop. But no, you meant the next Photoshop, while referencing Blender as a popular open source version of closed-source 3D modeling/rendering software? Is that right? reply Keavon 19 hours agoparentUpon rereading that paragraph, I suppose I didn't write that as clearly as I'd meant to. Blender is darn near perfect and there'd be no reason to replace it. So yes, as you figured out, I'm referring to becoming a second Blender but this time in the 2D realm: a generalist tool that uses actual innovation to catch up and then surpass its commercial competitors. reply crabmusket 16 hours agorootparentGraphite is to Photoshop as Blender is to 3DS Max? reply Keavon 16 hours agorootparentRoughly speaking, that's the plan, with next year's roadmap focused on raster (image and raw photo) editing. Currently, Illustrator would be the more appropriate comparison instead of Photoshop, because vector editing is the primary feature set we've built so far. reply timeon 11 hours agorootparentprevReminds me more Affinity Designer than Photoshop. Since it is also for vectors. In Adobe land you need two apps for this. (Well actually three - omnipresent Creative-Cloud eating the resources in background.) reply germandiago 1 hour agorootparentprevGood luck, you are going to need it. reply underbiding 18 hours agoparentprevbut its not really photoshop either because its targeting vector based graphics, whereas Photoshop is mainly raster-based. I'm not up on Adobe (I use InkScape which is sort of the default open-source / free alternative) but I guess Adobe Illustrator is the closest analogue here. reply mirekrusin 7 hours agorootparentAuthor says raster focus next year, intention to support both and frankly it sounds like great idea. reply aDyslecticCrow 5 hours agorootparentProcedural node-based raster editing can become insane. Do things vectors cannot, but with infinite resolution. There are already fractal examples on the website which would murder any vector renderer. reply emmanueloga_ 17 hours agoprevWow this looks fantastic! Good open-source tools for design are so necessary [1]. You should probably add Graphite to this list [2]. I'll definitely try Graphite and follow its progress. Good luck! -- 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lthVYUB8JLs 2: https://github.com/KenneyNL/Adobe-Alternatives reply Keavon 14 hours agoparentThanks! I'll open it up to the community to suggest Graphite's inclusion in lists like that one but I'll abstain from doing that myself. I should mention that, at the present moment, the only category we'd appropriately fit under is the Illustrator alternatives. Next year we will be building towards raster editing as our next core competency, but vector editing is the only one we've focused on so far. reply nicoburns 13 hours agorootparentReally looking forward to having something with decent vector AND raster capabilites. That niche is currently unfilled unless one wants to run an old version of Fireworks in a VM... reply OnionBlender 9 minutes agorootparentI'm glad at least one person in this thread mentioned Fireworks. I found it much more intuitive than Gimp and Inkscape. reply Keavon 13 hours agorootparentprevI keep reading occasional people talk about Fireworks with a wistful bygone \"what could have been\" for raster + vector. That's older than my era (although I was old enough to grow up making Flash animations and games) so I never got to know Fireworks, but I do hope to finally build a worthy solution after all this time. The neat part is that, in Graphite, raster content (brushes, patterns, noise, filters, effects, Mandelbrot Set fractals, etc.) is procedurally generated on-the-fly at the current viewing resolution, just like vector content. So they both interact harmoniously in a way no other editor has been able to manage. reply devsda 15 hours agoparentprevAdding to the above, in a way this can also be self hosted and is a candidate for the awesome selfhosted list [1]. 1. https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted reply Keavon 14 hours agorootparentIt looks like that list tends more towards home-server self-hosted SaaS kinds of software rather than desktop apps. With our upcoming desktop app, and the fact that you can install it right now as a PWA, there's really no benefit from self-hosting. Your data is already client-side, so there's nothing for the server to do besides act as a CDN and send some tiny static assets. Unless people are going somewhere without internet, there's really no point in self-hosting the static files instead of using our CDN. Since we don't even have a server backend (except for a proxy to the Google Fonts API which we need to keep our API key private). reply devsda 14 hours agorootparentI (mis?)understood one of the features for 1.0 \"Cloud document storage\" as some sort of custom storage server, webdav or other remote filesystem support. If there's no plan for that or if its limited to usual suspects like GDrive, Dropbox etc., then I guess there's not much benefit to selfhosting. reply Keavon 14 hours agorootparentThat's all far-future stuff that will let us continue to grow towards our larger ambitions further down the roadmap with a revenue stream that isn't purely dependent upon donations, which isn't sustainable on its own. It will always be a purely separate value-add that's not shoved down the throat of users— a subset of users will find that helpful and pay for the storage and most users won't care and won't be bothered about it. But we don't have any of that yet, and won't for a while. reply qwertox 14 hours agoprevThis is the kind of stuff I love to see at the top of HN, that application looks absolutely professional. When searching for \"scripting\" on the pages, I don't see any scripting support. Are there plans to integrate it? Also some kind of API? reply Keavon 13 hours agoparentThanks! No support for custom scripts yet. But the whole concept is that we're basically building a WYSIWYG editor on top of a node-based compositor on top of a visual programming language (so that's three products in one, lots of work ahead for us!). The result is that the whole thing is a programmatic data pipeline and you'll be able to write custom scripts in both node and code form, then compose them into reusable pieces and pipelines. But since we're building three products in one, we have only been able to focus on the parts that matter most to get things working. Your request hasn't yet been one of those, but worry not, that's very much a core feature. reply bschwindHN 6 hours agorootparentDo you think you'll use WASM as a target for the custom scripts in code form? Zed has an interesting WASM-based extension APIN that makes it really easy to write extensions in Rust, it might be worth checking out for this project. reply Keavon 36 minutes agorootparentCustom code will be compiled to Wasm so it's sandboxed for security purposes. First-party code that ships with Graphite, or perhaps trusted authors in the future, will be able to use non-Wasm native code on desktop. But Wasm is still a very high percentage of native speed. reply WillAdams 6 hours agorootparentprevIs it possible to draw a Bézier curve, then decompose it in the Node Editor to a set of numeric nodes which input into a Bézier node? I couldn't figure out how to do that (mentioned it elsethread). reply Keavon 35 minutes agorootparentYou could ask that in our Discord and we can give more advanced guidance, but that isn't something we specifically have nodes for yet. We are building a spreadsheet view for working with all the data in numeric form, and once we have that plus some nodes for interacting with the spreadsheet data, your use case will become more naturally represented. reply WillAdams 26 minutes agorootparentThis is a usage model which I would advocate for --- the ability to record series of actions and then edit them made using WordBASIC to automate Microsoft Word far more accessible/discoverable for me. reply deskr 5 hours agoprevThis is one of the more interesting projects I've seen for a while. Excellent landing page by the way. reply Keavon 34 minutes agoparentThanks! Do you mean the website home page, or the app's welcome screen? reply bufferoverflow 18 hours agoprevThe appeal of Blender for me is not just the open-sourceness, but also the fact that everything in it is programmable. Any action you can do via UI, you can do by calling some Python method. Why create a new project instead of advancing InkScape though? reply Keavon 15 hours agoparentGraphite is built to be a programmatic data processing pipeline that takes the form of a render engine and WYSIWYG editor. You'll be able to write custom code for every part of the system. And because it's time for a fresh start. Sometimes you can't turn around a heavy ship, and that ship doesn't want to be turned around. It's easy to write a sentence like that, but once you actually think about it, how does an outsider with a good idea and a capability to execute on it somehow approach an existing project and decide to \"take it over\"? That would be neither viable nor would it yield a desirable outcome. We're building something fundamentally different from Inkscape that just so happens to eclipse it. reply lionkor 12 hours agorootparentAbsolutely - as with so many large open source projects, the maintainers and community are (rightfully) going to be sceptical of any newcomers. This leaves only three options: 1. start contributing to the project slowly, try to get into their ranks, participate in conversation, and hope that you share the same vision 2. fork it and learn the codebase by yourself 3. write your own Out of those, given the obviously conscious choice to go with Rust, and the ambitious goals, the third option is the only one that makes sense. reply Keavon 12 hours agorootparentExactly! The only thing harder than making something so ambitious would be doing it in a huge legacy codebase with an existing leadership team fighting against someone vying to rock the boat. Being new is an opportunity, not a flaw. It means there's a lot of work to do, but that's tractable with the right organization structure that I think we've successfully managed to build— and it's something other projects really struggle with, so starting fresh in that respect also avoids problems from cultural elements that could very well be the blame for the inadequacies of those existing projects. reply _flux 4 hours agoparentprevMy understanding is that InkScape is foremost an SVG editor. If SVG can't do it, then InkScape can't either. This seems quite somewhat limiting for a general-purpose graphical editor, aspiring to integrate good bitmap editing support as well later. Though, I guess it does somehow extend the SVG format, as it provides saving as either Inkscape SVG or plain SVG.. So maybe my understanding is incorrect? reply Keavon 33 minutes agorootparentYes, and furthermore, Inkscape doesn't even have its own file format. You save your work to SVG. So the entire program is intrinsically tied to the SVG spec, and won't ever expand beyond that. It wouldn't be a good base to try and extend into a highly generalized program meeting the Graphite vision. reply handity 4 hours agoprevPlease make First and Last name optional in your email signup form, there's no reason for that to be mandatory. reply Keavon 32 minutes agoparentIt's not mandatory, you can enter any name you wish. reply lionkor 12 hours agoprevWhat a fantastic UX. You guys can really be very proud. Between this and Zed there are already two apps that can replace everyday apps for me. I wish I could do this kind of Rust code in my day job. reply kranke155 7 hours agoprevThis is incredible. Thank you for this. The Adobe suite is a bunch of bugs stuck together for the benefit of no one in particular, at this point. Hopefully with time and donations this can disrupt the market as Blender did in 3D. reply bethemoly 6 hours agoprevThis sounds like a big project—congrats on releasing it! Just curious, as a business other than a hobby, do you have enough resources to see it through? reply Keavon 28 minutes agoparentEverything we do is bootstrapped through donations and volunteer development time. When our main other core contributor graduates in a year, we'll need the funds to hire him, so we will be pushing that donation angle more in the coming year as well as applying for grants. I personally would like to be paid eventually, but I'm well-equipped to keep at this for a while before finances become a problem in my life. I can be not paid, but can't pay others. As a project, we have longer-term business plans that let us stay sustainable and independent and not wholly dependent upon donations: a combination of asset store payment processing, cloud document storage, and render farm services for people who wish to opt into paying for those value-adds that are otherwise not part of the main product. A decade from now, I'd like to actually recoup my investment, but I don't want to sell out to investors. reply virtualritz 11 hours agoprevI opened a medium complex SVG and the app became unresponsive beyond useable. After scaling it down by manually entering the scale values I could not find the SVG any more (the Align... buttons in the top bar are always grayed out/not implemented yet, it seems). Every update (even moving the canvas around takes 1-2 secs on my laptop. TLDR; looks like this is redrawing everything every time which makes it useable only for very simple projects atm, unless I miss sth. I.e. needs caching of vectors as bitmaps/textures of some sort. Also doesn't seem to support OpenEXRs yet? They won't show in the file browser. Screenshots look great and I love the node editor's mapping to the layer stack. But as always with Graphite it's still unclear to me how many of the screenshots show actual functinality and how many are mockups or the functionality behind some UI elements is simply not implemented yet. reply eternityforest 13 hours agoprevLove it! I've never liked how 2D graphics currently involves so many separate programs and forces you into a feed forward pipeline workflow. reply WillAdams 7 hours agoprevThis is almost exactly the tool I have wanted for a long while. The one thing is when something is drawn in the interactive UI, rather than becoming a single node which cannot be decomposed/worked with via sub-elements, it should become (or there should be an option for) \"ungrouping\" it to an equivalent set of nodes/values --- if this capability is present, I couldn't figure it out, and I'd be glad to know of it. reply Keavon 25 minutes agoparentFeel free to drop by our Discord and go into more detail about this. I think we may need to discuss it for me to understand exactly what you're describing. reply WillAdams 26 minutes agoparentprevSee answer at: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41862107 reply lacoolj 20 hours agoprevThis is really cool but I have an RTX 4080 and it's really struggling to open and subsequently manipulate the example art. Maybe just because it's in the browser? reply Keavon 19 hours agoparentThat'd be because it's all CPU-based at the moment . So your 4080 is taking a vacation while your CPU hits the gym. That's obviously not ideal, but you'll have to trust me that it is due to long-term architectural planning reasons and not a blatant disregard for sensible development practices. Our node graph engine is really advanced—it's actually a scripting language built upon Rust and its type system—which will have some very sizable benefits once it's done being built. But right now, it means vital things like GPU compute have been blocked by a towering pile of other engineering work. But we've nearly completed those prerequisites and should be able to unlock GPU compute in the early parts of next year (this is also blocked on Firefox and Safari shipping WebGPU support, required to use compute shaders in the browser— and on us having the time to support Windows, Mac, and Linux builds via [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)). In short, please be patient :) The app's architecture is designed with performance that'll make your CPU and GPU scream, but it's a big job building all of it. Especially for raster imagery, that's where a CPU-bottlenecked render pipeline is especially affected. But next year is the year we move on from vector graphics to raster once the GPU is utilized in the render pipeline. Thanks for taking a look! reply john01dav 18 hours agorootparentWhen you start supporting GPUs, what APIs do you plan to use (cuda, vulkan, dx, etc.)? It would be quite unfortunate to use a non-vendor-neutral API (for both OS and GPU vendor). I would probably use wgpu or vulkan for this. reply Keavon 18 hours agorootparentEverything will be using compute shaders for the foreseeable future. [WGPU](https://wgpu.rs/) abstracts that to work with WebGPU on browsers, DirectX/Vulkan on Windows, Metal on Mac, and Vulkan on Linux and Android. There may be opportunities to explore vendor-specific options like CUDA in the far future to leverage a further increase in performance, but compute shaders are portable and nearly as good. reply 123pie123 10 hours agoparentprevyep, this almost killed my machine , I wasn't to sure if it was my PC or firefox reply zdw 5 hours agoprevIs there a comparison/contrast with Krita anywhere? reply Keavon 20 minutes agoparentKrita is a painting application. Graphite is a vector editing application. There is currently no overlap between the two apps. We intend to eventually build a painting application workflow, but that isn't something we're focused on yet and we'll likely prioritize other area first because Krita is a competent tool for painting already, which digital artist should use for that workflow until we someday have the time to build something even better. reply short_sells_poo 5 hours agoprevI'm so glad this is a genuine product that stands by it's own merit rather than trying to sell itself on the basis of being written in Rust. I feel too many products that use some fancy new tech in development make that aspect part of the sales pitch. It is certainly interesting for us here, but the users of the tool will only care about the technical side to the degree that the tool is stable, performant and continues to be developed. I'm not an illustrator so I can't add much beyond that, but I'm rooting for the devs to turn it into a success! reply martin_henk 14 hours agoprevWow! That's something really useful and awesome. Shame on Adobe while having so much resources not pushing more to build a diverse eco system of creative apps like Graphite reply dzaima 16 hours agoprevOh cool! I've had a very unfinished unpublished SVG editor from a couple years ago with blender-ish controls that I started cleaning up a couple days ago; guess I don't need to anymore. Here are some things in mine that I've found useful but don't see here (/ might have missed) and could be food for thought (presumably some of these are just NYI but noting them regardless): [edit: a couple of these things are already noted at https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues/1870] - shift+G/R/S for setting handle mode (bent, colinear, and colinear+equidistant respectively) works out quite intuitively; mode can be displayed as a different icon on the point (square for bent, rectangle aligned to angle for colinear, and circle for equidistant is what I use; circle is somewhat questionable but my handles have arrow tips) - while holding just a handle, set the rotation/scale anchor point to its point - allow both rotate and scale at the same time (maybe never useful but I still did it. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯) - while rotating/scaling, some shortcut for setting the anchor point (esp. snapped to an element representing the rotational center of a symmetric design) - middle-mouse-dragging while holding an element should ignore the delta mouse movement during the movement - I draw visual indicators of the current r/g/s accumulated action (g: a line from the starting mouse position in the canvas to where it'd be dragged to; s: line from the anchor point through the current and original mouse position with different colors (i.e. the ratio of the color lengths is the ratio of scaling); r: lines from the anchor to original & current mouse position, with an arc in between (very busy-looking, don't quite like it)) - some actions - cut a path into two (a thing I don't have but have wanted is drag-selecting to cut into three), snapping to existing points if near enough; and another to join paths if two end-points are selected; and select all linked to current selection reply Keavon 15 hours agoparentThanks, those are really useful! Would you mind copy and pasting those into a comment in https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues/1870 to help us keep track of those suggestions? I'd like to revisit them again. reply ChadNauseam 16 hours agoprevWow, cool! I think I remember a post years ago about this project. IIRC you did a thesis in something to do with simulating brush strokes? Anyway, congrats on releasing this, super impressive to have worked on this for so long and come out with something that looks so good. (And it's awesome that you're looking into using Vello too.) reply Keavon 15 hours agoparentYou remember correctly! Here's that thesis code . You can ignore the readme since it doesn't talk about brushes and open the GitHub Pages site (or, I can just link it here: ). Then press Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, Ctrl+3, or Ctrl+4 and reload the page after each. Be patient as it takes a couple seconds to load the page once a demo is chosen. That'll load the four brush demos: - Ctrl+1: dotted stamp roller - Ctrl+2: bristle brush - Ctrl+3: diluted ink - Ctrl+4: ragged solid ink brush This concept will be reimplemented in Graphite eventually. Maybe as a GSoC project. The actual thesis write-up is herein case you're really interested for some reason. reply nassimm 17 hours agoprevLooks good! I'm not too much into graphics these days, but when I was I would've loved that. reply fwip 3 hours agoprevVery cool! One comment, one question. 1) panning the node graph of the leaves demo seemed slow / laggy on my macbook pro in chrome, which gave an initial low-quality feeling - moving nodes was nice and responsive. 2) Given that this is written in Rust (compiled), is it on the roadmap to 'export' the parameterized designs into some callable library code? e.g: a game engine that calls \"leaves = generate_texture(\"changing_leaves.graphite\", percentage=0.2)\"? It would be cool to keep that configurability even once you leave the editor - basically, splitting the node-graph renderer out as its own library that you can call programmatically. reply Keavon 14 minutes agoparent1. Please see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41854076 2. Yes, you got it!

Beautiful work, really amazing. Congratulations and thank you. reply adastra22 19 hours agoprevWhat UI crate are you using for the GUI? reply Keavon 19 hours agoparentRight now, it's a custom HTML/CSS/TypeScript component system using Svelte built to minimize bloat. But since Graphite is a data-driven graphics app and render engine, we are planning to gradually rewrite our UI components as Graphite documents— allowing us to design the editor's UI within its own editor UI. Once that happens, we can probably drop the web dependencies— although we've taken pains to ensure our current web dependencies are very lightweight and performant. All the slow parts of Graphite are due to backend engineering shortcuts we've taken to enable forward progress, and those are stopgaps that are actively being worked on to be rebuilt into proper, high-performance systems. reply airstrike 16 hours agorootparentHave you considered using Iced? It can be hard to figure out at first but it's blazing fast, cross-platform and can compile to WASM. It's also _beautifully_ designed. Importantly, it's both \"just Rust\" and \"very Rust\". You can stay on the yellow brick road and kinda just get the app out there with incredible multi-threaded CPU + GPU rendering performance from the outset... or dig deeper and go into advanced stuff. Per the docs, it \"leverages Rust to its full extent: ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, futures, streams, first-class functions\"... it's just up to you how much of that you want to use The documentation is admittedly WIP but if you need help, the Discord server is very helpful. I'm there virtually 24/7 and happy to answer any questions The repo is at https://github.com/iced-rs/iced -- check out the readme for two complex apps recently built. It's fully themeable so you can make apps look exactly as you want them to (which is a downside for those looking for more native widgets) reply Keavon 15 hours agorootparentIt was a top contender when I was picking a GUI solution but it didn't meet the cut. Remember that this was 3.5 years ago. The decision to go with HTML/CSS was undoubtedly the right one and it'll continue to treat us well for the foreseeable future. But we are beginning to rewrite certain areas, like the node graph, in our own render stack because this streamlines the code best. And other widgets like histograms, color scopes, etc. will continue to be built with our own renderer. And then at some point, it will start making sense to begin gradually replacing other parts of our UI with the regular widgets like buttons and checkboxes with that system. Doing so will help us simplify things and make them more user-customizable, so plugin authors can affect the UI, etc. reply airstrike 3 hours agorootparentIt's your app, so obviously do whatever you want, but I agree with the sibling comment that an immediate mode GUI wastes valuable CPU cycles redrawing the frame repeatedly and will invariably hurt performance Again, since iced is \"just rust\", you can write whatever widgets you need, although it comes with a long list of built-in widgets (and there are many more built by the community). You can compose views with a bunch of these widgets to get to the UI you want. There's also nothing stopping you from creating a way for users to write widgets for your iced application. The sky is the limit. And I'm singling out iced because I'm a fan, but this should be true for pretty much all robust GUI toolkits out there. reply adastra22 12 hours agorootparentprevI sincerely doubt you will be able to match the performance of native widgets with immediate-mode render libraries. reply anthk 5 hours agoprevSimilarly, there's Kons-9 for 3D procedural imaging/modelling written in Common Lisp. reply FrustratedMonky 6 hours agoprevIs there any dependencies that would not allow this to be compiled to WASM?

    "originBody": "macOS sometimes leaks traffic after system updates October 16, 2024 App We have found that you could be leaking traffic on macOS after system updates. To our current knowledge a reboot resolves it. We are currently investigating this and will follow up with more information. The current state In this scenario the macOS firewall does not seem to function correctly and is disregarding firewall rules. Most traffic will still go inside the VPN tunnel since the routing table specifies that it should. Unfortunately apps are not required to respect the routing table and can send traffic outside the tunnel if they try to. Some examples of apps that do this are Apple’s own apps and services since macOS 14.6, up until a recent 15.1 beta. What’s next? We’ve reported this to Apple and hopefully we’ll see a fix in the near future. In the meanwhile we will continue to investigate this to be able to provide more information to Apple and to see if there are any workarounds that we can implement in the app. Check if you are affected Run the following commands in a terminal to check if you are affected: 1. Add a firewall rule that blocks all traffic echo \"block drop quick all\"sudo pfctl -ef - 2. Try to send traffic outside the tunnel curl https://am.i.mullvad.net/connected To clean up after the experiment, disable the firewall and clear all rules. sudo pfctl -d sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf It is also possible to check if our app is leaking by doing the following: 1. Make sure you are not connected to a VPN 2. Find the default interface by running the following command in a terminal route get mullvad.netsed -nE 's/.*interface: //p' 3. Connect to a VPN server using our app 4. Run the following command (replace “” with the interface from step 2) curl --interfacehttps://am.i.mullvad.net/connected 5. The request should time out if everything is working properly. If there is a response then you are leaking.",

    "commentBody": "MacOS sometimes leaks traffic after system updates (mullvad.net)350 points by dulvui 10 hours agohidepastfavorite183 comments chatmasta 1 hour agoIf you want leak-proof VPN, you need to implement it outside of your device, at the router level. This is true for any device but Apple devices in particular. I highly recommended sniffing the traffic on the wire and piping it through wireshark. You can do this with a router, or a passive Ethernet tap. You’ll see a bunch of packets going to places other than your VPN entrypoint. If you use a router, you can check your mobile for leaks too. (Did you know if you have WiFi calling enabled, then your phone makes a TCP connection to a sensor server controlled by your ISP every 30 seconds? So if you’ve got T-Mobile and you’re abroad, not even using it as your default SIM, they’ll get a nice log of every exit IP you use.) Apple’s seeming embrace of support for VPN and network filtering extensions is a red herring, because they’ll happily disable it for their own traffic. On iOS, the App Store will skip any VPN, and similarly Apple will even block you from downloading updates if you’re on a VPN. I only realized this when I used my wireless router with VPN on it and updates failed to download. On Mac, there are a bunch of issues, especially on first boot. It seems like the Mac will refuse to establish the VPN until it can make one connection outside of it. I encounter this when my computer wakes from sleep and the on-demand wireguard tunnel (using Cloudflare Warp) fails to send packets. I unplug my Ethernet, disable always-on, wait 30 seconds (for some timeout?), re-enable always-on, and then plug in the Ethernet and in connects. But I’m not actually sure this isn’t leaking, I need to investigate more. reply thisislife2 7 hours agoprev> In this scenario the macOS firewall does not seem to function correctly and is disregarding firewall rules ... Some examples of apps that do this are Apple’s own apps and services since macOS 14.6, up until a recent 15.1 beta. This is not new - every time I update macOS, some of the system settings are changed to default including some in the firewall. And I have to painstakingly go through all of it and change it. Also, the few times I've reinstalled or updated macOS, I've always noticed that it takes longer for the installation if your system has access to the internet - so now I've made it a practice to switch of the router while installing or updating macOS or ios. (With all the AI bullshit being integrated everywhere in Windows, macOS and Android etc., I expect this kind of \"offloading\" of personal data, and downloading of data, to / from AI servers to keep increasing, especially during updates, to \"prepare\" for the new AI features in the newer OS updates. No internet means the installer is forced to skip it for later, saving you some valuable time, and hopefully you get to change the default setting before it starts up again. Whatever the claims of AI processing done on the Mac or iDevices itself, some \"offloading\" to their servers, will still happen, especially if the default settings - which you can change only after the OS is installed - also enables analytics and data collection.)

It has come in enormously long way since then. I am not exaggerating when I say, I have a better out of the box experience with Fedora. Then I do with Mac OS. Mac OS certainly has a lot of features, and visually has a great deal of Polish, but it also increasingly has a lot of bugs. reply vundercind 3 hours agorootparentI try every couple years. I tried KDE on Fedora last time (I hate gnome since 3) and could still crash various KDE apps with drag-n-drop operations—I’d trained myself never to use those outside narrow situations on Windows and Linux years ago because they usually broke things or did something stupid, but am now accustomed to them both working and doing something reasonable, so I spot those issues in a hurry when I use other environments now, and no longer accept that as just the way things are. Among other jank and poor stability, that’s just an example. IIRC making caps another control anywhere I was logged in—not just in KDE—was weirdly hard, too. Five or six years ago my Ubuntu tv-attached old desktop forgot how to decrypt the root disk its own installer had encrypted, after an OS upgrade. My Debian server required manual intervention (busting out my rusty Gentoo chroot grub-installing skills) to install its bootloader. The manual version went the same aa usual and had no problems so no clue WTF the installer was trying to do, but it consistently failed, and this was boring, old business-class Lenovo workstation hardware. That was four or five years ago. Basically when I try to go back I’m missing lots of features and it’s less stable than what I’m now accustomed to, so end up wasting a bunch of time and regretting it. reply aunty_helen 3 hours agorootparentHard in this camp too. The OS tinkering that is as requirement of Linux racks up a massive time investment. When you use your computer for work, that bill gets big quick and sometimes it's an inconvenience you just can't afford. MacOS, for all it's faults, can be tamed with little snitch and a slower update cycle, and then you have a relatively solid system. There's still some things to hate, like when I take my airpods out if I accidentally click one of the buttons Apple Music opens (no one wants to use Apple Music, ever). But, that little frustraition pales in comparison to the build your own experience a poweruser in Linux faces on a weekly basis. This randomly came front of mind last night when I thought, I can't remember the last time something broke on my laptop. It's been literal months since I've had anything weird or unwanted that I've _had_ to deal with. Contrast that to the last time I tried to daily Linux, about 2 years ago when I bought a framework and couldn't even log in due to trackpad issues, sleep / hibernate issues, screen resizing issues, issues issues issues. reply consteval 23 minutes agorootparentThe reason you have to tinker with MacOS and not Linux is because you're fine with how MaxOS is set up. So you waste your time in Linux getting it to behave like MacOS. Obviously if you go into it with the assumption MacOS is correct and the more like MacOS you are, the better, then Linux distros will fail horribly. People do this with Windows, too. If you go into it expecting Windows-isms you're gonna be very disappointed. And such \"isms\" aren't actually good at all - usually they suck. But because you already know them, they aren't \"isms\" anymore, they're now expectations. If you go back to the very first few times you used MacOS (or OSX at the time), you'll realize there was a lot of shit that surprised you. You adapted, and in some cases have actually come to PREFER functionality that sucks. And now you expect it, and that's the problem. reply vundercind 3 hours agorootparentprevI have plenty of complaints about Apple’s stuff, but my consistent experience when I try to use something else, for the last decade+, is that I’m jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire. Even goes for things like Shield vs Apple TV. I very much wish they had one or more peers putting them under pressure to do better, but the (tiny—which is likely part of the problem) set of competitors seem to have other priorities than chasing the particular market that Apple does. reply ActorNightly 42 minutes agorootparentprevI don't get why people still spread the lie that you have to tinker with Linux. Like right now, I can give you a laptop with a clean Linux Mint install, and you never have to touch the terminal for anything system config to do work. Seriously, its not that hard to say that you prefer MacOS because you like the feel of it. It does a lot of handholding for you, unlike Linux, which makes it way less likely for you to mess something up. You don't have to go the extra lengths to justify it lol. reply aunty_helen 3 minutes agorootparentI’ll put this out there, currently there’s no better platform than macOS on apple silicon for developing ai systems. I’m not a stranger to Linux or the command line. I own, use, configure servers as part of my business, including the dreaded on metal cuda install. In fact, the terminal integration in macOS is one of the biggest things over windows for me. But, every time I try linux desktop, for the past 20 years, it’s been a horrible time sink and has driven home the point that building a competent and most importantly consistent gui based os is harder than everyone gives it credit for. I stopped using Linux mint after installing it on my desktop and having the screen saver require a hard reboot -sometimes- when trying to wake. mh- 6 minutes agorootparentprev> I don't get why people still spread the lie that you have to tinker with Linux. It doesn't feel charitable to call people sharing their experience \"spreading the lie\". You're all over this thread talking to people that way. If you're trying to make the case that desktop Linux no longer has this characteristic, this isn't the way to go about it. TheSkyHasEyes 3 hours agorootparentprevGive XFCE a chance. > That was four or five years ago. Linux moves way faster than commercial OS IMO. Reconsider linux. Commercial OS isn't going to 'get better' for IT literate users. :/ reply vundercind 3 hours agorootparentXFCE was my favorite back in my Gentoo days, after I started using laptop hardware fast enough that it wasn’t noticeably slower than my prior favorite, WindowMaker :-) When I used early Ubuntus on desktop machines (back when Ubuntu wasn’t terrible—before the PulseAudio fiasco and the following series of bad decisions and failed maneuvers against Red Hat) I usually just stuck with the default of Gnome2. That era’s by far the closest I’ve seen Linux get to Just Working. [edit] FWIW I do find Void with a very-light window manager pleasant to use, but I don’t want to have to self-serve every little feature these days, so it’s pleasant but impractical for my actual life. Nothing short of a full DE, so just KDE or Gnome, with a batteries-included distro, stands a chance of matching what I’m used to just being there and happening for me without my having to ask for it. Unfortunately, I strongly dislike both of those DEs for different reasons. :-/ reply herpdyderp 2 hours agorootparentprevHard disagree. Every Linux-running personal computer that I use or have used is a terrible experience. Something is always broken, the whole system needs to be hard rebooted at least a few times a week, parts of the OS will randomly stop working each day, the list goes on and on. macOS is not perfect by any means, but at least I can actually get work done on it. reply ActorNightly 46 minutes agorootparentIn early 2010s this was sometimes the case. In modern days, you can daily drive linux without issues.

I wonder if you have some interesting hardware... reply tsimionescu 2 hours agorootparentprevI very much doubt that. I tried installing Fedora on my new laptop, and the defaults are horrible. It doesn't even support two-finger gestures on the login screen, so you have to right click in a different way before logging in. At least it's not as bad as Ubuntu, which allowed me with a simple warning to install Nvidia drivers without a full system update, which broke the system so badly it couldn't even boot anymore, o an otherwise newly installed setup. And Debian is horrible too, it doesn't even have a task bar of any kind (you are forced to Alt tab to switch apps, or even see which other apps are running), unless you go hunting for some extensions someone made. All of these can be made to work decently, but calling it a good out of the box experience is laughable. reply KronisLV 2 hours agorootparentprev> and visually has a great deal of Polish It's great that they translated the UI in that language! Jokes aside, I use a mix of Windows 10, Windows 11, Linux Mint (have had a few DEB and RPM distros on the desktop too) and macOS. I have to say, that all of them are serviceable. Windows is sometimes quite annoying to deal with, but has a lot of software for it (the likes of PowerToys, MobaXTerm, WinSCP, System Informer, Handbrake, 7-Zip, HWiNFO64, MiniTool Partition Wizard, MPC-HC, Rufus, ShareX, XSplit VCam, VSeeFace and others). You can do most of the same things in alternative software in other OSes, but there's a huge variety to be found, same as with running most of the games out there natively. The UI feels hit or miss and worse in Windows 11 than in 10 in some regards (no vertical taskbar, for example, need fixes for the context menu etc.), but the OS feels usable. Linux Mint and other Linux distros are pretty much ideal for software development, hands down. Most tools work, the resource usage is great, there's a huge knowledgebase on how to do things out there, it's quite customizable and can be used on servers, desktop computers or even an old low spec laptop alike. I personally settled on Cinnamon, but XFCE was very usable and someone might prefer GNOME or KDE (there were even attempts at reviving the old Unity desktop from Ubuntu, that one might have gotten hate when it was the main option, but actually had its nice bits too). Gaming is hit or miss with Proton (many games will run but definitely not all, also forget about playing anything with invasive anti-cheat solutions), sometimes you also won't be able to get some productivity software running, if it's developed only with Windows in mind, Wine isn't a silver bullet but it's nice that it exists. My M1 MacBook as an overall computer feels like it has great build quality despite the overpriced hardware. I'm mentioning that, because it's very well integrated with the hardware and I haven't had any weirdness due to that yet, like the touchpad on a laptop stopping working after a fresh Fedora install, or needing to compile Wi-Fi drivers from a GitHub repo for it to work at all, or Windows looking at the RAM available in a laptop and deciding that it wants most of it for itself and to slow everything down to a crawl. In macOS, the desktop also feels polished, is reasonably customizable, though sometimes is a bit jarring compared to both Windows and Linux distros, as are the things surrounding it (everything from the keyboard layout, to how managing open programs works, also connecting to an external 1080p monitor is a miserable experience because it doesn't fit within their own hardware ecosystem either). Development is doable, unless you go for the 8 GB version because you need the OS for a project and can't afford anything more, gaming feels way more limited than on Linux distros, but nothing feels particularly broken either. Neither is ideal, neither is horrible. They're all somewhere in the middle, doing more or less well when it comes to particular aspects. reply pndy 21 minutes agorootparent> It's great that they translated the UI in that language! Bit offtopic but since you nudged it: The oldest Polish localization of MacOS was done by a private company that insisted on using more \"appropriate linguistically\" terms that have roots in the 70s Polish IT. Tho, some people claimed it was just an attempt to separate Apple's system from Microsoft's even more dramatically. And for example instead of \"icon\" - \"ikona\" that translation introduced \"stamp - \"znaczek\"; \"edit\" menu item - \"edycja\" (sometimes \"edytuj\", depending on program) was \"change\" - \"zmiana\", \"folder\" that stayed as it is become \"teczka\", \"briefcase\". The most prominent example is the \"cancel\" translation, which elsewhere become \"anuluj\" but the team opted for \"abandon\", \"cease\" - \"poniechaj\", tho some argue it should be \"desist\" - \"zaniechaj\". The first official Leopard translation followed let's say, the 'industry standard', tho \"desktop\" still is being called there \"biurko\" while Linux and Windows uses term \"pulpit\" which is more close to \"dashboard\". The discourse that happen around \"cancel\" translation is still bring up on few occasions, as an example of trying to preserve origins of that old IT glossary and also of being nonconformistic to the ridiculous levels for some weird personal reasons. Echoes of that translation can be seen in the Polish KDE localization - there's one contributor who insists for using these rather obscure and weird terms: https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=404286 and since there's no official community nor team (to my knowledge), that translation gets approved and makes KDE looking weird for someone coming from Windows reply backtoyoujim 2 hours agorootparentprevcan it send txt messages to a phone ? reply RunSet 3 hours agorootparentprevI have an M2 Macbook Pro mostly gathering dust and waiting until Debian supports it rather than dip so much as a toe into Apple's crass software ecosystem.

There are literally thousands of possible combinations of accessibility features alone, that are vastly more difficult to impossible to access. Or simply don’t exist in any form. Once you add in all the default apps and functions of Mac OS, there’s likely millions of possible combinations that would take a fortune in time and effort and knowledge to replicate maybe a quarter of, on a hypothetical laptop installed with Linux.

Yes? Why would people recommend it as an alternative otherwise? I used MacOS for 5 years, left after Mojave and came back when an employer made me support MacOS. The current software experience on Mac is genuinely insufferable. Advertisements in your news, notifications begging you to try Safari, zero support for common and Open Source filesystems, constantly broken software packaging, zero useful APIs (what am I supposed to do with Metal???) and a $99/year tax to compensate for the displeasure of supporting developers. You really want to argue Apple cares about you? As a software developer, what pushed me over the edge was Docker. It runs absolutely terrible on MacOS, consumes resources/battery and makes your CPU hot as satan's taint. Native development is a nightmare on MacOS and you just have to settle with that if you want to defend it as your home.

I’ve found some of the alternative VM hosts for that to be a ton faster and more power efficient, as they make better use of MacOS’ built-in virtualization system, but YMMV. I’ve also found that Apple’s lead on power management is so great that I can be using a power-sucking thing like Docker and still come out ahead, which is really lame :-/ I hear that “Docker Desktop” is especially bad on MacOS, but I’ve used docker almost as long as it’s existed and still haven’t used that (I don’t really even know what the point of it is?) so dunno about that part. reply not_a_bot_4sho 3 hours agorootparentprevnext [2 more] [flagged] vundercind 1 hour agorootparentExcept I’ve personally used and written software for the big three consumer operating systems, each for many years, plus both major mobile operating systems, and have used a few minor or defunct operating systems for significant lengths of time.

Focusing on the browser is a step away from the point: if I'm not signed in, I don't want sound playing from any app⁰. I've had Windows do something similar, a media player deciding to unpause when coming up from hibernate (this was before Windows seemingly broke hibernate) and for some reason being at full volume, and it was a fair few seconds before I was able to login, get to that app, and hit pause again. It didn't leak anything sensitive (Hey everyone, this guy watches Stargate!) but it made me “that guy we all hate” on the train… Again it is the app that is responsible for making the sound, but I think at that point the OS shouldn't let it. I miss the times when laptops had physical volume sliders… To me this has the feeling of making a mountain out of a molehill, but I don't think there is any denying that the molehill itself exists and to others it might be more than the very minor irritation it could be to me. > I bet that if you configured the browser to never auto-play, this wouldn’t happen. I bet that no matter how tightly you try to control that, some advertiser will find a way to override it to make sound play, and sods law says that will happen when you most want your waking laptop to be quiet.

It's like being literally unable to dog Opening a laptop, even if the last activity was blaring obnoxious carnival music, should _allow_, not _demand_ the user to resume their last function - which was explicitly to _pause_ the laptop, by closing the lid. If I close the lid, I am done with the computer and video; it is obvious that I am done right now - the OS/browser would be alerted of LidDown, and I would expect the OS to tell the browser to Pause (via some new javascript media API that I am sure exists), pagefile ram if possible/needed, and dump all console.logs to a temp directory, in case restarting from hibernation goes awry. If I open the lid, I am attempting to use the computer. The previous quest can be pertinent or moot; but it would be oddly assumptive (against the ethos of general computing) to _automagically_ resume (especially a paused) playback just from first button press - at least give me the option to explore, format, or rename the thing. reply AstralStorm 8 hours agorootparentYou're asking the OSes to actually implement proper session management and centralized leak controls?

It’s one area where it’s vastly superior to any other OS I’ve frequently used (including Windows, all of the common BSDs, and more Linux distros than you’ve heard of). With pretty much any printer brand sold at Office Max, Mac printing looks like: 1. Hit cmd-P. 2. Find the printer in the pop up window and click the Print button. 3. Walk over and get the paper. The same’s true for AirPrint from iPhones and iPads. I don’t remember the last time I had trouble printing from any of those to any Brother or Canon or HP around any of the offices I’ve helped.

Last absolute head scratcher was syncing multiple Gmail accounts with a variety of passwords and passkeys to a single iCalendar.

Only the (archaic) Xerox needed a .ppd file from Xerox. The others are running with default drivers supplied with the system, and all work as first-class citizens, with all their features enabled (incl. the Xerox). Same is true for iPhone/AirPrint. As long as the mDNS packets are unhindered in the network, and the printer has semi-decent AirPrint support, they work automagically. Again, Samsung and HP printers are networked and AirPrint enabled. All any any devices (Linux / Windows / macOS / iOS / Android) on their respective networks can and do print without any drivers to these printers. They start printing instantly, with all features enabled, and honoring all options selected in the print dialog. I have two Google accounts on my iPhone and Mac, but only one of them uses passkeys IIRC, and absolutely have no problems for now.

I do own a flipper zero(I was one of the first backers so I've had it for a while). Admittedly it's a bit over-hyped and I never saw it as an rf swiss army knife because of it's limitations and shortcomings. The two shortcomings I saw were the price and the lack of WiFi built in. In reality, if this project gets paired with a single board computer, this would truly be a match made in heaven. An 18650 lipo battery to power them on, a cheap stl file for a 3d printed case and you have a disposable one-off hacking device(as in drop it somewhere for a one time task and do everything remotely over ssh and a proxy like ngrok or bore). Admittedly I started working on something of the sorts a while back though I never really got anywhere due to the lack of time. I actually wanted to include LoRa to the equation to make it truly off the grid.

The 'entry level ' one is the M5stickC, which is about the size of your thumb, has a couple of buttons, a screen, a grove connector (to attach peripherals), an accelerometer, a real time clock chip, and a battery for around $20. All their stuff is programmable in C or in MicroPython, and they have a Scratch-type building-block interface called UIflow which lets you prototype in MP very fast, and is extensible with your own modules. You kind of need it even if you're competent in Python because the documentation tends to be barebones and focus on the electronic schematics, so the UIflow software components are the API documentation. Expressif's own documentation is very good so this may be changing since they acquired M5stack, but I still find UIflow the fastest way to get hands-on with a new module. reply andreock 7 hours agoparentprevI will check it, thank you. reply HWR_14 17 hours agoprevThe big advantage of the FlipperZero is the community developing software.

Both my motorcycles now have about $8 worth of AliExpress parts including a CC1101 rf module hooked top to the high beam globe, so I can just flash my hi beams at the garage door and it opens via 433MHz magic. It was super easy to know how to build that when I'd experimented with \"listening\" to the keychain garage door opener with the FZ, and playing back the signal at the garage door. To get from there to a first prototype with a CC1101 module and an Arduino, then a second prototype with a CC1101 and an AT-Tiny installed on a bike was so obviously just going to work that it was a heap of fun. Without the \"instant gratification\" of being able to record the garage door opener key fob with the FZ and play it back to open the door, and the knowledge that the FZ did that just by using a inexpensive microcontroller driving a CC1101 module itself, I'd probably never even done more than wonder about how to do it. reply sedatk 15 hours agorootparent> “listening\" to the keychain garage door opener with the FZ, and playing back the signal That would only work with older garage doors that don’t use rolling codes, wouldn’t it? reply bigiain 12 hours agorootparentYep. Non rolling code garage doors seem to be ubiquitous in rental properties here (Sydney Australia). Rolling codes are better. But if you haven't seen it, Samy Kamkar has a device called Roll Jam, take a look at the last ~5 mins of this Defcon23 talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgvShN4USU (The TL;DR of the trick there is: Jam the radio signal a key fob sends so a car/garage fairly wide band receiver can't hear it. At the same time listen with a better tuned receiver. Wait for someone to press their key fob and record the code, then wait for them to press it again and record the second code - then stop jamming and replay the 1st code you captured.

Yep, more wires and modules. But hey, most devices want at least 4 wires (VCC/GND/A FEW SIGNALs), and other devices want more, to handle clocks and timing. And that's only if your thing supports IC2 and you have enough GPIO. Otherwise you need multiplexers. Any one of these things can be done with less than a dollar in parts.

Perhaps the C line (e.g. C6) would be more suited. Espressif CEO expressed commitment to RISC-V (now already years ago) and they've stopped releasing new chips with tensilica ISA.

Back on the 8266 it was even worse as there were a lot of gpio pins you couldn’t use at all! The S3 also has a built in hardware debugger accessible with its new built in USB pins. Previously you had to attach an external jtag debugger. The one thing I’ve noticed is the S3 is a bit of a “breaking” hardware revision and things like the arduino pin library haven’t quite caught up yet to some of the new features. Things like WLED or FastLED haven’t caught up quite yet either. reply ingen0s 17 hours agoprevThank you reply blackeyeblitzar 20 hours agoprev [–] Does anyone know what the legality of these are?

    "originBody": "Kailash Nadh CTO @ Zerodha Announcing FLOSS/fund: $1M per year for free and open source projects 15 Oct 2024 TLDR; Apply now We are excited to announce the launch of a dedicated fund aimed at providing financial assistance to Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FOSS/FLOSS) projects globally, with an annual commitment of $1 million. I will use the FOSS acronym in this post hereafter. This has been in the works for some time at Zerodha[↗], where we have been developing financial technology products and services built on an ever-growing FOSS stack. Without the high-quality FOSS projects that we have freely downloaded and used to build our organisation, products, and services, we would not exist as we do today—free as in both cost and freedom. A significant portion of our success and growth is owed to FOSS, encompassing everything from programming languages to operating systems, to databases, web servers, frontend frameworks, productivity tools, code editors, and absolutely everything. It goes without saying that this holds true for nearly every technology company founded in the last decade, whether it is publicly acknowledged or not. And yet, funding and financial sustainability, the lack thereof really, has been an increasingly hot topic over the last many years. Well, at least since cloud companies began making massive profits directly repackaging FOSS projects built by hobbyists and communities. The rise of the \"open core\" model and the unfortunate license changes in many good open projects recently, are clear signs of this growing turmoil. Many potential solutions seem to be emerging and evoling—commercial services, Venture Capital (VC) funding, and programs like GitHub Sponsors[↗], Open Collective[↗], FUTO[↗], Polar[↗], and Buy me a coffee[↗], amongst others. That said, Python libraries raising massive amounts of VC funding in quick time does not look like a healthy trend. Why are we here, though? The fundamental tenets of FOSS, the spirit of hacking, liberty, and reciprocity, while they have worked beautifully with code, have translated poorly into the highly commercial BigTech era. So far, it has been nearly impossible to quantify and structure ideas of goodwill and reciprocity into financial sustenance for FOSS projects. I recall the log4j incident from a couple of years ago which unleashed a spate of philosophical debates around FOSS, in which I also participated[↗], rather ideologically. For us, FLOSS/fund is about hacker goodwill, reciprocity, and common sense business strategy. We invite you to apply for funding. If you would like to understand the motivations behind this, a bit of storytelling lies ahead. Prelude The very first thing I did when we started Zerodha Tech more than a decade ago was to install Python and start scripting and automating time-consuming, mundane organisational tasks. Then came Postgres for building a small data warehouse, followed by PHP and WordPress for managing our website. From there, as we slowly grew the organisation, our technology stack expanded one piece of FOSS at a time, eventually leading to us becoming the largest stock broker in India several years later. Personally, my mental markup as a software developer and hacker is rooted in the simple act of copy-pasting open source code from the internet to hack, tinker, learn, and solve problems. An alternate vision is very difficult for me to comprehend, and a non-FOSS path to building technology, let alone an organisation, has never seemed logical. At Zerodha, over the years, we have contributed upstream to many projects that we use, as well as spun off and released several small and large FOSS projects[↗] from our work. In 2019, we made a sizeable investment in ERPNext[↗], a FOSS ERP that we had begun using extensively. In 2020, we co-founded the FOSS United Foundation[↗], which works on developing the FOSS ecosystem in India, and backed the creation of TinkerSpace[↗], a physical hackerspace and community center that hosts FOSS tinkering for young people. In 2023, we were a founding member of OASIS (Open-Source Alliance for Social Innovation and Sustainability)[↗], which focuses on FOSS capacity building and adoption in social sector non-profit organisations. Many of us from our team also volunteer at non-profits, helping drive meaningful FOSS adoption in the development sector, where even basic technological requirements are woefully unmet. We fund many of these initiatives with long-term commitments. In addition, we have given out many sizeable grants to FOSS projects and organisations in India. While funding projects outside India involves significant paperwork and operational overhead, we have reached out to several small and large projects that we use at work and have managed to pay them. This highly ad hoc approach is something that has increasingly bugged me though. While it is good to provide financial support to FOSS-aligned activities, most importantly, money ought to go directly to the source—invaluable FOSS projects. We have managed to build a commercially successful business on top of FOSS that we have freely, in both cost and freedom, adopted from all over the world. Therefore, \"ad hoc\" and \"reaching out\" simply do not suffice—we have to shut up or put up. Thus, structure. And that is how the idea of a structured, dedicated fund for FOSS projects globally, was born. We spent several months speaking to various banks, payment processors, and lawyers to finally arrive at a reasonably streamlined process. The fund will: Have a small, dedicated team to operate it properly in a non-adhoc manner, functioning like an OSPO (Open Source Program Office) but focused on funding projects—an OSFO (Open Source Funding Office), perhaps? Put money where the mouth is—a minimum of $10,000 and up to $100,000 for a single recipient, totaling $1 million per year, which we will increase once we understand the dynamics of running the fund. Source applications globally, relying on incoming applications through for discovering projects in need of support rather than the limited visibility we have as a small team. Form an interim internal selection committee to make discretionary selections. Once potential edge cases and any gotchas in running the program are handled, we will attempt to establish a public selection committee from the FOSS ecosystem with a community voting process for applications. More structure: funding.json Expanding a bit on \"ad hoc\" and \"reaching out\" I mentioned earlier, the majority of our experience paying projects has transpired like this: On a random day, we realise that a certain FOSS project has become very useful to us. After a bit of online searching, we find the developer's email address. We write to the developer, thanking them for their work, explaining how useful we find it, and expressing our interest in financially supporting it. They respond, thanking us but stating that they have not thought of any specific numbers. After a bit of friendly back and forth, we suggest an arbitrary amount, followed by more discussion about logistics and paperwork. This process of arriving at numbers over personal e-mails is awkward for both parties. It addition, it typically takes weeks, requiring time, commitment, and bandwidth from both the developer and the donor to complete a single transaction. Models like Open Collective and GitHub Sponsors address this to some extent, but there is no open, decentralized mechanism for discovering projects in need of financial assistance nor gaining insights into their specific needs. Any attempt on funding FOSS projects generally warrants clarity on several questions. Does the project under consideration need financial assistance? Or perhaps it is not just one particular project, but a developer or a group of developers who maintain several projects that need assistance. What kind and quantum of financial assistance are needed, and for what activities? Is there a structured support plan that the developers offer? Has the project received any funding in the past? Is it in dire need of support, or is it doing reasonably well? What payment methods are accepted? Is there a payment link or address that can be used without manual contact, or is something like a bank wire that is required? Once there is enough context, and a conversation is warranted, how does one reach out to the right person who address financial or logistical queries? That's about one project. But what about a particular category of projects? Maybe it is an emerging or critical area, and it would make sense to support multiple projects there. How does one discover them? What if the answers to such questions could be structured in a machine readable format, which could be crawled, indexed, catalogued, and made discoverable—similar to a robots.txt or package.json or sitemap.xml, but for funding. In the process, eliminating a lot of awkwardness and apprehension that would be otherwise transpire over back-and-forth personal e-mails discussing financial matters. How about a standardised funding.json manifest file that can be added to project repositories and websites signalling their financial needs?

This file is not meant to convey everything there is to know—an impossible task—but to solicit interest and communicate enough to ensure discoverability which would not be possible otherwise. Refer to the funding.json docs to know more. Applications that come through to the FLOSS/fund will be indexed and published on the dir.floss.fund directory / portal, making them publicly discoverable by anyone interested in supporting projects. This is going to be an interesting experiment. Fingers crossed! Motivations What are the motivations behind the fund? On a personal level, it is common sense, goodwill, and reciprocity—the spirit of FOSS. From a for-profit enterprise perspective, however, terms like \"goodwill\" and \"reciprocity\" are notoriously problematic, and most likely fundamentally incompatible with their very nature. But, that is a separate philosophical debate altogether. Setting philosophies aside, it makes perfect logical sense for a business that relies on FOSS to support it, directly or indirectly, when they freely tap into a global ecosystem of unlimited FOSS innovation—free in both cost and freedom. How many technology companies today could even exist without the massive amounts of FOSS they use? Ensuring that this ecosystem thrives, without inadvertently turning parts of it into a classic tragedy of the commons, everything aside, is good, logical business strategy. At the very least, a profitable business should allocate a tiny fraction of its profits to support the projects it is directly reliant on. When many startups have advertising and marketing budgets that often put public spending to shame, one would be hard-pressed to find a reason not to give a bit of money to the projects they depend on for their very existence. Thus, FLOSS/fund's motivations are to: Exercise our goodwill and reciprocity on a personal level as FOSS hackers. Exercise our organisational business sense and strategy to help the FOSS ecosystem thrive, without which our business cannot exist. Encourage and apply a bit of peer-pressure on other businesses to setup structured financial support programmes for FOSS. Contribute to existing FOSS funding models and to the sustainability conversations and debates. As a bonus: Explore whether the funding.json manifest experiment can bring discoverability to the financial needs of FOSS projects on a large scale. Let us see how this goes. Apply now",

It's also not just about the initial (typically multi-stage) application, but then the reporting and compliance requirements, the random donor requests.

The software is basically \"complete.\" How does funding work for someone like me? I have no initiatives with it that require funding. Occasionally, I need to fix a bizarre obscure bug, or support a new python version/feature (async/await being the last big one). But otherwise, I just field questions a few times a month. Truth be told, I'd rather be done with the project completely. It's like a little monkey on my back that I can never be rid of, that I must always tend to. But at the same time, since I can never realistically receive funding for it, the only value I get is the fact that my name is on it. I wish a big, legit company would just buy it off of me somehow, but there's no incentive for them either. I don't know how this ends. 1. https://github.com/amoffat/sh reply andris9 4 hours agoparentI had the exact same experience with Nodemailer, a popular open-source project I started 14 years ago. My solution was to empty the README file and set up a dedicated documentation website. Since the project is popular, the documentation website receives around 70,000 visits per month. I initially tried paid ads, but they only netted about $200 per month—not great. So, I started a commercial project somewhat related to Nodemailer and added ads for my new project on Nodemailer’s documentation page. This brings in around 3,000 visits per month to my paid project through the ads on the documentation page. Even if the conversion rate is low, it’s essentially free traffic for my paid project, which is now approaching $10,000 MRR. Without the free visitor flow from my OSS project’s documentation page, I definitely wouldn’t have made it this far. reply black_puppydog 3 hours agorootparentThis is a really interesting approach, I hadn't thought of this! Just out of curiosity, do you think the separate documentation page has better conversion than if you were to, say, include the ad directly into the readme inside the repo? reply andris9 3 hours agorootparentYou have less control over formatting and ad placement in the README file, as rendered markdown offers only limited options. With a dedicated documentation website, it’s much easier. It’s also a question of sovereignty. If your documentation is in the README, then GitHub owns the audience. If they, for some reason, close your project, you’re finished. With your own documentation page, the risk is much lower. reply myprotegeai 3 hours agorootparentprevThanks for sharing. It's an interesting idea, to try to trampoline it into another related commercial project. I just checked my RTD analytics, I get around 1k pageviews to `/` per month. Unfortunately I don't have a related commercial product either. reply andris9 2 hours agorootparentWhen I started with Nodemailer, my goal was to build a cool product—not to become an unpaid helpdesk employee for life. But here we are. So, I’ve been trying to monetize the project in various ways for the past ten years. I’ve tried everything (license restrictions, freelancing and consulting, paid extensions, etc.), and each approach failed for different reasons. The only strategy that actually took off was using Nodemailer’s documentation page as a referral source for another relevant paid project. reply aserafini 3 hours agorootparentprevVery interesting!

And people who do not spend their time indexing high-quality open source but trust other people that DO spend their time indexing high-quality open source can have an index fund of donation streams.

BoldContacts is a mobile app that helps people who have disabilities: https://github.com/BoldContacts/boldcontacts-mobile-app-for-... Results so far: 1. The JSON spec validation seems to be problematic. For example, I get an error message and there's no obvious way to handle it: \"entity.webpageUrl.url and manifest URL host and paths do not match. Expected entity.webpageUrl.wellKnown for provenance check at https://linktr.ee/joelparkerhenderson/*/.well-known/funding-...\" 2. An opportunity for improvement is for the JSON spec to favor each project having all it's own information in the JSON file i.e. orient the file toward the project, rather than toward a specific developer, and definitely not toward the naming convention of \"/.well-known\" subdirectory (which doesn't exist in many projects and has a history of glitches because it's a hidden dot directory). IMHO success looks like making the file spec simpler, even it means skipping some of the manifest capabilities. reply mr-karan 2 hours agoparentHey, I'm from Zerodha team. 1. Regarding the validation, this error seems to be related to the provenance check mechanism in the spec. This is to prove ownership of that project/domain. The wellKnown field is designed to handle cases where the webpageUrl doesn't match the manifest URL. 2. Will definitely be passing the feedback to our team and evaluate this further! reply jph 2 hours agorootparentThanks for the reply.

It's nice that more funds are available, but my best guess would be that these will go to projects which probably don't really need them anyway.

Successful projects in terms of usage and impact that can't be maintained by volunteers alone? reply kijin 4 hours agorootparentWhat does a one-time donation between $10k and $100k do to help the second case? Perhaps it will allow the maintainer to take a few months off and work full-time on the project, or maybe hire someone to clear the backlog. But what happens afterward? Without a clear pathway to making the project self-sustaining, you've merely postponed maintainer burnout by a couple of years at best. The biggest problem with occasional $15 donations is that they're occasional.

Thousands and thousands of downloads over the years and the creator has earned only a hundred dollars in donations.

If you get invited a hundred times for dinner without inviting back or bringing a bottle of wine, then you're a freeloader. And the guy inviting you is being taken advantage of, he's not being generous. Especially if you start charging other people for eating dinner for free at his house. Funnily, I've noted in tech circles, that they many times in the real world do not understand reciprocity. They get invited or treated to something and say \"that was great, thanks!\".

Thank you, this is an interesting suggestion. While a non-profit structure could potentially increase donations, implementing this globally would be extremely complex. Particularly because tax laws vary by country, which would require us to be registered as a non-profit in most, if not all countries, and comply with their jurisdiction. The administrative overhead and legal complexities of managing a truly international non-profit outweighs the benefits for our current scale.

    "originBody": "Why Don’t We Use Awnings Anymore JULY 11, 2022 by Scott Sidler 3041 Share on Facebook 7417 Share on Pinterest 1694 Share on Twitter 1742 Share on Reddit Image Credit: 123rf.com When you look at old black and white pictures of cities from before the 1950s you may notice something on most buildings that are no longer there today. Awnings. They were ubiquitous over nearly every window of buildings from the most basic single family home to massive buildings like The White House. Where did all these awnings go and why did they disappear? Before we answer that let’s look at what an awning actually does for a building. How Do Awnings Work? Awnings were and still are extremely effective at blocking solar heat gain through windows. We often look at builders from the 19th century with a pitying condescension like they just weren’t as smart as we are today. To me it’s really despicable the lack of respect we give these incredibly talented contractors who were able to design and construct these solid structures that have withstood the test of time without the use of computers, power tools, or energy codes. They built these structures with incredibly clever passive heating and cooling systems like the double-hung window, making the best of the technological limitations of their day to create buildings that could keep people relatively comfortably even in extreme temperatures and awnings were a major part of that. Awnings work by covering the top portion of window and thereby blocking the high summer sun from pouring into the window and heating the room. Since in the winter the sun is lower in the sky the awning, when positioned and sized properly, allows the winter sun into the room to warm things up. No adjusting, no tweaking, just completely passive heating in the winter and cooling in the summer by a thoughtful design. The metal frame could last for decades without needing changing, and the fabric covering would need to be replaced every 8-10 years depending on exposure and climate. Why Awnings Disappeared So where did all the awnings go? Two simple words…air conditioning. Before the widespread adoption of air conditioning, awnings were the preferred way to keep buildings cooler. But just because we invented AC does that mean we don’t need the help that awnings provide? In the middle of the 20th century as air conditioning was gradually installed in homes across America, awnings came down or wore out and were not replaced because now we had the technology to mechanically cool our buildings. Energy costs were relatively cheap in those decades and one generation later when energy prices jumped up during the 1970s people seemed to have forgotten about awnings for energy savings. We jumped into the insulation craze and began stuffing fiberglass into every wall and ceiling as fast as possible, forgetting what our fathers and grandfathers knew to be true. If you kept the sun out of the windows you could keep the heat out of the building. Today, awnings are mainly used as signage for storefronts and coverings to keep rain off of customers. Retractable awnings to cover decks and patios have picked up in the ensuing decades and remain a market for manufacturers, but the days of covering individual windows with awnings have gone away. In this age of increasing energy prices, I’m hopeful the awning will swing back into popularity since it is an extremely simple way to keep temperatures moderated throughout the year. Time will tell. How about you? Would you consider adding awnings to your house to keep your heating and cooling costs down? If not then why? Let me know in the comments below. Subscribe Now For Your FREE eBook!

Because those are the actual reasons. reply michaelt 9 hours agorootparentAC was indeed important. But also: We still sometimes use things like awnings, just in the form of 'porches' or modern-looking 'slat awnings' Changes in architectural fashion has made some forms of awning look dated. Fabric awnings need upkeep to keep them looking smart. When the awnings are above ground level, it's semi-expensive upkeep. Building owners are tempted to keep those tired, sun-bleached awnings in place rather than renewing them - contributing to the dated reputation of awnings. Awnings also face competition from interior curtains and blinds, which are much simpler to maintain. And there's shifting building use. A few decades ago an office worker would prize a desk by a big window with lots of natural light to read paperwork by, but in the age of PCs nobody wants direct sunlight on their screen. Internal blinds let workers control the light levels to match their needs. reply upofadown 7 hours agorootparent>Awnings also face competition from interior curtains and blinds, which are much simpler to maintain. But not significant competition. If the blinds are very reflective a small amount of sunlight might end up going out again but in general, once the solar radiation converts to heat you can't get it back out through the window. That is particularly true for modern multi-pane windows. reply ygra 7 hours agorootparentThat's why shutters (roller or hinged) exist that are on the outside of the windows. Here in Southern Germany pretty much every window has them and since they block the sun outside the window, it can help a lot not getting the interior too warm. reply Retric 5 hours agorootparentExternal shudders don’t help when it’s 100+f at night and they are just as hot as the surroundings.

However, they are not great for keeping heat out during the day; yeah if you close them you get protected from the heat of the sun, but also from its light. An awning will let the ambient daylight through and not turn your room into a cave reply Retric 5 hours agorootparentprevAwnings fail to deal with heat gain from the surrounding. So, in hot environments they can be less effective than insulating curtains inside the window which also help at night when it’s still 100+f outside. This is especially true if you have an overhang, trees, etc providing even modest shade. reply sickofparadox 5 hours agorootparentThey would compliment each other because the purpose of the awning is to prevent the heat of the sun from entering the house.

Sunlight bouncing off a reflective curtain and going outside is one of their benefits. An awning is a net benefit over a curtain alone, but there’s overlap in functionality so having a curtain reduces the net saving from adding an awning. reply cruffle_duffle 4 hours agorootparentprev> Once it's in, even if there are insulating curtains, the heat is still in the house. While I understand this “once the heat is inside” thing I still can’t help but feel closing the curtains (and blackout curtains) makes a non-trivial impact on the overall daytime temperature of a sun facing room. I get the goal is to reflect the energy back out and of your curtains are pure black that absorbs all the energy it would, in theory, heat the room as much as just leaving the curtain open but it still intuitively feels like you should close that curtain anyway. I mean insulation is inside the wall of the house and it keeps the heat out. How is that any different than a set of blackout curtains besides the R value? (Hint: it’s probably the lack of insulating properties in a curtain… though there would be dead air between the curtain and window and dead air is a moderately good insulator itself.

They are indeed built into the window frame and are fully retractable. The windows also open to the inside. They have a similar function as awnings, because you can have them part of the way down, so they block the sun at whatever altitude it is, while allowing you to keep the window open for airflow or light. They are also less obstructive on the facade than awnings. Random example: https://as.com/actualidad/sociedad/por-que-hay-tantas-persia... I've lived both in Spain and the Netherlands. In Spain you have the wooden blinds that are vertically retractable, they can fully black-out and insulate the room, but you also always have very light translucent curtains next to them, that let light in but can block visibility for privacy. In the Netherlands you usually only have very thick curtains that are not translucent, they fulfil both purposes in one, light/temperature insulation and privacy, but they are an inferior solution for both. My parents and grandparents from Spain are surprised and often note how many windows in the Netherlands are wide open, particularly on ground floors, you can see everything in the house from the street. In Spain we would simply use the translucent curtains that block very little light but provide privacy. And in the north of Spain it's just as grey as in the Netherlands, the light level is similar most of the year. We also have fewer ground-floor households, they are generally unpopular, there's often shops there at street-level, and apartments are far more common than detached houses. reply ragazzina 4 hours agorootparentprevcompletely different from an awning from a heat point of view.

That's what I'm saying, fabric doesn't really need to get replaced in 15 years and going from personal experience. The mechanism is simple enough to be reliable as well. Ultimately, it's impossible to analyze the cost benefits of this. It's a matter of personal taste and what the harshness of the local climate allows. I don't doubt that fixed awnings are cheaper - but actuating awnings fix their drawbacks, and the maintenance they introduce is minimal in my experience. And frankly, for the price of giving up a single vacation in 15+ years, it's not that expensive. Again, cheap enough that those in social housing can make the choice to get them installed.

Part of the key to old houses staying cool was high thermal mass: lots of brick and stone that could stay cool during the day. As great as modern insulation is at keeping hot and cool separate, a modern insulated wall doesn't cool it's surroundings like a high thermal mass wall would. Moving to a world where we combine passive cooling and high thermal mass construction with the benefits of modern tech will be key in my opinion. reply amluto 14 hours agoparentAwnings have a nice property that fancy windows don’t: they can reduce heat gain in the summer while still allowing more heat gain in the winter. A nice south-facing window that lets the low winter sun in can provide a lot of desirable heat in the winter in a cold climate.

There's enough thermal mass to keep the interior temp stable for three days. No need for air conditioning.

E.g. here in socal its pretty common to see people cover a window entirely in the heat with like newspaper or tin foil and lack AC. Likewise there are a lot of old homes and apartments built in the 1920s that used to have awnings (visible in historical photos often) and no longer do, and they don't have central air either (maybe a couple window units which also block light). I think the reason is simply that awnings take maintenance and are more costly. They eventually rot out from the sun and fall apart, needing replacement. Replacing an awning is not necessary to rent an apartment or sell a home, so it isn't done. If you had a ratty old one you'd probably just remove it vs replace. And even if you did want to replace that awning today, where do you even get one? They don't sell them at the hardware store like they might have 100 years ago. You'd probably have to order custom sized pieces from some company. Probably a couple grand in the materials and installation right there to do up all the windows.

Yes, an awning keeps your house cooler by blocking sunlight, but it also blocks sunlight, reducing the natural light inside your house. This means you either sit in the dark or use more artificial light, which is fine except natural sunlight is (for me at least) very beneficial for mood and for maintaining the circadian rhythm. I know lots of people who don't mind living in darkness or seem to have a personal vendetta against the sun, and maybe those people would be genuinely better off with awnings, but I don't think they're for me. reply asdff 1 hour agoparentThat might be a factor for some people but it seems like american society doesn't value natural light. I remember in college visiting a ton of peoples dorms and apartments and most people would either have purpose built blackout curtains or just nail an old towel over the window. Pretty common to see windows blocked up like this around town when you start looking for it. No clue who these troglodytes are but there are many of them. reply dangus 9 minutes agorootparent> That might be a factor for some people but it seems like american society doesn't value natural light. This seems puzzling to me. Large windows are a staple of every luxury new build. Floor to ceiling windows are a status symbol. reply crazygringo 14 hours agoparentprevI'm surprised I had to scroll down this far to find this -- yes exactly! They block the light, they block the sky, they block the view. Back in the day, windows were small and there were awnings and interiors were dark. Often made even darker with dark wood, dark colors, etc. It could be downright gloomy. Then a kind of aesthetic revolution happened where windows got bigger, walls got white, awnings went away -- and it's all so much brighter and joyous. And if your windows let in too much heat in the summer so you have to run your AC more, it can be counterbalanced in the winter when you can run the heat a lot less during sunny days. reply Aeolun 14 hours agoparentprevI think the reason this doesn’t get mentioned so much, is because the sun is absurdly bright during the day. I imagine a well designed awning doesn’t affect the light levels of your home to any perceptible degree. In my experience that’s true anyway. reply bobthepanda 13 hours agorootparentThere is plenty of light being reflected off of nearby surfaces to still brighten up a house with an awning. They’re mostly for reducing direct, intense sunlight. Plus, if it bothers you that much, there are awnings that retract or fold away. reply philwelch 13 hours agorootparentprev> the sun is absurdly bright during the day. Yes, this is what makes it so hard to replace with artificial lighting! I enjoy that absurdly bright sunlight. My house has extra windows over most of my windows and these specifically allow that sunlight in to add ambient lighting. During daytime most of my house is fully illuminated even with the lights off and blinds drawn because of these upper windows. You might describe what I have as the exact opposite of an awning and it’s one of my favorite features. reply Cthulhu_ 10 hours agoparentprevThis is the main reason I went for screens, which are a fine mesh fabric that cover the whole window, but you can still see outside - over shutters, which are double layer aluminium whatsits that really keep anything and anyone out. I mean it still gets pretty dark in the house with them closed, but in the hottest days of the summer, dark means cool and cool is good. reply ilaksh 7 hours agoprevI assume the energy savings are significant. Shouldn't this be actually be part of the building code? reply stdbrouw 6 hours agoparentIn Europe it is to some extent, with the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.

No awnings, but there was also definitely no effort to compute roof angles to maximize shade in the summer. Depending on the home's orientation you may not be able to pull that off at all even if you tried. reply jerlam 17 hours agorootparentAnd tract houses use the same designs but rotated and flipped for an entire development.

(in addition, the dark stonework on the ground floor functions to passively clear light snow in spring and early winter) It was built in the XX, but according to local vernacular, which likely (we have a few examples surviving from the XIII) predates both the modern profession of \"architect\" and metal-framed awnings. (my friend the architect has plenty of local work, but maybe that's because we live in different countries?) reply Cthulhu_ 10 hours agoparentprevI mean yeah, if you have a big house with large porches / overhangs that'll work.

Chronological snobbery is a whiggish habit. If anything, architecture today is lazy and mediocre, especially given our technological advantages. People even used to factor in the path of the sun and the direction of the wind to position a house. Some architects and contractors might still do that, but I don't think this is common, because, hey, we have HVAC, and hey, we just want to slap together and flip a shitty development as quickly as possible. The lack of care, the lack of concern for urban planning, the misuse of material in a given environment, the use of inferior materials and building methods, the lack of concern for posterity who will inherit our mess, the waste, the ugliness -- it's all shameful.

I understand these are a thing for RVs. reply AStonesThrow 18 hours agoprevThe American Southwest, especially the Sonoran Desert, was once a refuge for those who suffered respiratory ailments. Doctors would \"prescribe\" a change of scenery for allergies, asthma, tuberculosis, COPD, etc. People moved here because there was so little pollen in cleaner air, due to sparse population, as well as the lack of grass and other conventional foliage. However we also have a little feature we lovingly call \"Valley Fever\" which is a fungus, spread mostly by dust storms. As more Midwestern folks immigrated here, and the Snowbirds set up shop, they all wanted traditional lawns, trees, and golf courses, just like \"back home\". So by the 1980s-1990s, Phoenix was barely differentiated from Chicago or Kansas in terms of front yards. Now, those gardens definitely kept things cool in a local area. They needed things like flood-irrigation, so deep water often covers lawns. Deciduous or even evergreen trees can afford a lot of shade where you really, really need it. Unfortunately, monsoon microbursts often topple those kinds of trees, which have shallow roots in impoverished, sandy soils. Ironically, due to lack of water, and Greta Thunberg, we're reverting to desert landscapes (called xeriscape) and so the new urban domestic hotness here is to install little \"drip irrigation\" tubes, palo verde, cactus, succulents, yucca, etc. Needless to say, they don't provide enough shade, and the humidity stays quite low. Phoenicians today are clamoring for more artificial shelter and shade. Bus stops here are works of art with elaborate means of warding off the daytime heat. The city centers are still \"heat islands\" with murderous temperature increases during summertime (\"summertime\" in Phoenix lasts from March through October...) reply hakfoo 18 hours agoparentThe \"new hotness?\" Xeriscape has been promoted at least back to the 1990s. Palo Verdes can get pretty damn big with significant shade factor, but they tend to blow a coat of a billion tiny yellow flowers in season and make a huge mess that the HOA kvetches about. reply kjs3 40 minutes agoparentprevRight...it's some teenagers fault, not building unsustainably in a desert. reply maxbond 18 hours agoparentprevThe problem isn't activists, it's the climate.

Read up on the Colorado River Compact. Where the Water Goes by David Owens is a very accessible primer. The tl;dr is that the water was portioned out to the Western states (including Arizona) during an unusually wet period, and we're now in a period of drought.

Jon Brodkin – Oct 14, 2024 7:25 PM 30 The Internet Archive has brought its Wayback Machine back online \"in a provisional, read-only manner\" as it continues to recover from attacks that took the site down last week, founder Brewster Kahle said in a post last night. The archive.org home page points users to the now-functional Wayback Machine but notes that other Internet Archive services are temporarily offline. Kahle said it was \"safe to resume\" the Wayback Machine's operations, but that it \"might need further maintenance, in which case it will be suspended again.\" The Wayback Machine's \"Save Page Now\" feature that lets users capture a webpage manually is currently unavailable. The related openlibrary.org book-preservation website was still offline today. Founded in 1996, the nonprofit Internet Archive crawls the web to preserve pages that are publicly available and has captured 916 billion web pages so far. It has a staff of 150 people and also provides free access to many videos, audio files, and books (though it was recently forced to delete 500,000 books after losing a copyright case). DDoS attacks and data breach Kahle said last week that the site was offline because of multiple DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks. It also suffered a breach in September affecting 31 million user records. Last week, hackers defaced the Internet Archive website with a message that said, \"Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!\" HIBP is a reference to Have I Been Pwned, which was created by security researcher Troy Hunt and provides information and notifications on data breaches. The hacked Internet Archive data was sent to Have I Been Pwned and \"contains authentication information for registered members, including their email addresses, screen names, password change timestamps, Bcrypt-hashed passwords, and other internal data,\" BleepingComputer wrote. Kahle said on October 9 that the Internet Archive fended off a DDoS attack and was working on upgrading security in light of the data breach and website defacement. The next day, he reported that the \"DDoS folks are back\" and had knocked the site offline. The Internet Archive \"is being cautious and prioritizing keeping data safe at the expense of service availability,\" he added. \"Services are offline as we examine and strengthen them... Estimated Timeline: days, not weeks,\" he wrote on October 11. \"Thank you for the offers of pizza (we are set).\" Jon Brodkin Senior IT Reporter Jon Brodkin Senior IT Reporter Jon is a Senior IT Reporter for Ars Technica.

Guess what has happened over 6 years of decentralization of 50 TB? People only seed what they want or care about and there aren't enough seeders to host. They set all this up and nobody volunteers. You're a DWeb advocate and you haven't been seeding. That's a recipe for disaster if they rely on the goodness of volunteer seeders. The IA's mission is broader.

At that time our son was using it for games. He goes away to college and came home for the first school break. I get a phone call from our internet provider asking if our son was home. I was so shocked and handed the phone to our son. Apparently at that time bittorrent was optimizing for the most efficient path to a host. Since we had relatively good connection, the mighty weight of the internet was funnelling through our tiny internet provider to our son's computer. The provider (without our knowing it) had made a deal with our son that he would only turn on bittorrent between midnight and 6 AM. I doubt other providers would be so generous. I have been sceptical of bittorrent since that day. reply jetrink 6 hours agorootparentAll clients today (and probably back then) have options to limit bandwidth consumption including throttling, scheduling, and total data transfer caps.

It makes sense to abstract configuration behind an interface so you can easily mock it our or implement it differently for unit testing. Perhaps you also want to have some services configured through a database instead. This isn't a ConfigurationFileServiceFactoryFactory. reply burnte 3 hours agoparent> I know it's cool to \"hate\" on OO, but \"just read the fucking file\" doesn't work if you want to run your unit tests without reading a fucking file. Then don't do that, if in the real world it'll read a fucking file, then test with reading a fucking file. Tests aren't there to just be passed, they're to catch problems and if they're not testing the same workflows that the code will see IRL then the test is flawed. The first test should be reading a fucking file and that fucking file could be full of all sorts of garbage. Same goes for non-fucking files. reply xnorswap 3 hours agorootparentThose are integration tests. Integration tests are great, but not when you want to run thousands of them in a few minutes. And not when you want to have lots running in parallel, accessing and potentially making \"changes\" to the same files. I'm happy to have a long running integration test suite that runs on a build server. But while working on a project, I need fast running unit tests that I can edit and run to get fast feedback on my work. I find that \"time to iterate\" is key to effective and enjoyable development. That's why hot module reloading is an amazing innovation for the front-end. The back-end equivalent is quickly running affected unit tests. So I'd rather unit test my FooFileReader to make sure it can read parse (or not) what's in various files, and unit test my service which consumes the output of my FooFileReader by either parameterising the FooFile result or having an IFooFileReader injected. ( Either works to separate concerns. ) While unit testing, I'm going to test \"given that System.IO.File can read a file\", and write tests accordingly. I don't want a test sometimes fails because \"read errors can happen IRL\". That doesn't help test my business logic. I can even test what happens if read failures do happen, because I can mock my mock IFooFileReader to return a FileNotFoundException or any other exception. I'd rather not have to force a real-world scenario where I'm getting such an error. In a functional world, it's the difference between: function string -> result and function string -> parsedType -> result The second is cleaner and neater, and you can separately test: function string -> parsedType function parsedType -> result The second is more testable, at the cost of being more indirect. Interfaces and factories are just an idiomatic .NET way of doing this indirection over services and classes. Of course you can also write more in a functional style, and there are times and places to do that too. reply miningape 44 minutes agorootparentYou're mixing definitions - integration tests concern testing the \"integration\" between all parts of a solution. It has nothing to do with reading a JSON file, its perfectly acceptable to read from a JSON file and use its data in a unit test. Also reading / parsing a JSON file is fast enough for hot reloads / auto rerunning unless you have multiple GB files - so the argument for speed makes no sense. I'd argue it's slower as a whole to have to code up mocks and fill in the data than copy paste some json. I do agree with the second being neater, however past a certain point of enterprise coding it's a negligible difference compared to the overall complexity of the code - so taking a shortcut and making your tests simpler through JSON files actually ends up being the cleaner / neater solution. >While unit testing, I'm going to test \"given that System.IO.File can read a file\", and write tests accordingly. I don't want a test sometimes fails because \"read errors can happen IRL\". That doesn't help test my business logic. Since you're given that - use it. If your test fails because a \"low level\" dependency is failing it's indicating something is seriously fucked up on your machine. reply rbanffy 39 minutes agorootparentprev> And not when you want to have lots running in parallel, accessing and potentially making \"changes\" to the same files. Reading a file is a fast operation these days. Re-reading a file shortly after a read is less than a memory copy. Making the structure more complicated so that you can avoid reading a file during unit tests is a poor investment of resources - that complexity will haunt down the team forever. reply wtallis 1 hour agorootparentprev> While unit testing, I'm going to test \"given that System.IO.File can read a file\", and write tests accordingly. I don't want a test sometimes fails because \"read errors can happen IRL\". That sounds pretty squarely in the \"you ain't gonna need it\" category. If your test harness cannot make a temporary directory and populate it with a copy of the test config file that's stored in the same SCM repo as the test case code, then you simply have a broken CI server. There's no need to complicate your codebase and make your tests less realistic all to avoid hypothetical problems that would almost certainly break your test suite before the test case gets around to attempting an fopen. Just read the damn file. There are more complicated instances where mocking and dependency injection is needed. \"fopen might fail on the CI server\" usually isn't one of them. reply neonsunset 11 minutes agorootparentprevThe vast majority of codebases that spam factories are misusing the pattern and simply add more boilerplate and abstraction bloat for something that is easily expressible in true idiomatic C# itself. You see it everywhere where someone handrolls a \"ServiceResolver\" or \"DtoMapper\" that wrap what DI or ORM already handle on your behalf, simply because it is consistent with ancient badly written code that originates from practices that came from heavier Java and before that C++ codebases. reply consp 3 hours agorootparentprevUnit test are nice to have if you want to make test coverage or have sufficient time to implement them properly. In practice they contain only vague assumptions (the test passes, but the integration stops due to those assumptions being false) or contain things any basic code review should catch (and if you keep paying peanuts they won't do that so you make more unit tests). reply jessekv 2 hours agorootparentA good interface is testable, this is how you build up reliable abstractions to solve higher level problems. The devs on my team that take shortcuts here waste more time in the end. There is no cost trade-off. reply miningape 6 minutes agorootparentIn most cases especially for important code paths I agree. There is a case where I think it is justifiable to not write a single test: Startups. Specifically pre-seed & seed round funded I think are allowed to skip the majority of tests - however critical paths, especially those that are important to customers (i.e. transactions) must be tested. By the time you have built out that mvp and have a few customers then you should transition to writing more tests. And as the number of engineers, scope, or complexity grows you need to add tests. reply miningape 38 minutes agorootparentprev> Tests aren't there to just be passed, they're to catch problems So many developers don't understand this simple concept - it manifests in 2 ways: 1. Not writing tests 2. Writing too many / too specific tests Testing should always be focussed on the OUTCOMES never the implementation. That's why they're so good for making sure edge cases are covered - since we are able to assert the input and expected outcome of the code. I like to use the mental image that in an ideal world I could put the same tests on a completely separate implementation and it would still pass (mocks/stubs, and implementation specific tests don't pass this). I'm always far more frustrated by 2 than by 1 - since 2 adds so much unnecessary code / complexity that doesn't need to be there, growing technical debt through the tool that should help us manage it. They make changing implementations painful. And worst of all they think they're doing something correctly and when combined with the sunk-cost fallacy they're incredibly resistant to changing these fucked up tests. Don't get me wrong 1 is annoying too but he'll at least add the tests when you ask him to and not over engineer everything. reply IggleSniggle 5 minutes agorootparentThere's a lot of room for nuance. If you \"just read the fucking file\" but the file isn't a \"real\" configuration file then isn't it just a \"mock?\" If you replace all network calls with an interceptor that forwards all calls and responses, and just check what's happening as a \"listener,\" aren't you mocking out the network calls to a non-real implementation? At the end of the day, tests are necessarily a mock-up of what's real. You just happen to disagree with where some people put the abstraction layer. I also would like to make my tests more \"real\" but I have a lot of sympathy for folks that are trying to test something smaller without involving eg a file. After all, the whole point of \"everything is a file\" in Unix is that we shouldn't need to worry about this detail, it's an OS concern. If you write to a file that's not actually a file on disk but actually a device, that it should fundamentally be okay and work as expected. reply scrapcode 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah, that's called a fucking integration test. reply jessekv 2 hours agorootparentprevYeah modeless software is one honking great idea.

It's like that Skinner Simpsons meme. Are unit tests the problem and I'm wasting my time? No, it's the config files that are wrong. reply xnorswap 10 hours agoparentprevCould or should there just be a `IConfigurationService` instead of a separate IConfigurationFileService? Yes, probably. \"Interface all the things\" is a bit lazy, but it's easy, especially if you have Moq as a way to auto-mock interfaces and a DI framework to setup factory methods. But spinning into rage just because you see an interface or abstract factory isn't healthy. reply throwaway365x2 10 hours agorootparentI don't follow .Net closely, but it seems like there should be a better alternative. Java has a library called \"Mockito\" that can mock classes directly without requiring an interface. I assume something similar exists for .Net, as they have similar capabilities. Making an interface for one class, just so another class can be tested seems like we allow the tool (tests) to determine the architecture of what it is testing. Adding complexity in the name of TDD is a close second on my list of triggers There's nothing that triggers* me more than seeing an interface that only has one implementation. That's a huge code smell and often a result of pre-mature architecture design in my opinion. It also often leads to complexity where if you have an interface, you create a factory class/method to instantiate a \"default\" implementation. Fortunately it seems that it is not used as often as before. Our code has no factories and only a few interfaces, that actually have a practical use. The same applied to my previous workplace * The trigger applies to 2024 Java code written as if it was 2004. I may have a form of PTSD after many years of interfaces and FactoryFactory, but fortunately times have changed. I don't see much of that today except in legacy systems/organizations. reply xnorswap 10 hours agorootparentI'm sure the same exists for .NET ( Moq can probably do it? ), but writing against an interface and having concrete implementations supplied by the DI framework is pretty much the ordained way to do things in .NET. I used to be in the \"Interfaces with only a single implementation is a code smell\" camp, but I prefer to follow the principle of least surprise, so going with the flow and following the way the MS standards want you to do things makes it easier to onboard developers and get people up to speed with your code base. Save \"Do it your own way\" for those parts of the system that really requires it. And technically the auto-generated mock is a second implementation, even if you never see it. reply throwaway365x2 9 hours agorootparentI think you have good approach. I also tend to go with the flow and follow the common practice. If I tried to do \"Java in C#\", it would make it more difficult to follow my code and decrease maintainability. I sometimes work on legacy C# code that we inherited from another team and I try to follow the style as close as possible. I just haven't invested enough time to make any informed decisions about how things should be. reply Jerrrrrrry 9 hours agorootparentYou are both over thinking it. GIT? unit tests? and i thought debuggers spoiled us? although cavemen-esque in comparison to 'modernity'; it wasn't a nightmare to Pause/resume program flow and carefully distill every suspected-erroneous call to Console.Log(e)/stdout/IO/alert(e)/WriteLine(e); `everything to find the fun/troublesome bits of one's program - instead of a tedious labyrinth of stack traces obfuscating out any useful information, further insulted by nearly un-googable compiler errors. Tests were commented out functional calls with mock data. If you never need to instantiate another instance of a structure so much so that it would benefit from an explicit schema for its use - whether it be an object or class inheritance or prototype chain - then sure, optimize it into a byte array, or even a proper Object/struct. But if it exists / is instantiated once/twice, it is likely to be best optimized as raw variables - short-cutting OOP and it's innate inheritance chain would be wise, as well as limiting possibly OOP overhead, such as garbage collection. >interface in C# Coincidentally, that is where my patience for abstraction for C# had finally diminished. yield and generators gave off awkward syntatic-over-carmelized sugar smell as well - I saw the need, to compliment namespaces/access modifiers, but felt like a small tailored class would always outweigh the negligible time-save. reply Bjartr 6 hours agorootparentI love the idea of syntactic engagement gone too far as \"burnt sugar\" reply Kuinox 9 hours agorootparentprevMoq® cannot do it. I forked Moq® and made a library that can mock classes: https://github.com/Kuinox/Myna. It can do that by weaving the class you mock at compile time for your mocks (you can still use your class normally). reply pylua 5 hours agorootparentprevWhat’s wrong with having an interface with one implementation ? It’s meant to be extended by code outside the current repo most likely. It’s not a smell in any sense. reply klibertp 4 hours agorootparent90% of single-implementation interfaces (in Kotlin on Android projects I've seen) are internal (package/module private, more or less.) So no, they are not meant to be extended or substituted, and tests are their only raison d'etre (irony: I've almost never seen any actual tests...) This is insane because there are other tools you can use for testing, like an all-open compiler plugin or testing frameworks that can mock regular classes without issues. An interface with a single implementation sometimes makes sense, but in the code I've seen, such things are cludges/workarounds for technical limitations that haven't been there for more than a decade already. At least, it looks that way from the perspective of a polyglot programmer who has worked with multiple interface-less OOP languages, from Smalltalk to Python to C++. reply gregmac 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah, IConfigurationService implies separation of concern. Code using it doesn't have to care where the configuration came from, just that it is there. Someone separately can write the concrete ConfigurationFileService:IConfigurationService that reads/parses files. IConfigurationFileService implies abstraction of file system-based configuration. Are we planning that there's going to be a different way to read configuration files in the future, and what exactly is that? If no one can articulate it, it just seems like architecture astronautism and: YAGNI. IConfigurationService makes writing unit tests for anything that uses it way easier, too. There can be a simple TestConfigurationService:IConfigurationService that just implements everything as settable, and in your test code you can provide exactly the properties you need (and nothing more), and easily have 100 variations of configs to ensure your code is working. Without the headache of dealing with actual files separate from your test code, or worse, shared with other test code. I've actually written multiple long-lived pieces of software this way, and more than once ended up implementing stuff like environment variable-based configuration, REST API-sourced configuration, and even aggregations that combine multiple sources, eg: new AggregateConfig(new ServerConfig(\"https://whatever\"), new EnvironmentConfig(), new FileConfig(\"/some/path.config\")); All that code that used IConfigurationService is completely untouched and unaware of any of this, letting whoever is doing this as part of changing deployment (or whatever) be productive quickly with very little knowledge of the rest of the (possibly massive) app. reply rcxdude 7 hours agoparentprevBut why is it so hard to read a file during a unit test? Files are pretty easy to mock in many different ways, all of which are pretty fast. You don't need a special-purpose interface to be able to test the code that uses a config file. reply stickfigure 6 hours agorootparentLet's say you want to test bootstrapping your system with various configurations. You could make a few dozen different configuration files. Or maybe it's more than that because you want to test permutations. Now you're maintaining a bestiary. So instead you think \"I'll write code that generates the config file for each test\". And that's reasonable sometimes. On the other hand, the single-responsibility principle can be reasonably applied here and \"reading the config data\" is a good single responsibility. You don't want to have to write code to muck with json or xml every time some component needs a configuration value. So there should already be a clean boundary here and it often makes sense to test the components separately. There's not one rule. The article author sounds like an excitable jr engineer that's never written software at scale. reply dogleash 4 hours agorootparent> that's never written software at scale. Is this like a never version of that insult where people would say someone's opinion doesn't matter because they worked on a project that never shipped (regardless of how much or how little they contributed to the failure)? Just replacing it with an AWS bill-measuring contest? reply stickfigure 2 hours agorootparent\"Software at scale\" is different from \"data at scale\" is different from \"compute at scale\". But yeah, when I hear \"STOP MAKING SERVICES AND FACTORIES AND INTERFACES AND JUST READ THE FUCKING JSON FILE YOU ENTERPRISE FUCKERS\" I think \"developer who's never worked on anything more complicated than a chat app, and isn't old enough to have learned humility yet\". reply _gabe_ 4 minutes agorootparentOr… they’ve seen the results of what it looks like when these kinds of practices are multiplied over a multi-decade long tool and are understandably frustrated when they have to try to help maintain this unmaintainable, untraceable code (because every time you click a function it takes you to an interface and not the implementation) that’s only understood by the developer that solely developed the vast majority of the tool over those multiple decades. I am growing more and more confident that the people that follow these practices often don’t have enough experience jumping into somebody else’s vast sprawling code base that follows these patterns and trying to wrangle the mess. nucleardog 1 hour agorootparentprevThe interface in question is `IConfigurationFileService`. I can only guess at the actual interface, but based on the name it doesn't sound like it's abstracting away the need to put your configuration into files. Could just be a case of bad naming and it solves everything you're saying. But it sounds like pointless enterprise-y fuckery to me. I would not say the same thing about `ConfigurationFileService : IConfigurationLoader` or something. reply pphysch 3 hours agorootparentprev> Now you're maintaining a bestiary. Any battle-hardened test suite is already a bestiary. Having a subfolder of diverse & exemplary config files, that could be iterated over, is not adding much to the pile. reply stickfigure 1 hour agorootparentA totally reasonable approach! Sometimes. reply xnorswap 5 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps a better example is a real world example I ran into just this week. I found out that our unit test suite would only pass when run under elevated credentials. Our internal developer tooling had been running under semi-privileged credentials for years, and was the usual way of triggering a full unit test suite run, so no-one really noticed that it didn't work when run at a lower elevation. When run from a lower privilege, a unit test was failing because it was failing to write to a registry key. I first double checked that I wasn't accidentally triggering integration tests, or that the test should be tagged integration. But no, we had simply failed to abstract away our registry writes within that service. Of course no unit test should be writing to the real registry, but this settings manager was just being new'ed up as a concrete class, and there was no interface for it, and so it was just naively making registry edits. This settings class wrote directly to the windows registry as it's data-store wasn't noticed as an issue for years, because all the times it had previously been run, it had been under credentials which could access that registry key. And yes, there are different ways we could have mocked it, but favouring a concrete class meant this registry edit was happening unnoticed across all our unit test runs. And I suspect this might have been behind some of the dreaded flaky test syndrome, \"I just tweaked a CSS file, why did my PR build fail?\". Because 99% of times it was fast enough that it didn't cause issues, but with just the right concurrency of test execution, and you'd have a problem that wouldn't show up in any meaningful error message, just a failed test \"for no reason\". Why shouldn't unit tests read real-world files? Because that introduces brittleness, and an inherent link between tests. If you want fast and easy to parallelize tests they need to have no real-world effects. A test suite which is effectively pure can be executed orders of magnitude more quickly, and more reliably, than one which depends on: - Files - DateTime.Now (Anywhere in your code. A DateTimeFactory which you can mock might sound ridiculous, but it's perhaps the best thing you can do for your code if your current code / tests run on real dateTimes. Even for production code, having a DateTimeFactory can be really helpful for relieving some timing issues. ) - Databases ( This is more \"obvious\", but still needs to be said! ) And so on. A unit test suite should boil down to essentially pure statements. Given inputs A,B,C, when applying functions f, g, h, then we expect results h(g(f(A,B,C))) to be X. This can also be the difference between a test takingDateTime.Now I've got this in several places. I have code that needs to check if other date is within two weeks of today. I have test data. I could either modify the test data based on today's date (adding other logic to tests that itself could be faulty), do something while loading the test data... or have the date to be used for comparisons be injected in. That date is July 1, 2018. It was selected so that I didn't have difficulty with reasoning about the test data and \"is this a leap year?\" or across a year boundary on January 1. Its not a \"I don't trust it to work across those conditions\" but rather a \"it is easier to reason about what is 60 days before or after July 1 than 60 days before or after January 1. And returning to the point - injectable dates for \"now\" are very useful. Repeatable and reasonable tests save time. reply wobblyasp 6 hours agorootparentprevIt's not, but maybe I don't want to create a file for the tests. The point theyre trying to make is that it's a personal preference and not an obvious \"this way is better\" reply proikan 10 hours agoparentprevIsn't ```dependency injection``` (aka passing arguments) the big thing that's supposed to solve this?

So let's say you have a service FooService that requires some configuration. ( Ignoring the System.configuration namespace for now) You'd have: class FooService(IConfigurationService ConfigurationService){ // Access Configuration Through IConfigurationService } Then elsewhere you'd set up your DI framework to inject your ConfigFileService to satisfy IConfigurationService in prod. Yes, it can sometimes feel a bit like \"turtles all the way down\", where sometimes you just wish you had a bunch of concrete implementations. In unit tests, you'd auto-mock IConfigurationService. For integration tests you might provide a different concrete resolution. There are some advantages to service based DI though. The standard ASP.NET DI framework makes it trivially easy to configure it as a singleton, or per-request-lifetime, or per-instantiation, without having to manually implement singleton patterns. This gives you good control over service lifetime. reply xnorswap 8 hours agorootparentMy example above is terrible, because in reality you'd have another level before this, which sorts out your global configuration, reads it and just injects service specific parameters and configuration for each service. But I just wanted to illustrate idiomatic .NET DI, and on reflection picking configuration was probably the worst way to illustrate it. reply rkachowski 10 hours agoparentprevmost of these issues disappear with the introduction of first class functions.

EDIT: Found xnorswap's comment below about configuration, which makes sense I get - but as they mentioned, it does feel like \"turtles all the way down\". reply criddell 5 hours agorootparentI've used them in the past to keep interface and implementation separate. It's an easy way to stick an adapter between something concrete and the thing that needs something but doesn't care where it's coming from. So, for example, I could have a IGadgetStore with methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting gadget instances and then I can have a bunch of different classes implementing that interface. An obvious example is to have a PostgresGadgetStore and a MysqlGadgetstore and CsvFileGadgetStore. If the user wants to implement their own store that I haven't written, they can. reply FroshKiller 6 hours agorootparentprevA non-mocking use of mine: I have a factory with a method that returns instances of a particular interface for publishing typed events to a pub/sub service. The caller of the factory doesn't have to be updated with new concrete types as new events are added, because it's the factory's responsibility to create the events. The event types themselves just implement the interface that's required to serialize them for the pub/sub service. reply nonameiguess 3 hours agorootparentprevI don't think it's off-topic at all. The ideal this kind of thing is trying to achieve is separation of concern. One developer or team or even entire organization is writing things like serializers for specific kinds of file formats or other sources of persisted data like databases and environment variables or things like the Java Springboot externalized config. Another organization is just trying to create an application that requires configuration. They don't necessarily want to have to worry too much about where it comes from. Especially in places that strictly separate development and operations, they'll probably have no say anyway and it'll change over time and they're not gonna want to change their own code when it does. You can analogize this to non-software use cases. I've got phillips head and flathead screwdrivers and ideally don't want to have to worry about the specific qualities of a particular kind of screw when selecting one. It either has one slot on the head or two. That's the interface to the screw and it should be the only thing I have to worry about when selecting a screwdriver. Unfortunately, this kind of thing can balloon out of control, and in the worst kinds of \"enterprise\" Java shops I was involved in deep into my past, where concrete classes were injected at runtime by xml file loaded into the framework, it was literally impossible to tell what code was going to do simply by reading it, because it is impossible to know what is being injected at runtime except by inspecting it during runtime. It's a pretty frustrating experience when reading an entire code base doesn't tell you what the code actually does. reply guax 10 hours agoparentprevWhy do you need the interface? You can extend/mock the class itself. Refactoring code is easy and cheap.

Refactoring code is easy and cheap. There is no reason for complex abstractions that protect implantation outside of libraries and frameworks. \"Mock\" can be a loaded word in this context, so please excuse me if I'm looking at it through a difference lens, but if you're using some sort of mocking set of tooling (like Jest or similar), I'd argue that those mocks are much more confusing than an interface with an implementation. I personally love an interface because it defines the most narrow set of operations an object needs to support to be passed in, and the implementation of those are completely irrelevant for calling. In many cases, I personally find that a lot simpler and cleaner to read. reply FrustratedMonky 5 hours agoparentprevThe thing that should be tested is whatever you are handing to a client app to use. If it is an interface, then test the interface, not the file behind it. If the client will get the file, then test that the file is correct. So in this case, is this entire file being handed to clients to do what they will with it? Does that make sense as an interface. If you are building an app, and you want other parts of the app, or clients of the app, to use this data, does it make sense to just hand over the entire file as the interface. Basically : Programmer 1: \"Hey man, show me your data interface so I can build a quick lookup on something\" Programmer 2: \"here is the whole damn file, do whatever you want and leave me alone.

Most of the time it turns out that all the other features are neither necessary nor important enough to spend time on. Projects without time restraints or focus tends to create a complex system that will \"solve\" the entire problem space. Most of the time it turns out that our assumptions are wrong and we need to do a major refactoring. \"Temporary\" solutions may not have the best code structure or architecture, but it is not necessarily a bad technical debt, as many new developers to the project seems to think it is. Also, the time restraints of a temporary solution encourages the developer to create simple code and not \"clever\" code, because they can always blame time restraints for their lack of cleverness.

    "originBody": "Azad's Blog About Contact Traveling with Apple Vision Pro Oct 8, 2024 Apple Vision Pro, Films The Vision Pro has quickly become an essential item that I take onto every flight. It’s a fantastic device to travel with—Be it by train or by plane, it offers an unparalleled opportunity to selectively tune out your environment and sink into an engaging activity like watching a movie or just working on your laptop. In this blog post, I’ll outline what I’ve learned about the Vision Pro while traveling, explain some of the functionality, shine light onto its drawbacks, as well as assess how it fares against solutions like a phone or a laptop. For context, most of the traveling where I’ve brought my Vision Pro along has been on airplanes, but this applies to traveling by train as well. Table of Contents Expand Packing / Travel Setup First and foremost, space in my suitcase or backpack while traveling is the most valuable commodity. Whenever I’m packing for a trip, anything that adds unnecessary bulk to my setup is immediately discarded. For that reason, I highly recommend that you do NOT purchase the behemoth of the $200 Vision Pro “travel case” from Apple. It’s unnecessarily massive and doesn’t fit into ANYTHING. Avoid it at all costs unless you absolutely need a crazy amount of protection from the elements (but at that point, might as well buy a Pelican case!). The size of the official AVP Travel case size is wayy too big. (image credit: Dan Miller on Twitter) My travel setup is super simple and minimal. To protect the front glass, I use the “Vision Pro Cover” that comes by default with the headset and on the inside, I use this affordable, generic VR lens protector cover to prevent anything from scratching the lenses. I then throw it into my backpack, face-first, sitting above the other items. Side view of my travel setup Lens protection In my backpack I even use the space between the Solo strap and the headset itself as a place to put my rolled up puffer jacket or quarter-zip. This way, the only amount of space that it actually takes up is the thickness of the headset itself! As for the battery pack, after charging it to 100%, I disconnect the battery, roll up the cord (while being aware of not adding extra stress to the connector) and throw into my backpack (either into a pocket or have it sit on the bottom). With this setup, I haven’t scratched or damaged the headset itself at all over the 5-10 flights that I’ve taken it on. Works quite well! User Experience Airport Security Line At the airport security line, I typically pull out my laptop and the Vision Pro from my backpack. Thankfully, it seems like the Vision Pro doesn’t look suspicious at all while being x-rayed as I haven’t been questioned about it yet. Travel Mode The Vision Pro’s 6DoF tracking system is built on a combination of IMU’s + SLAM cameras (same as any other VR headsets). Unlike other VR headsets, however, it has a native “Travel Mode” which accounts for the fact that using a 6DoF VR headset in a moving vehicle will lead to massive drift and tracking issues. The Vision Pro’s Travel Mode was specifically designed to account for these tracking issues (essentially relying entirely on the SLAM cameras and ignoring the IMU data). As I put on the headset, if the plane is a bit unstable, the Vision Pro detects that I’m on a plane and will suggest to turn on Travel Mode with an actionable notification, which is great because it eliminates any need to prepare the headset prior to boarding/take-off! This was a very deliberate design choice by Apple and is a very welcome one. Vision Pro prompting me to activate Travel Mode based on tracking issues in moving vehicle. I should mention that since the IMU data is ignored, the way the horizon is determined in Travel Mode tracking is purely by the orientation/rotation of your head. If your head is titled, so will all your virtual apps/windows. To fix this, you can cover your vision pro with your hands (to lock the cameras) and when you re-initialize, recenter your apps so that they adhere to the newly-determined horizon. This might seem like a minor detail, but I find it immensely annoying if my windows are not parallel to the airplane’s ground plane. Battery Life & Charging The 2.5-3 hr battery life of Apple Vision Pro is… fine. It’s enough to watch a 90-120 minute movie and mayyybe an episode of a TV show. For short flights, this is perfectly adequate but for longer, transatlantic/transpacific flights, it’s obviously very much limited. The best option to extend its battery life is if your plane seat has a 120/240V power outlet. Given that you have a minimum 30W charging adapter, you’ll be able to keep your Vision Pro charged indefinitely. The next best option is having a high power output battery bank. I use a single 12k mAh Anker battery bank (which can output up to 60W), so recharging the Vision Pro does eat up the entirety of the battery bank’s capacity. This is something to keep in mind if you need to keep your phone charged as well. I should mention that I prioritize keeping my phone charged over my Vision Pro. A 12k mAh battery bank will recharge my phone 3-4 times while providing me the ability to watch multiple times more movies/TV shows, listen to podcasts, etc. If I have a long flight and I’m not sure that my seat will have a proper power outlet, I don’t rely on my Vision Pro to be my only form of entertainment for the entirety of the flight. By the way, I typically place the battery pack in the pouch by my knees. The cable is the perfect length for it to reach my head without it feeling too long or too short. Nice! The cable is the perfect length when the battery is placed in the seat pouch. Physical Comfort Now, if you’re like me and find the Vision Pro’s ergonomics and weight distribution to be utterly shit, I will highly recommend that you try to find a comfortable setup before you embark on your journey. Having gone through quite a few head strap setups, I now use the VR Cover Universal Headset Support Strap exclusively. It offers quite a lot of comfort without adding any bulk to the portability of the headset. It helps by removing pressure off your cheeks and distributing the weight onto the front area of the top of your head (similar to a typical VR headset halo strap). It’s not perfect but I find it to be “good enough” for now. Using AVP with the VR Cover Support Strap While they’re might be better head strap solutions, the bulk that they add to the travel setup is a dealbreaker for me. Social Comfort Another aspect of comfort is… social comfort. When I’m wearing a VR headset around people, I don’t know whether they’re looking at me, or where they are, what they’re doing, etc. Here, the combination of Passthrough + EyeSight offers a great way of remaining aware of your surroundings. Passthrough Thankfully, it seems like one of the few places where it’s currently socially acceptable to wear a Vision Pro is on a plane. Of the 5-10 times that I’ve worn it on planes, I haven’t had the feeling of people staring at me suspiciously, whispering about me (at least to my knowledge), or asking me about what I’m doing. I do typically feel self-conscious about using VR in public (so I almost never do it), so the fact that I feel almost entirely comfortable wearing it on a plane says something. Everyone does something to pass the time on a plane, so people are much more forgiving seeing a nerd wearing a face-computer. Passthrough + EyeSight, as pitched by Apple in their initial announcement of Apple Vision Pro does work quite well when it comes to staying aware of your surroundings and interacting with others (especially flight attendants for those delicious snacks). While I’m not entirely sure if EyeSight is active when I’m speaking with the flight attendants, the fact that I see them approaching my aisle, that I turn to look and engage with them, and that they see that I am hearing and seeing them (somehow, despite the fact that both my eyes and ears and covered), means that they treat me as any other passenger. Video of me ordering tea from a flight attendant while wearing a Vision Pro. I’m serious that I haven’t had any real issues interacting with flight attendants while wearing my Vision Pro. One caveat is that, out of respect, if the conversation is more than the “what would you like? Tea please” deal, I do remove the headset to make direct eye contact with them. I feel that it would be sort of odd to have a full-on conversation with someone if they’re wearing a headset (like bro, just take it off and let’s talk like humans). UI Interaction One underrated aspect of VisionOS’s interaction system is that it requires very minimal “hand wavy-ness” to interact with the system. This is a stark difference when compared Quest’s OS (or as it’s now called Meta Horizon OS) which requires you to either use a controller or your hand to point and aim at a screen. The fact that you just look at the buttons that you’d like to interact with and pinch your fingers while your hand is resting on your lap is a massive plus for not looking like a dweeb. Interacting with the visionOS via tapping + eye tracking is pretty discrete (compared to other VR headsets). I mention this because I have used a Quest on a plane (briefly, to capture marketing footage of Puzzling Places in Passthrough). I really felt self conscious about trying to minimize the amount of arm movements I had to do to navigate the OS, menus, etc. I held my elbow tight against my body and tried to only rotate my wrist around, which was quite uncomfortable. So once again, the eye+pinch UI interaction system is a wonder when it comes to minimizing the amount of physical movement required to navigate the OS, remaining cool and discrete while wearing a face computer (right? right??). Virtual Environment / Depth Collision Mitigation One of the biggest issues of Passthrough Mixed Reality is the fact that depending on where you are, you might have a chair or a wall in front of you that presents a “collision” with a virtual screen in your Vision Pro. In the case of flying on a plane, the chair in front of you is quite close, so if you’d like to set your virtual movie screen to be large and 10 ft away, the chair and the movie screen create a “depth collision”, which can be quite uncomfortable. Of course, one way to mitigate this is to immerse yourself into a fully virtual world, but that comes at the expense of spatial awareness. The wonderful thing about visionOS is that you can use a “partial” virtual environment, carefully dialing in just how much of a virtual environment you’d like to use. Showcasing the incongruity of the “depth collision” between a virtual object (Mac window) and IRL object (chair) and its mitigation with a partial virtual environment. In this case, it’s a perfect fix for opening a portal or a window to a serene landscape to place your large movie screen in, while still being able to see the plane around you. It works great and is one of the best features of visionOS for using VR in public. AirPods Pros + Vision Pro A match made in heaven. The AirPod Pros are a fantastic set of earphones to wear with the Vision Pro on a plane, offering top-of-the-line active noise cancellation (ANC) but also, “adaptive” and “transparency” modes which allow you to selectively hear voices/sounds around you, depending on the situation. I use the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C, which are special in that they offer uncompressed audio with low latency specifically for the Vision Pro. While they do work quite well, according to audiophile reviews, the difference in audio quality between the regular AirPods Pro 2s and the USB-C version with uncompressed audio is minimal, so keep that in mind if you already own an older pair. The AirPod Pro 2s also feature “Spatial Audio” which output the surround sound mix of movies in a spatial format. By default, the sound is contextually spatialized and head-tracked, meaning, the Vision Pro tries to simulate the room acoustics of the space that you’re in. Typically, this works well enough in a room, but on a dark plane, I find that the spatial acoustics are a bit too different from the raw audio output of the movie itself. Thankfully, you can change this by disabling the Spatial Audio output from Control Center while watching a movie, where you get the raw sound mix of the movie piped to your AirPods with surround sound still (meaning, sound cues that are behind you will still sound like they’re behind you). The fact that both virtual surround sound and contextual spatialization are called Spatial Audio is definitely a bit confusing. Toggling the contextually spatialized and head-tracked Spatial Audio to hear the pure surround sound mix. Either way, if you have a Vision Pro, get the AirPod Pro 2s!! You will absolutely not regret it. Eating/Snacking Speaking of flight attendants, when you’re ready to have your in-flight meal, I find that the Vision Pro’s Travel mode tracking perform at its worst, particularly in dark cabin environments (much less so when it’s bright). The problem is that for meals that require eyesight to coordinate (aka using a fork to pick up food from a plate), as soon as you look down at your food, the tracking often gets lost. This causes the movie to stop playing and for you to have to look forward for the tracking to re-initialize. Additionally, the Vision Pro’s field of view is more horizontal than vertical (unlike most other VR headsets) which can make eating challenging, requiring me to fully tilt my head down to look at my food. In most cases, unless I have a sandwich in my hand that I can eat without looking at, I take my headset off to eat my meal, then return to my movie. Works in Complete Darkness One of the drawbacks of VR systems that use cameras for 6DoF tracking is the need to have the room lights on for the headset to function! Thankfully, Apple Vision Pro does work in pitch dark environments (albeit with some caveats). While the 6DoF tracking gets reduced to 3DoF, the OS and all of the UI interactions still function in 6DoF. The hand and finger tracking continue to work in 6DoF (a bit more slowly, as the depth sensor being used to track your hands likely has a slower refresh rate than the cameras), so you can still use the full OS and grab windows to move them closer/further away. The 3DoF movement limitation isn’t an issue for watching movies and using the Mac Virtual Display. This is a very unique feature to the Vision Pro. No other all-in-one headset can natively function in the dark to this extent. Watching Movies Once Vision Pros start to become more affordable, I foresee regular travelers buying Vision Pros just to have an amazing in-flight entertainment system. It’s truly that amazing. Watching movies in Apple Vision Pro—The video player is fantastic. Here are some of the things I’ve learned while watching movies on planes. Apps The way you’ll want to watch movies and shows is through native VisionOS apps (Apple TV, Disney+, Max) as they will play videos in their native aspect ratios, offer the highest quality visuals and audio, and have a much easier UI built for AVP. Apple TV is my preferred app to watch movies with. In my opinion, it provides the highest quality video and audio playback, the ability to buy or rent movies without needing to subscribe, and overall, has the simplest and cleanest UI. Note: Recently, Apple combined the iTunes Movie Store with the Apple TV streaming service into just “Apple TV”. As for Prime Video and other video streaming apps which don’t have visionOS apps, you can use their iPad apps. The aspect ratio of the app window, will be the same as an iPad, however, so movies will play in a letterboxed mode with black bars above and below. Watching videos through iPad apps always have black bars on top and bottom (the video itself was blacked out when capturing the screenshot). It’s obviously not ideal, but hey, at least I was able to watch Rings of Power comfortably on the plane, on a large screen! Visuals The movies that play in virtual screens are native to the films’ aspect ratios, which can vary movie to movie, eliminating the black bars of “letterboxing” and “pillarboxing” you typically have on iPads, iPhones, or MacBooks. 4:3 aspect ratio 16:9 aspect ratio 2.40:1 aspect ratio They make great use of the high-res displays of the Vision Pro, its wide color gamut, and its bright HDR capabilities. In fact, of all the screens and displays in my house, my Vision Pro is hands down the highest quality display that I own, so I very much look forward to watching visually compelling movies in it. One small detail worth mentioning is that the Vision Pro bumps up the frame rate from 90 to 96 fps to provide a smooth playback for 24 fps movies (4:4 pulldown). I really appreciate that level of detail that Apple has put into providing a quality movie-watching experience. As all VR headset optics go, Apple Vision Pro’s optics are not perfect in the sense that they’re free of glare. Compared to older Fresnel lenses, Vision Pro’s unique concave pancake lenses are some of the best I’ve seen at mitigating god-rays/lens flaring/smearing from high contrast elements. My advice here is to not use a pitch black environment like the “Moon” or the “Cinema” but rather, use the Dark version of “White Sands”. Cinema Environment As mentioned in the Virtual Environment section, Apple has created 8 virtual environments, each with “Light” and “Dark” variants. What’s special is that every environment even has a unique “Cinema” mode where the video playback window gets pushed back and expanded to become 100ft or so, maximizing the field of view of the headset and give the film the “center stage”. Transitioning to an environment’s cinematic mode. As of VisionOS2, all video apps can take advantage of the Cinema environments that Apple has provided for each virtual environment. Using them gives you a truly massive, immersive (meaning, no multi-tasking) screen to watch your movies on. The environment is also reactive to the lighting of the video, much like the emission of a projector screen. While some of the environments like Mount Hood have impressive reflective water features underneath the cinematic video playback window, I find them to be a bit too distracting for my taste. I always go back to the White Sands environment using either the light or dark environment, depending on my mood or time of day. I should mention that I don’t always use the immersive cinematic environments. Although as of VisionOS2, you can recenter to adjust the tilt of the cinematic window, I find that it still doesn’t provides as much granular control as I’d like over where I would like to place my movie window. I find myself just making the normal window bigger, pushing it back, and placing it wherever would be most comfortable for me to look at. Benefits of Privacy A big bonus for watching movies in VR on a plane is the fact that you don’t need to conscious about movies that contain graphic scenes. You don’t need to turn down the brightness and rotate the screen away from children! And speaking of brightness, if you’re on a long red-eye flight with the cabin lights off (with your seat neighbor asleep), you don’t need to worry about the brightness of your movie bothering them. Special film formats Apple TV also contains the largest catalogue of 3D movies (some that are event entirely exclusive to the service, never released on Blu-Ray). I have an in-depth post about the Vision Pro is a revolution for home video formats by offering stereo 3D movies in 4k + HDR, high frame rate, as well as providing a platform for IMAX to offer films in their native 1.43:1 aspect ratio. Audio Using AirPods Pro 2s with active noice canceling is the best way to watch movies with Vision Pro. In terms of “Spatial Audio”, I’m still a torn on whether I should use the “contextual spatialization” of the surround sound mix of the movie (which is on by default) as it does change the output quite a bit. I find that it’s quite inaccurate when you’re watching the movie in pitch darkness, as the room scanning that the contextual spatialization is based on isn’t mapping the shape of the plane cabin accurately. Thankfully, you can turn off Spatial Audio and have the native surround mix piped to your AirPods. I believe this output mode still simulates surround sound too! Caveat: when videos doesn’t play Similar to iOS streaming apps, I have encountered issues with downloaded purchased and rented shows and movies not being able to play without a network connection. This is truly a “godfuckingdamnit” situation especially when that movie might’ve been the only form of entertainment that I brought onboard. Playback error of a download Prime Video episode on my phone. The only time encountered the error with a purchased item was when I had downloaded a movie months ago (likely a few OS updates ago) and I wanted to watch it on a plane. Rentals can be tricky, especially because you need to keep track of when they were rented and when you’re trigger the start of its playback. Typically, they have worked fine for me, but I do worry a bit every time I board the plane on whether a rental will play or not (at least on planes without Wifi). Mac Virtual Display The other major use case of Apple Vision Pro on plane is… to work! I don’t mean working with the silly little iPad apps but rather, connect it to your MacBook and turn its tiny little screen into a battle-station. Writing this blog post on a plane using a 13in MacBook Air and Mac Virtual Display. Mac Virtual Display is a native way for your Mac to stream its screen to the Vision Pro wirelessly without needing a Wifi or network connection. This is noteworthy as most virtual desktop software for VR headsets require either a cabled connection or a local network. With Mac Virtual Display, the Mac and Vision Pro connect to each directly (via Apple magic, likely using Wifi Direct). Here are a few things worth mentioning about using my Vision Pro as a virtual monitor for my MacBook. No More Laptop Screen Tilt Limitations if you’ve tried to work on a plane with a laptop, you know just how restricting the angle of the plane seat in front of you can be. Even 13 inch laptops feel “large” when you can barely tilt the screen enough to actually do some work. It’s doubly worse if the seat in front reclines all the way, making it entirely unusable. Not much fun trying to use a laptop when the seat in front has reclined. Here, it doesn’t matter what my front seat neighbor does, I can just tilt my screen down, place the laptop on my lap or tray, pull up a virtual monitor, and get to work. Higher Resolution + More Real Estate A very underrated aspect of Mac Virtual Display is that the virtual display isn’t merely a mirror of your laptop screen but an entirely new “display” with its own specifications and attributes. In my case, using a M2 13 inch MacBook Air, Mac Virtual Display actually increases the resolution of my laptop going from the 1710 x 1112 to 2560 x 1440 giving me way more screen real estate to work with! Here’s what I mean: On the left is what my desktop looks like when I’m writing this blog post on my MacBook by default (I’m even using the highest resolution available). On the right is what my desktop looks like with Mac Virtual Display. Notice how much more real estate there is around my browser window. Comparing the relative sizes and resolution of my MacBook’s display vs Mac Virtual Display in Vision Pro. With VisionOS2, I’m anxiously waiting for the ultra-wide virtual displays (and higher resolutions) to become available which will only make the experience of using a small laptop to do “big work” more viable. I do hope that in the future individual apps and windows from a Mac can be streamed into the Vision Pro, allowing each app to take whatever shape and size that it would best benefit from (rather than streaming the full desktop). Privacy I often see frequent flyers who do sensitive work on planes use privacy filters on their laptop screens to block out others from seeing their work. With it, also comes the cost of screen clarity, text sharpness, color accuracy, and narrow viewing angles (obviously) which hinder the fantastic qualities of MacBook displays. When using Mac Virtual Display, your MacBook screen is blacked out, allowing only you to be able to see you virtual screen. It’s quite handy for sensitive work! iPhone Mirroring This one’s a little bonus: Apple recently announced that you can stream (screen mirror) your iPhone to Mac and Vision Pro, giving you a smooth, high quality virtual display of your phone. Unlike on MacOS, however, iPhone screen mirroring isn’t intractable, so you’ll still have to hold the phone in your hand and scroll/type. It also has issues with video playback, so if you’re planning to watch downloaded shows/movies or even YouTube videos on your phone, you’ll encounter AirPlay issues. The reason you’d stream your phone while watching a movie in Vision Pro is because trying to use your phone via the Passthrough is less than ideal, especially in low light. Screen mirroring my iPhone to my Vision Pro while watching a video It’s not the most useful feature, but I did enjoy scrolling through Twitter in pitch darkness when my seat-mate was asleep. Conclusion I’ll try to summarize my thoughts on Apple Vision Pro as as traveling device. The first generation Vision Pro is an incredibly vivid showcase of how Apple sees its power users connecting all the devices within their ecosystem to provide a high quality, private, immersive experience, especially in environments that are outside of their typical home/work spaces. As a travel device, it’s a fantastic platform for watching movies and expanding my MacBook workspace. It has many flaws, which power users (like myself) who are motivated enough to make the most out of their device will find ways of alleviating. As it stands, as a first generation product that’s heavy, very expensive, and has a very underbaked OS and app ecosystem, I have a tough time recommending anyone to go out and buy one. That being said, I’m taking it on every flight I go on. But damn, based on how well it all works now, you can just tell by the 4th or 5th generation, Apple Vision Pro will be on the face of every frequent flyer. ←Previous Twitter, LinkedIn",

Just plug in the USB-C cable, and you have a virtual 60\" screen in front of you which works perfectly for Netflix, etc. And they cost less than 10% of the cost of an AVP, and are not limited to 2-3 hours of battery life (they get power from the phone). Note that if you have an older (lightning) iPhone, don't bother with these. They require a pair of dongles. Not only does that make things really awkward, but one of the dongles ends up apparently blocking HDCP, and prevents you from using anything but ... your own... downloaded content. reply willemlaurentz 4 hours agoprevAgree with author that the plane seems to be the only place where it is socially acceptable to wear the skimask.

Such an amazing tool to explore, enjoy and relax. The work part though? I had the same feeling as with the iPad early on. I need a keyboard and a mouse to be productive. reply Terretta 21 minutes agorootparent> The work part though? I had the same feeling as with the iPad early on. I need a keyboard and a mouse to be productive. Both my iPad Pro and my Vision Pro have a keyboard and trackpad: - The iPad Pro of course uses the excellent Magic Keyboard. - The Vision Pro uses an Apple keyboard w/o numpad side by side with the Magic Trackpad, in a custom tray to hold both. (Make sure that your carryon's front pocket can hold the full tray.) For sure if I thought I could only do work on a MacBook not an iPad Pro (what most people seem to think, insisting iPad is a consumption device), then I definitely couldn't work on a Vision Pro. But once you've figured out how to code (e.g. VSCode using blink code, or Koder, Working Copy, Textastic, etc.), do graphic design (e.g. Affinity suite), or run Office on an iPad (Teams, Outlook, Word, PowerPoint, Excel), the Vision Pro does those too but with \"all the app windows at once\" (ofc, iPad Pro 13\" makes excellent use of Stage Manager for window groups). All that said, I haven't felt a burden to pull AVP out on the plane. iPad Pro 13\" HDR with AirPods Pro USB-C using Spatial Audio that anchors to your iPad screen seem more than enough. Especially since you can share audio with a seat mate who also has AirPods, and both watch the same movie together. Not often talked about: for doing real work, do consider a fresh glasses prescription and the Zeiss add-ins. To keep windows rectangular instead of trapezoid, insist you're under 40 regardless of your age, otherwise Zeiss do a stealth \"progressive\" that warps window sizes. reply nine_k 35 minutes agorootparentprevI don't see why won't you be able use a keyboard if you can touch-type.

If I’m taking a commuter train every day , my view is not something great. Most of the time it’s rundown houses, tunnels or fences. This has been my experience in the UK, US and Canada. If I’m taking a more long distance train, you assume I’m sat on the side with a view. Ever taken a mountain train? One side just gets rocks wizzing by. You also assume they’re travelling in weather and a time of day that affords them a good view. Traveling at night? Traveling in misty weather?

There is even a tunnel when you are comming from Freiburg in direction of Lausanne/Geneva where you can count down the exact moment the tourists will let escape a collective woooaaaaah once the train exit the tunnel to a majestic view of Lake of Geneva with the alps and the Mont Blanc in the background. There are some views you never get tired of looking at, especially as seasons, weather, clouds and time of the day makes it an ever changing postcard. All in all in most of europe the trains usually offer nice views and I often find myself daydreaming about climbing that dirt trail on the left with my bike, riding my motorbike on that twisty road on the right side a few minutes later and what kind of life was it living 500 years ago in the old castle I can see here. reply CPLX 0 minutes agorootparentI mean you literally live in Switzerland.

Something like a quarter of all air travel passengers get a respiratory illness within a week. Some hypothesize that the incredibly low humidity of cabin air (in most aircraft, except the very newest) makes it easier to acquire infections.

For me, a good travel device is one that takes up minimal room when packing to the point where it becomes easy to forget I even have it in my bag. The Vision Pro typically requires its own dedicated spot on top of your carry on as you go through the airport - kind of the opposite. The author talks about just packing it with a single cover for the goggles but that also makes me nervous given its MSRP reply dfxm12 3 hours agoparentA kindle/book/tablet seems superior in this regard. You get your entertainment for the plane and you don't have to worry about unpacking it on the plane, being precious with a very expensive piece of equipment and they are negligible in terms of lugging around/storing in your hotel. You can even reasonably use these if you have a little down time waiting in a line, during quick trips, will be without power for a while, etc. reply cryptoz 14 minutes agorootparentThe last time I remember flying with a tablet, it was so suspicious that airport security hauled me into a private room and interrogated me about it. They questioned why I didn't take it out of my bag for the scanner (since it was a 'laptop'). They asked what it was. They made me turn it on and use it. They were extremely rude and kept me holed up for a long time while investigating it. So I don't fly with a tablet any more haha! Although, I get that time has passed and I would no longer be accosted so much, I assume. Must be pretty common now. My story takes place in ~2011 with the Motorola Xoom tablet. I guess they had never seen a tablet before. I was also working hard on a plane one time, writing code to access barometer data on mobile devices to build a distributed weather sensor network that could be activated in software.

By contrast, you can readily set the apparent screen size in the AVP to 40+ degree angle: × 1.2 (corresponding to 40-degree viewing angle) THX recommends that the \"best seat-to-screen distance\" is one where the view angle approximates 40 degrees,[26] (the actual angle is 40.04 degrees). Their recommendation was originally presented at the 2006 CES show, and was stated as being the theoretical maximum horizontal view angle, based on average human vision. In the opinion of THX, the location where the display is viewed at a 40-degree view angle provides the most \"immersive cinematic experience\", all else being equal.

There's a steady trickle of interesting things that appear for it, and it's VERY useful as a giant virtual extended laptop screen if you have a Macbook. Especially if you are in a recliner and can tilt the virtual screen above your head a bit- vastly more comfortable. Very much looking forward to the extra large virtual curved monitor they're working on, hopefully this fall. The thing is still kind of magical. When I first got it, I would get some eye fatigue and/or dizziness after about an hour of using it, but that seemed to improve after a couple weeks (adaptation?) and I can now use it for 2-3 hours at a time uninterrupted without any discomfort. Chewing ginger apparently helps (same as with VR headsets). Drinking coffee from a mug with it on is difficult. Get a straw. I'm a big guy (6'3\", 260lbs) and the headset is still a bit heavy. The gestural and eye-focus UI is extremely good, my only complaint is that I still find it hard sometimes not to make erroneous inputs which can get frustrating, but that is more the fault of web UI's with closely-clustered controls that were not designed with this interface in mind- but sometimes with text input as well, it's sometimes frustrating. The quality of the passthrough video (AR) can be improved, it's a bit shimmery (although still clear enough to comfortably read things on your phone or watch). It's stitched together from a bunch of cameras so it is surely already a technical feat. The FOV is OK, but more is always better. The immersive environments (and being able to dial them in and out) are FANTASTIC.

I can’t get them setup to program on well tho reply nerdjon 3 hours agoparentI bought an xreal pro hoping for a cheaper vision pro while technology catches up. Honestly xreal's marketing is generous at best. They seem to really try to push it as being an AR device when its really nothing more than a monitor stuck to your face that you can't change the size of. Using the beam or the software on your computer adds some AR ability, but due to the way it works on your Mac it really is not a pleasant experience and uses a ton of resources. The tracking is not great. The lack of any sort of pass through (all you can do is dim it) makes it fairly useless in many situations, like the one mentioned in this article. Options are great, and it is great that is significantly cheaper. But I bought the xreal pro, I keep trying to use it for watching something, games, programming or other work. But every time I use it for maybe 20 minutes and just get frustrated and put it away for a few more weeks. It is one of the reasons I think that the price (and size) of the vision pro is justified.

That may or may not be true in general, but air travel is one of the most oppressive environments people regularly find themselves in. Being in an extremely crowded environment with very little personal space is psychologically uncomfortable for a lot of people. And it's basically not possible to escape that environment until the plane lands, which is typically hours of time. If it's OK to tune the world out anywhere, it's got to be in an airplane. reply bentcorner 4 hours agorootparentWeirdly enough I love being on a plane (and airports). There's something psychologically freeing about them that I feel whenever I fly. I look forward to flying so much. And it's not like I'm flying first class or anything - I fly economy every time. Maybe if I flew more frequently I'd grow to dislike it (I fly maybe once a year), but honestly airports and flying are my favorite part of a trip (yes, I like them more than any possible destination). TBF I haven't flown to anywhere particularly exciting but I fail to imagine any place matching the pleasure of an airport + flight.

Just sleep on the floor. Chips cost $15\". edit: came back to post this, i definitely get an odd feeling of liberation once i'm at an airport. I travel sometimes for work and once i get in to the airport waiting to board I feel like work and every day life ceases for a time and i'm free to do whatever. It's odd because i'm trapped in this building with hundreds if not thousands of other people waiting to get on a pressurized metal tube blasting through the sky at hundreds of miles/hr.

Maybe there's some ticketing snafu and it takes an hour just to drop your checked bag (sanctimonious carry-on fliers hold your posts like you hold the seventeen bags you try to drag on the plane) Maybe security is insanely backed up or just run by incompetents, like the time at SFO where it took them 30 minutes to screen the 10 people in front of me. Then once you get past security, a whole new list of potential problems comes up: Maybe the incoming flight is delayed, possibly delayed so much you're going to miss your connection. Maybe you'll board but the plane will be broken because the airlines don't believe in preventive maintenance, and you'll have to deplane again. Maybe you'll board but due to various circumstances in airport operations you spend 3 hours sitting on the tarmac while the airplane gets increasingly hot and your toddler gets increasingly fussy. reply dfxm12 3 hours agorootparentprevDo you have to deal with the TSA where you fly?

To me the unpleasantness of flying mostly comes down to physical discomfort. The seats are cramped, the air is dry, the food isn't great, the bathroom situation is uncomfortable, and you can't really walk around. VR would visually transport you somewhere else, but physically, you're still very much on a plane. reply threetonesun 3 hours agorootparentAs someone with generalized anxiety I hate almost every part of flying from the point at which I leave the house until I arrive, but none of what you mentioned bothers me terribly.

I understand tech reviewers and journalists raving about having something to do on planes, as they probably spend an awful lot of time there. Then perhaps sales people also flighting on company's dime. But regular people don't spend much time on planes, and many of them don't need it to be an entertaining or efficient time, they can just spleep if the flight is long enough (I can't imagine lugging along a luggage the size of the Vision Pro for just a 2 hour flight) In particular the plane staff won't let you tune completely out if you're awake: the whole safety sequence , take off and landing, turbulences, the in-flight meal, all the guidance for international flights, your neighbours when you've pulled the middle seat etc. reply throw4950sh06 4 hours agorootparentMany regular people bought tablets, expensive noise canceling headphones and other hardware with the express purpose of using it on a flight 2-6 times (1-3 round trips) a year. Of course, it gets used outside of a plane too - but that applies to VR gear just as well.

Agreed 100%. Apologies for linking to my own essay, but I think this can be more generally stated as a difference between \"isolated\" and \"integrated\" arts. A device like the Vision Pro (and most tech devices, for that matter) is pushing society further and further into isolated chambers, and thus further incentivizing media and creators to focus on creating isolated aesthetic experiences, not ones that are integrated with the environment. This is such a baseline unquestioned assumption that we have about the structure of the tech economy, that to think a company like Apple would make a device that brings people together in the real world seems absurd. I wrote a bit more about this idea here: https://onthearts.com/p/modern-culture-is-too-escapist-part reply frankvdwaal 3 hours agorootparentI have a little unproven hypothesis that fits that last statement, that it would be absurd for a company like Apple to bring people together in the real world. My hypothesis is that these companies want to make money by \"taking\" your senses. They want your attention to be with them at all times, by being in your ear so you'll hear them, by being on your wrist so you'll feel them, by being on your eyes so you'll see them. I'm thinking these companies are building up technological ecosystems - Apple's specialty! - that they hope will eventually form a proxy for you to experience reality. Because if they can convince you to experience life through them, they'll have your wallet too. Maybe it's just a silly thought of mine, but it kind of fits. reply polo 2 hours agorootparentVery well put. I agree with you, and yet I still wouldn’t give up using my Vision Pro. Though I hope I’ll be able to draw the line at the Apple NosePods ;-) reply bbor 4 hours agorootparentprevThanks for sharing, I for one found it relevant! I've always found it somewhat monstrous how much art is in museum archives -- surely \"showcasing stuff behind glass\" is something our civilization can manage?? I'd quibble that what you're really pointing to here is capitalism, though. Architecture isn't monotonous because of our cultural attitude towards architects/Architecture, it's monotonous because capitalists build most buildings, and they're predictably interested in perceived efficiency above all else. There's good reason to argue that beautiful surroundings augment worker productivity so it's not even a clean tradeoff, but in practice, only the richest companies and universities end up taking that risk with beautiful structures[1][2][3] and/or sculptures/fountains/gardens/etc. Obviously, the same dynamic applies to the exclusivity of contemporary art galleries and private collections. In Apple's(/\"tech\"'s) defense, I think they'd absolutely love to sell integrative products whenever possible. The Nintendo Switch was originally marketed[4] as such, and despite being a bit goofy, I imagine it helped sell a lot of units. That's why Apple spent ungodly amounts of money trying to make real AR work before compromising with \"passthrough\" -- they know that people are social creatures, and that a huge driver of their sales is perceived social value.[5] Again: the problem is the system of incentives, not individual bad actors.

(Except as a placeholder for a group of individuals.) The difficulty is in imagining some kind of economic structure in which an Apple or Microsoft could make billions from selling products/services that are somehow public goods, or enhancing public spaces. We can conceive of top design minds at Apple spending billions to create a new personal computing device, but the same minds working on a way to improve public spaces – say, by removing graffiti easily, or planting trees easily – just somehow doesn't make sense or fit into the \"types of things\" they would do. It may also just be a fundamental structural issue, as I talked about in the latter part of the essay. There are far fewer legal restrictions on individual objects than there are on spaces. I.e., while everyone can use an iPhone everywhere, using a device to remove graffiti would come up against all sorts of property rights laws. It's quite a difficult topic to wrap one's mind around, at the end of the day. But yeah in general I agree that it's not necessarily individual bad actors, and incentives are a huge part of it. reply dagmx 3 hours agoparentprevWhat environment on a plane would someone be better out not tuning out? It’s a multi hour flight. I don’t know anyone around me, most are asleep. Many people already tune out the noise with their noise cancelling audio products.

They were from different countries travelling for different reasons. They had a friendly chat for a while about where they were from, why they were on that plane, and some things they enjoyed to do. The whole interaction lasted maybe twenty minutes, from sitting to take off. Then they said “cheers”, one of them went to sleep and the other began watching something on the phone. They didn’t speak again until we landed and from the outside it didn’t feel any of them felt awkward for even a second.

But there is an awful amount of people acting like the environment around you on a plane is worth paying attention to the entire time reply Dylan16807 18 minutes agorootparentprevSo what I get out of this is that while they were nice and friendly and had a good chat, they also tuned each other out for basically the entire flight. Sounds like an example in favor of dagmx's argument, which is not to be unfriendly, but that friendliness is rarely a way to pass multiple hours in a plane. reply latexr 1 minute agorootparentThey didn’t “tune each other out” nor did they tune out the world entirely. Any of them could have resumed the conversation if they wanted to. Heck, I could have easily started up a conversation with them if I felt like it. That’s not tuning out, it’s simply not interacting. Have you never sat in someone’s company, be it a pet or another person, each doing your own thing yet the presence of another made it more pleasant? That doesn’t mean tuning out the other person, quite the contrary. vunderba 2 hours agoparentprev> The more time passes, the less I can shake the feeling that the world would be better if we tuned out our environment less.

Or driving in their cars. I coincidentally demoed the Vision Pro this past weekend and expected to hate it, but was pretty impressed with it. I definitely don't want people walking around NYC with it strapped to their faces, but on a long plane or train ride I can see it being pretty nice. reply bbor 4 hours agorootparentWell put! Though I would argue that the issue being discussed is not short-term distraction in highly dangerous situations like driving a car or sharing a sidewalk in NYC, but rather the long-term psychological effects of filling every spare moment with entertainment. Ever since being forced to bus an hour+ to high school (sans smart phone! Can you imagine?!) I've learned to appreciate what long stretches of contemplation can do for a person. Or, at least, do for me. Of course, my attention span typically maxes out around 2h unless I'm in a particularly thoughtful place in life, such as my bus ride to a new city after undergrad graduation, or the flight home after a big family event. And, of course, being in the window seat is a must -- you'd have to be something of a zen master to peacefully \"raw-dog\" a flight by just starting at the seat in front of you! Rant aside, I absolutely agree that being stuck in place for hours at a time is good reason to want some form of entertainment, and this is arguably the perfect application for VR. Being stuck on a long bus/train/plane without entertainment can feel downright claustrophobic, and it's not like there's any communication with others anyway. Other than the nice flight attendants, which we still have, for some weird reason -- I thought it was a nice touch to clarify that talking to them with the headset for more than a phrase or two feels disrespectful. reply mtalantikite 3 hours agorootparent> but rather the long-term psychological effects of filling every spare moment with entertainment. Oh, for sure. I mean I'm in my 40s and have never owned a TV and have spent every morning with my meditation practice for a very long time. Even on 14+ hour flights I tend to just sit there, maybe listening to music a bit, but largely doing my meditation practice. I'm totally on board with people being present in their environments. But of all the places for someone to use something like the Vision Pro, an airplane seems totally reasonable to me. I'm much more concerned with people needing to scroll TikTok while on the escalator at Whole Foods and what that says about society than someone watching a movie on an international flight! reply latexr 4 hours agorootparentprev> Though I would argue that the issue being discussed is not short-term distraction in highly dangerous situations like driving a car or sharing a sidewalk in NYC, but rather the long-term psychological effects of filling every spare moment with entertainment. Correct. And I also had in mind how those individual psychological effects affect our interactions with the rest of reality and other living beings, which collectively shapes society. I’m reminded of something I read years ago (I don’t recall the source at all and am likely adding details) which argued that US politics were less aggressively divisive in the past because politicians from both sides regularly saw each other and spent time together, meaning they could form more empathy and see the opposition as real human beings and not caricatures. As they spend less time together, it’s easier to fall into the trap of seeing the other side as a “them” unworthy of respect. > I thought it was a nice touch to clarify that talking to them with the headset for more than a phrase or two feels disrespectful. Agreed. reply jon-wood 3 hours agorootparentprev> Other than the nice flight attendants, which we still have, for some weird reason They're trained to get everyone off the plane in under 90 seconds in case of emergency. The handing out of drinks and snacks is a pleasant side effect of their presence. reply beepbooptheory 3 hours agoparentprevThere is something subtle going on with the \"passthrough\" feature. All the marketing and fans continually point to it in a way that feels like tacit acknowledgement of this very point wrt \"tuning out.\" We are all primed for full VR Wall-E experience machines to suck us up into our own world, but the future seems to be more and more about the overlay. Not replacing one picture with another, but just painting and filtering ontop of the original. Not \"I am somewhere else right now\", but \"I am here, but I am doing something you can't see.\" Which, I gotta say, is an even darker formulation at the end of the day! Like at least if we all plugged in and went the Oasis we are truly sharing some base experience of the place; or if its going to be solitary experience machines, at least those experiences would be holistically directed towards me in some consistent package; but with this stuff, you start to think about how much more ground these crooks can still take in stratifying the experience of simply the world itself as we perceive it. reply nonameiguess 4 hours agoparentprevIt's obviously hyperbole. I'm a fairly frequent traveler at this point and probably will continue to be in another decade, and there is no plausible future in which I'm strapping on a VR headset for the duration of a flight. Sometimes I'll read a book but not consistently. More often than not, I watch the landscape pass and get a thrill out of recognizing landmarks from high above. I also like to count the rubberized tracks in a city as it consistently surprises me how many there are when I can never seem to find one to run on where I actually live. On the other hand, I try to take a middle ground here. As much as I get annoyed and shake my fist at clouds these days when I'm trying to run past people on the sidewalks and they've got their faces buried in phones and don't see me coming, I can recognize a lot of people seem to have a deep-seated need for non-stop mental stimulus they don't seem to get from the real world for whatever reason and I'm not going to judge them for that. They're just different from me and that's fine. But I do exist too and it'd be nice if reviewers like this didn't typical mind everyone, either. reply DutchRanger 4 hours agoprevI take out my earbuds even saying Hi to the bus driver I can't imagine talking to a flight attendant while wearing a VR device. It seems very uninterested in the person you are talking to. Could be just me but I think a lot of older generations share this experience. It is not hard to take out your earbuds or take off your VR device to show you are paying attention to the person you are talking to. reply dailykoder 17 minutes agoparent>Could be just me but I think a lot of older generations share this experience. I am only 32 and wouldn't consider myself old. I used to get very uncomfortable, maybe even angry, when people at the cashier in the supermarket just did not get off their headphones and just leave a simple hello to the person at the counter. Nowadays I am just mildly irritated sometimes, but I still think it's stupid. Especially if the cashier is a really nice and polite person. Leaving on your headphones and not saying a word, sometimes not even giving them a look, feels like a f- you in their face. Just be nice to other people and it even works if you are a very socially awkward person like me. The world can be nice and even give you a smile every once in a while. This obviously got worse since corona. Germany used to be a cash-heavy country, but now since \"everyone\" is just paying by card, they just pull it out, wave around with it to signal that they want to pay with it, so that they don't even have to say one single word. So weird. reply cybrox 4 hours agoparentprevThere's a huge shift in this field at the moment. I personally find it disrespectful to talk to people while wearing headphones/earbuds and I'd still consider myself young but a lot of younger people, especially u25 seem to find this completely normal. I'm not sure I like this development. Ignoring the \"disrespectful\" part, it has become accepted to toy with your phone while listening to someone and let's be honest, we all know you're not REALLY listening or engaging with the conversation. reply Quothling 3 hours agorootparentI think your perception of what is being played inside the earbuds may be why you're confused about this. Around here it's extremely common for people to keep their earbuds in for short conversations, but everyone will pause and activate surrounding sounds while they talk. There are obviously assholes who don't, but in general it's completely normal to assume someone wearing earbuds is listening to you. Contradictory to your experience with it being young people who wouldn't listen to you it tends to be the 45ish business man who continues to talk on their phone in my experience. reply drcode 3 hours agorootparent> in general it's completely normal to assume someone wearing earbuds is listening to you Just because you emphatically state that something is normal, that does not make it normal reply Quothling 3 hours agorootparentI think it's a little disingenuous for you to take what I said out of the context I said it in, but you're right as far as it's in my anecdotal experience. Which is why I said \"around here\", but I guess I could've made it even clearer. reply LeafItAlone 3 hours agorootparentprevI personally also take them out. But don’t see it as rude or disrespectful if others don’t. Especially with AirPods gaining hearing aid functionality, it shouldn’t be a sign of lack of focus. As an aside, I personally able to concentrate _more_ in certain scenarios when I am fiddling or have background noise playing. It quiets the part of my brain that otherwise gets distracted. I use that method for video conferences to increase the amount I am focused on the speaker and content. reply darknavi 3 hours agorootparentprevWhat about earbuds aiding in hearing? Lots of scenarios where earbuds can help with hearing and not impede it. I use AirPod Pros on flights for cancelling out the loud background noise of the plane but it makes talking to others much easier. reply kccqzy 3 hours agorootparentIt doesn't give any social cues on how you are using it. That is, people cannot tell whether you are using earbuds to block outside sound or to enhance outside sound. Therefore it doesn't work, until social norms change. I remember the real hearing aids of yesteryear. They look sufficiently different from earbuds that they are always acceptable. reply jayd16 3 hours agoparentprevIt actually is a real pain to put the headset on and off frequently. Much, much more so than earbuds. It's a major UX issue. I don't even really see people take off headphones in this scenario, just uncovering an ear. It would be fairly hilarious to see someone lift up one side of an AR headset to make (singular) eye contact, tho. reply youoy 4 hours agoprev> A big bonus for watching movies in VR on a plane is the fact that you don’t need to conscious about movies that contain graphic scenes.

From what I can tell there are two populations: those who prefer to recline and those who prefer not to. As long as an entire column of seats belongs to one population you're fine (if everyone wants to recline no one loses space, we all just shift around to a configuration in which everyone is more comfortable). But when you have someone more comfortable staying upright sitting behind a recline-preferenced person, that's where issues arise. It's not clear to me whether it's morally wrong for the front person to recline in that case, given that's basically just preferencing the default of \"upright\", which is arbitrary. Nothing here should be read as justifying people who don't pay attention to what's going on behind them and/or recline suddenly/aggressively. It's always something that should be done with a glance behind and a smooth, gentle motion. Maybe also a word to the person sitting behind though again I'm not convinced that's a moral imperative.

I've posted issues and PRs for showstopper issues that took months to get merged in: https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/issues/991 https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/pull/1026 You have the opportunity for the community to lean in on ArchiveBox. I understand it's hard to do everything as a solo dev, we've seen many cases in the community where solo devs get burned out or have personal challenges that take priority etc. It's hard for us users to lean in on ArchiveBox when after a happy month of archiving, things start break and you're left with maintaining a branch of your own fixes that aren't in main. Meanwhile, your solution of soliciting one time donations just makes the whole project feel more rickety and fly-by-night. How about thinking bigger? We NEED ArchiveBox to be a real thing. Decentralized tooling for archiving is SO IMPORTANT. I care about it and I suspect many people do. I'm posting this so other people who care about it can also comment and chime in and suggest how it can become something we can rely on. Because archiving isn't just about the past, it's about the future. Maybe it needs to be a dev org of three committed part-time maintainers, and a small foundation that people recurrently support is what grants it? IDK. I'm not an expert at how to make open source resilient. There have been discussions about this in the past, but I think it's worth a serious look because ArchiveBox is IMPORTANT and I want it to work any month I decide to re-activate my interest in it.

I'm a fan of the ability to create WARC archives from a target, uploard the WARC files to object storage (whether that is IA, S3, Backblaze B2, etc), and then keep them in cold storage or serve them up via HTTPS or a torrent (mutable, preferred). The Internet Archive serves a torrent file for every item they host; one can do the same with WARC archives to enable a distributed archive. CDX indexes can be used for rapidly querying the underlying WARC archives. You might support cryptographically signing WARC archives; Wayback is particular about archive provenance and integrity, for example. https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd0005... (\"CDX Internet Archive Index File\") https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd0002...

(\"Wayback CDX Server API - BETA\") reply nikisweeting 2 hours agoparentI recommend Browsertrix for WARC creation, I think they are the best currently available for WARC/WACZ. ArchiveBox is also gearing up to support real cryptographic signing of archives using https://tlsnotary.org/ in an upcoming plugin. (in a way that actually solves the TLS non-repudation issue, which traditional \"signing a WARC\" does not, more info: https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nd...) reply toomuchtodo 1 hour agorootparentKeep in mind, what signing methodology you use is a function of who accepts it. If I can confirm \"ArchiveTeam ripped this\", that is is superior to whatever tlsnotary is doing with MPC, blockchain, distributed ledger, whatever (in my use case). Have to trust someone at the end of the day. ArchiveTeam's Warrior doesn't use tlsnotary, for example, and rips entire sites just fine. reply nikisweeting 1 hour agorootparentThe idea with TLSNotary is that you can have several universities or central agencies running signing servers but you dont have to share the cleartext content of your archives with them to get it signed. This dramatically changes what is possible with signing because previously to get ArchiveTeam's signature of approval, they would have to see the content themselves to archive it. With TLSNotary they can sign without needing to see the content/access the cookies/etc. reply pzmarzly 1 hour agoparentprevCan you recommend some tools to manage mutable torrents? I.e. create them, edit them, download them and keep them downloaded up to date.

Think of it as a filename of a zip file in a flat distributed filesystem, with the ability to cherrypick files out via traditional bittorrent mechanisms.

For example, if I archive someone's blog, what is stopping me from inserting inflammatory posts that they never wrote, and passing them off as the real deal? Slight update: I see you're using TLS Notary! That's exactly what I would have suggested! reply the_gorilla 2 hours agoprevI don't know how anyone manages to use archivebox. I've tried it twice in the last 3 years and its site compatibility is bad, it quietly leaks everything you archive to archive.org by default, and whenever it fails on a download it stops archiving anything even after deleting and resubmitting all the jobs. I'm sure it works for some people, but not me. reply nikisweeting 2 hours agoparentThese are legitimate gripes that have plagued specific past releases, I hear your frustration. Please keep in mind this was a solo effort of a single developer, only worked on in my spare time over the last 7 years (up until very recently). The new v0.8 adds a BG queue specifically to deal with the issue of stalling when some sites fail. There was a system to do this in the past, but it was imperfect and mostly optimized for the docker setup where a scheduler is running `archivebox update` every few hours to retry failed URLs. Site compability is much improved with the new BETA, but it's a perpetual cat and mouse game to fix specific sites, which is why we think the new plugin system is the way forward. It's just not sustainable for a single company (really just me right now) to maintain hundreds of workarounds for each individual site. I'm also discussing with the Webrecorder and Archive.org teams how we can to share these site-specific workarounds as cross-compatible plugins (aka \"behaviors\") between our various software. > it quietly leaks everything you archive to archive.org by default It's prominently mentioned many times (at least 4) on our homepage that this is the default, and archiving public-only sites (which are already fair game for Archive.org) is a default for good reason. Archiving private content requires several important changes and security considerations. More context: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26866689 reply freedomben 1 hour agorootparentYeah, I'm not sure whether archive.org should be defaulted to on or off (I see both sides of that one), but its existence is definitely surfaced. I love Archive Box btw, thank you for your effort! It's filling a very important need. reply the_gorilla 1 hour agorootparentprevI can accept the other issues, but archivebox needs be private and secure by default. Sending everything to archive.org is bad default value and it erodes a certain level of trust in the project. Requiring \"several important changes and security considerations\" just makes a non-starter. The default settings should be \"safe\" for the default user, because as you mentioned in that post, 90% of users are never going to change them. Users should be able to run it locally and archive data without worrying about security issues, unless you only want experts to be able to use your software. Also a contradiction between your statement and your blogpost, someone saving their photos isn't going to be want to worry about whether they configured your tool correctly or leaking all the group logs or grandma's photos. >It's prominently mentioned many times (at least 4) on our homepage that this is the default, and archiving public-only sites (which are already fair game for Archive.org) is a default for good reason.

The difficult reality currently is that archiving anything non-public is not simple to make safe. Every capture will contain reflected session cookies, usernames, and PII, and other sensitive content. People don't understand that this means if they share a snapshot of one page they're potentially leaking their login credentials for an entire site. It is possible to do safely, and we provide ways to achieve that that I'm constantly working on improving, but until it's easy and straightforward and doesn't require any user education on security implications, I cant make it the default. The goal is to get it to the point where it CAN be the default, but I'm still at least 6mo away from that point. Check out the archivebox/sessions dir in the source code for a look at the development happening here. Until then, it requires some user education and setting up a dedicated chrome profile + cookies + tweaking config to do. (as an intentional barrier to entry for private archiving) reply Apocryphon 45 minutes agorootparentprevPerhaps this data is \"private\" as in \"personal property\" and not \"private\" as in \"confidential.\" reply nikisweeting 18 minutes agorootparentIt's intended for both but it currently requires extra setup to do \"confidential\" because there are security risks. reply hobs 1 hour agorootparentprevAs a custom tool built to archive stuff for archive.org, why would you expect that it can also do a completely opposite task, saving information privately? I can see why you would want such a tool, but it seems like a direct divergence from the core goal of the existing codebase. reply 2 hours agoprev [–] [deleted] GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "GEEK.SG About Now Blog ToolsProjects How I Self-Hosted Llama 3.2 with Coolify on My Home Server: A Step-by-Step Guide Inspired by numerous people migrating their Next.js applications from Vercel to self-hosted VPS on Hetzner due to pricing concerns, I decided to explore self-hosting some of my non-critical applications. Additionally, I wanted to push my technical boundaries by running Llama 3.2 using Ollama and making its API available to power AI applications for my business, Wisp. The objective was to breathe new life into an old home server that once ran high-frequency trading and MEV algorithms but had since become a step stool for my daughter to climb onto the TV console. This blog post chronicles my journey of setting up Coolify to run Ollama (using Llama 3.2) on my home server, with a particular focus on the challenges and triumphs of enabling GPU acceleration using the CUDA toolkit. (Update) Since some of you are curious, this is how Llama 3.2 3B perform on a GeForce RTX 2060: My Goals The primary idea was to leverage my home server, previously gathering dust, to perform valuable tasks. Specifically, I wanted it to host and automate AI-related functions. Additionally, this setup would provide a centralized location to run Supabase for storing various data. The broader goal includes: Serving a Next.js website: This site should be live on the public Internet, auto-deploy from the master branch, work with a public subdomain, and maintain no open public ports for security. Running Llama 3.2: Utilizing the GPU for agentic tasks and making a locally accessible API. Wildcard domain: Enabling new services to spin up effortlessly under varied subdomains. Overall Experience Setting up this environment was no small feat, but each step was a valuable learning experience. Here's a walkthrough of my journey: Installing Ubuntu 24: This was a breeze, requiring only a single reboot. Coolify Installation: The process was smooth thanks to the handy install script, which ensured most prerequisites were met. A minor hiccup was resolved by running commands as root to avoid permission issues with the /data directory. Configuring Coolify: Initially, setting the server as localhost prevented assigning a domain via Cloudflare Tunnel. The fix involved adding the host as a second 'server'. Moreover, configuring the tunnel and SSL correctly took time but was crucial for security and functionality. Cloudflare Tunnel: Patience was key here. The wildcard domain setup was essential, and understanding the nuances of Cloudflare’s free SSL certificate coverage saved time and money. Deployment Wins: Successfully hosting my personal blog using Coolify over a Cloudflare Tunnel was a significant morale boost, fueling the energy needed to proceed with the Ollama setup. Running Ollama: Coolify made deploying the Ollama service straightforward. However, initial trials showed slow inference speeds and heavy CPU usage. Enabling GPU: Ubuntu 24 had the NVIDIA drivers pre-installed, but CUDA toolkit installation and configuration posed challenges. Persistent efforts led to discovering the need for the nvidia-container-toolkit and Docker service configuration modifications to enable GPU usage. The results were remarkable, reducing inference time by over 10x. API Exposure: Securing the LLM API with an API key became the next challenge. After unsuccessful attempts with nginx, I found potential solutions by using Caddy. Something I'll work on next after writing this post. Server Specifications For context, here are the specifications of my home server: CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core GPU: GeForce RTX 2060 RAM: 4 x 16GB DDR4 3200 MT/s SSD: 2TB SSD + 8TB SSD Step-by-Step Guide 1. Install Ubuntu (For a New Setup) Start by installing Ubuntu on your home server. Follow the detailed guide available on the official Ubuntu website. Important Settings: Avoid using LVM or disk encryption for a smoother reboot experience and easier server management. Note that this trade-off means anyone with physical access can read your data. Ensure the installation of third-party drivers to automatically get the NVIDIA driver. Install SSH Enable SSH to access your server remotely, which is especially useful if you’re managing it from another machine on your local network. Refer to this SSH setup guide for Ubuntu 20.04, suitable for Ubuntu 24 as well. Update and Upgrade APT Always perform an update and upgrade for your packages: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y Useful Commands Here are some additional commands for printing information about your machine and setup: View CPU usage: htop List NVIDIA graphics card information: lspcigrep -i nvidia Print architecture, OS distro, release: uname -m && cat /etc/*release Print physical RAM installed: sudo dmidecode --type memoryless Print processor info: cat /proc/cpuinfogrep 'name'| uniq Check NVIDIA driver information: nvidia-smi 2. Installing Coolify Coolify is an open-source platform designed to make deploying and managing your applications on self-hosted environments easier. Its key feature is allowing users to manage full-stack applications, databases, and services without relying on complex Kubernetes setups. Coolify streamlines deployments through a user-friendly interface, supporting services like Docker, GitHub, and GitLab. To install Coolify, follow the automated installation instructions from their documentation: curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.shbash Important Notes: Ensure you’re logged in as the root user to avoid permission issues. The installation script checks prerequisites, but you may need to troubleshoot some dependency errors if they arise. Once Coolify is installed: Visit the coolify dashboard at http://localhost:8000 . This is also available on the network. Replace localhost with the ip address of the server if you are accessing it from another machine. Set up an admin account - this is stored locally on your server. Create your first project by adding a resource and deploying it to localhost. In my case, I deployed my personal blog first to test the setup. 3. Setting Up a Cloudflare Tunnel on Coolify Cloudflare Tunnel is a secure way to expose services running on your local network to the public internet without having to open ports on your router. For my setup, this was a key feature, as I wanted to keep my server behind a firewall while still allowing external access to some services. Cloudflare’s Zero Trust platform ensures that all traffic is encrypted and routed securely, preventing unauthorized access. To set up a Cloudflare Tunnel, follow this instructions on Coolify’s official documentation. The key is to focus on setting up wildcard subdomains for all your services. A few key caveats: Localhost Server Issue: You cannot assign a domain to the pre-created localhost server directly. To solve this, add your host as a second server within Coolify, using the IP address 172.17.0.1 for host.docker.internal (since coolify will show an error that host.docker.internal has already been assigned to a server). Wildcard Domain Setup: Make sure you use a top-level domain like *.example.com. If you use a wildcard on a subdomain, Cloudflare will not provide a free SSL certificate, unless you opt for the ACM plan. After setting up the Cloudflare Tunnel: Deploy your resources to the newly added server. Change the domain in the service configuration to match your new subdomain. Once everything is deployed, you should be able to access your service live from its custom domain. 4. Deploying Ollama Once you’ve set up your Coolify project, the next step is to deploy Ollama. This service allows you to run large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3.2 on your server with a web-based interface. Add a New Resource: In your Coolify project, select \"Add Resource\" and choose Ollama with Open WebUI as the service you want to deploy to your new server. Configure the Domain: After adding Ollama, configure the domain for the Open WebUI service. Assign a domain from the wildcard domain you set up earlier through Cloudflare Tunnel. This will allow you to access the Ollama WebUI directly from the internet. Deploy the Service: Once everything is set up, click on \"Deploy.\" You should now be able to access the Open WebUI via the assigned domain. Upon your first login, you'll be prompted to create an admin account. This is important for managing models and access through the UI. Install Llama 3.2: With your admin account set up, you can now install the latest Llama model. Head to Ollama's library and search for the Llama model you want to use. I opted for Llama 3.2, which can be installed using the tag llama3.2. Try Your First Chat: Once installed, initiate your first chat with Llama 3.2 via the web interface. During this phase, your model will likely run on the CPU, so expect to hear your machine working hard (with increased CPU fan noise). To monitor your machine’s performance during this, use the following commands: htop to keep an eye on CPU usage. watch -n 0.5 nvidia-smi to track GPU usage (though at this stage, GPU may not be utilized yet). 5. Configuring Ollama to Use GPU Large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3.2 perform significantly better with GPU acceleration. GPUs, particularly those from NVIDIA, are optimized for the heavy parallel computations involved in AI workloads, which is where CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) comes into play. The CUDA toolkit enables direct GPU acceleration for applications like Ollama, drastically reducing inference time and CPU load. This is arguably the most challenging step in setting up Ollama on your server, but here’s a breakdown of the process: (Already Done): Install the NVIDIA driver (this should have been handled during your Ubuntu installation). Install the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit: This toolkit is necessary to unlock GPU acceleration. (Optional): Test that the CUDA toolkit is working correctly. Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit: This will allow Docker containers (like Ollama) to access the GPU. Enable the Ollama service in Coolify to use the GPU. Install the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Follow NVIDIA’s official installation guide to install the CUDA toolkit for your system. I recommend using the network repository installation method for the most flexibility and ease of updates. Install the new cuda-keyring package: wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos///cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb Replace / with the appropriate value for your distribution and architecture: ubuntu2004/arm64 ubuntu2004/sbsa ubuntu2004/x86_64 ubuntu2204/sbsa ubuntu2204/x86_64 ubuntu2404/sbsa ubuntu2404/x86_64 Update the APT repository cache: sudo apt-get update Install the CUDA SDK: sudo apt-get install cuda-toolkit Set up the environment for CUDA by adding its binaries to your PATH: export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.6/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}} Reboot the system to ensure all configurations take effect: sudo reboot (Optional) Test that CUDA Toolkit Works To ensure that your system is correctly configured for GPU acceleration, test the CUDA installation by compiling and running sample programs provided by NVIDIA (https://github.com/nvidia/cuda-samples). First, install the necessary build tools: sudo apt install build-essential Clone the CUDA sample repository and build the sample projects: git clone https://github.com/nvidia/cuda-samples cd cuda-samples make Navigate to the compiled binaries and run the deviceQuery tool to verify your GPU and CUDA installation: cd bin/x86_64/linux/release ./deviceQuery You should see detailed information about your GPU and CUDA environment, confirming that the toolkit is working correctly. Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit To enable Docker containers to access your GPU, you'll need to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. This toolkit allows Docker to offload GPU-intensive operations to your NVIDIA GPU, essential for speeding up tasks like model inference with Ollama. Follow the steps below from Ollama docker docs to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit: Configure the repository: curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey \\sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list \\sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' \\sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list sudo apt-get update Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit packages: sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit With the container toolkit installed, Docker will now be able to use your GPU. Enable Ollama Service in Coolify to Use GPU To enable GPU support for the Ollama service in Coolify, you'll need to modify the Docker Compose file to allow access to all the GPUs on the host machine. Edit the Compose File: Navigate to the Ollama service in Coolify and select \"Edit Compose File.\" Add GPU Configuration: Append the following configuration under the ollama-api resource. This enables Docker to utilize all GPUs available on the host system: deploy: resources: reservations: devices: - driver: nvidia count: all capabilities: - gpu Restart the Service: After saving the changes, restart the Ollama service by clicking the \"Restart\" button in Coolify. Once restarted, Ollama will now leverage your GPU for model inference. You can verify that it's using the GPU by running: htop to check CPU usage (it should remain low). watch -n 0.5 nvidia-smi to see the GPU usage in action. Testing GPU Performance Try initiating another conversation with Llama 3.2 via the web UI. This time, you should notice a significant reduction in CPU load, as the GPU will handle the inference tasks. Congratulations! You’ve successfully configured Ollama to use GPU acceleration through Coolify on your home server! Next Steps The final step in securing your setup is to expose the LLM API to the internet while ensuring it’s protected by an API key. Using Caddy, you can enforce API key access for the Ollama service. For a detailed guide, refer to this discussion. Conclusion In this post, I detailed my journey of setting up Llama 3.2 on my home server, utilizing GPU acceleration to handle AI workloads efficiently. Starting from a simple Ubuntu setup, I navigated the complexities of installing NVIDIA drivers, configuring Docker for GPU support, and deploying Ollama using Coolify. With this setup, I now have a powerful AI system running locally, handling agentic tasks with ease. This guide walks through the entire process, from software installations to troubleshooting, and provides a blueprint for anyone looking to do the same.

I just closed my account on SmugMug and published my images locally using my NAS; this costs no extra money (is basically free) since the photos were already on the NAS, and the NAS is already powered on 24-7. The NAS I use is an Asustor so it's not really Linux and you can't install what you want on it, but it has Apache, Python and PHP with Sqlite extension, which is more than enough for basic websites. Cloudflare free is like magic. Response times are near instantaneous and setup is minimal. You don't even have to configure an SSL certificate locally, it's all handled for you and works for wildcard subdomains. And of course if one puts a real server behind it, like in the post, anything's possible. reply ghoomketu 7 hours agoparent> Cloudflare free is like magic Cloudflare is pretty strict about the Html to media ratio and might suspend or terminate your account if you are serving too many images.

Some public IP will need to have ports 443/80 open. reply nirav72 5 hours agorootparentprevThat requires opening a firewall port on router. For some people, that might not be possible.

Personally, I have some notes and bookmarks that I'd like to scrape, then have an LLM summarize, generate hierarchical tags, and store in a database. For the notes part at least, I wouldn't want to give them to another provider; even for the bookmarks, I wouldn't be comfortable passing my reading profile to anyone. reply xyc 11 hours agoparentllama3.2 1b & 3b is really useful for quick tasks like creating some quick scripts from some text, then pasting them to execute as it's super fast & replaces a lot of temporary automation needs. If you don't feel like invest time into automation, sometimes you can just feed into an LLM. This is one of the reason why recently I added floating chat to https://recurse.chat/ to quickly access local LLM. Here's a demo: https://x.com/recursechat/status/1846309980091330815 reply taosx 10 hours agorootparentLooks very nice, saved it for later. Last week, I worked on implementing always-on speech-to-text functionality for automating tasks. I've made significant progress, achieving decent accuracy, but I imposed some self-imposed constraints to implement certain parts from scratch to deliver a single binary deployable solution, which means I still have work to do (audio processing is new territory for me). However, I'm optimistic about its potential. That being said, I think the more straightforward approach would be to utilize an existing library like https://github.com/collabora/WhisperLive/ within a Docker container. This way, you can call it via WebSocket and integrate it with my LLM, which could also serve as a nice feature in your product. reply xyc 10 hours agorootparentThanks! lmk when/if you wanna give it a spin as free trial hasn't been updated with the latest but I'll try to do it this week. I've actually been playing around with speech to text recently. Thank you for the pointer, docker is a bit too heavy to deploy for desktop app use case but it's good to know about the repo. Building binaries with Pyinstaller could be an option though. Real time transcription seems a bit complicated as it involves VAD so a feasible path for me is to first ship simple transcription with whisper.cpp. large-v3-turbo looks fast enough :D reply taosx 10 hours agorootparentYes it's fast enough, especially if you don't need something live. reply afro88 9 hours agorootparentprevCan you list some real temporary automation needs you've fulfilled?

Immediately and constantly if you ask anything hard. An 8b model is not chat-gpt. The 3B model in the OP post is not chat-gpt. The capability compared to sonnet/4o is like a potato and a car. Search for 'LLM Leaderboard' and you can see for yourself. The 8b models do not even rank. They're generally not capable enough to use as a self hosted assistant. reply worldsayshi 8 hours agorootparentI really hope we can get sonnet like performance down to single consumer level GPU someone soon. Maybe the hardware will get there before the models. reply TechDebtDevin 1 hour agorootparentWell considering it probably takes several hundred GBs of VRAM to run inference for Claude its going to be a while. But yes, like the guy above said it's really only helpful for one line commands. Like if I forgot some sort flag thats available for a certain type of command. Or random things I don't work with often enough to memorize their little build commands etc. It's not helpful for programming just simple commands. It also can help with unstructured or messy data to make it more readable, although there's potential to hallucinate if the context is at all large. reply lolinder 4 hours agorootparentprev> Search for 'LLM Leaderboard' and you can see for yourself. The 8b models do not even rank. This is not true. On benchmarks, maybe, but I find the LLM Arena more accurately accounts for the subjective experience of using these things, and Llama 3.1 8B ranks relatively high, outperforming GPT-3.5 and certain iterations of 4. Where the 8Bs do struggle is that they don't have as deep a repository of knowledge, so using them without some form of RAG won't get you as good results as using a plain larger model. But frankly I'm not convinced that RAG-free chat is the future anyway, and 8B models are extremely fast and cheap to run. Combined with good RAG they can do very well. reply Rick76 6 hours agoparentprevI essentially use it like everyone else.

If it fits in GPU memory the inference speed is quite decent. However I've found quality of smaller models to be quite lacking. The Llama 3.2 3B for example is much worse than Gemma2 9B, which is the one I found performs best while fitting comfortably. Actual sentences are fine, but it doesn't follow prompts as well and it doesn't \"understand\" the context very well. Quantization brings down memory cost, but there seems to be a sharp decline below 5 bits for those I tried. So a larger but heavily quantized model usually performs worse, at least with the models I've tried so far. So with only 6GB of GPU memory I think you either have to accept the hit on inference speed by only partially offloading, or accept fairly low model quality. Doesn't mean the smaller models can't be useful, but don't expect ChatGPT 4o at home. That said if you got a beefy CPU then it can be reasonable to have it do a few of the layers.

    "originBody": "Hofstadter on Lisp In the mid-80s, while reading through my roommate's collection of Scientific American back issues, I encountered this introduction to Lisp written by Douglas Hofstadter. I found it very charming at the time, and provide it here (somewhat illegally) for the edification of a new generation of Lispers. In a testament to the timelessness of Lisp, you can still run all the examples below in emacs if you install these aliases: (defalias 'plus #'+) (defalias 'quotient #'/) (defalias 'times #'*) (defalias 'difference #'-) Lisp: Atoms and Lists February, 1983 IN previous columns I have written quite often about the field of artificial intelligence - the search for ways to program computers so that they might come to behave with flexibility, common sense, insight, creativity, self awareness, humor, and so on. The quest for AI started in earnest over two decades ago, and since then has bifurcated many times, so that today it is a very active and multifaceted research area. In the United States there are perhaps a couple of thousand people professionally involved in AI, and there are a similar number abroad. Although there is among these workers a considerable divergence of opinion concerning the best route to AI, one thing that is nearly unanimous is the choice of programming language. Most AI research efforts are carried out in a language called \"Lisp\". (The name is not quite an acronym; it stands for \"list processing\".) Why is most AI work done in Lisp? There are many reasons, most of which are somewhat technical, but one of the best is quite simple: Lisp is crisp. Or as Marilyn Monroe said in The Seven-Year Itch, \"I think it's just elegant!\" Every computer language has arbitrary features, and most languages are in fact overloaded with them. A few, however, such as Lisp and Algol, are built around a kernel that seems as natural as a branch of mathematics. The kernel of Lisp has a crystalline purity that not only appeals to the esthetic sense, but also makes Lisp a far more flexible language than most others. Because of Lisp's beauty and centrality in this important area of modern science, then, I have decided to devote a trio of columns to some of the basic ideas of Lisp. The deep roots of Lisp lie principally in mathematical logic. Mathematical pioneers such as Thoralf Skolem, Kurt Godel, and Alonzo Church contributed seminal ideas to logic in the 1920's and 1930's that were incorporated decades later into Lisp. Computer programming in earnest began in the 1940's, but so-called \"higher-level\" programming languages (of which Lisp is one) came into existence only in the 1950's. The earliest list-processing language was not Lisp but IPL (\"Information Processing Language\"), developed in the mid-1950's by Herbert Simon, Allen Newell, and J. C. Shaw. In the years 1956-58, John McCarthy, drawing on all these previous sources, came up with an elegant algebraic list-processing language he called Lisp. It caught on quickly with the young crowd around him at the newly-formed MIT Artificial Intelligence Project, was implemented on the IBM 704, spread to other AI groups, infected them, and has stayed around all these years. Many dialects now exist, but all of them share that central elegant kernel. Let us now move on to the way Lisp really works. One of the most appealing features of Lisp is that it is interactive, as contrasted with most other higher-level languages, which are noninteractive. What this means is the following. When you want to program in Lisp, you sit down at a terminal connected to a computer and you type the word \"lisp\" (or words to that effect). The next thing you will see on your screen is a so-called \"prompt\" - a characteristic symbol such as an arrow or asterisk. I like to think of this prompt as a greeting spoken by a special \"Lisp genie\", bowing low and saying to you, \"Your wish is my command - and now, what is your next wish?\" The genie then waits for you to type something to it. This genie is usually referred to as the Lisp interpreter, and it will do anything you want but you have to take great care in expressing your desires precisely, otherwise you may reap some disastrous effects. Shown below is the prompt, showing that the Lisp genie is ready to do your bidding: > The genie is asking us for our heart's desire, so let us type in a simple expression: > (plus 2 2) and then a carriage return. (By the way, all Lisp expressions and words will be printed in Helvetica in this and the following two chapters.) Even non-Lispers can probably anticipate that the Lisp genie will print in return. the value 4. Then it will also print a fresh prompt, so that the screen will now appear this way: > (plus 2 2) 4 > The genie is now ready to carry out our next command - or, more politely stated, our next wish - should we have one. The carrying-out of a wish expressed as a Lisp statement is called evaluation of that statement. The preceding short interchange between human and computer exemplifies the behavior of the Lisp interpreter: it reads a statement, evaluates it, prints the appropriate value, and then signals its readiness to read a new statement. For this reason, the central activity of the Lisp interpreter is referred to as the read-eval-print loop. The existence of this Lisp genie (the Lisp interpreter) is what makes Lisp interactive. You get immediate feedback as soon as you have typed a \"wish\" - a complete statement - to Lisp. And the way to get a bunch of wishes carried out is to type one, then ask the genie to carry it out, then type another, ask the genie again, and so on. By contrast, in many higher-level computer languages you must write out an entire program consisting of a vast number of wishes to be carried out in some specified order. What's worse is that later wishes usually depend strongly on the consequences of earlier wishes - and of course, you don't get to try them out one by one. The execution of such a program may, needless to say, lead to many unexpected results, because so many wishes have to mesh perfectly together. If you've made the slightest conceptual error in designing your wish list, then a total foul-up is likely - in fact, almost inevitable. Running a program of this sort is like launching a new space probe, untested: you can't possibly have anticipated all the things that might go wrong, and so all you can do is sit back and watch, hoping that it will work. If it fails, you go back and correct the one thing the failure revealed, and then try another launch. Such a gawky, indirect, expensive way of programming is in marked contrast to the direct, interactive, one-wish-at-atime style of Lisp, which allows \"incremental\" program development and debugging. This is another major reason for the popularity of Lisp. What sorts of wishes can you type to the Lisp genie for evaluation, and what sorts of things will it print back to you? Well, to begin with, you can type arithmetical expressions expressed in a rather strange way, such as (times (plus 6 3) (difference 6 3)). The answer to this is 27, since (plus 6 3) evaluates to 9, and (difference 6 3) evaluates to 3, and their product is 27. This notation, in which each operation is placed to the left of its operands, was invented by the Polish logician Jan Lukasiewicz before computers existed. Unfortunately for Lukasiewicz, his name was too formidable-looking for most speakers of English, and so this type of notation came to be called Polish notation. Here is a simple problem in this notation for you, in which you are to play the part of the Lisp genie: > (quotient (plus 2113) (difference 23 (times 2 (difference 7 (plus 2 2))))) Perhaps you have noticed that statements of Lisp involve parentheses. A profusion of parentheses is one of the hallmarks of Lisp. It is not uncommon to see an expression that terminates in a dozen right parentheses! This makes many people shudder at first - and yet once you get used to their characteristic appearance, Lisp expressions become remarkably intuitive, even, charming, to the eye, especially when pretty printed, which means that a careful indentation scheme is followed that reveals their logical structure. All of the expressions in displays in this article have been pretty-printed. The heart of Lisp is its manipulable structures. All programs in Lisp work by creating, modifying, and destroying structures. Structures come in two types: atomic and composite, or, as they are usually called, atoms and lists. Thus, every Lisp object is either an atom or a list (but not both). The only exception is the special object called nil, which is both an atom and a list. More about nil in a moment. What are some other typical Lisp atoms? Here are a few: hydrogen, helium, j-s-bach, 1729, 3.14159, pi, arf, foo, bar, baz, buttons-&-bows Lists are the flexible data structures of Lisp. A list is pretty much what it sounds like: a collection of some parts in a specific order. The parts of a list are usually called its elements or members. What can these members be? Well, not surprisingly, lists can have atoms as members. But just as easily, lists can contain lists as members, and those lists can in turn contain other lists as members, and so on, recursively. Oops! I jumped the gun with that word. But no harm done. You certainly understood what I meant, and it will prepare you for a more technical definition of the term to come later. A list printed on your screen is recognizable by its parentheses. In Lisp, anything bounded by matching parentheses constitutes a list. So, for instance, (zonk blee strill (croak flonk)) is a four-element list whose last element is itself a two-element list. Another short list is (plus 2 2), illustrating the fact that Lisp statements themselves are lists. This is important because it means that the Lisp genie, by manipulating lists and atoms, can actually construct new wishes by itself. Thus the object of a wish can be the construction - and subsequent evaluation - of a new wish! Then there is the empty list - the list with no elements at all. How is this written down? You might think that an empty pair of parentheses - () - would work. Indeed, it will work - but there is a second way of indicating the empty list, and that is by writing nil. The two notations are synonymous, although nil is more commonly written than () is. The empty list, nil, is a key concept of Lisp; in the universe of lists, it is what zero is in the universe of numbers. To use another metaphor for nil, it is like the earth in which all structures are rooted. But for you to understand what this means, you will have to wait a bit. The most commonly exploited feature of an atom is that it has (or can be given) a value. Some atoms have permanent values, while others are variables. As you might expect, the value of the atom 1729 is the integer 1729, and this is permanent. (I am distinguishing here between the atom whose print name or pname is the four-digit string 1729, and the eternal Platonic essence that happens to be the sum of two cubes in two different ways - i.e., the number 1729.) The value of nil is also permanent, and it is - nil! Only one other atom has itself as its permanent value, and that is the special atom t. Aside from t, nil, and atoms whose names are numerals, atoms are generally variables, which means that you can assign values to them and later change their values at will. How is this done? Well, to assign the value 4 to the atom pie, you can type to the Lisp genie (setq pie 4). Or you could just as well type (setq pie (plus 2 2)) - or even (setq pie (plus 1 1 1 1)). In any of these cases, as soon as you type your carriage return, pie's value will become 4, and so it will remain forevermore - or at least until you do another setq operation on the atom pie. Lisp would not be crisp if the only values atoms could have were numbers. Fortunately, however, an atom's value can be set to any kind of Lisp object - any atom or list whatsoever. For instance, we might want to make the value of the atom pi be a list such as (a b c) or perhaps (plus 2 2) instead of the number 4. To do the latter, we again use the setq operation. To illustrate, here follows a brief conversation with the genie: > (setq pie (plus 2 2)) 4 > (setq pi '(plus 2 2)) (plus 2 2) Notice the vast difference between the values assigned to the atoms pie and pi as a result of these two wishes asked of the Lisp genie, which differ merely in the presence or absence of a small but critical quote mark in front of the inner list (plus 2 2). In the first wish, containing no quote mark, that inner (plus 2 2) must be evaluated. This returns 4, which is assigned to the variable pie as its new value. On the other hand, in the second wish, since the quote mark is there, the list (plus 2 2) is never executed as a command, but is treated merely as an inert lump of Lispstuff, much like meat on a butcher's shelf. It is ever so close to being \"alive\", yet it is dead. So the value of pi in this second case is the list (plus 2 2), a fragment of Lisp code. The following interchange with the genie confirms the values of these atoms. > pie 4 > pi (plus 2 2) > (eval pi) 4 > What is this last step? I wanted to show how you can ask the genie to evaluate the value of an expression, rather than simply printing the value of that expression. Ordinarily, the genie automatically performs just one level of evaluation, but by writing eval, you can get a second stage of evaluation carried out. (And of course, by using eval over and over again, you can carry this as far as you like.) This feature often proves invaluable, but it is a little too advanced to discuss further at this stage. Every list but nil has at least one element. This first element is called the list's Car. Thus the car of (eval pi) is the atom eval. The cars of the lists (plus 2 2), (setq x 17), (eval pi), and (car pi) are all names of operations, or, as they are more commonly called in Lisp, functions. The car of a list need not be the name of a function; it need not even be an atom. For instance, ((1)(2 2) (3 3 3)) is a perfectly fine list. Its car is the list (1), whose car in turn is not a function name but merely a numeral. If you were to remove a list's car, what would remain? A shorter list. This is called the list's cdr, a word that sounds about halfway between \"kidder\" and \"could'er\". (The words \"car\" and \"cdr\" are quaint relics from the first implementation of Lisp on the IBM 704. The letters in \"car\" stand for \"Contents of the Address part of Register\" and those in \"cdr\" for \"Contents of the Decrement part of Register referring to specific hardware features of that machine, now long since irrelevant.) The cdr of (a b c d) is the list (b c d), whose cdr is (c d), whose cdr is (d), whose cdr is nil. And nil has no cdr, just as it has no car. Attempting to take the car or cdr of nil causes (or should cause) the Lisp genie to cough out an error message, just as attempting to divide by zero should evoke an error message. Here is a little table showing the car and cdr of a few lists, just to make sure the notions are unambiguous. list car cdr ((a) b (c)) (a) (b (c)) (plus 2 2) plus (2 2) ((car x) (car y)) (car x) ((car y)) (nil nil nil nil) nil (nil nil nil) (nil) nil nil nil **ERROR** **ERROR** Just as car and cdr are called functions, so the things that they operate on are called their arguments. Thus in the command (plus pie 2), plus is the function name, and the arguments are the atoms pie and 2. In evaluating this command (and most commands), the genie figures out the values of the arguments, and then applies the function to those values. Thus, since the value of the atom pie is 4, and the value of the atom 2 is 2, the genie returns the atom 6. Suppose you have a list and you'd like to see a list just like it, only one element longer. For instance, suppose the value of the atom x is (cake cookie) and you'd like to create a new list called y just like x, except with an extra atom-say pie - at the front. You can then use the function called cons (short for \"construct\"), whose effect is to make a new list out of an old list and a suggested car. Here's a transcript of such a process: >(setq x '(cake cookie)) (cake cookie) >(setq y (cons 'pie x)) (pie cake cookie) > x (cake cookie) Two things are worth noticing here. I asked for the value of x to be printed out after the cons operation, so you could see that x itself was not changed by the cons. The cons operation created a new list and made that list be the value of y, but left x entirely alone. The other noteworthy fact is that I used that quote mark again, in front of the atom pie. What if I had not used it? Here's what would have happened. > (setq z (cons pie x)) (4 cake cookie) Remember, after all, that the atom pie still has the value 4, and whenever the genie sees an unquoted atom inside a wish, it will always use the value belonging to that atom, rather than the atom's name. (Always? Well, almost always. I'll explain in a moment. In the meantime, look for an exception - you've already encountered it.) Now here are a few exercises - some a bit tricky - for you. Watch out for the quote marks! Oh, one last thing: I use the function reverse, which produces a list just like its argument, only with its elements in reverse order. For instance, the genie, upon being told (reverse '((a b) (c d e))) will write ((c d e) (a b)). The genie's lines in this dialogue are given afterward. > (setq w (cons pie '(cdr z))) > (setq v (cons 'pie (cdr z))) > (setq u (reverse v)) > (cdr (cdr u)) > (car (cdr u)) > (cons (car (cdr u)) u) > u > (reverse '(cons (car u) (reverse (cdr u)))) > (reverse (cons (car u) (reverse (cdr u)))) > u > (cons 'cookie (cons 'cake (cons 'pie nil))) Answers (as printed by the genie): (4 cdr z) (pie cake cookie) (cookie cake pie) (pie) cake (cake cookie cake pie) (cookie cake pie) ((reverse (cdr u)) (car u) cons) (cake pie cookie) (cookie cake pie) (cookie cake pie) The last example, featuring repeated use of cons, is often called, in Lisp slang \"consing up a list\". You start with nil, and then do repeated cons operations. It is analogous to building a positive integer by starting at zero and then performing the successor operation over and over again. However, whereas at any stage in the latter process there is a unique way of performing the successor operation, given any list there are infinitely many different items you can cons onto it, thus giving rise to a vast branching tree of lists instead of the unbranching number line. It is on account of this image of a tree growing out of the ground of nil and containing all possible lists that I earlier likened nil to \"the earth in which all structures are rooted\". As I mentioned a moment ago, the genie doesn't always replace (unquoted) atoms by their values. There are cases where a function treats its arguments, though unquoted, as if quoted. Did you go back and find such a case? It's easy. The answer is the function setq. In particular, in a setq command, the first atom is taken straight-not evaluated. As a matter of fact, the q in setq stands for \"quote\", meaning that the first argument is treated as if quoted. Things can get quite tricky when you learn about set, a function similar to setq except that it does evaluate its first argument. Thus, if the value of the atom x is the atom k, then saying (set x 7) will not do anything to x-its value will remain the atom k-but the value of the atom k will now become 7. So watch closely: > (setq a 'b) > (setq b 'c) > (setq c 'a) > (set a c) > (set c b) Now tell me: What are the values of the atoms a, b, and c? Here comes the answer, so don't peek. They are, respectively: a, a, and a. This may seem a bit confusing. You may be reassured to know that in Lisp, set is not very commonly used, and such confusions do not arise that often. Psychologically, one of the great powers of programming is the ability to define new compound operations in terms of old ones, and to do this over and over again, thus building up a vast repertoire of ever more complex operations. It is quite reminiscent of evolution, in which ever more complex molecules evolve out of less complex ones, in an ever-upward spiral of complexity and creativity. It is also quite reminiscent of the industrial revolution, in which people used very simple early machines to help them build more complex machines, then used those in turn to build even more complex machines, and so on, once again in an ever-upward spiral of complexity and creativity. At each stage, whether in evolution or revolution, the products get more flexible and more intricate, more \"intelligent\" and yet more vulnerable to delicate \"bugs\" or breakdowns. Likewise with programming in Lisp, only here the \"molecules\" or \"machines\" are now Lisp functions defined in terms of previously known Lisp functions. Suppose, for instance, that you wish to have a function that will always return the last element of a list, just as car always returns the first element of a list. Lisp does not come equipped with such a function, but you can easily create one. Do you see how? To get the last element of a list called lyst, you simply do a reverse on lyst and then take the car of that: (car (reverse lyst)). To dub this operation with the name rac (car backwards), we use the def function, as follows: > (def rac (lambda (lyst) (car (reverse lyst)))) Using def this way creates a function definition. In it, the word lambda followed by (lyst) indicates that the function we are defining has only one parameter, or dummy variable, to be called lyst. (It could have been called anything; I just happen to like the atom lyst.) In general, the list of parameters (dummy variables) must immediately follow the word lambda. After this \"def wish\" has been carried out, the rac function is as well understood by the genie as is car. Thus (rac '(your brains)) will yield the atom brains. And we can use rac itself in definitions of yet further functions. The whole thing snowballs rather miraculously, and you can quickly become overwhelmed by the power you wield. Here is a simple example. Suppose you have a situation where you know you are going to run into many big long lists and you know it will often be useful to form, for each such long list, a short list that contains just its car and rac. We can define a one-parameter function to do this for you: > (def readers-digest-condensed-version (lambda (biglonglist) (cons (car biglonglist) (cons (rac biglonglist) nil)))) Thus if we apply our new function readers-digest-condensed-version to the entire text of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake (treating it as a big long list of words), we will obtain the shorter list (riverrun the). Unfortunately, reapplying the condensation operator to this new list will not simplify it any further. It would be nice as well as useful if we could create an inverse operation to readers-digest-condensed-version called rejoyce that, given any two words, would create a novel beginning and ending with them, respectively - and such that James Joyce would have written it (had he thought of it). Thus execution of the Lisp statement (rejoyce 'Stately 'Yes) would result in the Lisp genie generating from scratch the entire novel Ulysses. Writing this function is left as an exercise for the reader. To test your program, see what it does with (rejoyce 'karma 'dharma). One goal that has seemed to some people to be both desirable and feasible using Lisp and related programming languages is (1) to make every single statement return a value and (2) to have it be through this returned value and only through it that the statement has any effect. The idea of (1) is that values are handed \"upward\" from the innermost function calls to the outermost ones, until the full statement's value is returned to you. The idea of (2) is that during all these calls, no atom has its value changed at all (unless the atom is a dummy variable). In all dialects of Lisp known to me, (1) is true, but (2) is not necessarily true. Thus if x is bound to (a b c d e) and you say (car (cdr (reverse x))), the first thing that happens is that (reverse x) is calculated; then this value is handed \"up\" to the cdr function, which calculates the cdr of that list; finally, this shorter list is handed to the car function, which extracts one element-namely the atom d-and returns it. In the meantime, the atom x has suffered no damage; it is still bound to (a b c d e). It might seem that an expression such as (reverse x) would change the value of x by reversing it, just as carrying out the oral command \"Turn your sweater inside out\" will affect the sweater. But actually, carrying out the wish (reverse x) no more changes the value of x than carrying out the wish (plus 2 2) changes the value of 2. Instead, executing (reverse x) causes a new (unnamed) list to come into being, just like x, only reversed. And that list is the value of the statement; it is what the statement returns. The value of x itself, however, is untouched. Similarly, evaluating (cons 5 pi) will not change the list named pi in the slightest; it merely returns a new list with 5 as its car and whatever pi's value is as its cdr. Such behavior is to be contrasted with that of functions that leave \"side effects\" in their wake. Such side effects are usually in the form of changed variable bindings, although there are other possibilities, such as causing input or output to take place. A typical \"harmful\" command is a setq, and proponents of the \"applicative\" school of programming - the school that says you should never make any side effects whatsoever - are profoundly disturbed by the mere mention of setq. For them, all results must come about purely by the way that functions compute their values and hand them to other functions. The only bindings that the advocates of the applicative style approve of are transitory \"lambda bindings\" - those that arise when a function is applied to its arguments. Whenever any function is called, that function's dummy variables temporarily assume \"lambda bindings\". These bindings are just like those caused by a setq, except that they are fleeting. That is, the moment the function is finished computing, they go away - vanishing without a trace. For example, during the computation of (rac '(a b c)), the lambda binding of the dummy variable lyst is the list (a b c); but as soon as the answer c is passed along to the function or person that requested the rac, the value of the atom lyst used in getting that answer is totally forgotten. The Lisp interpreter will tell you that lyst is an \"unbound atom\" if you ask for its value. Applicative programmers much prefer lambda bindings to ordinary setq bindings. I personally am not a fanatic about avoiding setq's and other functions that cause side effects. Though I find the applicative style to be jus-telegant, I find it impractical when it comes to the construction of large AI-style programs. Therefore I shall not advocate the applicative style here, though I shall adhere to it when possible. Strictly speaking, in applicative programming, you cannot even define new functions, since a def statement causes a permanent change to take place in the genie's memory - namely, the permanent storage in memory of the function definition. So the ideal applicative approach would have functions, like variable bindings, being created only temporarily, and their definitions would be discarded the moment after they had been used. But this is extreme \"applicativism\". For your edification, here are a few more simple function definitions. > (def rdc (lambda (lyst) (reverse (cdr (reverse lyst))))) > (def snoc (lambda (x lyst) (reverse (cons x (reverse lyst))))) > (def twice (lambda (n) (plus n n))) The functions rdc and snoc are analogous to cdr and cons, only backwards. Thus, the rdc of (a b c d e) is (a b c d), and if you type (snoc 5 '(1 2 3 4)), you will get (1 2 3 4 5) as your answer. All of this is mildly interesting so far, but if you want to see the genie do anything truly surprising, you have to allow it to make some decisions based on things that happen along the way. These are sometimes called \"conditional wishes\". A typical example would be the following: > (cond ((eq x 1) 'land) ((eq x 2) 'sea)) The value returned by this statement will be the atom land if x has value 1, and the atom sea if x has value 2. Otherwise, the value returned will be nil (i.e., if x is 5). The atom eq (pronounced \"eek\") is the name of a common Lisp function that returns the atom t (standing for \"true\") if its two arguments have the same value, and nil (for \"no\" or \"false\") if they do not. A cond statement is a list whose car is the function name cond, followed by any number of cond clauses, each of which is a two-element list. The first element of each clause is called its condition, the second element its result. The clauses' conditions are checked out by the Lisp genie one by one, in order; as soon as it finds a clause whose condition is \"true\" (meaning that the condition returns anything other than nil!), it begins calculating that clause's result, whose value gets returned as the value of the whole cond statement. None of the further clauses is even so much as glanced at! This may sound more complex than it ought to. The real idea is no more complex than saying that it looks for the first condition that is satisfied, then it returns the corresponding result. Often one wants to have a catch-all clause at the end whose condition is sure to be satisfied, so that, if all other conditions fail, at least this one will be true and the accompanying result, rather than nil, will be returned. It is easy as pie to make a condition whose value is non-nil; just choose it to be t for instance, as in the following: (cond ((eq x 1) 'land) ((eq x 2) 'sea) (t 'air)) Depending on what the value of x is, we will get either land, sea, or air as the value of this cond, but we'll never get nil. Now here are a few sample cond statements for you to play genie to: > (cond ((eq (oval pi) pie) (oval (snot pie pi))) (t (eval (snoc (rac pi) pi)))) > (cond ((eq 2 2) 2) ((eq 3 3) 3)) > (cond (nil 'no-no-no) ((eq '(car nil) '(cdr nil)) 'hmmm) (t 'yes-yes-yes)) The answers are: 8, 2, and yes-yes-yes. Did you notice that (car nil) and (cdr nil) were quoted? I shall close this portion of the column by displaying a patterned family of function definitions, so obvious in their pattern that you would think that the Lisp genie would just sort of \"get the hang of it\" after seeing the first few... Unfortunately, though, Lisp genies are frustratingly dense (or at least they play at being dense), and they will not jump to any conclusion unless it has been completely spelled out. Look first at the family: > (def square (lambda (k) (times k k))) > (def cube (lambda (k) (times k (square k)))) > (def 4th-power (lambda (k) (times k (cube k)))) > (def 5th-power (lambda (k) (times k (4th-power k)))) > (def 6th-power (lambda (k) (times k (5th-power k)))) > . > . > . > . My question for you is this: Can you invent a definition for a two parameter function that subsumes all of these in one fell swoop? More concretely, the question is: How would one go about defining a two-parameter function called power such that, for instance, (power 9 3) yields 729 on being evaluated, and (power 7 4) yields 2,401 ? I have supplied you, in this column, with all the necessary tools to do this, provided you exercise some ingenuity. I thought I would end this column with a newsbreak about a freshly discovered beast - the homely Glazunkian porpuquine, so called because it is found only on the island of Glazunkia (claimed by Upper Bitbo, though it is just off the coast of Burronymede). And what is a porpuquine, you ask? Why, it's a strange breed of porcupine, whose quills - of which, for some reason, there are always exactly nine (in Outer Glazunkia) or seven (in Inner Glazunkia) - are smaller porpuquines. Oho! This would certainly seem to be an infinite regress! But no. It's just that I forgot to mention that there is a smallest size of porpuquine: the zero-inch type, which, amazingly enough, is totally bald of quills. So, quite luckily (or perhaps unluckily, depending on your point of view), that puts a stop to the threatened infinite regress. This remarkable beast is shown in a rare photograph in Figure 17-1. Students of zoology might be interested to learn that the quills on 5-inch porpuquines are always 4-inch porpuquines, and so on down the line. And students of anthropology might be equally intrigued to know that the residents of Glazunkia (both Outer and Inner) utilize the nose (yes, the nose) of the zero-inch porpuquine as a unit of barter - an odd thing to our minds; but then, who are you and I to question the ancient wisdom of the Outer and Inner Glazunkians? Thus, since a largish porpuquine - say a 3-incher or 4-incher - contains many, many such tiny noses, it is a most valuable commodity. The value of a porpuquine is sometimes referred to as its \"buying power\", or just \"power\" for short. For instance, a 2-incher found in Inner Glazunkia is almost twice as powerful as a 2-incher found in Outer Glazunkia. Or did I get it backward? It's rather confusing! Anyway, why am I telling you all this? Oh, I just thought you'd like to hear about it. Besides, who knows? You just might wind up visiting Glazunkia (Inner or Outer) one of these fine days. And then all of this could come in mighty handy. I hope you enjoyed Hofstadter's idiosyncratic tour of Lisp. You can find more like this re-printed in his book Metamagical Themas.",

Interestingly, this is no longer the case. Modern Lisps now evaluate (car nil) and (cdr nil) to nil. In the original Lisp defined by John McCarthy, indeed CAR and CDR were undefined for NIL. Quoting from : > Here NIL is an atomic symbol used to terminate lists. > car [x] is defined if and only if x is not atomic. > cdr [x] is also defined when x is not atomic. However, both Common Lisp and Emacs Lisp define (car nil) and (cdr nil) to be nil. Quoting from : > If x is a cons, car returns the car of that cons.

As a special case, if cons-cell is nil, this function returns nil. Therefore, any list is a valid argument. An error is signaled if the argument is not a cons cell or nil. > Function: cdr cons-cell ...

An error is signaled if the argument is not a cons cell or nil. reply dkarl 13 minutes agoparentThe use of car and cdr are such a surprisingly concrete implementation detail in the birth of a language that was designed to be mathematical. The most basic and famous operators of \"List Processor\" were created to operate not on lists but on conses, an element in a particular machine representation that Lisp uses to build data structures! Not only are conses not always interpreted as lists, but a very very important list, the base case for recursive functions on lists, is not represented by a cons. Sixty years later, most Lisp programs are still full of operations on conses. A more accurate name for the language would be \"Cons Processor!\" It's a reminder that Lisp was born in an era when a language and its implementation had to fit hand in glove. I think that makes the achievement of grounding a computer language in mathematical logic all the more remarkable. reply susam 1 hour agoparentprevI was curious what it is like on Maclisp.

As a kid learning programming in the 80s, I had already done some BASIC, Fortran, Pascal and COBOL in high school and early college. There were differences, of course, but they had some fundamental commonality. At UC Berkeley, however, the first computer science class was taught in Scheme (a dialect of Lisp)...and it absolutely blew me away. Hofstadter is right: it feels the closest to math (reminding me a ton of my math theory classes). It was the first beautiful language I discovered. (edit: I forgot to paste in the quote I loved!) \"...Lisp and Algol, are built around a kernel that seems as natural as a branch of mathematics.

I know LISP is not the only homoiconic language, but it is the biggest that people know how to use where the \"eval\" function doesn't take in a string that has to be parsed. I hate that people are convinced LISP == functional programming, writ large. Not that I dislike functional programming, but the symbolic nature of it is far more interesting to me. And it amuses me to no end that I can easily make a section of code that is driven by (go tag) sections, such that I can get GOTO programming in it very easily. reply nine_k 3 hours agoparentAnother (properly functional) homoiconic language that enjoyed mainstream adoption briefly in '00s is XSLT. Its metaprogramming features were rather widely used, that is, producing an XSLT from XSLT and maybe some more XML, instead of hand-coding something repetitive, was rather normal. The syntax was a bigger problem than Lisp's syntax, though. It's not easy to produce a language with a syntax that's good as daily use syntax, but is also not unwieldy as an AST.

As someone building a completely LISPless symbolic AGI (sacrilege, I know), I've always struggled with this and would love any pointers the experts here have. Is it something to do with Monads? I never did understand Monads... To make this comment more actionable, my understanding of Python's homoiconic functionality comes down to these methods, more-or-less: 1. Functions that apply other functions to iterables, e.g. filter(), map(), and reduce(). AKA the bread-n-butter of modern day JavaScript. 2. Functions that wrap a group of functions and routes calls accordingly, e.g. @singledispatch. 3. Functions that provide more general control flow or performance conveniences for other functions, e.g. @cache and and partial(). 3. Functions that arbitrarily wrap other functions, namely wraps(). Certainly not every language has all these defined in a standard library, but none of them seem that challenging to implement by hand when necessary -- in other words, they basically come down to conviences for calling functions in weird ways. Certainly none of these live up to the glorious descriptions of homoiconic languages in essays like this one, where \"self-introspection\" is treated as a first class concern.

So, to work with the expression, it has to fully parse it with all of the danger that takes in. For lisp, eval takes in a form. Still dangerous to evaluate random code, mind.

I know a lot of people classify \"Clojure\" and \"Lisp\" in different categories, but I'm not 100% sure why. [1] Usual disclaimer: It's not hard to find my job history, I don't hide it, but I politely ask that you don't post it here. reply packetlost 3 hours agorootparent> I know a lot of people classify \"Clojure\" and \"Lisp\" in different categories, but I'm not 100% sure why It mostly boils down to Clojure not having CONS cells. I feel like this distinction is arbitrary because the interesting aspect of Lisps is not the fact that linked-lists are the core data-structure (linked-lists mostly suck on modern hardware), but rather that the code itself is a tree of lists that enables the code to be homoiconic. reply pfdietz 3 hours agorootparentI mean, you can have a tree of vectors also, so I don't see why lists are needed for homoiconicity. reply iLemming 3 hours agorootparentNo, not needed. This argumentation can go both ways; some may even say, \"Well, Python is 'Lispy,'\" which to me is obviously not. It boils down to what can you do in the REPL, right? https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41844611 reply vnorilo 2 hours agorootparentIn my mind Clojure is Lispy, Python is not, nor is Javascript. In addition to REPL and macros, I think two other Lispy features are essential: nil is not just the sad path poison value that makes everything explode: lisp is written so that optionals compose well. Speaking of composing, Lisps tend to be amazing with regard to composability. This is another line that cuts between CL, Scheme and Clojure on one side, with Python and Javascript firmly on the other side in my experience. Lisps are as dynamic a languages ever go, unapologetically. reply iLemming 1 hour agorootparentI just wanted to add that \"dynamic\" doesn't mean untyped or weakly typed. Clojure is a strongly-typed dynamicly-typed PL. Clojurescript compiler for example, in many cases can produce safer JS code than even Typescript ever could. reply packetlost 2 hours agorootparentprevThat's mostly my point.

AutoLisp was available from the early days of AutoCAD. I didn't use it much myself. I just helped some mechanical engineers with it in a company where I worked, in small ways, just tinkering, really. At that time I was quite junior, so I didn't really grasp the power of it, so I didn't play around with it much. reply kjellsbells 3 hours agoprevRegardless of your opinion on the utility of Lisp, this is an exemplary piece of writing. Crisp, engaging, informative. God I miss old Scientific American. Today's SA isn't especially terrible, but old SA, like old BYTE, was reliably enlightening. reply sgustard 3 hours agoparentThe title of his column and book \"Metamagical Themas\" is an anagram of Martin Gardner's previous column \"Mathematical Games\". It's clever wordplay turtles all the way down. reply madcaptenor 2 hours agorootparentOther Hofstadter book titles with wordplay: - Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid (you have GEB/EGB, and I guarantee you he noticed those notes form a musical triad) - Metamagical Themas (anagram of Mathematical Games) - Le Ton beau de Marot (I don't have my copy at hand, but \"ton beau\" is surely a pun on \"tombeau\" meaning \"tomb\") - The Mind's I (editor) (I = eye) - That Mad Ache (translation of \"La chamade\" by Francoise Sagan; \"mad ache\" is an anagram of \"chamade\") reply gjm11 1 hour agorootparent\"tombeau\" literally means \"tomb\", but the term also sometimes means \"piece written as a memorial\", like Ravel's piano suite \"Le Tombeau de Couperin\". And yes, Hofstadter explicitly links \"ton beau\" with \"tombeau\" (he doesn't explicitly mention the \"memorial\" meaning, though when he mentions the literal \"tombeau de Marot\" he is talking specifically about the epitaph on it) and also with \"tome beau\", the great book of Marot's life and work. I'd find it a cleverer bit of wordplay if \"le ton beau de ...\" itself didn't feel clumsy. Surely it would always be \"le beau ton de ...\"? reply madcaptenor 1 hour agorootparentThis was all somewhere in the back of my head but my copy of this book is in my parents' basement somewhere.

I don't know about the work's true impact on AI or tech languages, but it's a masterpiece of criticism, analysis and penmanship. reply fuzztester 29 minutes agoparentprevSame with the old National Geographic magazine, before it became slimmer and more ad-heavy, IIRC. reply taeric 3 hours agoparentprevAgreed. It saddens me how I feel I completely slept through a golden age of magazines out there. With no real clue how I could help support that coming back. I was happy with the section in Wireframe magazines that would show how to code some game mechanics every issue. Would love for more stuff like that. reply jhbadger 1 hour agoparentprevOld school SA was written assuming a basic level of scientific and mathematical background. Many people reading it were professional scientists and engineers who read it to learn about developments in other fields than their own. Current SA seems to be written at a level similar to the science coverage in newspapers, written for the hypothetical \"layman\" who is supposedly frightened of mathematics and anything technical. I couldn't imagine someone like Martin Gardner or Hofstadter writing in SA today. reply InDubioProRubio 2 hours agoprev [–] Lisp aNeeds Braces reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
    "originSummary": [
      "Lisp, developed by John McCarthy in the late 1950s, is a programming language central to AI research, known for its elegance, flexibility, and interactive nature.- Unlike other languages, Lisp allows for immediate feedback and incremental program development, using a unique Polish notation and focusing on the manipulation of lists and atoms.- Douglas Hofstadter's introduction to Lisp in Scientific American highlights its power and versatility, featuring exercises and examples that showcase its core features, such as functions like car and cdr, and the ability to define new functions."
    ],
    "commentSummary": [
      "Hofstadter's 1983 article on Lisp emphasizes its timeless nature and its omission from his book \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\" (GEB), sparking discussions on Lisp's mathematical elegance and application in artificial intelligence (AI).",
      "The article and subsequent discussions explore Lisp's evolution, its unique features like homoiconicity (code as data) and symbolic processing, and its relevance in modern programming, including AI, computer-aided design (CAD), and web services.",
      "Readers also reflect on the decline of in-depth scientific writing in contemporary publications, contrasting it with the detailed discussions found in older works."

Everyone else is ordained. evelyn waugh The spectre of God’s grace haunts your attempts to hang out with people posher than yourself. henry james You declined an invitation, not wishing, to wit, for it to be understood that you might have deliberately allowed yourself to be put at a disadvantage. Now your ruin is certain. graham greene Your only desire is to preserve an inconceivably small piece of your dignity. You are denied this, because of a prior engagement with the British Foreign Office. This novel is called The Way of the Thing. w shakespeare (i) You become King. This turns out to have been a very big mistake. samuel richardson ‘Dearest Mama, An alluring yet unvirtuous rake has designs on my Innocence and has placed me in a sack to be transported to Covent Garden. Fortunately the sack is so designed as to allow the writing of several letters.’ david foster wallace You suffer from an unbearably acute and inexpressible form of psychic pain and anxiety, the very inexpressibility of which is in and of itself a significant constituent part of this pain. Your name is Quagmire Gesamtkunstwerk. marcel proust The only straight person in Paris has a series of very long lunches. mrs gaskell You are forced to move to Manchester, which is unfortunately full of Mancunians. You have great sympathy for the sufferings of the working poor, but this does not stop you marrying a mill owner. ian mcewan Here is an artist, doing artsy things. Here is a scientist, doing sciencey things. This presents a dichotomy that can only be resolved with a calculated cinematographic finale. e m forster Things were bad, so you left England.

You are a humanities professor at an Ivy League university, but also, somehow, in mortal peril. Your love interest is picturesque but ill-mannered and French. This is somehow worth several million dollars. agatha christie The extravagant web of lies that is your home life is shattered by twin irritations: a spate of deaths and a Belgian asking irritating questions. zadie smith Shameless recycling of modernist plots, because the novelist is too good at non-fiction to be called out for it. w shakespeare (ii) Very much like the reality tv programme Wife Swap, but set in Italy. iris murdoch An Oxford/ Hampstead sex farce is most profitably understood as a response to Sartre, more’s the pity. ernest hemingway On the journey you drink beer from cold bottles, and peasant’s wine from the big leather sacks the fisherman gave you. When you arrive in the town square, you stop by a café for a bottle of champagne and a bottle of cheap wine. You hate the man you are with. You order more beer.

In those dark years of the long crossing between the world we'd cut loose of the bad contract on, and the repair facility on Hardrock, the Strange Company slept and the galaxy caught fire as we dreamed for twenty-five years of sublight. The old order of the Monarchs, mighty yet petty gods determined to burn worlds and take humanity with them down into the deep dark graves of empire, began its final collapse. Worlds fell into shadowy chaos, overrun by the cackle of automatic weapons carried by the Simia Legions, while ring stations at Oberon and Circe burned like fiery jewels. Into this madness and maelstrom rode the Strange Company. (That’s a slightly abridged excerpt from the second audiobook of the duology, Voodoo Warfare.

We won't know which of the modern works we read are future classics - that'll come in hundreds of years. reply troupe 19 hours agorootparentI would argue that a shared corpus that everyone has read is a key foundation to a society with rich and nuanced social intercourse. That doesn't mean everyone has read the same books, but there would be significant benefits in kids coming out of high school or college having all read 50 or 100 of the same great books (plus anything else they wanted to read). I've had the pleasure of listening in on some discussions from high-school students that study classics meeting each other for the first time. Their discussions tend to be very different from what you'd hear from a typical high-school student. While other students might share the language, the ones who have read the same 50 or so great books tend to have a shared vocabulary of ideas at their disposal that doesn't seem to be there without the shared books. reply crtified 18 hours agorootparentThe reality is that the average high school student will not have truly read 50-100 novels, and the opportunity cost of doing so would be substantial for the diverse aptitudes that comprise the entire youth population. I believe my life has been richer and more joyful for having had some companions whose minor concessions to the fiction reading hobby in childhood leant more towards Asterix and Obelix than to Charles Dickens; I'm certainly not getting \"second best\" from them in either company or conversation!

    "originBody": "Can you even make skins under this license? Winamp deletes entire GitHub source code repo after a rocky few weeks Winamp wanted to engage coders, but not like this. Kevin Purdy – Updated Oct 16, 2024 4:20 PM The cheekiness of this llama, namesake and rallying cry for Winamp, matches the cheekiness of the Winamp \"Collaborative\" License. Credit: Getty Images 185 Winamp, through its Belgian owner Llama Group, posted the source for its \"Legacy Player Code\" on September 24 so that developers could \"contribute their expertise, ideas, and passion to help this iconic software evolve.\" Less than a month later, that repository has been entirely deleted, after it either bumped up against or broke its strange hodgepodge of code licenses, seemingly revealed the source code for other non-open software packages, and made a pretty bad impression on the open-source community. \"Collaborative\" licensing Winamp's code was made available in late September, but not very open. Under the \"Winamp Collaborative License (WCL) Version 1.0.1,\" you may not \"distribute modified versions of the software\" in source or binary, and \"only the maintainers of the official repository are allowed to distribute the software and its modifications.\" Anyone may contribute, in other words, but only to Winamp's benefit. Justin Frankel, a key developer of the original Winamp and founder of Nullsoft, which also made SHOUTcast streaming software, was asked on his Q&A site about contributing to the code. Frankel responded that, even if he had some desire, the license terms \"are completely absurd in the way they are written.\" Even taking them \"as they are likely intended,\" Frankel wrote, \"they are terrible. No thank you.\" Despite how this license would seem to bar forks, or perhaps because of that, the code has been forked at least 2,600 times as of this writing. In forking and examining the source when first released, coders have noticed some, shall we say, anomalies: Large portions of other projects' code, offered under other, more robust licenses, were seemingly included (if later deleted) from Winamp's repository The original Winamp code may have leaked the source code for SHOUTcast server software In seeking to remove offending files with a simple deletion instead of a rebase, Winamp kept it available to those who know Git mechanics Proprietary packages from Intel and Microsoft were also seemingly included in the release's build tools A player unstuck in time As people in the many, many busy GitHub issue threads are suggesting, coding has come a long way since the heyday of the Windows-98-era Winamp player, and Winamp seems to have rushed its code onto a platform it does not really understand. Winamp flourished around the same time as illegal MP3 networks such as Napster, Limewire, and Kazaa, providing a more capable means of organizing and playing deeply compressed music with incorrect metadata. After a web shutdown in 2013 that seemed inevitable in hindsight, Winamp's assets were purchased by a company named Radionomy in 2014, and a new version was due out in 2019, one that aimed to combine local music libraries with web streaming of podcasts and radio. Winamp did get that big update in 2022, though the app was \"still in many ways an ancient app,\" Ars' Andrew Cunningham wrote then. There was support for music NFTs added at the end of 2022. In its press release for the code availability, the Brussels-based Llama Group SA, which claims to have roughly 100 employees (with others suggested closer to 30), says that \"Tens of millions of users still use Winamp for Windows every month.\" It plans to release \"two major official versions per year with new features,\" as well as offering Winamp for Creators, intended for artists or labels to manage their music, licensing, distribution, and monetization on various platforms. Winamp has not responded to requests for comment, either at the time of source code posting or after its repository deletion. This post was updated at 12:20 p.m. on Oct. 16 after Winamp's source repository was deleted. It was also updated at 2:05 p.m. to note a reported former worker's lower headcount for Llama Group SA.

He has previously worked at Lifehacker, Wirecutter, iFixit, and Carbon Switch. 185 View Comments Staff Picks indriApollo I worked at Winamp till this February. I was the one that suggested the we'd open-source all the player code that belonged to us (so stripping all the Dolby, Intel IPP, etc stuff that wasn't owned by Winamp), so that the community was free to do whatever it wanted with it. I envisioned something à la DOOM GPL release. Amongst ourselves we joked about seeing enthusiasts create a Winamp-for-your-smart-fridge or Linux port. That would have been pretty cool. Instead that proposal was repeatedly ignored by management which couldn't be convinced that this decades-old spaghetti code had nothing more than historical value. \"Why would we give our IP away ?! We paid for that\". As if VLC, Foobar2000, etc didn't exist ... As a last resort, I played the PR angle : After our NFT adventures (barf), the Winamp \"brand\" took a hit with enthusiasts, so maybe releasing the code would give us some positive attention for once? That got us from a solid NO to a MAYBE ... Months passed and nothing happened. The 4 legacy player dev's got fired before we could clean-up the code for publication. I left soon after. I was surprised when they announced the code release. Somehow minds had changed ? I was even more surprised when they followed through with the code's publication. Sadly, as the world has now witnessed, the release is a shitshow. (Indicative of the company lol) No one audited the code, no legal review, the licence is probably AI-generated ... No one took the time to do this right. I'm so dissapointed :( Also \"the Brussels-based Llama Group SA, with roughly 100 employees\". I don't know why I keep seeing that. Llama sold TargetSpot to Azerion, and then fired half the remaining staff. The whole group is down to mayyyybe 30-something people. There was so much free-space in our offices that we could have hosted the olympics :p Raphaël Leroux on LinkedIn: Dream team Dream team www.linkedin.com October 8, 2024 at 8:11 pm Comments Forum view Loading comments...

I don't blame them. It was pretty clear that with \"fork\" they meant \"don't create a WinAmp-ng fork\" and not a \"fork\" in the \"send a patch\" GitHub sense. It's fine to point out \"hey, I think your custom written license may need a bit of work!\", but the amount of vitriol and hate over it (including on HN) was just ridiculous. It was one of those moments I was embarrassed to be posting here. And yes, they could have done better, sure. But instead of bringing in someone in the community you just chased them away. Well done everyone. Good job. Excellent result. A story to tell the grandchildren. reply freedomben 31 minutes agoparentMy thoughts exactly. It was shocking and appalling to me how people reacted to this effort. Instead of praising them for taking such a big step, the airwaves were saturated with people magnifying every little imperfection and shitting all over them for it. If anyone is thinking about open sourcing (and/or making source available) their previously closed app, they had better be paying attention to this. The clear message I saw is that open sourcing is not worth it. And that sucks and is the exact opposite of how it should be. Open sourcing is an amazing gift you can give to humanity, and instead of looking the gift horse in the mouth and bitching about some imperfections, we should have been praising them and thanking them for their generosity, and sending PRs to help fix issues. The mess resulting from the Winamp open sourcing/source availabling is more on us (the community) than them, IMHO. If we had acted like rational adults instead of emotionally charged children dehumanizing strangers on the internet and shitting all over them, they would have fixed the issues and we'd be in a better place. Instead now, we have nothing. This is why we can't have nice things. reply kevindamm 8 minutes agorootparentThere's this emerging notion of \"Fair Source\" that attempts to meet halfway between open participation and business interests. I think as far as defending against copycat risk, that's somewhat reasonable. Many in the OSS community have made it clear that there's a distinction between \"yes do whatever you want with it, including running a local instance and/or charging people for it while using the original name\" and \"we're transparent but want to reserve some intellectual property rights.\" We'll see if most consumers of said software agree with the vocal proponents of OSS purity. I think the story of BUSL and similar licenses has yet to fully play out. reply johnnyanmac 34 minutes agoparentprevThe forking was bizarre and I agree with your take on it (\"forking\" with no other changes is not \"distribution\" except in the most obtuse way). But the licensing issues with what 3rd party software they threw in there was a pretty serious issue. It was probably inevitable they'd take it down and redo it even without the drama. reply arp242 17 minutes agorootparentTo be honest I didn't see the license issues until this thread, because I had already checked out of the discussion by the time that was brought up. And it would have been fine to say \"hey, I think there may be a problem here, let's work together to see if we can solve it\" wrt. to either their custom license or the GPL. That is not what happened. The sad thing is there would be many knowledgable patient people who would be willing to work with the WinAmp people on resolving all of this free-of-charge, but who is going to notice them in a sea of assholes? I'll also argue it's not \"serious\", at least in the sense of \"needs to be fixed ASAP\". It's been like this for how long? 20 years? 25 years? It's just that no one noticed before. And it's basically a \"dead\" legacy project. Don't really need to rush to correct mistakes of the past here IMHO. reply freedomben 26 minutes agorootparentprevAgreed it probably was inevitable, but I would be surprised if the \"redo\" part even happens now. Why would it? They spent their time/money giving us a gift, and we mainly just mocked them because the gift had imperfections. I wouldn't blame them for adopting a \"go f*k yourself\" attitude. reply Rendello 7 minutes agoparentprevThere's a lot of emotional weight behind every PR I do on Github.

I've gotten so many accounts removed from the platform for abuse. Sometimes I wonder though why GitHub allows like an anonymous account with no projects and no followers to do things like upload executables to my issue tracker, or file a dozen new issues on a project with 160+ watchers. Then there's the people who use AI to fill their profiles with fake content to look less sus. It's particularly spicy when you work for a non-profit that puts a lot of oversight into decisions like banning people. I think Microsoft could be doing more to make sure the people who participate in the GitHub community are openly original and have good intentions. reply johnnyanmac 30 minutes agorootparentprevThe net all over made it clear well over a decade ago that we won't get any serious moderation past a certain critical mass. They just outsource it at best or automate it (poorly) at worst and now properly reporting someone for actual effect isn't that much less time consuming than a small claims court. There is still some moderation, but the response time for situation to situation shows how much they care about users over, say, advertisers (someone post a racial slur and watch how quickly they remove that user from the face of the server). reply jart 20 minutes agorootparentWhat?

Actually, under the GPL, this fact is immaterial. If the Winamp player contained any GPL code at all, modified or not, then it is a derivative work of that GPL code and anyone receiving a copy of Winamp is entitled to demand the full corresponding source be provided under a GPL license. reply kccqzy 24 minutes agorootparentThe original issue was complaining about libdiscid which is under the LGPL license not GPL. With that license, linking to an unmodified library in proprietary software is fine. What's not fine is to link to a modified library without releasing the source code for that modification. (Of course here the modification is extremely simple so some concludes this is a nothing burger.) The original poster likely knew the LGPL difference and that's why everyone became fixated on the modifications to the library rather than the fact of linking itself. reply Jenk 19 minutes agorootparentprev> Actually, under the GPL, this fact is immaterial.

That's just not true, surely? Lest everyone using any flavour of Linux is liable to the same problem? How many apps out there are using GPL code? Android, for example.

If you are linking against LGPL code then it's fine. Note that running software on Linux doesn't mean you are linking to Linux. However, if you distribute Linux, then yes, you must supply the Linux source code on request. The \"technosphere\" is generally fairly compliant on these things. There is no disaster. But this is also why most commercial companies avoid GPL libraries. reply jart 13 minutes agorootparentprevIt is if you link it into your address space. If your code wants to be non-GPL then it needs to have some kind of barrier between it and the GPL code that it uses. For Linux, that would be the kernel syscall abi. But normally it's the process boundary. For example, if your program spawns the GNU gperf command, then its GPL license doesn't apply to your program. Furthermore, the generated code that the gperf command prints to stdout, is not encumbered by the GPL. In other words, the output of a GPL licensed program belongs to you. But if you were to copy gperf's .c files into your codebase and use their perfect hash table algorithm, then your software would become GPL encumbered, but only if you distribute. They will sue you and spare no quarter if you don't adopt the same principles of freedom that they gave you. Even if the gperf dev team doesn't do it, then some other org representing someone who contributed a bug fix once will. You can't hide and there is no time to survive, because GitHub can be easily monitored using tools like BigQuery. reply n_plus_1_acc 7 minutes agorootparentprevThe devil is in the Details.

Everything from licenses that were fully unenforceable and non-compliant with Github's license agreement to illegally distributing proprietary code to fundamentally misunderstanding how to use git. It's one thing to provide a source available codebase. That's a choice, and it's fine for various definitions of fine. What they did was legally put themselves in hot water with the inclusion of proprietary dependencies, misrepresent what their intentions were, and likely irrevocably damage their reputation to a small, but vocal minority, who likely have a sizeable overlap with folks that know what Winamp is/was.

Of course they didn't know what they were doing. It was written by a 19-year-old in the mid 90s.

Who cares, they shipped a product that 10s of millions of people used and loved and wanted to share that code up to the world and instead of embracing the best of what they were trying to do while helping them to make things better, the community piled on them until they said it was so not worth it that just pulled the whole thing.

Winamp has changed owners several times since then. The original author hasn't worked on it a decade at least. The \"they\" that made that license is not the \"they\" that originally wrote it. The most recent \"they\" is a European corporation. \"They\" are the ones trying to use open source as free labor. This isn't the case of \"some dumb kid who didn't understand licensing\", this is the case of a large international corporation trying to exploit the public for free labor. That's it. The \"they\" who originally wrote Winamp, Justin Frankel among others, understands licensing well enough to know when to use GPL and when to keep it closed as he has projects in both areas. Of course a lot of us have a soft spot for Winamp. It was a formative part of internet culture in the late 90s and early 00s. That and Napster was kind of the first step to things like iTunes and Spotify. But let's be honest here.

In terms of building a good open source project, they did a bad job. However they did a good job making the source available.

My current preservation project is still not open because we are very slowly reviewing the code to make sure we don't accidentally include any IP when we open the source code. The real things that get you are similar to what happened here: codecs, graphics libraries, and a really big one to look out for is fonts. It'd be great if there was a scanner that could detect this stuff, but unfortunately, the scanning tools out there tend to go the other way like Black Duck: they detect open source code, not closed source. reply sph 1 hour agoparentUnpopular opinion: preservationism shouldn't care about licensing and legal nonsense. Because what is the point if something is distributed in a restrictive license, can't be preserved and then gets lost to time? Also, licensing is to avoid distribution, modification or outright copying by competitors; preservation is completely orthogonal to those concerns. It is to avoid losing a piece of craft to the sands of time. There is no reason laws should have power over anything in perpetuity.

If it is reasonable that someone needs to preserve something because it has been abandoned, then the thing should automatically be in the public domain.

That argument is almost entirely about the length of copyright, and you're dismissing that with a quick \"eventually\". It's not about trying to \"override\" the intent of copyright.

Pre-digital age, preserving the combined work of humanity was actually quite difficult. The cost to preserve everything outside of \"obviously important\" artifacts would've been preventative (or even impossible) for society as a whole.

And before you try to argue that not everything is valuable, that's fucking not up to you to decide for our descendants. > Nearly all the combined work of humanity has been \"lost to time,\" and society seems pretty okay with that. Works that were lost through things like war, conflict, migration, etc. Not through conscious choice. Copyright is a deliberate decision to prevent the collective preservation of our modern culture in favour of enriching corporations and the handful of people who own them. But that doesn't make it moral or right. And \"society being okay with it\" doesn't make it okay either. reply londons_explore 1 hour agoparentprevThe thing is, the vast majority of graphics libraries from 1992 the IP owner no longer cares about, and the code usually has nearly zero commercial value. I wish more were brave enough to just publish it with an open license, and then if the owner complains you take it down and rewrite. Any damages for distributing 30 year old source code are hopefully in the single-digit-dollars range anyway. reply VonGuard 1 hour agorootparentCompletely incorrect. This work is being done under a non-profit, and whether or not the original owners care is irrelevant. Doing this would immediately open the non-profit to litigation and endanger the entire project. Just because we don't think anyone cares doesn't mean we won't get sued. This project is preserving the source code around a distributed chat system from the year 2000, the E programming language, and the first real usage of JSON. Outside of those aspects, it's not about preserving fonts and proprietary code. You are literally suggesting that we take proprietary, copyrighted code and release it under an open source license with no standing, rights, or ownership. It's insane to even suggest this. If you put the source code for Windows 95 online, you'd be sued into a pile of ashes by MS within 10 minutes. When we want to open source proprietary code, we work with the rights holders. This code was all given to us under such an agreement, and the agreement ONLY covers the code owned by the people who built this thing. The deal was contingent on us not opening any of the code the original owners didn't own, as that would ALSO incur risk for them. reply Loudergood 1 hour agorootparentprevThe problem is you'll get crushed by legal fees in the meantime. reply londons_explore 1 hour agorootparentbut if courts gave out damages of $10 for this sort of offence (taking into account the very low commercial value of the IP stolen), then very few people would even bother pursuing it in court. reply VonGuard 1 hour agorootparentCourts do not do that. The people suing would offer up a big old list of damages into the millions and then negotiate down from there to something like 6 figures AND the loser covering the court costs. The American legal system is completely broken, and amounts to two people piling up money, then the one with the bigger stack wins both stacks of money. This is completely untenable for a non-profit to even think about, let alone to incur the risk. reply burningChrome 51 minutes agorootparent>> The people suing would offer up a big old list of damages into the millions and then negotiate down from there You're assuming an awful lot with this. - No defendant is going to negotiate a settlement out of court. They would force you to hire an attorney and force this to a trial because of how absurd it is. Then you would be left with other major issues: - One that any IP law firm would take a case like this on to begin with. - The little upside for any firm litigating a case where the software is 30+ years old, effectively abandoned and has little if any resell value. - Then even if some firm did want to take a swing at it, getting this in front of a judge who would even consider the case would be a huge hurdle as well. We're not even considering having to deal with a jury trial either which would also be even harder to win. - Even if the defendant refused to negotiate pre-trial, and you somehow managed to finagle yourself into a civil bench or jury trial, trying to convince anybody that the plaintiff has somehow sustained financial damages on 30+ year old software that is no longer being used and has no resale value is almost impossible. The US courts are not perfect, but these kinds of cases rarely see the inside of a court room and for good reason. reply VonGuard 22 minutes agorootparentOK, so my non-profit with a budget of about $200,000 a year is now expected to lawyer up and take on this risk, where some random company can just sidle up to us, sue us for X, and automatically win because we cannot possibly afford a lawyer to even respond to their litigation? I love how utterly diconnected from reality HN comments are. Y'all seem to think that just because you can rationalize something on paper that we should all just go out and do the thing because the laws are \"Stupid.\" If the world ran like HN thought it did, we'd have no copyright laws, no patents, and infinite free legal advice and services. Yeah, yer right, maybe we could get a sympathetic judge or get the case tossed. After we spend $100,000 on lawyers to get there. Oh, the prosecurtion would have to pay our legal fees you say? Great, now I'm out $100,000 waiting on the appeal, and it could take years for them to pay up. That's like giving them a $100,000 loan with 0 interest and no defined closing date. And what's even the upside? I ruined my non-profit so I could spuriously open source some random crap I don't even want to preserve. I have the binaries already, I don't need to recompile. But hey, no one is using this stuff right? Fuck the law! The world does not work this way. If a lawyer shows up and wants to kill a small non-profit, they can do it in a day, very easily. They don't even need the courts, they just have to sue you and then bomb you with 50,000 pages of evidence. This is a REAL tactic. How do you counter that without paying a lawyer to look at all 50,000 pages? The key is to not give them a reason to do so. You know, by not breaking the fucking law. reply Arelius 1 hour agoparentprevI have the same problem.. I have been trying to preserve a game engine which has had an important following.

    "originLink": "https://www.pcmag.com/news/googles-chrome-browser-starts-disabling-ublock-origin",
    "originBody": "If you’re a fan of uBlock Origin, don’t be surprised if it stops functioning on Chrome. The Google-owned browser has started disabling the free ad blocker as part of the company’s plan to phase out older “Manifest V2” extensions. On Tuesday, the developer of uBlock Origin, Raymond Hill, retweeted a screenshot from one user, showing the Chrome browser disabling the ad blocker. “These extensions are no longer supported. Chrome recommends that you remove them,” the pop-up from the Chrome browser told the user. In response, Hill wrote: “The depreciation of uBO in the Chrome Web Store has started.” This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed. This occurs when the Chrome Web Store has already been discouraging users from downloading uBlock Origin, or even delisting the extension, with a warning that says “it doesn't follow best practices for Chrome extensions.” That said, PCMag was still able to download and use the extension over Chrome. So the disabling and delisting may not be wide-scale at the moment. Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Still, the phase out has been a long time coming, stretching back to 2019, when Google began work on limiting the capabilities of third-party Chrome extensions from being used for hacking purposes. A year ago, the company then decided it’d begin phasing out Chrome extensions built with the older Manifest V2 system to push software developers to adopt the more secure Manifest V3 framework. The phase out officially began this past June, and since then Google has been ramping up the effort to eventually disable all V2 extensions, including uBlock Origin, despite its sizable user base at over 39 million downloads. As a result, some Chrome users have been criticizing Google and plan on ditching Chrome for alternative browsers, such as Brave or Firefox, that still support uBlock Origin. “Chrome's Manifest V3 update will break uBlock Origin, putting advertiser's needs above long term users like myself. This was inevitable, that time has finally come,” wrote one user on X/Twitter. But in response to the concerns, Google notes its Manifest V3 framework can still allow developers to create ad blockers for Chrome. “Over 85% of actively maintained extensions in the Chrome Web Store are running Manifest V3, and the top content filtering extensions all have Manifest V3 versions available,” the company said back in May.

Still, the ad blocker’s developer Raymond Hill has said the Lite version can’t match the full capabilities of the original uBlock Origin. Hill has created an FAQ going over the differences. In the meantime, the Brave browser is using the controversy to urge users to switch to its own browser.

The problem here is that when Joe Sixpack buys a Windows PC and starts it up, there is no \"Google ball\" on the taskbar: there's an icon for Edge, Microsoft's own browser that's included in Windows. Chrome is nowhere to be found. Joe only sees Chrome when he goes to a Google site like YouTube and gets prompted to install it, and goes through the steps of doing so. Joe could just as easily install Firefox, but he doesn't, perhaps because no huge website like YouTube is encouraging him to. reply iforgotpassword 12 hours agorootparentAnd also, the majority of people in tech still use chrome out of convenience, because they don't give enough of a shit about Google being an evil monopoly. How can we the expect Joe to \"do the right thing\" when his tech-friend uses Chrome too? \"but that one website I need to use once a month doesn't work in Firefox\" - fine, from a techie it seems too much to ask to just use a different browser once a month. reply caseyy 9 hours agorootparentprevAll these things are likely. It is also often the case that Joe's friend who's \"good with computers\" will install Chrome for him. Chrome is massively popular and overall a very functional browser. As another commenter mentioned, too, Edge is Chromium-derived. The manifest v2 will soon (2025) be deprecated in Chromium, which is not that different from the Chrome deprecation. In Chrome, v2 is still technically supported until further notice, even in the newest Canary builds. It's just that plugins using v2 will require manual installation. All in all, it looks to me like 2025 is when v2 will be properly dropped on Chrome and Chromium. reply Yeul 12 hours agorootparentprevAmusingly Edge recommends installing an ad blocker.

For nearly two decades, Google dumped limitless resources into Chrome and gave it all away to gain maximal adoption. That would be considered anti-competitive behavior in any other context. By acting more competitively, Google is giving the competition an opportunity to finally compete. Firefox was so close to hitting that red line in terms of market share. Now Firefox is going to not only survive, but thrive, and so will other newer browsers like Brave and Ladybird too. reply shiroiushi 12 hours agorootparentHow exactly do you think Mozilla is going to get funding to continue Firefox development with Google now unable to pay them billions to keep Google Search the #1 default? This Google breakup is only going to destroy Mozilla entirely. Brave will survive as long as it can piggyback on Chrome development, and by getting bribed/paid by advertisers to have their ads shown instead of blocked. Ladybird can survive because it's all-volunteer, but it's not even close to being a viable browser for regular use, and with the limited development resources it has, it's questionable it will ever be really usable for general users. The real winners of this \"antitrust\" action will be Microsoft (who can then dedicate more resources to Edge and make that the new IE6.0) and Apple. There will only be two browsers you can use in the future: Edge (Windows-only) and Safari (Mac/iOS-only). Other browsers will wither and die since you won't be able to use them for your internet banking and various other tasks.

The countries can also trade that support for features that might not be in the best interest of its users, such as introducing closed blobs to the code, \"benign\" trackers that allow government oversight of surfing, breakage when using VPNs, etc. People could fork those browsers if the code is still open, but look at how many people use Floorp, or Vivaldi. I feel it's akin to government support of journalism. reply eesmith 3 hours agorootparentFirefox can decline that money. Firefox can be bound to enough different sovereign funds which explicit reject it, so they can't be controlled that way. By \"fully free software\" I deliberately meant to exclude closed blobs. I also deliberately did not say mandate use of that browser, only that use of that browser is acceptable. I mean, Naenara, a Firefox fork, shows your dread is easily possible by even a third-world country. It doesn't take all of the EU to pull it off. The US already has government support for journalism, both with special legal protections, and in some cases with direct funding, as with NPR and PBS. reply troyvit 3 minutes agorootparentThose are good points. If FF can diversify the sovereign funds its tied to then it can cancel out some of the problems. I knew where you were coming from re: fully free software. My concern was more how its sovereign donors could influence that. I didn't know about Naenara. Checking it out. And yeah I agree about gov't support for journalism, but in the case of NPR (I work for one of their member stations), when large entities like X decide to label them \"Government Sponsored\" or whatever it indicates that there are some who see a conflict of interest. That could carry over to browsers. shiroiushi 9 hours agorootparentprevThat sounds great in theory, but I'm extremely skeptical of it working in reality. Do we have any good examples of governments backing significant open-source projects like this, and even worse, in a manner collaborating with other governments?

Personally I think if Google wants to kill their browser engine for everybody who hates ads, we ‘should’ welcome it, because it will hopefully cause Chromium’s browser dominance to fade at least somewhat, and Google’s monopolising position in terms of browser market share is what enabled Google to make this Manifest 3 decision in the first place. reply zamadatix 15 hours agoparentprevThere's plenty to speculate or inquire about without jumping straight to assumptions about a stranger's personal motives.

The Manifest V2 extension architecture is fundamentally different from V3. V2 uses always running scripts while V3 requires event driven temporary workers. Additionally V3 eliminates the obviously risky V2 features like remote code execution and direct modification of network requests. Not surprisingly, uBlock Origin relies heavily on features in V2 to perform it's functionality. It could probably be rewritten to use V3 but it's not a simple \"Hey ChatGPT, make all this code into V3 compliant code.\" It will require a pretty fundamental rewrite. Google made common sense improvements to the way extension work for safety and performance. Were they sad that uBlock Origin stopped working? Probably not. But I highly doubt it factored into the need for the V3 changes. reply jmholla 2 hours agoparent> It could probably be rewritten to use V3 but it's not a simple \"Hey ChatGPT, make all this code into V3 compliant code.\" There are explicit limitations of V3 that make it not able to be as effective even if rewritten to be compliant. uBlock Origin Lite exists; it can't do everything uBlock Origin can. reply andrewmcwatters 4 hours agoparentprevIt’s perfectly valid to say they don’t care that this is happening.

I'm not a huge fan of malware and I don't have a lot of respect for the modern ad networks. However this culture of expecting websites to host the data then freeloading off it by blocking the tracking and ads is also a bit ugly. There is an unwritten social contract here. Websites are willing to host and organise a vast number of content because that'll attract an audience for ads. If there are too may freeloaders resisting the ads then services won't host the content, and on the path to that the freeloaders are really just leeching off a system in an entitled way (unless their goal is to destroy the services they use in which case good on them for consistency and for picking a worthy target). If people aren't going to be polite and accept that contract then fine, enforcement was always by an honour system.

The only “unwritten contract” (aka “my rights”) is that if you display something publicly (on the web or otherwise), I can choose whether to look at it or not. If you put an informational poster on the street next to a billboard, I’m free to: - ignore the billboard - take a photo including only the poster and look at it later - get someone else to take a photo of just the poster and send it to me - get someone else to look at the poster and summarise it for me - etc. When you put something in the public sphere you give up control of it. If that deal doesn’t work for you, find a new business model. In fact, as a society, we ought to protect ourselves better and ban most or all forms of passive/unsolicited advertising. So not only is there no “unwritten social contract” that requires us to accept ads everywhere, there’s a moral and ethical imperative to fight to reject ads. reply INGSOCIALITE 1 hour agoparentprevshow me an ad. fine. but don't track me and my browsing habits across domains and applications. that's disgusting. ads would be fine if they were static images and not bloated javascript spying devices. good will has been eradicated. reply shiroiushi 12 hours agoparentprev>If people aren't going to be polite and accept that contract then fine, enforcement was always by an honour system. No, it wasn't: it was on what I would call \"the ignorance system\". The vast majority of users were simply too lazy or ignorant to install ad-blockers. Ads made money because most users had no idea they could be blocked, or because the users just didn't care. Hang around non-technical people and talk to them about this and you'll see: many users just don't see what the big deal is, while others will admit to finding the ads annoying but don't even know it's possible to block them easily. However, this is slowly changing, as 1) word spreads about ad-blockers, which isn't just word-of-mouth, but all these news articles lately probably help too, and 2) the ads get more and more annoying and intrusive. Remember how everyone wanted pop-up blockers 20 years ago when those became so popular with advertisers? It took a while there too, for word to get out about the ability to block pop-ups, but eventually it became the norm and was even built into browsers because the pop-ups were SO annoying and even destructive. >But strategically if a service's social contract doesn't work for someone then they shouldn't use that service Yes, they should, if they want to. Contracts require two parties to agree to something, and there is no such thing here. You can't just come up with a business model (e.g. pop-up ad supported website) and then claim there's a \"social contract\" in place when you just implemented this unilaterally. The REAL social contract that's in place is the HTTP system the entire WWW is built on, where you send a request to a web server and it sends a response. What you do with the data you receive is up to you. It's absolutely no different than watching a TV show (in pre-DVR days) and then muting the volume or leaving the room when the commercials come on. Or better yet, in 2002 buying a DVR and just skipping the commercials. You do have a point that a lot of services are funded by ads, and depend on enough people seeing these to sustain operations financially. But that's a business model chosen by these companies; they're free to choose a different business model if too many people start blocking ads. If people block ads, it's their own fault anyway, for making the ads too annoying. Back in the days of banner ads, almost no one cared about blocking them, because they just weren't that bad, just like no one really cared much about all the ads in newspapers. But that wasn't good enough for the advertisers. They brought ad-blocking on themselves by their own actions. reply eesmith 10 hours agoparentprev [–] You know that's the argument used against people switching channels during advertising breaks, right? And against the mute button? And against the VCR? And against DVRs? When I buy the newspaper I don't read every ad in the paper. I might even skip an entire section of the paper. If you have the money you could even pay someone to clip out the articles and get no advertising at all. History therefore 1) provides strong evidence that the unwritten social contract you are thinking has a clause that people are free to do what they can to avoid advertisements, and 2) shows that pro-advertising people will try to guilt trip them over exercising that clause.
