Dear @colmmacuait, I think that if you type \"man\" at 0001 hours it should print \"gimme gimme gimme\". #abba @marnanel - 3 November 2011 er, that was my fault, I suggested it. Sorry. Pretty much the whole story is in the commit. The maintainer of man is a good friend of mine, and one day six years ago I jokingly said to him that if you invoke man after midnight it should print \"gimme gimme gimme\", because of the Abba song called \"Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight\": Well, he did actually put it in. A few people were amused to discover it, and we mostly forgot about it until today. I can't speak for Col, obviously, but I didn't expect this to ever cause any problems: what sort of test would break on parsing the output of man with no page specified? I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that one turned up eventually, but it did take six years. (The commit message calls me Thomas, which is my legal first name though I don't use it online much.) This issue has been fixed with commit 84bde8: Running man with man -w will no longer trigger this easter egg.

Show activity on this post. This is an easter egg in man. When you run man without specifying the page or with -w, it outputs \"gimme gimme gimme\" to stderr, but only at 00:30: # date +%T -s \"00:30:00\" 00:30:00 # man -w gimme gimme gimme /usr/local/share/man:/usr/share/man:/usr/man The exit code is always 0. The correct output should always be: # man -w /usr/local/share/man:/usr/share/man:/usr/man # echo $? 0 # man What manual page do you want? # echo $? 1 The string \"gimme gimme gimme\" can be found in RHEL, OpenSUSE, Fedora, Debian and probably more, so it's not really distro specific. You can grep your man binary to verify. This code is responsible for the output, added by this commit: src/man.c-1167- if (first_arg == argc) { src/man.c-1168- /* http://twitter.com/#!/marnanel/status/132280557190119424 */ src/man.c-1169- time_t now = time (NULL); src/man.c-1170- struct tm *localnow = localtime (&now); src/man.c-1171- if (localnow && src/man.c-1172- localnow->tm_hour == 0 && localnow->tm_min == 30) src/man.c:1173: fprintf (stderr, \"gimme gimme gimme\"); I have contacted RHEL support about this issue. The string comes from well known ABBA song Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight). The developer of the man-db, Colin Watson, decided that there was enough fun and the story won't get forgotten and removed the easter egg completely. Thank you Colin!

I'm glad that it made some people smile, which after all was the whole purpose of it, and my Twitter notifications and so on today suggest that most people thought it was more amusing than annoying. Still, some people did find it annoying, and six years seems like a pretty good run for that sort of thing; it probably isn't going to get significantly better exposure than it already unexpectedly has by way of this question. Time to put it to bed.

But at the same time, it's a shame such a masterpiece had to be removed. You could add a special flag like man -abba and when fired after midnight would give the easter egg. – Bartłomiej Skwira Commented Nov 22, 2017 at 11:07Show 9 more comments You must log in to answer this question.

(2017) (unix.stackexchange.com)772 points by jamesy0ung 17 hours agohidepastfavorite339 comments IgorPartola 14 hours agoSorry time: years ago I worked on a telemedicine web app before telemedicine was nearly as popular as it is today. Part of the application had patients filling out questionnaires online to show answers to the doctors. We were onboarding different parts of a large healthcare system throughout all this (cardio, GI, etc.) and each had questionnaires that required different logic for when and how to display the questions, so the application had a fairly powerful system for driving the conditional logic of when questions do and do not show up. Well one day I am working on a new set of features to help support the new clinic that’s coming online and for whatever reason the question that should by all rights show up, does not. As I am getting deeper into debugging why, I pepper the code with nonsensical and slightly angry debug statements that show up alongside the questions. After solving the problem I happily clean up and commit the fixed code and move onto the next thing. Well, it turns out I didn’t clean up all the debug statements. The statement I left in said I SEE YOU!!! in big red letters if you answered a particular set of questions in a particular way. This was discovered by a patient. Of the psychiatric clinic that just came online. On the questionnaire meant to evaluate paranoia. Since then I have started using things like aaa and 111 as my debug markers. reply mattnewton 11 hours agoparentThe strings used for debugging at Google were supposed to include “DO NOT SUBMIT” which, a bot to check for this was added after a debug strings made it to production (It was before my time but I believe it was after the legendary WD incident- “western digital” was remapped to “woodly doodly” in test code that accidentally shipped for those curious) reply indrora 1 hour agorootparentWhen I worked as a technical writer earlier in my career, we had a debug/prod check: If you used a series of words it would fail you in prod (refused to build). These were usually codenames of projects and such. One afternoon, I added the phrase \"[Ww]ombo\\s[Cc]ombo\" (it supported regular expressions) and an expansion set (&prodbomb; evaluated to &wca; &wcb; to create \"womb combo\") but only in prod. In debug builds, it would produce \"Wombat Combat\"in bright red text. This was a useful way to mark pages as \"Don't build this in prod yet\" - a habit some teams had of just yolo'ing their development branches right into production instead of doing a rebase to main. More than one build was saved by it within a few months. reply smitelli 6 hours agorootparentprev> \"DO NOT SUBMIT\" Kinda verbose, ain't it? Just speaking from my own personal experience, usually when I resort to print-debugging I'm already pretty punchy and more likely to use a quick \"ASDFASD\" or similar. reply twic 3 hours agorootparentI use the strings \"XXX\" and \"999\" for this (the latter because you sometimes need a dummy value in a numeric context), and have a global git hook which stops me committing a changeset which includes them. I occasionally need to override the hook, for example when using mktemp -t, or when some floating-point data actually contains a run of 9s. But mostly, it is quite specific at catching stuff that shouldn't be checked in. reply names_are_hard 2 hours agorootparentprevI worked on a codebase that had a special logging function with a name like NoPushLog that was just a direct wrapper of the base log function. A githook checked that this string was not in pushed code. This solves many of the concerns raised in this thread about readability, automation, avoiding typos in the magic string. The tricky thing you have to solve is how to push the code that defines the custom logging function, but there are solutions. reply mattnewton 2 hours agorootparentIt doesn’t allow you to put that in comments, config files or other languages though like a plain text string. reply sneak 38 minutes agorootparentWhy wouldn’t it? Sounds like the git hook is probably just grep… reply bipson 5 hours agorootparentprevYes, but you can check for \"DO NOT SUBMIT\" with automation. You can't automate checking for random strings, right? reply anyonecancode 1 hour agorootparentRelated in terms of being easy to search for, I use the abbreviation \"TK\" as a placeholder for text or incomplete code. Took this from the publishing industry (my partner worked in magazines) -- it's a combination that does not appear in regular English and so is easy to both see and to use search tools for. reply neutronicus 5 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps an abbreviation would be the best of both worlds, and debug strings should be prefixed with \"DNS\" You won't need to submit that particular string working at Google, right? reply tetha 3 hours agorootparentWe could also have an acronym for the more severe \"DO NOT SUBMIT - SECURITY EXPECTATIONS COMPROMISE\". reply pixl97 1 hour agorootparentDNS-SEC...

I've never written code for a project that legitimately included the name of a dog variety. A simple grep for \"doberman\" in the production release CI pipeline catches it.

Holding down a few keys while clicking on a specific small set of pixels in an application we were developing for a customer would produce a specific message that was attributable to me personally. I did this sort of thing in most things I worked on back then, partially as a \"calling card\" and partially as a means of being able to prove my involvement in a given product if the need ever arose. This saved our bacon when a sales rep sent an \"evaluation\" copy of the nearly completed product to the customer, without authorization, that consisted of our entire source tree. (This was the 1990s and we were running MS-DOS, no file security) Suddenly the customer tells us they have \"repurposed\" an \"internally developed program\" and they cancel our contract. The sales rep was upset that he would not be getting a commission on the sale and mentioned that he had \"even sent them a demo\", which led to the discovery of what had happened. My boss and I went to the customer's site to \"finalize the paperwork\", and when we were shown the application (which had extremely minor UI changes) I checked if the hidden click spot still worked, and it did! The customer was horrified. My boss was outraged. We ended up getting paid the full contract amount plus a large bonus in exchange for agreeing not to sue. The sales rep decided to leave voluntarily rather than be fired. reply MonkeyClub 3 hours agorootparent> Holding down a few keys while clicking on a specific small set of pixels Did you draw inspiration for it from Bullock's The Net (1995) by any chance? reply Suzuran 1 hour agorootparentI don't think so; I don't remember ever seeing it reply mackman 8 hours agorootparentprevListen. If it’s never supposed to happen then you definitely want a customer to tell you if it happens. Best way to make sure that happens is to insult their mum. It’s just good engineering discipline. reply bartread 6 hours agorootparentIn my younger and more foolish years I worked for a company called Redgate and, whilst there, I had to do some licensing jiggery pokery that stopped people using our tools if the licensing code had been tampered with or removed. I didn't want to make it too easy for people trying to crack our tools so, if such a problem were detected, the error message spat out to the console bore no relation to what had gone wrong. By \"bore no relation\" I mean the error message would be one of a number of lines of dialogue from a scene in a House episode where House is trying to figure out who Wilson's girlfriend is... which led to this: https://gist.github.com/gregoryyoung/871736 Yes, Greg Young (the event sourcing guy) ran into an error that said \"Because I wanna ask you about your girlfriend. I must know who she is, or you would've told me her name,\" because he'd moved Smartassembly minus the licensing DLLs. Of course, he didn't realise what he'd done \"wrong\" so he tweeted it to his considerable following and it went viral. Because I'm exactly the sort of walking cliche you'd expect I was blissfully unaware of the unfolding drama, being away on sabbatical snowboarding at the time. I hadn't taken my laptop with me, I'd disabled data roaming on my phone to avoid a whopper of a bill after a couple of months away, and had only a gen 1 iPad to access email and internet. So of course I came back in the evening to discover that it had all kicked off, with this ludicrous chain of emails where people were trying to figure out what was going on, until somebody had the sense to go and look in our source control system (which at the time was still svn for most things), and figure out that it was my fault. People saw the funny side and it wasn't that big a deal but the reason I bring this up is that the last line of dialogue in that scene is, \"Your mama,\" delivered by Wilson to House, and it was also the error message for the final failure scenario I was looking for. I'm glad that one didn't get printed. reply tverbeure 1 hour agorootparentBack in the nineties, 3D Studio used to be pirated by every kid in their dorm and more. The software had license checks all over the place apparently, but crackers tried to remove all of them. However, if they missed one, it would move a random vertex by some random amount which is obviously very visible when rendering a 3D scene. When people complained about this on forums (usenet mostly), they outed themselves for using pirated software. reply eastbound 46 minutes agorootparentprevSystem.exit(0); in Java is probably the most evil thing invented, when the license check fails (preferably launch a thread and do it without stacktrace, after a random time). To this day I still think Google’s motto only referred to “Do no System.exit(0)”. reply m3047 1 hour agorootparentprevSadly I mostly agree with this. File it with \"the first time people get the password right tell them they failed, making them enter it a second time\" and other janky but highly effective stuff. reply eastbound 45 minutes agorootparentI believe you can get someone’s entire list of passwords this way. reply nicce 7 hours agorootparentprevI write alot of #![no_std] code in Rust and forgetting debug messages is luckily impossible because compiler won’t compile in the end if you forget something. reply mattnewton 4 hours agorootparentThe nice thing about DO NOT SUBMIT is that it worked in comments, text protos and other configuration files, and every language. reply mstade 11 hours agoparentprevI did something similar years ago when working on a gambling site where people could upload bets in bulk using specially crafted files. During development this would sometimes break but only in very specific circumstances, and because they were so absurd and seemingly specific to our local development environment I just added an error message saying \"watch and amaze while the application eats itself!\" Or something to that effect. It was inspired by an error I saw with the Discworld game for the original PlayStation. Of course, once this hit production it turns out the det of circumstances necessary to trigger this error wasn't quite as specific as I'd thought, and support was overloaded by hundreds of people calling in to report the error, worried that their money was gone. Of course, people using these feature were high rollers placing very large bets, so management was not happy... Fortunately I wasn't fired and we fixed the issue very quickly, but man I felt the edge of that sword really close to my neck. It was at one of my first jobs as well nearby 20 years ago.

Basically the error messages was: $ pulseaudio W: main.c: D-Bus name org.pulseaudio.Server already taken. Weird shit! I thought a user facing error message like this is inappropriate, so politely took the issue upstream [1]. Lennart, who I had spent some time with in real life a few months previous, didn't yet have the reputation for being the person he is today. I thought he'd be pretty reasonable about it. Instead he closed the bug as \"won't fix\" and left the comment, \"Sorry, but please don't waste my time, will you?\". I was pretty shocked by his response, I lost a lot of respect for him at this moment and then wrote a long ass blog post about professionalism of developers and appropriate language for user facing error messages.. but still, Lennart tainted himself and showed the person we now know him as. (Also, if you are reading this Lennart, fuck you). Ubuntu ended up carrying a patch simply to remove this inappropriate language, I never checked if it was eventually cleaned upstream or if other distros also removed it.

My first encounter with this was as a young developer at an electronics manufacturing company. When discussing a request from a customer to change a particular undesirable behavior of the device, I referred to this as a \"bug\" in an e-mail to them. I was quickly reprimanded / corrected, with the explanation that -- while \"bug\" is a somewhat innocuous term to engineers, to non-engineer types it brings to mind a whole host of bad images, fears, and can lead to canceled contracts under the premise that we've delivered bad-faith product. I was initially very resistant to this idea, but I've seen the wisdom in this as I've matured as an engineer over the past 20 years since this run-in. For a related example, it reminds me of this issue that was opened on llama.cpp by a user who was concerned that the software had been \"hacked\": https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/issues/33#issuecommen... > Hey, I was reading your Readme.md and I saw that your repo was hacked. I want to ask what this means and wanted to check if the users like me also get the impact of hacking. Or, this is not the thing I should worry about? Of course, the repo was not hacked -- but the founder of the project mentioned that it had been \"hacked together\" (as a term of humility / self-deprecation) and some users got the wrong idea of what he meant by that. So I don't think this is about censorship, so much as good public relations. \"Don't spook the horses\" -- not all words mean the same things to engineers as people whose perceptions of technology are shaped more by movies and headlines. reply Anthony-G 9 hours agorootparentprevDystopian for sure: I’d wager that if the code-base lives long enough and the pool of developers is large enough, they will start using Newspeak words such as “ungood” or “doubleplusungood” – or other synonyms for “bad” – to work around the blacklist. reply dotnet00 8 hours agorootparentYou mean to work around the ungoodlist :) reply geoduck14 6 hours agorootparentYou joke, but the phrase \"black list\" isn't allowed where I work.

People got grumpy about master/slave being replaced with server/client, superior/subordinate, leader/follower, and similar terms but that actually largely benefits as well in that it makes things clearer. Anyone who has dealt with bus protocols that support the more complex \"multi-leader\" setups or peer-to-peer setups knows how the master/slave terminology can be confusing and potentially limiting in accurately describing the parts of the system. And the git master/main thing also is more a matter of just making things easier to pick up. Master can be confusing there for the same reasons it's confusing in bus topologies. Main instead is obvious. It's the main/mainline branch of the project. And that also helps set the divide for main vs feature vs maintenance branches (and release tags). So yeah some of it was done under the guise of politics but that's generally been more about getting an excuse to make the change without people dismissing it rather than the underlying reason for the change to happen. reply jrockway 2 hours agorootparentprev2 fewer characters to type every time you switch branches.

Debugger.Break and Debugger.Launch are like a breakpoint that gets hit even when you're not debugging, and prompts you to attach a debugger. ( Launch won't pause if you already have one attached, but especially useful when you want to attach to a start-up routine in an IIS hosted web-app. ) Debugger.Write writes to a different output stream, and like all Diagnostic.Debug statements, isn't even compiled into release builds, so there's zero chance of it ending up in prod.

If you want free-as-in-beer software, you'll take what I give you, easter eggs and all. Anything else is just entitlement. reply __MatrixMan__ 51 minutes agorootparentI have skepticism for anything that has a free/paid tier. The reduced functionality version has typically been gimped in a way that doesn't make much sense. You end up with cases where the button for the paid functionality is just missing so users don't even know that the thing is possible... and other such problems. It ends up feeling rather 1984. But I'd respect a maintainer who had a paid tier which differed in some kind of goofy way: - the free version does something goofy at 11:11, but works fine otherwise - the paid version is identical to the free version, but it doesn't do anything goofy at 11:11 Of course it would be trivial to just do this: if time.now() == time(hours=11, minutes=11): sleep(60) freeversion() But if you've got a pipeline which absolutely must not fail then you should probably be paying the maintainer. Hacking around the easter egg would hopefully feel enough like an admission of guilt to just talk your boss into paying. reply chgs 5 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely, if you’re precious about it review the code, remove the lines, and away you go.

And midnight isnt so late, I have a heritage of systems administration, all kinds of things happen at 3-4am; its a good feeling to debug and prevent them. reply lukan 12 hours agorootparentI like working up late at night as well, but if the kids wake me up in the morning anyway, I don't want the night work to have been useless and avoidable. reply mistercheph 12 hours agorootparentprevYes, I’d probably laugh too. A person who becomes miserable because of a joke that unintentionally misdirects their task for the day, has mostly miserable days, and resents the world for every ounce of joy contained in it; and spills the bile in their heart back out as revenge for their daily suffering. reply lukan 11 hours agorootparentYes, there are people who have mostly miserable days. Do you think, they deserve even more misery, by wasting them even one further day, that could have become a joy otherwise? How could they find joy with such a joke? reply mistercheph 35 minutes agorootparentCan't help them, why worry about trying to make people who have chosen unhappiness happy? Leave them behind reply ryandrake 14 hours agorootparentprevNot sad to me. A program is expected to behave sensibly for all of its inputs, reliably producing its outputs. Larger systems depend on their sub components working properly. Imagine if grep had an Easter egg where it randomly output a joke 1 out of every 1,000,000 runs. How would you debug that deep in a bash script somewhere, as was the case for OP. If you absolutely must write an Easter egg, put it in the “About” screen or the command line usage string or something… not in the program’s primary output. reply wpietri 14 hours agorootparentSaying that it \"is expected\" is a rhetorical trick, projecting your personal notions onto the structure of the universe. You may expect that, but I don't. To me, software is a community effort. Communities are made of people, and people have gloriously many motivations for their work. A spirit of play is one of those motivations, and I'm glad people honor it. Yes, it shouldn't cause much trouble along the way. But that's not because of some theory about what software it's for. It's because of the people. reply snvzz 13 hours agorootparentTry reading man(1) i.e. doing man man sometime. The expected behavior is described there. reply strogonoff 14 hours agorootparentprevA real-world program (a product of fallible humans, made for fallible humans, executing on hardware built by fallible humans and operating in unpredictable environment) is never bug-free or 100% reliable. There is always a chance that it will fail to behave sensibly—expecting otherwise is foolish and poor design. That holds with or without easter eggs. Easter eggs is an element of controlled chaos. reply ryandrake 14 hours agorootparentYea I don’t want to deal with some joker’s controlled chaos at 10:30PM before launch day trying to isolate a rare-repro bug that turns out was deliberately added. If that makes me a Grumpy Graybeard then I accept that name. I wouldn’t want my home builder to insert an Easter egg that causes my windows to open randomly in the middle of the night on one day of the year because he found it “joyful.” reply strogonoff 13 hours agorootparentIf output of man invoked without any arguments causes a critical bug right before the launch day, or the equivalent of your windows opening randomly in the middle of the night, you have much bigger things to worry about than that easter egg. (I doubt a true Graybeard would ever find oneself in such a circumstance.) If bit flips become more common as transistors get smaller, that’s certainly going to throw a much less controlled wrench in the works. reply keybored 15 minutes agorootparentRead the submission. It also would print that Easter Egg with `man -w`—give me the man path (after midnight). reply Ekaros 11 hours agorootparentprevIt might not be critical bug. But it certainly could be failed build job. Which you then have to rerun wasting time or manually hunt down and waste time tracking where it comes from. And something like this printing out in error could indicate that you have been compromised and you should lock down everything. Verify that you full system is clean and go through all of the logs. reply ElFitz 11 hours agorootparentprevThe analogy starts breaking down when you start paying your home builder. I would suggest not relying on some joker’s code and write your own instead. Open source is open source. That’s all that’s promised, and we aren’t entitled to anything more. reply idunnoman1222 4 hours agorootparentpreveggs in the manual buddy. It’s like a joke while you’re reading really dry documentation. reply mistercheph 12 hours agorootparentprevYeah I’m sure that launch was going to go super great, grinch and co launching profit seeking clickable trash hole gets disrupted by man command bug and their feelings are really hurt because somebody did a whoopie cushion? Woops, saddest story i ever read, what a bunch of poor sobs reply _V_ 11 hours agorootparentprevExpecting software to \"behave sensibly\" is your own faulty assumption. I write software and I've learned never to expect such thing in an environment, that almost anything can bug out, even including the CPU itself. reply seanhunter 13 hours agorootparentprevOh please. 'man' is fundamentally different to 'grep' and if you can't see how you shouldn't be producing systems of any kind. For starters the user of 'man' is an interactive unix user. Other than really unusual edge cases (eg processes which produce printed versions of the unix manual, and the test scripts of the OP in the stackexchange) there are no non-interactive or batch uses of man, it isn't used in pipelines or scripts etc. Whereas grep is a staple of batch processes, scripts, cronjobs large and small as well as being a key tool for interactive use. reply cperciva 12 hours agorootparentThe Tarsnap website has the man pages for tarsnap utilities, for easy googling; they're generated basically by `mansed`. I would be very annoyed if the Tarsnap website was broken because someone decided to throw in an Easter egg and make the output occasionally inconsistent. If anyone reading this is ever considering putting in an Easter egg like this: Please check if stdout is a terminal! If your output is going to a terminal, it's probably safe to be silly. If your output is going anywhere else, you should absolutely not play games. reply seanhunter 12 hours agorootparentChecking that stdout is a terminal is a good idea indeed. reply mistercheph 12 hours agorootparentprevAdmit it, you’re very annoyed even when Tarsnap does work, this is more of a question of character. reply asimpleusecase 13 hours agorootparentprevSo is AI an Eater egg machine? reply snvzz 2 hours agorootparentprevThere are people who abhor surprises. I am one of them. reply mbStavola 14 hours agoparentprevSoftware can and should be fun, especially if it's harmless. Where is the hacker spirit? reply mrweasel 12 hours agorootparentThere is simply to little fun and weirdness left in modern software, and that's quite sad. We should stride to make software a little more fun, have a little more character and have certain human touch to it. Obviously don't have your database write \"FART\" in place of data, just because the user is \"dave\" and it's not 16:45 in the afternoon, but harmless messages in the code, weird log messages and otherwise harmless reactions to predetermined inputs. reply voidfunc 13 hours agorootparentprevSoftware should fulfill its requirements and do nothing more. reply scbrg 11 hours agorootparentIn this case, it did. The requirement is clearly specified in the top answer: if you invoke man after midnight it should print \"gimme gimme gimme\", because of the Abba song called \"Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight\" You might not agree that that's a good requirement. Others' requirements aren't always aligned with yours :) reply PetahNZ 9 hours agorootparentprevHave you never worked for anyone before? The software I make is always expected to do more than what the requirements stated. reply kalleboo 10 hours agorootparentprevThis is Hacker News, not IBM Suits News reply nasmorn 13 hours agorootparentprevResistance is futile reply mistercheph 11 hours agorootparentprevMy requirement for all software: make me smile :) Requirement fulfilled, under budget too :)) reply hulitu 10 hours agorootparentprev> Software should fulfill its requirements and do nothing more.

Only two of the top 10 search results are broadly positive about this feature: https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ftsa&q=vlc+santa+hat+&ia=web And in a VideoLAN forum thread, at least one user was willing to recompile the source in order to remove the objectionable icon (presumably before it became a configurable option in the application settings): https://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?t=53998 reply Am4TIfIsER0ppos 5 hours agorootparentSome people have a visceral hatred of Christmas due to its heritage. GP appears to only hate easter eggs. A good thing it is open source and one can modify if they wish. I wish I had the skills to remove the things I hate. reply foobarian 2 hours agorootparentIt's open source and we mold it to the way we like it! Right? One time I decided I would like my workstation login prompt to work like the Monty Python bridge of death and print \"what is thy name\" etc. instead of the usual login:. Tracking down where exactly this string was turned out to be really hard, I don't even remember exactly but somewhere in PAM source code? Anyway after that I became less quick to tell people \"just change the source!\" reply snvzz 2 hours agorootparentprevI do not celebrate xmas, or engage in religion. It'd annoy me for sure. Fortunately, I run mpv. reply skeaker 1 hour agorootparentNot engaging with it I would understand, but being annoyed by it is Grinch behavior honestly.

    "commentBody": "Meta Movie Gen (meta.com)501 points by brianjking 5 hours agohidepastfavorite449 comments benabbott 1 hour agoThings are about to get weird. We can't control this at any level: At the level of image/video synthesis: Some leading companies have suggested they put watermarks in the content they create. Nice thought, but open source will always be an option, and people will always be able to build un-watermarked tools. At the level of law: You could attempt to pass a law banning image/video generation entirely, or those without watermarks, but same issue as before– you can't stop someone from building this tech in their garage with open-source software. At the level of social media platforms: If you know how GANs work, you already know this isn't possible. Half of image generation AI is an AI image detector itself. The detectors will always be just about as good as the generators- that's how the generators are able to improve themselves. It is, I will not mince words, IMPOSSIBLE to build an AI detector that works longterm. Because as soon as you have a great AI content classifier, it's used to make a better generator that outsmarts the classifier. So... smash the looms..? reply mikeshi42 0 minutes agoparentI agree the cat is out of the bag, but GANs do not work like that. One of the common failure modes in training a GAN is that the discriminator gets too powerful too quickly and the generator then can no longer learn. Hard to say anything is impossible off of one point - but discrimination afaik is generally seen as the easier problem of the two, given you only need to give a binary output as opposed to a continuous one. reply layer8 16 minutes agoparentprevJust stop taking any video you see at face value? People managed without videos before video cameras were available, and the written word was never reliable to start with. Maybe the future won’t be that different? reply farleykr 22 minutes agoparentprevI think pretty soon we will get to the point where there’s some sort of significant boundary at all levels between online and real life because the only way to be sure you’re seeing something real is to be interacting with it in real life. The internet will not be something you visit on a web browser to get information but will become a place you go where you will simply have to acknowledge that nothing is real. Obviously that’s a concern now but I wonder if we’ll get to a point where it’s taken for granted at large that whatever you see on the internet just isn’t real. And I wonder what implications that will have. reply dinfinity 24 minutes agoparentprevThe challenge is to determine what is real, not what is fake. I think cryptographic signing and the classic web of trust approaches are going to prove the most valuable tools in doing so, even if they're definitely not a panacea. reply afro88 17 minutes agoparentprev> It is, I will not mince words, IMPOSSIBLE to build an AI detector that works longterm Like pretty much any tool involving detection of / protection from erroneous things, it's forever a cat and mouse game.

Also, I think the most obvious giveaway are all the micro-variations that happen along the edges, which give a fuzzy artifact. reply dekhn 10 minutes agoparentThat sheen looks (to me) like some of the filters that are used by people who copy videos from TV and movie and post them on (for example) facebook reels. There's an entire pattern of reels that are basically just ripped-off-content with enough added noise to (I presume) avoid content detection filters. Then the comments have links to scam sites (but are labelled as \"the IMDB page for this content\"). reply lopis 5 hours agoparentprevI assure you that's not enough. These are high quality videos. Once they get uploaded to social media, compression mostly makes imperfections go away. And it's been shown that when people are not expecting AI content, they are much less likely to realize they are looking at AI. I would 100% believe most of these videos were real if caught off guard. reply jetrink 12 minutes agorootparentA friend who lives in North Carolina sent me a video of the raging floodwaters in his state- at least that's what the superimposed text claimed it was. When I looked closer, it was clearly an Indian city filled with Indian people and Indian cars. He hadn't noticed anything except the flood water. It reminded me of that famous selective attention test video[1]. I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen it, but it's amazing what details we can miss when we aren't looking for them. I suspect this is made even worse when we're casually viewing videos in a disjointed way as on social media and we're not even giving one part of the video our full attention. 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo reply mikae1 19 minutes agorootparentprev> it's been shown that when people are not expecting AI content, they are much less likely to realize they are looking at AI.

I recently figured out that the Movie Recaps channel was all AI when the generated voice slipped and mispronounced a word in a really unnatural way. They post videos almost daily and they get millions of views. Must be making bank. reply inkcapmushroom 32 minutes agorootparentI was watching UFC recaps on Youtube and the algorithm got me onto AI generated MMA content, I watched for a while before realizing it. They were using old videos which were \"enhanced\" using AI and had an AI narrator. I only realized it when the fight footage got so old, and the AI had to do so much work to touch it up, that artifacts started appearing in the video. Once I realized it I rewatched the earlier clips in the video and could see the artifacts there too, but not until I was looking for them. reply Twisell 18 minutes agorootparentprevMost probably they employ overseas, underpaid workers with non-standard English accents and so they include text-to-speach in the production process to smoothen the end result. I won't argue wether text to speech qualifies as an AI but I agree they must be making bank. reply newaccount74 5 hours agoparentprevI thought the movements were off. The little girl on the beach moves like an adult, the painter looks like a puppet, and everything is in slow motion? reply declan_roberts 3 hours agorootparentThey look like some commercial promo video, which makes sense since that's probably what they were trained on. reply Rinzler89 5 hours agoparentprev>All the vids have that instantly recognizable GenAI \"sheen\" That's something that can be fixed in a future release or you can fix it right now with some filters in post in your pipeline. reply atrus 5 hours agorootparentI think the big blind spot people have with these models is that the release pages only show just the AI output. But anyone competently using these AI tools will be using them in step X of a hundred step creative process. And it's only going to get worse as both the AI tools improve and people find better ways to integrate them into their workflow. reply Rinzler89 5 hours agorootparentYeah exactly. Video pipelines that go into productions we only see the end results of have a lot of steps to them beyond just the raw video output/capture. Even Netflix/Hollywood productions without VFX have a lot of retouching and post processing to them. reply surfingdino 5 hours agorootparentprev> \"That's something that can be easily fixed in a future release (...)\" This has been the default excuse for the last 5+ years.

A bit over a year ago the best AI videos were hilarious hallucinations of Will Smith eating spaghetti. Today we have these realistic videos that are still in the uncanny valley. That's insane progress in the span of a year. Who knows what it will be like in another year. Let'em cook. reply authorfly 5 hours agorootparentDisco Diffusion was a (bad) thing in 2021 that lead to the spaghetti video / weird Burger Kind Ads level quality. But it ran on consumer GPUs / in Jupyter notebook. 2 years ago we had decent video generation for clips 7 months ago we have Sora https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39393252 (still silence since then) With these things, like DALL-E 1 and GPT-3, the original release of the game changer often comes ca. 2 years before people can actually use it. I think that's what we're looking at. I.e. it's not as fast as you think. reply bbor 5 hours agorootparentWhat video generation was decent 2 years ago? Will smith eating spaghetti was barely coherent and clearly broken, and that was March 2023 (https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ai-will-smith-eating-spaghett...). And isn’t this model open source…? So we get access to it, like, momentarily? Or did I miss something? reply ekianjo 5 hours agorootparentprevYou had AI videos 5 years ago? reply surfingdino 5 hours agorootparentAI in general. reply bbor 5 hours agorootparent…I mean, it was advancing slowly for linguistic tasks until late 2022, that’s fair. That’s why we’re in such a crazy unexpected rollercoaster of an era - we accidentally cracked intuitive computing while trying to build the best text autocomplete. AI in general is from 1950, or more generally from whenever the abacus was invented. This very website runs on AI, and always has. I would implore us to speak more exactly if we’re criticizing stuff; “LLMs” came around (in force) in 2023, both for coherent language use (ChatGPT 3.5) and image use (DALLE2). The predecessors were an order of magnitude less capable, and going back 5 years puts us back in the era of “chatbots”, aka dumb toys that can barely string together a Reddit comment on /r/subredditsimulator. reply blargey 5 hours agoparentprevI wonder how much RLHF or other human tweaking of the models contributes to this sort of overstauration / excess contrast in the first place. The average consumer seems to prefer such features when comparing images/video, and use it as a heuristic for quality. And there have been some text-to-image comparisons of older gen models to newer gen, purporting that the older, more hands-off models didn't skew towards kitschy and overblown output the way newer ones do. reply DebtDeflation 5 hours agoparentprevAt least all the humans in these videos seem to have the correct number of fingers, so that's progress. And Moo Deng seems to have a natural sheen for some reason so can't hold that against them.

I have yet to find examples of this reply mitthrowaway2 47 minutes agorootparentIn the linked webpage, the following videos would be good enough to trick me: - The monkey in hotspring video, if not for its weird beard... - The koala video I would have mistaken for hollywood-quality studio CGI (although I would know it's not real because koalas don't surf... do they?) - The pumpkin video if played at 1/4 resolution and 2x speed - The dog-at-Versailles video edit If the videos are that good, I'm sure I already can't distinguish between real photos and the best AI images. For example, ThisPersonDoesNotExist isn't even very recent, but I wouldn't be able to tell whether most of its output is real or not, although it's limited to a certain style of close-up portrait photography. https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 2 minutes agorootparent> limited to a certain style of close-up portrait photography Not to take away from your point but it's more limited than one might think from this phrase. As an exercise, open that page and scroll so the full image is on your screen, then hover your mouse cursor within the iris of one of the eyes, refresh and scroll again. I've yet to see a case where my mouse cursor is not still in line with the iris of the next not-person. It's not just the style but even details down to how far the \"person\" is from the \"camera\" relative to their head size. Even knowing that, the images still look like head shots of strangers, at least at a glance and often more. grumbel 1 hour agorootparentprevThere are numerous tricks and LORAs to make realistic images without the overpolish you get by default: * https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fvs0e1 * https://old.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1fak0jl/fi... reply dageshi 5 hours agoparentprevYeah but... it's good enough? There were movies with horrible VFX that still sold perfectly well at the time. reply jsheard 5 hours agorootparentAn important contrast is that early VFX offered strong control with weak fidelity, and these prompt-based AI systems offer high fidelity with weak control. Intent matters if you want to make something more than a tech demo or throwaway B-roll and you can't communicate much intent in a 30 word prompt, assuming the model even follows the prompt accurately. reply marcosdumay 3 hours agorootparentThis is such an important problem of the entire genAI idea. It's absurd that people keep focusing on quality instead of talking about it. But then, a lot of people have financial reasons to ignore the problem. What's too bad, because it's hindering the creation of stuff that are actually useful. reply blueblisters 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah controlnet-style conditioning doesn't solve for consistent assets, or lighting, framing etc. Maybe its early but it seems hard to get around traditional 3D assets + rendering, at least for serious use-cases. These models do seem like they could be great photorealism/stylization shaders.

Is it just they had to create millions of videos and cherry pick only a handful of decent generations? Or is it just so expensive there's no business model for it? My mind instantly assumes it a money thing and they're just wanting to charge millions for it, therefore out of reach for the general public. But then with Meta's whole stance on open ai models, that doesn't seem to ring true. reply zoogeny 2 hours agoparentThere are a few available to the public. runway.ai and kling are a couple that I see heavily used on Twitter. I pay for runway right now for experiments and it works. The problem is that maybe 1 out of 10 prompts result in something useable. And when I say useable I have pretty low standards. Since the model pumps out 5 or 10 second clips you have to be pretty creative since the models still struggle with keeping any kind of consistency between shots. Things like lighting, locations, characters can all morph within/between cips. The issue isn't quality exactly, it is like 80% there. When it works, it is capable of blowing your mind. You can get something that looks like it is a bonafide Hollywood shot. But that is a single 5 second or 10 second clip. So far there is no easy way to reliably piece those together to make even a 1 minute long TikTok. The real problem is the cost. Since you have to sometimes do 10 prompts to get a single acceptable shot it is like a 10x multiplier on the cost per second of video. That can get very expensive for even short experiments. reply layer8 9 minutes agoparentprevConsistency and continuity is the main problem. Take a look at the “Super Panavision” AI videos on YouTube. reply altairprime 26 minutes agoparentprevAt “the public” Internet scale, if a hundred million people click Generate, imagine if Meta ends up paying a million dollars instantaneously. - How many clicks of Generate are budgeted for? - How many clicks should each user’s quota be? - How much advertising revenue will be earned per click? - Why should they give away a million dollars? Right now, AI costs for this are so high that offering this feature ‘for free’ would bankrupt a small country in a matter of days, if everyone on Meta used it once. It doesn’t particularly matter what the exact cost is: it’s simply not tolerable to anyone who owes payment for the services provided.

When A.I. can generate any entertainment you can imagine, we might start finding this kind of entertainment boring.

I always find the breathless joy that some people express at this stuff with confusion. To me, the very instant someone mentions \"AI generated\" I just instantly find it un-interesting artistically. It's not the same as photoshop or using digital art suites. It's AI generated. Insisting on the bare minimum human involvement as a feature is just a non-starter for me if something is presented as art. I'll wait to see if the utopian vision people have for this stuff comes to fruition.

Input detailed descriptions, use real images as reference, you can spend a minute or a day on it. If you prompt \"cute dog\" you should expect generic outputs. If you write half a screen with detailed instructions, you can expect it to be mostly your contribution. It's the old \"you're holding it wrong\" problem. BTW, try to input an image in chatGPT or Claude and ask for a description, you will be amazed how detailed it can get. reply beezlebroxxxxxx 4 hours agorootparentYou need an image for an ad. You write a brief and send it to an artist who follows your brief and makes the image for you. You make more detailed briefs, or you make generic briefs. You receive an image. Regardless, did you make that image or just get a response to your brief? You want a painting of your dog. You send the painter dozens of photos of your dog. You describe your dog in rapturous, incredible, detail. You receive a painting in response. Did you make that painting? Were you the artist in any normal parlance? When you use chatGPT or Claude you're signing up to getting/receiving the image generated as a response to your prompt, not creating that image. You're involvement is always lessened. You might claim you made that image, but then you would be like a company claiming they made the response to their brief, or the dog owner insisting they were the painter, which everyone would consider nonsensical if not plain wrong. Are they collaborators? Maybe. But the degree of collaboration in making the image is very very small. reply chefandy 4 hours agorootparentprevIt's still very different. What you describe is exactly what an art director does, which is creative and difficult— there's a good reason many commercial artists end their careers as art directors but none start there. Anybody that says making things that look good and interesting using generative AI is easy or doesn't require genuine creativity is just being a naysayer. However, at most, the art director is credited with the compilation of other people's work. In no situation would they claim authorship over any of the pieces that other people made no matter how much influence they had on them. This distinction might seem like a paperwork difference to people outside of the process, but it's not. Every stroke of the pen or stylus or brush, scissor snip, or pixel pushed is specifically informed by that artist's unique perspective based on their experience, internal state, minute physical differences, and any number of other non-quantifiable factors; there's no way even an identical twin that went to the same school and had the same work experience would have done it exactly the same way with the same outcome. Even using tools like Photoshop, which in professional blank-canvas art creation context use little to no automation (compared to finishing work for photography and such that use more of it.) And furthermore, you can almost guarantee that there's enough consistency in their distinctions that a knowledgeable observer could consistently tell which one made which piece. That's an artistic perspective— it's what makes a piece that artist's own piece. It's what makes something someone's take on the mona lisa rather than a forgery (or, copy I guess if they weren't trying to hide it) of the mona lisa. It's also what NN image generators take from artists. Artists don't learn how to do that— they learn broad techniques— their perspective is their humanity showing through in that process. That's what makes NN image generators learning process different from humans, and why it's can make a polaroid look like a Picasso in his synthetic cubist phase but gets confused about the upper limit for human limb counts. I think generative AI could be used to make statements with visual language, closer to design than art. I definitely think it could be used to make art by making images and then physically or digitally cutting pieces out and assembling them. But no matter how detailed you get in those prompts, there aren't enough words to express real artistic perspective and no matter what, your still working with other people's borrowed humanity usefully pureed and reformed by a machine. These tools are fundamentally completely different than tools like Photoshop. In art school I worked with both physical media and electronic media and the fundamental processes are exactly the same. Things like typography in graphic design are much easier, but you're still doing the same exact process and reasoning about the same exact things on a computer that you do working on paper and sending it to a \"paste up man,\" as they did until the 80s/90s. People aren't just being sour pusses about this amazing new art tool— it's taking and reselling their humanity. I actually think these image generators are super neat — I use them to make more boards and references all the time. But no matter how specific I get with those prompts, I didn't make any of that. I asked a computer and that computer made it for me out of other people's art. A lot of people who are taken by their newfound ability to make polished images on command refuse to believe it, but it's true. It's a fundamentally different activity. reply mattgreenrocks 4 hours agorootparentprev> I only really hear about people being ecstatic about AI online, by people who are, for lack of a better term, really online, and who do not have the skills, know-how, or ability, to make art themselves. Yes, I've noticed this. The people who are excited about it usually come off as opportunistic (hence the \"breathless joy\"), and not really interested in letting whatever art/craft they want to make deeply change them. They just want the recognition of being able to make the thing without the formative work. (I hesitate to point this out, anticipating allegations of elitism.) Plus, really online people tend to dominate online discussions, giving the impression that the public will be happy to consume only AI generated things. Then again, the public is happy to consume social media engagement crap, so I'm very curious what the revealed preference is here. The value in learning this stuff is that it changes you. I'll be forever indebted to my guitar teacher partially because he teaches me to do the work, and that evidence of doing the work is manifest readily, and to play the long, long game. reply schmidtleonard 4 hours agorootparentprev> \"AI generated\" I just instantly find it un-interesting artistically How familiar are you with what is possible and how much human effort goes towards achieving it? https://civitai.com/images Photography, digital painting, 3D rendering -- these all went through a phase of being panned as \"not real art\" before they were accepted, but they were all eventually accepted and they all turned out to have their own type of merit.

Using AI is akin to standing beside a great pianist and whispering into his ear that you want \"something sad and slow\" and then waiting for him to play your request. You might continue to give him prompts but you're just doing that. In time, you might be called a \"collaborator\" but your involvement begins at bare minimum and you have to justify that you're more involved --- the pianist doesn't, the pianist is making the music. You could record the song and do more to the recording, or improv along with your own instrument. But just taking the raw output again and again is simply getting a response to your prompt again and again. The prompt themselves are actually more artistic as they venture into surrealist poetry and prose, but the images are almost always much less interesting artistically than the prompts would suggest. reply schmidtleonard 3 hours agorootparent> I'll be blunt, all of those images look comically generic and extremely \"AI\".

If you think it's all just iterative prompting, you are about 3 years behind the tools and workflows that allow the level of quality and consistency you see in the best AI work. reply consteval 4 hours agorootparentprevI would say the difference here is with these: > Photography, digital painting, 3D rendering You still make these. You sit down and form the art. When you use AI you don't make anything, you ask someone else to make it, i.e. you've commissioned it. It doesn't really matter if I sit down for a portrait and describe in excruciating detail what I want, I'm still not a painter. It doesn't even matter, in my eyes, how good or how shit the art is. It can be the best art ever, but the only reason art, as a whole, has value is because of the human aspect. Picasso famously said he spent his childhood learning how to paint professionally, and then spent the rest of his life learning how to paint like a child. And I think that really encapsulates the meaning of art. It's not so much about the end product, it's about the author's intention to get there. Anybody can paint like a child, very few have the inclination and inspiration to think of that. You can see this a lot in contemporary art. People say it looks really easy. Sure, it looks easy now, because you've already seen it and didn't come up with it. The coming up with it part is the art, not the thing. reply schmidtleonard 3 hours agorootparent> You still make these. You sit down and form the art. When you use a camera you don't make anything. You press a button and the camera makes it. You haven't even described it. When you use photoshop you don't make anything. You press buttons and the software just draws the pixels for you. It doesn't make you a painter. When you use 3D rendering software you don't make anything. You tell the computer about the scene and the computer makes it. You've barely commissioned it. It's easy to be super reductive. Easy but wrong. reply consteval 3 hours agorootparentSorry, I don't think it's the same because making physical specifications via modifying pixels, or 3D art, or forming a shot is something you do. It's the difference between making a house with wood and making a house by telling someone to make a house. One is making a house, one isn't. The problem with AI is that it's natural language. So there's no skill there, you're describing something, you're commissioning it. When I do photoshop, I'm not describing anything, I'm modifying pixels. When I do 3D modeling, I'm not describing anything, I'm doing modeling. You can say that those more formal specifications is the same as a description. But it's not. Because then why aren't the business folks programmers? Why aren't the people who come up with the requirements software engineers? Why are YOU the engineer and not them? Because you made it formally, they just described it. So you're the engineer, they're the business analysts. Also, as a side note, it's not at all reductive to say people who use AI just describe what they want. That is literally, actually, what they do. There's no more secret sauce than that - that is where the process begins and ends. If that makes it seem really uninspired then that's a clue, not an indicator that my reasoning is broken. You can get into prompt engineering and whatever, I don't care. You can be a prompt engineer then, but not an artist. To me it seems plainly obvious nobody has any trouble applying this to everyone else, but suddenly when it's AI it's like everyone's prior human experience evaporates and they're saying novel things. reply aenvoker 2 hours agorootparentTry it sometime.

To me that's uninteresting, not novel and not mind-expanding at all. reply aliasxneo 3 hours agorootparentprevI think a key piece here is that I often consume art from the mindset of, \"What was the creator thinking?\" What is their worldview? What social situations pushed them to express things in this way? For video, it's possible AI can feed into the overall creative pipeline, but I don't see it replacing the human touch. If anything, it opens up the industry to less-technical people who can spend more time focusing on the human touch.

This is why people with practice and expertise (e.g., professional artists, like screenwriters and musicians) can reliably create new things. reply jppittma 2 hours agorootparentTo an extent. Take cooking for example though- I don't doubt that writing recipes and trying them builds ones creative muscle, on the other hand, I don't think being we'd be at a loss for great chefs if we were to automate the cutting of onions, the poaching of eggs, and the stirring of risotto. reply sonofhans 8 minutes agorootparentOf course we would. That’s my entire point. Take poaching eggs for example. Let’s say you automate that 100% so as a human you never need to do it again. Well, how good are your omelettes then? It’s a similar activity — keeping eggs at the right temperature and agitation for the right amount of time. Every new thing you learn to do with eggs — poaching, scrambling, omelettes, soft-cooking for ramen — will teach you more about eggs and how to work with them. So the more you automate your cooking with eggs the worse you get at all egg-related things. The KitchenBot-9000 poaches and scrambles perfect eggs, so why bother?

Not trying to take them out of context, but specifying them. You mention, from my understanding, that mastering is almost worthless without the magic, and the magic only being there if you're neurodivergent.

It is not an assessment of the creative process itself. It's not as though I disagree entirely with what you're saying though. There are certainly ways in which the medium is highly influential over the process of creating something. But it's a mixed bag, and technical skill is not something to be celebrated in all cases. A technically accurate painting is oftentimes quite dull and uninspired.

You see it in how people spend their time. You see it in how people spend their money. And none of this is new. The public can create vast amounts of spectacular original content right now using Dalle, MidJourney, Stable Diffusion - they have very little interest in doing so. Only a tiny fraction of the population has demonstrated that it cares what-so-ever about generative media. It's a passing curiosity for a flicker of an instant for the masses. The hilariously fantastical premise of: if we just give people massive amounts of time, they'll dedicate their brains to creativity and exploration and live exceptionally fulfilling lives - we already know that's a lie for the masses. That is not what they do at all if you give them enormous amounts of time, they sit around doing nothing much at all (and if you give them enormous amounts of money to go with it, they do really dumb things with it, mostly focused on rampant consumerism). The reason it doesn't work is because all people are not created equal, all people are not the same, all brains are not wired the same, the masses are mimics, they are unable & unwilling to originate as a prime focus (and nothing can change that). reply farts_mckensy 4 hours agorootparentThat's simply untrue.

This community is made up of a lot of creative industry people. One guy who worked in commercials shared a recent job he was on for a name brand. They had a soundstage, actors, sound people, makeup, lighting, etc. setup for 3 days for the shoot. Something like 25 people working for 3 days. But behind that was about 3 months of effort if one includes pre-production and post-production. Think about editing, color correction, sound editing, music, etc. Your creative children may live in a world where they can achieve a similar result themselves. Perhaps as a small team, one person working on characters, one person doing audio, one person writing a script. Instead of needing tens of thousands of dollars of rented equipment and 25 experts, they will be able to take ideas from their own head and realize them with persistence and AI generation.

There are some AI artist that begin to emerge or there are some AI generated personas out there who are interesting but they are interesting only because the people behind it made it interesting. I am not fatalistic at all for the creatives. AI is going to wipe out the producers and integrators(people that specialize in putting things together, like coders who code when tasked, painters who paint when commissioned, musicians that play once provided with the score), not the creatives.

I have little faith in an optimistic view of human nature where we voluntarily turn more toward more intellectual or worthy pursuits. On one hand, entertainment has often been the seed that drives us to make the imagined real, but the adjacent possible of rewarding adventure/discovery/invention only seems to get more unaffordable and out of reach. Intellectual revolutions are like gold rushes. They require discovery, that initial nugget in a stream, the novel idea that opens a door to new opportunities that draws in the prospectors. Without fresh opportunity, there is no enthusiasm and we stew in our juices.

Sloth - that's not really a tropical drink, and we can't see enough of the background to call it a \"tropical world\". Fire spinner - not wearing a green cloth around his waist Ghost - Not facing the mirror, obviously not reflected the way the prompter intended. No old beams, no cloth-covered furniture, not what I would call \"cool and natural light\". This is probably the most impressively realistic-looking example, but it almost certainly doesn't come close to matching what the prompter was imagining. Monkey - boat doesn't have a rudder, no trees or lush greenery Science lab - no rainbow wallpaper This seems like nitpicking, and again I can't underestimate how unbelievable the technology is, but the process of making any kind of video or movie involves translating a very specific vision from your brain to reality. I can't think of many applications where \"anything that looks good and vaguely matches the assignment\" is the goal. I guess stock footage videographers should be concerned.

It's genuinely scary. reply CuriouslyC 4 hours agorootparentprevThat doesn't follow at all. If I come up with a meaningful story and use AI to generate clips and stich them together to tell it, that's real art. If you disagree with that, you're basically saying La Jetee isn't art, which would be a hard sell. reply adamc 3 hours agorootparentI don't have anything against stitching together clips to tell your story, but I'm unconvinced that these demonstrate anything like that. As I said in another comment, it seems like you'd need to write a screenplay PLUS all the information the director, cinematographer, etc. use to create an actual movie -- everything from direction for how actors portray scenes to decisions on exactly how shots are constructed, to blocking for multiple actors in a scene, to color schemes... There are a LOT of choices in making a movie, and if you just let the AI make them, you are getting \"random\" (uncontrolled) choices. I don't think that is going to compare favorably to the real thing. If you can specify all that, then it's just a tool. Cool. But it's still going to take pro-level skills to use it. reply diego_sandoval 4 hours agoparentprevThey used to say that the Internet would make people smarter and more knowledgeable.

Before you downvote, don't get this as a belittling the effort and all the results, they are stunning, but as a sincere question. I do plenty of photography, I do a lot of videography. I know my way around Premiere Pro, Lightroom and After Effects. I also know a decent amount about computer vision and cg. If I look at the \"edited\" videos, they look fake. Immediately. And not a little bit. They look like they were put through a washing machine full of effects: too contrasty, too much gamma, too much clarity, too low levels, like a baby playing with the effect controls. Can't exactly put my fingers on, but comparing the \"original\" videos to the ones that simply change one element, like the \"add blue pom poms to his hands\", it changes the whole video, and makes the whole video a bit cartooney, for lack of a better word. I am simply wondering why?! Is that a change in general through the model that processes the video? Is that something that is easy to get rid of in future versions, or inherently baked into how the model transforms the video? reply wiseowise 5 hours agoprevSo I’m probably going to be too closed minded about this: but who the f*ck asked for this and did anyone consider consequences of easily accessible AI slop generation?

At a cool 92 pages it's closer to a small book than a normal scientific publication. There's nearly 10 pages of citations alone. I'll have to work through this in the coming days, but here's a few interesting points from the first few sections. For a long time people have speculated about The Singularity. What happens when AI is used to improve AI in a virtuous circle of productivity? Well, that day has come. To generate videos from text you need video+text pairs to train on. They get that text from more AI. They trained a special Llama3 model that knows how to write detailed captions from images/video and used it to consistently annotate their database of approx 100M videos and 1B images. This is only one of many ways in which they deployed AI to help them train this new AI. They do a lot of pre-filtering on the videos to ensure training on high quality inputs only. This is a big recent trend in model training: scaling up data works but you can do even better by training on less data after dumping the noise. Things they filter out: portrait videos (landscape videos tend to be higher quality, presumably because it gets rid of most low effort phone cam vids), videos without motion, videos with too much jittery motion, videos with bars, videos with too much text, video with special motion effects like slideshows, perceptual duplicates etc. Then they work out the \"concepts\" in the videos and re-balance the training set to ensure there are no dominant concepts. You can control the camera because they trained a dedicated camera motion classifier and ran that over all the inputs, the outputs are then added to the text captions. The text embeddings they mix in are actually a concatenation of several models. There's MetaCLIP providing the usual understanding of what's in the request, but they also mix in a model trained on character-level text so you can request specific spellings of words too. The AI sheen mentioned in other comments mostly isn't to do with it being AI but rather because they fine-tune the model on videos selected for being \"cinematic\" or \"aesthetic\" in some way. It looks how they want it to look. For instance they select for natural lighting, absence of too many small objects (clutter), vivid colors, interesting motion and absence of over",

    "originLink": "https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/cartographist/",
    "originBody": "Szymon Kaliski Main Projects Notes Music Bio Cartographist Cartographist is an experimental web browser optimized for rabbit-holing. Instead of opening new windows (with cmd-click), Cartographist spawns horizontally scrollable panes. Instead of forcing you to find things in a linear history, Cartographist shows a tree-structured outline of your browsing: Instead of always starting fresh, Cartographist can save, and load \"trails\" — the exact state of the session you've left — supporting researching topics over long periods of time. For more context about the project, you can check out the longer write-up below, which originally appeared as a part of Q4 2021 newsletter. Transcluded from Cartographist During the summer of 2020 I played around with an idea for research-focused web browser, embodying some of the concepts from Browsing vs Searching note — browsing being an open-ended divergent activity, and searching understood as information retrieval. I shared a preview on Twitter ↗, to a surprisingly overwhelming response, but I got distracted with other things and never got back to the project. I still occasionally get requests for sharing this, so here it is: szymonkaliski/Cartographist ↗. The main idea of browsing in panes was inspired by Andy Matuschak's website layout ↗ and some of Nate Parrot's ↗ experiments around stacking mobile web browser views next to each other (which I can't seem to find anymore, sorry). This sort of layout has a long history, starting with Miller columns ↗ and the original Smalltalk class browser, and is a great interface for detail-in-context browsing. As an aside, I also use this technique for navigating code with Vim, where a single shortcut goes to a definition of a function in a new pane: (Glamorous Toolkit ↗ is worth checking out, as it takes the idea of pane browsing to another level) In theory, I also really like the idea of disk-persisted history which allows for going back to a browsing session after a while, and consciously deciding which \"topic\" I am in. Unfortunately, in practice, I don't think having the full history is that useful. Yes, it's sometimes good to know how you ended up somewhere, but I think what's most valuable about \"research\" is the synthesis part — grabbing parts of larger wholes, rearranging, recombining, thinking with the material. A small step in this direction could be persisting scroll position or maybe selection, and making the history editable — allowing users to remove dead ends, add notes, etc. Additionally, it started to feel that I'm solving this problem on a wrong level. For example, a good window manager could replace Cartographist almost completely — I played around with columnar layout in HHTWM for a bit, but lack of horizontal scrolling makes it not that useful in the end. Well, let me know if you have any ideas how to make Cartographist better! Is there anything interesting here that I'm not seeing? Could it be useful to you in any way?

All jokes aside, the description of the Vim functionality reminds me of the Whisper browser for Squeak, that had something of a depth-oriented SmalltalkBrowser to avoid the inevitable proliferation of windows in the normal course of things.

But, of course, the Whisper browser had stacking of things as well as sideways browsing, and new UI. reply kristopolous 9 hours agoprevI made something like this over 20 years ago. It also had full text searching of the contents of the page and also worked as a browser history. I used it for a few years. The real solution I saw in a roomful of butcher paper tucked in cabinets in the basement of a really dedicated guy who had a learning disability. He went through textbooks and had to come up with his own special syntax in order to comprehend the text by rearranging the contents on these giant rolls effectively making a hybrid between a mind map and a zui. He had a \"linking\" idea that involved an indexing system where you'd get another roll of paper out of the cabinet earmarked with labels and then unrolled it to the \"linked\" region. Then he'd fold it back on a table and have them both side by side. The general applicability was immediately apparent. I worked on it as a new way to browse the web over 10 years ago for a few months but then didn't stick with it. I keep telling myself I'll work more on it but you know, anxiety and depression sucks.

It helped me realize that clearing my plate was the most important activity I could do on any given day, because it created the space I needed to focus, and reduced the strain I felt in a day. It has taken time but I've now found when I look at tabs (or screenshots or whatever clutter) and think not about what I'll save or lose, but about how much more I will do if I don't have the clutter, I start to see it not as something lost but something gained, and it has helped. It doesn't always work, but sometimes it does, and its amazing on those days. reply wpietri 6 hours agoparentprevFor me tab accumulation is often related to fear of loss, sort of a digital hoarding of things that I might need someday. So it's possible I'd be better here knowing that my history was always there. I think it would be even more helpful if I could easily tag things along the way, and then quickly search both my tags and content of seen pages. Confidence I could find something again would make it easier for me to close tabs. For what it's worth, as a fellow ADHD person, these days I regularly go on tab-closing sweeps (generally at some related event, like starting or stopping work for the day or when starting or finishing a task). I try to have one window per ongoing task, and then find places for the other tabs. E.g., if a task represents or is related to a possible to-do, I'll put in in my kanban board. If it's a to-read, it goes to instapaper. If I just thought it was interesting and might want it again, I'll put a line in my LogSeq journal with a short description. The general theory being that if I'm not just hoarding, the I'm saving a tab for a reason, so I should articulate the reason and put the tab somewhere I'll find it again when the the time is right. reply berkes 9 hours agoparentprevI had exactly the same.

    "title": "Getting my daily news from a dot matrix printer",
    "originLink": "https://aschmelyun.com/blog/getting-my-daily-news-from-a-dot-matrix-printer/",
    "originBody": "For a while now I've started my day by unlocking my phone and scrolling through different news and social media sites to see what's going on. It's not exactly great for my mental health and I've been trying to cut down on screen time for a while. I still want to stay up-to-date though, especially after I get up in the morning. I recently purchased a dot matrix printer from eBay, and thought it would be a great excuse to have a custom \"front page\" printed out and ready for me each day. So, that's what I built! Printer ASMR noises in the video below 👇 I'll take this article to dive in and show you what I used, how I set it up, and the PHP script that powers it all. Interested in that full source code? Check it out on the GitHub repo! Purchasing the hardware The supply list for this project was pretty small, and with the exception of the printer, most of this can be found on Amazon or other online retailers. Dot matrix printer Raspberry Pi Zero W [link] Serial to USB adapter [link] Power supply The printer I purchased was a Star NP-10 from what looks like the mid-80's. I can't be 100% sure, but any dot matrix printer with a serial port should do the trick. The prices range from about $80-120 USD, but I was able to get this one for about half that price because it was marked as \"unsure if working\". It did need a little cleaning up and some tuning of the ink ribbon cartridge (isn't that cool, it's like a typewriter!), but after that it fired right up and ran through the test page print. After that, I hooked everything up. The Raspberry Pi is connected to my WiFi, and then via USB to the serial port of the printer. After turning on the printer and sshing into the Pi, I can verify that the printer is available at /dev/usb/lp0. Now, how do I get this thing to print? Figuring out the printer's code Because the printer is available at lp0 I wanted to see if I could just echo raw text to it and have it come through the printer. So I ran the following: echo \"Hello, world!\" > /dev/usb/lp0 Which resulted in an error that the file couldn't be accessed. Bummer, a permissions issue. Easily fixed though with some chmod'ing: sudo chmod 666 /dev/usb/lp0 There might be a better way to handle that, but it allowed my echo to go through, and I saw the text available on the printer! Alright, I can send raw data to the printer via this file, so let's find a way to scale this up. I use PHP as my language of choice in a day-to-day basis, and this is no exception. I write a basic script that accesses the file through fopen() and starts writing text to it. I try a few sentences, some spacing, and then some unicode art, but quickly find out that there's not as much character support on the printer as I was sending. So I thought it was about time that I start digging into how this thing actually works. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of internet hoarders, I found a full manual for the printer scanned and uploaded as a PDF. Come to find out, either because of the age or just the manufacturing decision, this printer has a very specific character set that it accepts. Loosely based off of the IBM PC's Code Page 437 it consists mostly of your standard alpha-numeric characters, but with a small set of special symbols, lines, and boxes. Neat! Sending these characters to the printer is pretty straightforward, I can just echo out the hex values with PHP like so: $horizontalDouble = \"\\xCD\"; $deg = \"\\xF8\"; echo str_repeat($horizontalDouble, 24); echo '78' . $deg . 'F' . PHP_EOL; Alright, so I'm able to write text to the printer just fine, and include some special characters and design symbols. Now I need to figure out what I want to see every morning. Gathering the data I knew I wanted four distinct sections for my personal front page: weather, stocks, major news headlines, and a few top reddit posts. After all, that's usually what I end up look at on my phone in the morning. Additionally, since this is an experimental project, I wanted to remain super cheap for this data, free if at all possible. Thankfully there's an amazing GitHub repo for free and public APIs, so I just went through there and found the ones I needed. The weather pulls from Open-Meteo and no API key is needed Stocks data pulls from twelvedata that offers a generous free tier News headlines pull from NYTimes which has a decent free tier, good enough for this project Reddit posts pull from Reddit JSON which is free (but I had to spoof my User-Agent) For each of the sections, I wrote some basic PHP code to pull in the payload from the API endpoint and compile the data I wanted into a larger overall array. I only wanted specific stocks, types of headlines, and subreddit posts, and if any of the sections couldn't have data to present I just simply crash the script early so I can start it again at a later time. This can be seen in this snippet which I use for pulling news headlines: // Get news headlines data echo \"Fetching news headlines data...\" . PHP_EOL; $newsUrl = NEWS . \"?api-key=\" . NEWSKEY; $newsData = []; $newsAmount = 0; $data = json_decode(file_get_contents($newsUrl), true); if (!isset($data['results'])) { die(\"Unable to retrieve news data\"); } foreach ($data['results'] as $article) { if ( ($article['type'] === 'Article') && (in_array($article['section'], ['U.S.', 'World', 'Weather', 'Arts'])) && ($newsAmount < MAXNEWS) ) { $newsData[] = $article; $newsAmount++; } } The NEWS, NEWSKEY, and MAXNEWS variables are all constants instantiated at the top of the script for easy editing. Running this compiles everything I want to see displayed on the paper, but now I need to take on the actual task of formatting everything for the printer, and sending it the raw data. Printing out my front page I could just print out a heading for each section, but that's a little boring. I wanted a bit of flair to the project, so I decided to have a box at the top displaying the current date, day of the week, and my front page name all nicely bordered. It took a little math, but I got everything working by using a combination of the hex values I talked about above, str_repeat and the knowledge that the page width for this printer is 80 characters. Now, just simply go through each section, print a little heading: str_repeat($horizontalSingle, 3) . \" WEATHER \" . str_repeat($horizontalSingle, (PAGEWIDTH - 9)) . \"\"; And then print out the data that I want displayed for that section: \" \" . round(($weatherData['daily']['daylight_duration'][0] / 3600), 2) . \"h of Sunlight - Sunrise: \" . date('g:ia', strtotime($weatherData['daily']['sunrise'][0])) . \" - Sunset: \" . date('g:ia', strtotime($weatherData['daily']['sunset'][0])) . \"\"; For the weather and stocks, I knew I wouldn't hit the edge of the paper so I just wrote everything in single long lines. But that's different for the news headlines and Reddit posts. If I just feed the printer one long line of text, it's smart enough to cut it and start printing on another line. But, I didn't want a word getting cut off in the middle and starting on the next line. So I implemented a small function to handle line length and instead return back an array of lines with a max length corresponding to the page width. function splitString($string, $maxLength = PAGEWIDTH) { $result = []; $words = explode(' ', $string); $currentLine = ''; foreach ($words as $word) { if (strlen($currentLine . $word) <= $maxLength) { $currentLine .= ($currentLine ? ' ' : '') . $word; } else { if ($currentLine) { $result[] = $currentLine; $currentLine = $word; } else { // If a single word is longer than maxLength, split it $result[] = substr($word, 0, $maxLength); $currentLine = substr($word, $maxLength); } } } if ($currentLine) { $result[] = $currentLine; } return $result; } Then I can just use it like so: foreach (splitString($redditPost) as $line) { fwrite($printer, $line) . \"\"; } Now all that's left to do is run the script! Usage and wrapping up I can fire off the printer manually by just running php print.php but I've instead set up a cron job to handle it for me. Every morning at around 8am it starts printing out my personalized front page. I rip it off and check it out in the morning while drinking my coffee. As silly as it might sound, it just feels better having that finite amount of news on a single sheet of paper. Of being able to stop there instead of endlessly scrolling through websites and social media apps. Also, this was a super fun project and I'm hoping I can find more uses for this dot matrix printer. Working with physical hardware (especially older specimens like this) is always a blast for me, and being able to integrate them with new technology or use them in interesting ways just ignites pure passion and reinforces why I became a programmer in the first place.

    "commentBody": "Getting my daily news from a dot matrix printer (aschmelyun.com)302 points by chrisdemarco 3 hours agohidepastfavorite105 comments whartung 3 hours agoSo, curiosity today. One of the things that this person does is simply echo to /dev/lp0. Which is all you did back in the day. Shove text down the interface, and the printer printed. Now, while we have very fancy modern printers, they're still printers with a long legacy. Even back in the day, early HP laser printers worked like this. Shove data down the wire, and it printed (Courier 10, 66 lines per page). Only the Apple Laserwriter didn't really do this (I don't think) because it was an exclusively PostScript printer. Instead, you shoved PostScript down the wire. As the printers evolved, the language that was sent to them got more complicated. But even so, they still had a long line of backward compatibility. So, if I plug a USB printer into a computer, and ls > /dev/usbXXX, will it print today? Does that still \"just work\"? If I do that with an EPSON and send it EPSON MX-80 escape codes -- does it still work? It wouldn't surprise me either way, but I'm just curious if someone knows.

I once had a company Macbook and it connected to my old Brother printer without problems and only then (after almost ten years of having the printer) I discovered it has double sided printing. It just worked. I always wondered if there is a way to connect somehow to this machinery to get a macOS printer driver or whatever and emulate whatever is needed for this to work on Linux. reply bee_rider 23 minutes agorootparentHuh, my first thought was that it ought to be somewhat mechanically obvious if the printer supports double sided printing. But now I’m thinking, some printers do just magically suck the paper back in for the second side, right?

It was a few years ago. On Linux my Brother printer is not on the list. Brother offers a deb and rpm packages which may be obsolete for all I know. Then you have to install it manually. But in my case it never offered double sided printing. For years I am using a crutch in terms of Android driver and Brother's own app. This despite being offered by the producer doesn't offer double sided printing either.

When connected via usb it appeared as /dev/usblp0 or something like that, and yes just cat'ing to it worked. And presumably the customers who buy these things new want them compatible with whatever processes they already have (for the last 30-50 years), so it supports both ESC/P 2 as you'd expect and IBM's escape codes (which I didn't expect and the old matrix printers I had from the 90's didn't). What's perhaps more surprising, my macbook had an inbuilt driver for generic epson printers and it worked. It was not very good, it printed as graphics but it was there for some reason.

One of the classic user errors was that somebody would try to print a document from Word and it would send a load of PostScript to the dot matrix printer, which would dutifully print it all out as PostScript source, wasting paper and printer ribbon until somebody told the printer to stop... reply zzo38computer 2 hours agoparentprev> Only the Apple Laserwriter didn't really do this (I don't think) because it was an exclusively PostScript printer. Instead, you shoved PostScript down the wire. It would be possible to write a PostScript program that emulates ESC/P (or PCL), although then you would have to send an entire page (or a page break) before the page would be printed, unlike the old dot-matrix line printers that you can print one line at a time, PostScript can only print one page at a time. reply mmmlinux 1 hour agorootparentIts not like a laser printer can really print line by line though. reply ssl-3 1 hour agorootparentAn old HP laser printer will buffer plain text line-by-line, and will print a page once the last line is buffered.

Doesn't work on my Brother laser printer on Linux, even if I send some valid Postscript to /dev/usb/lp0 . Piping it to lpr works of course, as long as you have a default printer selected.

Super easy to print out images and QR codes. and the autocut functionality makes it easy to segment messages. Additionally the receipt printer is nice because you can activate the bell inside as an additional \"notification\" and has an extra control for a cash drawer that I am thinking of hooking into to control a light or something. I had it set up for emails and every morning it would print off my calendar. I think the interface works well especially if you pair it with a physical control like buttons or NFC reader. That way you can issue \"commands\" and get output. Like I had one NFC card to make it print my calendar, one for unread emails, etc. I have some more features I want to add to it.

It was a CP/M and later DOS program, so not a WYSIWYG page layout tool like PageMaker. Instead it used text documents formatted with a simple markup language. It originally worked by taking advantage of the high-resolution graphics mode present in Epson dot-matrix printers, which were capable of platen microadjustments as small as 1/3 the pitch between the pins in the print head, allowing for 3 times the vertical resolution the head alone could give. Fancy Font rendered the text on the computer and sent it as graphics in this special high-resolution mode, yielding results that were as close as you could get to typeset for home equipment in the early 1980s. Later versions of Fancy Font had drivers for early laser printers like the OG HP LaserJet. But when the Mac came out... the writing was on the wall for such a system. reply PaulHoule 1 hour agoprevFor a while I’ve been printing “three-sided cards” which have an image on one side and a QR code with documentation on the other side https://mastodon.social/@UP8/111013706271196029 the “third” side is the web site linked by the QR code. I got bored with photography and made up a character who goes around with a cheap lens and always keeps the aperture around f/18 or more, uses heavy processing, color grades and shoots a standard non-standard aspect ratio so it looks like he’s using some weird camera from an alternate timeline. I just started printing this series and came to the conclusion that 4x5 can be easily made by cutting down a 4x6 but instead of cutting it I’d have an inch to put in a QR code and documentation on the front: similarly I could cut down a 5x7 to a square 5x5 and fit documentation in there. I have a few boxes of glossy paper that aren’t printable on the back and I think I’m going to use the, that way. (Found out later that instagram has a 4x5 standard and that my sports photos taken with a good lens really look good in that format) One question though is what the documentation looks like and I am split between: (1) minimal changes to what I have, (2) some kind of fake dot matrix or other effect that looks like an old printer that might have been built into that fantasy camera or (3) something that makes he most of what the inkjet printer can do. reply neilv 44 minutes agoprevI used the sell Epson dot-matrix and laser printers, when I was 15 or so. And I also had an old, used Star Micronix Gemini 10X at home, before I got the Epson dealer employee discount. It's hard to make out the dots in the photo, but I'd guess this is probably around a 24-pin, printing in near-letter-quality (NLQ) mode, and (barely) doing true descenders. Note how straight the vertical lines of the line-drawing-character box at the top. If it was alternating printing one line while moving the printhead to the right, then the next line while moving printhead left, the slight imprecision of the drive in many printers would tend to be visible when the pixels of the line don't quite line up. Or if it's doing NLQ mode, it might be printing bidirectionally on the same line, overlapping dots, and might be more forgiving. I would guess this model probably has features like italic and bold (or at least double-strike), maybe condensed, double-wide, toggle from 10cpi and 12cpi, etc. And you can usually mix those within a page, like you know that you can print twice as many characters horizontally at condensed in just a small spot of the page, and do the layout arithmetic based on that. That printer might also do bitmaps, and/or let you define characters. If you can't find the doc for a particular model, but it might be some degree of Epson-compatible, search for \"epson esc/p printer\" documentation, and see what codes work. And know about form-feed, for a smooth finish to your page. Or, if you you just want to treat it as an 80x66-character array, but get a little fancy within that, in a one-hour project, you can make a shell script that fetches data with Curl, generate HTML, and pipe it through something like `w3m` or `elinks` for formatting. Or use Svelte and pull in 100 packages from NPM to print to the vintage thing. For a more telegram-y aesthetic, you might be able to source yellow paper (search keywords \"tractor-feed\", \"continuous form\"), preferably unperforated. For more computer-y, search keyword \"greenbar\". A 9-pin or similar printer will look more vintage than the crisp one in the article, or you can try running a 24-pin in draft/fast mode. reply technothrasher 1 hour agoprevThe headline gave me flashbacks of doing the Friday morning news slot for my college radio station back in the early 90's, and printing out the stories off our news feed that I wanted to read on the stations big noisy dot matrix printer. reply canpan 3 hours agoprevThis is great!

BY ERIN DAVIS OCT 2, 2024 Share Key Takeaways Google won't be mandating a strict return-to-office plan, according to company leaders. Employees at the tech giant were concerned about losing their hybrid work schedule after Amazon mandated that staff return to the office five days a week. In a town hall last month, Google brass assured staffers that the company wouldn't follow Amazon's lead and mandate that employees return to the office five days a week, per Business Insider. Related: Amazon CEO Mandates Employees Work in the Office 5 Days Per Week Starting January At Google's most recent \"TGIF\" (Thank God It's Friday) monthly meeting, where employees submit questions, the most submitted query was reportedly for Google to recommit to its hybrid work policy in light of Amazon's new mandate. Last month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that all corporate employees are expected to be in the office five days a week starting in January. Salesforce also returned to a mostly five-day-a-week in-office schedule effective October 1. Related: Google Is Paying $2.7 Billion to Reportedly Rehire an Early Employee Who Built an AI Chatbot Before ChatGPT Google's current policy, meanwhile, is for employees to be in the office \"at least\" three days a week. A Google VP reportedly told employees at the town hall that the current system was working and changes were not expected. Although this goes against the trend of large tech companies enforcing stricter RTO rules, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai noted the policy will stay flexible as long as staff remains productive during remote days. A Google spokesperson confirmed these comments were made but provided no further context, per Business Insider.

But in 12 months (or the next layoff period), they will move from hybrid to full RTO. Still a shitty move to mandate RTO. Most people (IT folks) have spoke with do this routine: 0) daily routine to prepare for day 1) 1 hr commute to shitty office 2) login to computer, do calls with cross regional (and international) teams over Zoom/Teams/Webex or whatever conferencing system 3) teleconferencing with boss or manager 4) teleconferencing with company stakeholders 5) work on features and push code to remote systems (VCS, CI/CD…) 6) eat shitty food at nearby places, or use the low quality vending machines or cafeteria 7) logoff 8) 1 hr commute back home There are _some_ roles which may require in-person. But those were mostly sales folks. Some IT folks that deal with physical assets did require RTO (ie, data center / network engineers). reply sbrother 22 hours agoparentI think the worst part is 9) at night, do more work that requires focus time while no one is bothering you, since expectations got calibrated to when everyone had a private office and more control over their own time. reply macintux 22 hours agorootparentYep. Many of my days are 4-6 hours of meetings in the morning, 2 more hours of paperwork/email/coordination activities, go get dinner, then work another 2-3 hours. Thank goodness I can work from home. I know in some ways that makes my flexibility more damaging to my work/life balance, but the tradeoff is worth it to me. reply sbrother 16 hours agorootparentYep that schedule is pretty familiar for me as well. I’m willing to do it when necessary; I feel like it’s fair given the flexibility and trust I’m given as a fully remote employee. When I’ve worked in the office in the past, the laptop stays closed as soon as I leave work at 5. They don’t get to have it both ways. reply chii 13 hours agorootparentprev> since expectations got calibrated to when everyone had a private office and more control over their own time. which is why you should not be doing overtime to meet expectation.

Either it's remote or it's not. reply ein0p 20 hours agorootparentprevThat’s how it was for me circa 2004-2005. The only way I could get anything real work done was from home, after hours. During the day all we did was sit in meetings and report status to each other and to the higher ups. Worse, then the higher ups decided that we don’t need a sustained engineering team for the past two releases (boxed software) and the team would context switch between building new stuff and patching what’s already out there, 2 releases back.

I would have killed for a 1 hour commute. reply kstrauser 19 hours agorootparentI had a commute from East Bay that was a 30 minute bus ride to downtown SF and a 15 minute walk. I didn’t mind it so much when I had to do that daily. The bus ride was a great time to read a book or the news. The walk was a nice chance to get some air and exercise and practice mindfulness, or to go the opposite way and listen to a podcast or some music. I far prefer my current commute of walking downstairs. I could abide the 45 minute ride-and-walk commute if there were a legitimate reason I needed to be somewhere in person. No one would pay me enough to commute 5 hours a day. reply barsonme 21 hours agorootparentprevThat’s insane. 13 hours of work + commute. After 7 hours of sleep you only have 4 hours left in your day for literally everything else. reply commandar 21 hours agorootparentThe push for the 8 hour work day over a century ago was often accompanied with slogans to the effect of \"8 hours work, 8 hours rest, 8 hours for what we will.\" 5 hours round trip commuting a day is giving up over half of your prerogative time to simply shuffling from one place to another.

Prop 13 means the new home buyer has 10-100x higher property taxes than their old home neighbor. Permitting madness means that in the santa cruz mountains, any construction is on essentially a permanent freeze. Even driving an old car, generally considered to be an \"antique\" if older than 25 years in the other 49 states, why in California there is no set time, it is a set year, 1976. So, according to classically rabidly insane california logic, in the year 3000, a 1,000 year old car would be \"new\" and not \"antique\" the saving grace: whereas lane splitting (driving a motorcycle between two cars) is illegal in 49 states and grey-area in DC, it is outright totally legal in California. Thusly those with interest and probably low anxiety and medium-high deathwish are exempted from traffic reply epolanski 20 hours agorootparentprevI find it absurd how Americans can't give up on their suburbs and car centric development dystopia and then spend so much time in their cars. reply worstspotgain 20 hours agorootparentPeople would go for condos if there were cheap large ones nearby. Alas, the supply restrictionists blocked all vertical development decades ago in order to inflate prices 10x and capture tech wages.

Lots of squares / parks around usually full of kids playing :) reply worstspotgain 19 hours agorootparentprevNow that's crazy talk. You have to sign over most of your future earnings to the guy who's selling you the property, in exchange for (hopefully) getting the next guy to fork over most of theirs. The game is so hardcore that the pyramid scheme is as strong as ever. reply tesch1 20 hours agorootparentprevBecause door-to-door transport is faster than public transportation. Average American commute time is 26 minutes, what is it where you live? https://transportgeography.org/contents/chapter8/urban-trans.... reply kstrauser 19 hours agorootparentNot where I live. A bus ride takes about half an hour to get to downtown SF. The same drive during rush hour would take an hour, easy. You couldn’t make me drive to work here. reply ktosobcy 11 hours agorootparentprevWell... in most cases in densely populated places you simply can walk to the job or ride a bike. In BCN for example commute would be most of the time ~15-20 minutes (walking+metro). Car would easily take twice as much. Of course if you are living in urban sprawl and nothing is close and even getting something to eat requires \"a trip\" then yeah - door-to-door car would probably be \"better\" reply longnt80 19 hours agorootparentprevThey didn't necessary talk about time in commute. Maybe they thought spending time inside cars was useless. Sure your commute is shorter but most Americans also have to drive everywhere in their cars. To be honest, it's shit. Edit: also, the chart is too simple to know how they conducted and came up with the data. reply itsoktocry 20 hours agorootparentprev>I find it absurd how Americans can't give up on their suburbs and car centric development dystopia and then spend so much time in their cars I agree that kind of commute is insane, but maybe we don't all want to raise our families in shoe boxes (often surrounded by filth and crime) in the city centre (as if everyone in France lives in downtown Paris). You may find that thrilling, but I don't. None of it. reply epolanski 19 hours agorootparentYour arguments has way too many fallacies, like if the US has any shortage of crime and filth filled suburbs, but I'll cut it short. Everybody should live in the context they prefer. That being said, if the suburb dystopia was instead built around sensible public transport with good trains, metros and well planned gathering and commercial areas I could have some sympathy. But no, everything is planned and built around the concept of owning and driving a car for everything. Which is also why you end up having so many suburbs that are the facto dumpster ghettos, people not owning a car cannot even easily commute daily to a job available downtown. Good public transport and proper city planning are some of the best social equalizers and life improving engines out there. For everybody, including and especially people wanting their own home rather than living in apartments (that by the way don't have to be small, albeit smaller dimensions have plenty of benefits too). reply Aeolun 20 hours agorootparentprevThere is zero relation between filth and crime, and living in the city centre. At least inherently. There may be a correlation where you live. reply badlibrarian 20 hours agorootparent\"In 2005, Harvard University and Suffolk University researchers worked with local police to identify 34 \"crime hot spots\" in Lowell, Massachusetts. In half of the spots, authorities cleared trash, fixed streetlights, enforced building codes, discouraged loiterers, made more misdemeanor arrests, and expanded mental health services and aid for the homeless. In the other half of the identified locations, there was no change to routine police service. The areas that received additional attention experienced a 20% reduction in calls to the police. The study concluded that cleaning up the physical environment was more effective than misdemeanor arrests.\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory reply Aeolun 6 hours agorootparentI’m not sure what you are trying to say? It feels like you should be trying to refute what I said, but it’s actually in agreement? reply Izkata 4 hours agorootparentThey probably read your comment as three things instead of two (I did at first and had to take a second look). Tighter binding between the paired items might make it read better, instead of the awkwardly placed comma: > There is zero relation between filth/crime and living in the city centre. reply smugma 14 hours agorootparentprevThe irony is the vast groups of tech employees that choose to live in San Francisco and commute to the suburbs. reply RobRivera 20 hours agorootparentprevYes, we Americans love our cars, oil, wars, wwf, and guns. reply worstspotgain 20 hours agorootparentWell at least we still donate to preserve endangered species. 1 out of 5 ain't bad! reply abeyer 19 hours agorootparentBut only because we're confused and think we're still paying for pro wrestling. :D reply hiatus 20 hours agorootparentprevWhat steps do you suggest an average person take? reply epolanski 19 hours agorootparentNone? This has to be dealt with at city planning level by investing in proper public transport. Because money in US only subsidizes car drivers. reply Foobar8568 13 hours agorootparentprevI am at 2h30 total commute, and will be soon at 3h-3h30, in Switzerland. At least, I can work remotely 2days+what ever I need depending of the day. reply worstspotgain 10 hours agorootparentHoly Schweiz reply ktosobcy 11 hours agorootparentprevUhm... that's like almost getting from one side of Switzerland to another (Zurich-Basel is like 1h by train?) reply Foobar8568 1 hour agorootparentWell there are plenty of people going from Montreux or further to Geneva. With the changes in schedule, any trains going around the lake past Renens will be slower by at least 5min. Over the years, I had met several workers who were doing 2h+ per leg commute. reply Rinzler89 10 hours agorootparentprevMaybe he lives and works somewhere that's not point to point connected by a direct train connection as the crow flies. reply Rinzler89 12 hours agorootparentprevHoly shit that commute is crazy. Have you requested to work fully remote? reply 10xalphadev 20 hours agorootparentprevI live within an European city - not downtown, but relatively close. My commute by car over ~10km is 18-20 mins, same distance by public transport takes 40-50 mins, depending on train reliability and workers not striking. So change my mind? reply longnt80 20 hours agorootparentI don't intent to change your mind because it's often that people are stuck to their opinions. Just want to say that sitting in public transports I can do other things such as doing some work or reading a book. While sitting in a car feels terrible to me. 30 minutes of driving a car is a lot worse than sitting in public transport. Also, if I have to commute by walk/bike, I also feel much better. reply tomcam 19 hours agorootparent> Just want to say that sitting in public transports I can do other things such as doing some work or reading a book. In my experience that kind of activity was often not possible, especially in cases where one bus was late and I had go worry about getting to the connecting stop on time. Likewise I couldn't really read b/c I might get distracted and miss a connection. This was all pre-Internet and of course pre-unlimited data plan. These days I might have a downright pleasurable experience on public transport listening to podcasts under those conditions. Except here in Seattle there are just too many maniacs on some lines. reply epolanski 19 hours agorootparentprevWhat's there to change your mind? There are areas that are poorly connected and cars are much more convenient. I live outside Rome, Italy, my SO works downtown. It takes her 35ish minutes to get to work by train, it would take her way more than one hour by car. Hell, it takes her colleagues living in Rome center often an hour to get to work on a 6 km drive. The funniest thing was when I worked with a guy that commuted by train from Naples! That's 150 miles away. And he would still get back home quicker by train than people living in Rome. reply doitLP 18 hours agorootparentprevI find it tiresome how someone who lives elsewhere thinks we can waive a magic wand and change trillions in infrastructure and a century of entrenched car culture. Unless you have workable solutions please keep the peanut gallery comments to yourself. There are solutions but they are the hard “get people to buck all incentives and change their behavior for the common good” kind that take a lot of work. reply shiroiushi 11 hours agorootparentI'm not sure what other people can do, but personally I decided that instead of wishing in vain that the place I lived in was this way, I moved across the world to a new city and country where I could live car-free. Now I ride a bicycle to work and use subways and trains to get around on the weekends. Vote with your feet, I guess. reply FPSDavid 20 hours agorootparentprevThat is a ... choice. reply ryandrake 19 hours agorootparentI mean, I guess it's a choice in that I'm not willing to move my family into a tiny shoebox or split the cost with three other roommates in order to afford to live in my employer's city. I don't make $300K+ at a FAANG like everyone else on HN, so I have to live in a place farther away that is supported by my compensation. reply hamandcheese 21 hours agorootparentprevEveryone I know with a long commute can afford a shorter commute, they just trade the commute for a larger single-family dwelling. reply smugma 14 hours agorootparentMost of the tech employees I know in SF could have shorter commutes with larger houses but choose to have smaller houses and longer commutes to live in the city rather than the suburbs. Why? Access to people in parks, cafes, bars, restaurants, events, “culture”, single people. reply jrks11o 20 hours agorootparentprevyeah, “can afford” doesn’t mean I should, props to them reply hamandcheese 15 hours agorootparentI'm mostly just observing that long commutes for techies is driven by American cultural norms. I have some sympathy for the ones with kids, zero sympathy for the rest. reply BeetleB 20 hours agoparentprevI think if you're required to RTO, you should insist on not having Zoom/Teams/Webex on while in the office. \"Come to my cube if you need me\". Way before the pandemic, I almost never had those tools running on my work laptop - unless it was for a (rare at the time) cross-geo meeting. A coworker once sent me a screenshot of how I appeared in the IM tool - Last seen 120 days ago. Sadly, that went away once we hired our first remote person. reply closeparen 1 hour agorootparentIn the best case you might have all the engineers rolling up to the same line manager sitting in the same office, but those above entry-level are expected to spend a good portion of their time collaborating across teams (and therefore across sites). reply deciplex 20 hours agorootparentprevIf you're required to RTO and doing it you probably aren't in a position to \"insist\" on jack shit. reply lbreakjai 9 hours agorootparentYou have to fully lean into it. Or at least pretend to. My company implemented RTO, citing the usual collaboration and culture, and I've suddenly turned into the biggest in-person sycophant every time they try to organise workshops online \"because it's much easier\". We have offices on both sides of the Channel. It means travelling, which is expensive, hard to align, and really disruptive, but since the RTO mandate I suddenly realised _how valuable_ those in person interactions were, and how much more creative we were thanks to those watercooler chats. I'm interviewing elsewhere, so I'm having a bit of fun seeing how far I can push the malicious compliance. reply datavirtue 7 hours agorootparentprevNo one else is in the office on the same days. I recently seeked out a job that was in-office. It was just a reminder that the model is dead beyond repair. These boomer CEOs can't be gone soon enough. I'm full remote now and the engagement, interaction and team comraderie are FAR better. reply hintymad 20 hours agoparentprev> shitty office I'm not sure this applies to Google. Their offices and food are pretty nice. And their gyms are top-notch. If you stick with the salad bar, I'd venture to guess the freshness and nutrition variety will be better than most IT guys can get at home. Of course, this does not mean RTO won't suck. reply closeparen 16 hours agorootparentTech office amenity spaces are visually impressive, but then your actual workstation is just a desk in an ocean of desks, where you have to wear noise-cancelling headphones to hear yourself think. reply nostromo 20 hours agoparentprevYou're forgetting that a lot of people still have to WFH, they just do it now before or after going to the office - so it's even worse than you're stating. I know some folks that work from the west coast with customers on the east coast, and they regularly are taking meetings at 6am from home, then commuting in, and getting home late. If we return to the office, we should not also be expected to work long hours when we're at home. It's the worst of both words. reply technick 20 hours agorootparentI was told at a previous job I couldn't work from home but they expected me to take my laptop home with me just in case something happened. My response was I couldn't work from home and just left my laptop at work. reply chii 13 hours agorootparent> but they expected me to take my laptop home with me just in case something happened. which is called being on call, and it needs to be paid. Otherwise, you're right, you cannot be expected to work (at home or not) in off hours. reply jerlam 18 hours agorootparentprevWest coast seems like the worst time zone to be remote. You have to get up early for meetings with your coworkers, and they can get your immediate feedback on their problems. But when you have your own problems, it's often too late for them to help you. reply deciplex 20 hours agorootparentprev>It's the worst of both words. And it's quickly becoming the status quo. They really don't ever let a disaster go to waste, do they? reply angmarsbane 21 hours agoparentprevRTO for sales folks doesn't make sense to me either. Typically you want your sales folks on the road not in your office. I think sales is a good candidate for fully remote. reply DebtDeflation 21 hours agorootparentYou 100% want your sales folks at customers not in your office. Most roles can be hybrid/remote. Regardless of Tech, Finance, Marketing, whatever, if the job involves sitting in front of a computer or being on the phone all day it's a good candidate. If you were doing the job remotely from March 2020 through the end of 2021 and being effective, it's a good candidate. reply bathtub365 21 hours agorootparentSales also has long established and standard ways to measure performance reply teractiveodular 21 hours agorootparentprevAmazon is not mandating RTO for sales folks. reply deagle50 21 hours agorootparentGood, they didn't when I was in sales at AWS (well before Covid). reply whstl 22 hours agoparentprev> There are _some_ roles which may require in-person IME when working in a Product role, it worked better from the office. Doesn't have to be every day, but being able to talk directly to people is much better than having to schedule meetings. Tech positions don't even need daily video calls IMO. My team experimented with a few days of written status updates and it was fine. But they chose to have a 10-mins stand-up mainly for socialization. reply dijksterhuis 20 hours agorootparent> being able to talk directly to people is much better than having to schedule meetings i do not understand what people are talking about when they say things like this personA: hey @personB you got 20 mins to talk about XYZ? personB: yeah gimme 10 mins personA: k, i’ll grab a coffee personA: /zoom start that’s ^ not scheduling a meeting. that’s having the same direct conversation but with like one extra step (joining zoom). the rest of what your comment says is fair enough. i just see this mentioned a lot in anti-WFH leaning comments. often about how hard it is to mentor a junior.

And that's without taking what sibling poster said: sometimes people take 1h, 2h, 1 day to reply you on Slack. With face to face communication you convey more than \"the message\". This comes from personal experience: dealing with tech people with Slack-only communication is fine. Dealing with non-tech people is much different. For example, I just RIGHT NOW have to ask a Salesperson about whether a feature is ready to go into prod. I can just walk 10 meters to their desk and get an answer in 5 secs. OR I can write to them in Slack on email and get an answer Monday, because they have 20 unread Slack messages and 500 unread e-mails. You might call this \"a bother\" to them.

A lot of the cloud heavy offices moved to shared desks for engineers, so there's only a desk for 2 days/week, so they don't have enough space available for everyone to return full time. It's still possible, but I don't think would be as easy as an annoucement. reply yegle 20 hours agoparentprevAt least Google's offices have nice perks: free gym, healthy and nutritious meals, healthy and tasty snacks. Personally those perks are enough to negate the terrible commute. I was told Amazon's offices has none of these. reply stego-tech 22 hours agoparentprevI mean, my experience says you’re right, but the red hot labor summer combined with Dell and Amazon _and_ Apple workers vocally opposing such mandates and leaving outright give me hope that maybe, _maybe_ leadership will accept this is a losing battle and embrace the new norms. Barring that, the younger working demographics have made it abundantly clear there’s a zero tolerance for the traditional corporate bullshit. When mandates first came down, they responded with “coffee badging” and the like; I don’t doubt there will be another adaptation, like arriving late and leaving early, baking the commute time silently into the work day. The writing is on the wall, and the modern worker knows how badly they’re being screwed over. I’d argue it’s a wiser decision to let the workers do their jobs from wherever, consolidate offices into continental HQs, and decentralize the workforce to disincentivize collective action. Workers get the flexibility they need to survive in the current cost of living/housing crisis, and companies don’t risk bleeding talent or earning the wrath of a Union election. Everybody wins except commercial landlords, but they’re not exactly the good guys here anyway. reply Spooky23 22 hours agorootparentTech organizations are all overstaffed from the pandemic. Engineering is usually boom/bust. Likely outcome is recession and purge. The plucky gen alphas will be in the cube farm to pay they rent. reply stego-tech 21 hours agorootparentIt depends on your perspective and context. I refuse to subscribe to the defeatist attitudes of \"this is how it has been and therefore always shall be\" that's in your post, because otherwise what's the point of participating at all if change is impossible? The engineering boom-bust cycle is a recent phenomenon (past fifty years) relatively speaking, and it doesn't mean it's a permanent fixture of civilization unless we choose to accept it as such. I reject permanence and advocate change, and so should you. Besides, \"Gen Alpha\" won't be in cube farms even with a RTO, because Glorious Leaders (TM) in tech threw out cubicles, personal identity, and privacy in favor of hotel seating and clean desk policies.

We’re at a high where massively capitalized companies have been in a hiring binge for skilled technical employees for a long time. It’s been good to me - my family is more prosperous by any measure than my parents are grandparents, who were arguably smarter and bolder people. All of these companies have been incredibly successful… but can they sustain their historically unprecedented growth? Maybe. But when that train slows down, Intel is the example of what happens. reply stego-tech 20 hours agorootparentOh goodness, if we’re talking about sustainable growth then boy do I have some hockeystick charts to reject that notion. For decades, growth has largely been an illusion created through clever accounting and inflation metrics - it’s why the industry keeps desperately trying to jump on “brand new” stuff like crypto, blockchain, and generative models: a new industry means actual growth as opposed to illusory growth, which would create a new wealth class above and beyond any of the existing billionaires of today. For all of Sam Altman’s own blowharding, he’s not wrong that whatever the next brand-new revolutionary industry turns out to be - AI, space mining, molecular fabrication, whatever - will require literal trillions of dollars to explode into a 100x ROI. That said, if we abandon this idea of “infinite growth forever” and accept that market saturation and incremental improvements provide opportunities to rebalance structures and remediate institutional flaws, then there’s a lot more hope to be had. You can’t build new things forever, and eventually need to take time to pay off outstanding debts, improve existing systems, modernize legacy infrastructure, and basically make everything simpler and sustainable for whatever the Next Big Thing turns out to be. …unfortunately for me, making that pitch to leadership usually just gets me laughed out of the room because maintenance and efficiency isn’t “sexy”, nor does it boost their share valuations.

Being close to the office resolves it for us. reply redserk 21 hours agorootparentUnfortunately a new job, even 5-8 miles away, may turn a then-5 minute commute into a 45m-1hr commute in many metropolitan areas. I think more management needs to realize that forcing in-person isn't inherently beneficial. There can be value in meeting up if it's appropriately planned, though. My current management has been very accommodating with remote/hybrid. If there's a meeting where face-time is beneficial, people voluntarily come in -- but there's no pressure to do so. Generally, we find it easier to pop into the office for a day every few months to whiteboard things instead of dealing with Miro/Zoom. We have a mix of remote folks who live next to the office, some folks within a couple hour drive, and some who need to fly in. A former job of mine used to fly people to the same location 4x a year for a week to hash out a quarterly plan and grab drinks. The whole agenda was laid out and not a minute felt wasted. While not everyone went 4x a year, everyone was given the opportunity to do so, and this helped alleviate friction. Another job of mine had remote folks fly in every 3-4 months for a couple of days at a time. Some teams did it more frequently (1x/mo for a couple days) when critical projects were in the pipeline, but they'd return to normal afterwards. reply jart 17 hours agorootparentOh tell me about it. I used to have no problem with a 2 hour commute taking metro-north because I could just unwind on the train, and I loved walking into majestic places like grand central station.

I suppose if you are a person who has an iron will and good discipline the potential for productivity is much higher at home where you can lock in and just grind for a few hours with no interruptions. I am not that person and suspect many others aren't either, so there's that conflict between potential and real world outcomes where some people are just more productive in office even with all the distractions you mentioned than in an environment where you can actually focus in a flow state but have no surrounding social pressure to do so. I suspect management figures the same which is probably part of why RTO is being pushed so hard. reply generic92034 20 hours agorootparentIn my eyes the individual differences here could mean that it would be better to leave the decisions about WFH or office work to the teams.

There's also the associated side costs: getting ready to leave work (more for women, many feel socially obliged to put on makeup), extra clothes washing (personally, I don't like to wear clothes I had to travel in public transport with), having to schedule around errands like tradespeople coming in for repairs or picking up parcels from the post office, and for those with children all the shit associated with that, like picking up said children from daycare (whose opening times often conflict with expected work availability) or transporting them to school and after-school stuff like sports training... and finally, even though people like to deny even the most obvious (like in Munich, the current explosion of covid in wastewater tracking), there is still a pandemic raging on plus all the other \"regular\" bugs like influenza, RSV, measles and whatever else shit children catch at school, distribute to their parents, who then distribute it around work.

Their team, managers, and collaborators never actually expected them at their desks. It was all to appease this mandate. It's not surprising that Amazon has moved to 5 days a week despite so many people gaming the system and not actually caring about being in person. There's likely some algorithm driving this entire movement that doesn't take into account any of the real nuance that team dynamics requires, let alone taking into account that there are tangible benefits to remote work. reply qqtt 21 hours agoparentI honestly don't think there is any algorithm. For all the bluster and commitment to being \"data driven\", none of the companies I've seen mandate RTO have provided any sort of data-driven reason why it needs to happen. Amazon's policy might as well be \"Jassy feels it in his gut that RTO is better for the company so we are doing it\". All the communication of RTO invokes the most fanciful and vague references to \"magical hallway conversations\" and \"increased collaboration\" without a single data point to back up any of the claims. It has been almost humorous to watch such stalwarts of \"data driven decision making\" turn up a giant goose egg with respect to actual evidence on such a huge, impactful, and far reaching decision. reply mvanbaak 21 hours agorootparentAmazons RTO is a hidden layoff round.

The most obvious example of this is citing evidence that WFH makes people more productive, but there are various other arguments that try to position WFH as beneficial for both employers and employees. I have opinions on many of the points made by both sides, but honestly it strikes me as the wrong argument to be having. The reason I want to be able to WFH is because I prefer it. I don't care if it's better for my employer or not, the same as I don't care whether working on Saturday and Sunday is better or not - I simply won't do it. I know I'm in a privileged position to be able to say \"I won't work in an office\" and others have obligations that undermine their ability to show RTO employers the finger. I guess I'm just surprised that people demanding WFH, simply because they want it, seem to be in the minority, judging by HN comments (fraught, I know). Perhaps this is a culture clash? I'm British, and this might be a US-centric thing. reply zamadatix 19 hours agoparentLike you say, the set of people who'd be pushing the argument from that angle is inherently pretty small. Basically either those that don't need money from a job in the first place + those that want some extra money from a job but only when it's extremely convenient and that boundary just happens to be WFH or not. The others don't inherently care more about their employer than themselves, they care more more about the money impact it means for their compensation. More efficient = more valuable to employer = more compensation. For employees benefit only = less valuable to employer = less compensation. reply asib 19 hours agorootparentMy labour history knowledge is pretty non-existent, but I assume past progress was often made via unions, e.g. 8-hour work day. Seems like this is a situation begging for workers (at Amazon and elsewhere) to unionise and demand the right to WFH through the power of collective bargaining.

The Supreme Court has steadily been gutting it for 40+ years now, and unionism has unfortunately been subsumed into culture war politics so that even a bare acknowledgement of the imbalances in negotiating power between management and labor is impossible without getting entangled in tribal-political ideology.

If Amazon engineers unionised, this RTO mandate could be fought without appeals to employers' business motivations.

Some companies are asking to RTO for half the week even if you're 50 miles away. Depending on where you're at that could be a ~5 hour round trip commute. If you factor in parking in certain places like NYC you're almost forced into taking a train so having meetings during the commute wouldn't be too realistic.

Aside from all the conversation about work culture, state taxes are a big barrier to fully remote work. States hate losing tax revenue. Notoriously, it is easier to register to do business in a state than to unregister. This is even harder internationally. For large organizations, remote can be the difference between one state's paperwork + regs + taxation, and every state and country under the sun's paperwork + regs + taxation. That is a real burden. Not just the paperwork + administrative overhead, but being subject to differing employment + everything else laws from *everywhere* will really muck up ability to run a consistent business. While fully remote startups can now access services to help with this, like PEO providers like Justworks/Deel, the reality is that most of the world is not setup to accept this at scale. I run a fully remote startup and still run into issues with vendor diligence departments and accounts etc. expecting us to have a physical office, and being totally bewildered when we don't. The people involved now understand remote work, but the systems --forms, insurances, tax nexus decisions, etc -- still very much aren't setup to handle it. Notably: if you are a bigger company, you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube with all these local governments, and you bet that every locality will be trying to extract tax dollars from the big firms with deeper pockets. reply sethhochberg 22 hours agorootparentWe see this all the time working at the intersection of the insurance / fintech space. I've had several big, legacy vendors make requests for multiple physical signatures on a piece of paper (printed and mailed or faxed, can't just annotate a PDF) from people who haven't even met eachother in person let alone ever worked at the same address. The kicker? These papers are access authorization forms to APIs. Your average tech company is probably reasonably well prepared to go truly distributed, but I bet many of their vendors aren't. Whole workflows in certain industries don't even conceptualize companies with employees distributed across offices, let alone companies with no office at all. (I've fought similar battles over not being able to provide a direct phone extension because I don't have a phone on my office desk and even if I did I'm not at the office anything close to full time, and I don't provide my personal cell phone number to vendors... but thats a whole different topic.

I'd love to chat about what you've found work. we're in the intersection of fintech / wealth (which overlaps with insurance). I've gotten by just fine for the past few years but we are starting to see more questions about this that require us to change our legal address away from a residence. I think we got away without much trouble solely because of the pandemic, and now it's over we're going to see a lot more questions about this. It's not worth the future of the whole business to fight big vendors/customers over addresses. reply mushufasa 22 hours agorootparentBasically, for those who aren't living this, the physical address is mostly a liability thing. Insurance expect to be able to (imagine worst case scenario) walk into an office and blame / seize assets / arrest people if things go south. Sometimes you can just provide a residential address of a founder / board member, but all the diligence forms etc expect a physical office building where you can find all the employees 5 days a week if you just walk in. reply ygjb 22 hours agorootparentprev> For large organizations, remote can be the difference between one state's paperwork + regs + taxation, and every state and country under the sun's paperwork + regs + taxation. That is a real burden. Not just the paperwork + administrative overhead, but being subject to differing employment + everything else laws from everywhere will really muck up ability to run a consistent business. This is a real burden for small businesses. The nature of Amazon's business as an online retailer with a massive distribution network means that for any significant market they do business in, they will have employees. Practically speaking, this is a solved problem for any state in which Amazon has a warehouse (which I think is probably all of them for the US?). reply ryandrake 22 hours agorootparentAll major payroll companies and employment law firms have long since figured out paperwork, taxes, and labor regulations in all 50 states.

The issue of state tax breaks was such a big deal during their \"HQ2\" contest a few years ago that it actually became one of the top issues in the NYC elections that year. (to a large extent local candidate races became a referendum on how they felt about giving tax breaks to amazon in exchange for Amazon's commitments to employ a certain # of highly paid software + product people who would potentially contribute to the overall tax base.

Cities subsidize the suburban infrastructure because of the population density benefits. If everyone spreads out then infrastructure will suffer. reply blackeyeblitzar 22 hours agorootparentDo cities actually subsidize suburban infrastructure? I am skeptical but I don’t know all of the details on how people come to that conclusion. What happens if the economy is more spread out? Also a lot of the people that own and run companies that give a city its tax base live in the suburban areas. It might even be reasonable to say that they are the ones subsidizing the city and not the other way. How do you think about these angles? reply 0cf8612b2e1e 22 hours agorootparentIt is simple enough to break it down by area. If a city has N people per city block, but a suburb has 1/N people per city block you lose out on all economies of scale. Each individual dwelling requires water, electrical, gas, roads, etc. More efficient to amortize that across more people per unit of infrastructure. A road is always going up cost $/foot. Best if that road is being used by 100k people per day instead of 10. reply blackeyeblitzar 22 hours agorootparentYes but that’s a cost of infrastructure angle, not an argument for who is subsidizing whom. I’m saying the fact that the economy is unnecessarily focused into cities makes suburbs look worse in tax revenue but it doesn’t have to be that way. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 19 hours agorootparentYou cannot ignore infrastructure costs and then ask who is subsidizing whom. Infrastructure is an enormous governmental expense. Not just the initial installation, but the ongoing maintenance as well. Economies of scale are always going to result in the higher density installation being more cost effective. reply Spooky23 21 hours agorootparentprevSuburbs in general are losers from a government operations perspective. They work because they are mostly newish. Core functions like keeping roads functional rely on state and federal aid. Many older suburbs are more in decline now. Especially in 2nd/3rd tier metro areas. It’s just less obvious than the inner city or rural areas. They need growth to thrive. Once they fill out, population ages out, schools decline, and a vicious cycle starts. Money policy has kept that going by organizing the economy around real estate. I don’t think it’s sustainable to continually recapitalize single family homes. reply antisthenes 20 hours agorootparentSuburban infrastructure is usually much more sparse, of lower quality and a lot of it is shifted to the local business/homeowner. As an example - city water vs Water wells & Septic tank/fields. Gravel roads without sidewalks, etc. So it's not 100% evident that cities subsidize rural counties. Cities do provide the larger tax base for states, which probably subsidize more rural counties through incentives tied to certain rural activities, but making a blanket statement is probably not accurate. reply Spooky23 20 hours agorootparentTowns and counties produce revenue from property tax and sales tax. The infrastructure relies on state support, which is usually from Federal funds and personal income tax. That aid is a transfer payment from cities to localities. Bigger states, bigger transfer. Also, the federal funds are sourced from bigger states to the smaller states. Thats one of the amazing things about the US. The wealth of the coasts ensured that the smaller states weren’t left behind. reply shaftway 22 hours agorootparentprevStrong Towns does a lot of discussion in this area. But here's a video that breaks it down well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nw6qyyrTeI reply KittenInABox 22 hours agorootparentprevIt's not like cities give their money to every suburban mom. It's like this: Suburbs cannot function without freeways, but the presence of freeways harm the property values of city neighborhoods not suburban ones. SFH simply produces less tax revenue than an entire apartment building by land, so any statewide social services (education, freeway maintenance...) is paid proportionately more by cities than by SFH. There are reports[0] of cities reporting that their SFH actually loses them money due to the fact they simply don't pay their fair share of taxes vs all the infrastructure they use. It's not like the government is going \"oh boy, SFH mom, here's 500$ plucked straight from some inner city mom's payroll taxes\". But in the broader system of supporting many people's living styles through greater societal infrastructure, less-dense housing like suburbs do not put out as much as they take.

I've lived in SFH on the edge of a major city and on the edge of farmland and there's a wide gulf in the level of infrastructure that they had access to, and also a significant difference in the amount of tax that was owed. It's hard for me to believe that those two very different scenarios are functionally equivalent. Moreover, vast swathes of the city I used to live next to, despite having significantly higher tax rates, were ultimately paying a lot less in tax due to severely depressed income levels and property values.

    "originBody": "You don't say Cox slows Internet speeds in entire neighborhoods to punish any heavy users Cox warns customers to lower usage, imposes 10Mbps upload limit on “gigabit” plan. Jon Brodkin – Jun 8, 2020 8:55 PM Credit: Getty ImagesBosca78 Credit: Getty ImagesBosca78 289 Cox Communications is lowering Internet upload speeds in entire neighborhoods to stop what it considers \"excessive usage,\" in a decision that punishes both heavy Internet users and their neighbors. Cox, a cable company with about 5.2 million broadband customers in the United States, has been sending notices to some heavy Internet users warning them to use less data and notifying them of neighborhood-wide speed decreases. In the case we will describe in this article, a gigabit customer who was paying $50 extra per month for unlimited data was flagged by Cox because he was using 8TB to 12TB a month. Cox responded by lowering the upload speeds on the gigabit-download plan from 35Mbps to 10Mbps for the customer's whole neighborhood. Cox confirmed to Ars that it has imposed neighborhood-wide slowdowns in multiple neighborhoods in cases like this one but didn't say how many excessive users are enough to trigger a speed decrease. Mike, a Cox customer from Gainesville, Florida, pays $150 a month, including $100 for 1Gbps download speeds and 35Mbps upload speeds, and another $50 for \"unlimited data\" so that he can go over Cox's 1TB data cap. Mike told Ars via email that most of his 8TB+ monthly use consists of scheduled device backups and \"data sharing via various (encrypted) information-sharing protocols,\" such as peer-to-peer networks, between 1am and 8am. (We agreed to publish Mike's first name only but reviewed his bills and confirmed the basic details of his account with Cox.) Generally speaking, data usage for most households declines significantly during those 1am-8am overnight hours, so a robustly built broadband network should be able to handle the traffic. In any case, Mike couldn't use more than 35Mbps for uploads at any given time because that's the limit Cox always imposed on its gigabit-download cable plan. Mike said his household's daytime and evening use is more like a typical Internet user's, with work-from-home activities during the day and streaming video in high-definition during the evening. Mike also said his level of Internet usage has been roughly the same for the past four years that he's been using Cox—but it was only in mid-May that the company flagged him for excessive use. This may suggest that Cox is struggling to handle pandemic-level broadband traffic, but Cox says that the vast majority of its network is \"performing very well.\" Cox provided a little more detail after this story published, saying that the neighborhood-wide slowdowns and disconnection threats sent to individual customers \"are two separate initiatives that could cross over in some cases.\" (Clarification: Mike's nightly uploads alone couldn't have accounted for more than half of his monthly 8TB+ usage if his upload speeds were capped at 35Mbps; seven hours of nightly uploads at that rate would amount to about 3.3TB per month. The nightly uploads may have accounted for most of his upload usage, however, as his monthly usage of 8TB to 12TB includes both downloads and uploads. Assuming Mike was also downloading heavily during those 1-8am hours, then the overnight usage including both downloads and uploads would account for most of his overall data usage.) “Scheduled for termination” First, Mike got three calls from Cox including one that left a voicemail saying, \"we need to speak with you regarding your Internet usage. Your home is using an extraordinarily high amount of Internet data and adjustments need to be made immediately.\" The voicemail warned that your \"Internet will be scheduled for termination\" unless usage reductions are \"made within five days,\" according to Mike. Mike explained how he responded: Since I work from home, I naturally was very concerned they would pull the plug on me and I'd be unable to work. Immediately calling the number [provided in the voicemail], I was funneled directly to a department for \"questions about your recent Internet speed changes,\" and spoke with a representative there. He went on to explain that their network is overburdened and since I was an above-average user, I was being targeted to lower my usage or else have my account terminated... I tried to explain that my usage is not out of the ordinary for me. My day-time bandwidth usage is paltry (most of my bandwidth consumption is scheduled from 1am-8am), and that Cox should have been upgrading their infrastructure instead of oversubscribing nodes and pocketing the record revenue. I was told if I did not make a substantial decrease in my upload data usage, my service would be terminated. Comments in a Reddit thread last month confirm that Mike isn't the only Cox customer being warned to cut upload speeds in order to avoid being kicked off the network. Cox didn't tell Mike exactly how much data he'd have to shave off his monthly usage. There was \"no magic number or threshold, just an arbitrary amount of decrease, a Cox-deemed 'good effort,'\" or his service would be cut off, he said. Shortly after that phone call, Mike received an email from Cox with the subject line, \"Alert: Action required to continue your Internet service.\" Mike provided Ars with a copy of the email. \"We've recently tried getting in touch with you about your service—your account has been identified as using an extremely high level of bandwidth, which is causing a negative impact on our network and our other customers across your neighborhood,\" the email said. Mike's \"extraordinarily high\" upload usage \"is negatively impacting Internet service of other customers, which is a violation of our Acceptable Use Policy, the email said. The policy contains a broad prohibition on transmitting amounts of data large enough to disrupt the network, but it doesn't specify an amount. The real kicker is that Cox's email to Mike said that everyone in his neighborhood will get lower upload speeds until July 15: During these unprecedented times, many people are working and schooling from home, and maintaining connectivity is important. We are working to provide a positive Internet experience for everyone, so we've adjusted our Gigablast upload speeds in your neighborhood from 35Mbps to 10Mbps, now through July 15, 2020. Your download speeds have not changed. Cox's email doesn't specifically state that Mike's usage spurred the decision to impose a neighborhood-wide slowdown, but this is apparently only happening in a small percentage of neighborhoods where Cox has seen heavier use than elsewhere in its network. Questions for Cox This raises several questions that we asked Cox. We asked the cable company why its network is \"unable to handle Mike's uploads in the middle of the night\" and whether it has \"considered adding capacity to its network instead of forcing unlimited-data customers to use less data.\" We asked Cox how much data, specifically, customers who pay for unlimited data are actually allowed to use, and \"Why isn't Mike allowed to use unlimited data when he is paying for the highest speeds and paying extra for unlimited data?\" We also asked why Cox is imposing slowdowns throughout entire neighborhoods instead of only on the people allegedly violating the Acceptable Use Policy and whether the slowdowns are imposed even when only a single customer in a neighborhood is flagged for excessive usage. We also asked how many people in Mike's neighborhood are affected by the upload-speed decrease and whether they will get discounts to reflect their reduced service. Cox didn't provide as much detail as we were looking for, but it confirmed the neighborhood-wide speed decreases, saying it has \"identified a small number of neighborhoods where performance can be improved for all customers in the neighborhood by temporarily increasing or maintaining download speeds and changing upload speeds for some of our service tiers.\" Cox defended the temporary 10Mbps upload speed for its gigabit-download plan, saying that \"10Mbps is plenty of speed for the vast majority of customers to continue their regular activity and have a positive experience.\" Of course, customers paying extra for Cox's fastest plan and unlimited data are more likely to be outliers who do need high upstream bandwidth. Unlike fiber-to-the-home service, in which ISPs offer symmetrical upstream and downstream speeds, cable service generally has much lower uploads than downloads. Cox offers symmetrical gigabit speeds in some areas where it has deployed fiber directly to homes but provides slower upload speeds on its cable network. Cable users may eventually get symmetrical upload and download speeds from an upgrade to DOCSIS, the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification. A Cox webpage that was updated on April 30 says that the gigabit plan's upload speeds are now \"10Mbps in limited areas to support consistent service across customers during periods of sustained increased Internet usage.\" The now-repealed net neutrality rules likely wouldn't have prevented this kind of data slowdown, as the slowdown would presumably fall under an exception for \"reasonable network management.\" But the Obama-era system in which ISPs were regulated as common carriers gave more rights to consumers to complain about unreasonable rates and practices, perhaps giving extra impetus to ISPs to upgrade their networks instead of limiting their users. Cox is a private company and thus doesn't report network-upgrade spending publicly, but major ISPs such as Comcast, AT&T, and Charter have reduced network spending since the FCC repealed its net neutrality rules and common-carrier regulation. (Update: Harold Feld, senior VP of consumer-advocacy group Public Knowledge, says that \"Cox's going after unspecified 'excess uploaders' would probably have violated the enhanced disclosure rules under the 2015 net neutrality order.\") Cox told Ars that it \"will continue to work with anyone who is violating our Acceptable Use Policy with excessive use to help ensure everyone can have a positive Internet experience.\" Cox says network “performing very well” Cox told Ars its \"network is performing very well overall\" during the pandemic, and that out of 28,000 neighborhood nodes across the US, 98 to 99 percent \"are performing with adequate capacity even with the tremendous level of increased peak usage.\" If Cox's 5.2 million paying broadband customers are spread equally across nodes, each node would serve about 185 households. Cox said that it always \"keep[s] a close eye at the individual node level to make sure we don't approach any congestion thresholds and need to make any adjustments. Similar to our normal process, if we see the network reach or exceed utilization thresholds we will accelerate network upgrade plans in the impacted areas. This could include splitting nodes, pulling additional fiber, equipment swaps and/or core network changes, all of which add capacity to the area.\" But those measures apparently aren't enough to handle users like Mike, Cox said: In some instances a number of excessive users, like the customer you referenced, are causing congestion problems in a small number of neighborhoods by utilizing over 100-200 times more upstream bandwidth than the average household. This type of excessive usage is negatively impacting the service of other customers, which is a violation of our Acceptable Use Policy. It is not our desire to terminate anyone's service, but we may need to address excessive usage out of fairness to the rest of our customers, especially during this time when households are even more dependent on a good Internet experience... In the case of the customer you mentioned, we have communicated with him about our concerns and it appears he has made adjustments to his usage to operate within our Acceptable Use Policy. Mike confirmed to Ars that he has lowered his use by limiting overnight upload speeds to 400kbps, \"so that it is always throttled.\" His usage in the 2.5 weeks since May 22 is 2.1TB, putting him well below his usual monthly pace. Pandemic spurs extra broadband use Broadband networks have mostly held up well during the pandemic. Cable-lobby group NCTA, which represents Cox and other cable companies, says that \"networks are engineered to provide superior performance throughout the day\" and that \"provider-backbone networks have significant capacity and show no signs of congestion.\" Since March 1, NCTA says that peak upstream traffic has risen 26.2 percent and peak download traffic has risen 9.1 percent. Cox told us that \"a small percentage of nodes... were approaching congestion levels prior to\" the pandemic, and that \"the dramatically increased use in those neighborhoods has pushed [them] beyond the threshold where performance will be impacted. These speed adjustments are temporary while we try to keep as many people as possible connected during the crisis.\" Mike said he suspects Cox is limiting upload speeds \"because their network can't handle the increase of residential live video conference streaming\" that has happened during the pandemic. Recently, Mike said he has been seeing upload speeds of only 4Mbps to 5Mbps. Coming soon: A price increase Mike's bill is currently lower than usual because Cox, like other ISPs, is providing unlimited data to all customers during the pandemic. The waiver of the $50 monthly unlimited-data charge temporarily knocked his bill down to $100, and Cox provided a further $20 discount on his latest bill. Mike's bill doesn't explain the reason for the $20 credit, but it could be because of the new upload data limit. But Cox is already signaling that Mike is in for a price increase in the near future. Today, Mike told Ars that \"I just got an alert after logging in that my one-year introduction rate is now over, so I'll be paying $175 a month for 'unlimited' data once the current data-overage exceptions expire. Yay.\" This article was updated after publication with additional responses from Cox.

Anything less is deceptive advertising. For a gigabit connection, that would mean around 300TB per month. reply ReverseCold 18 hours agoparentI don’t know why they don’t advertise their oversubscription rate. The FCC should probably require this to be disclosed in some standard location. So many people are mad because “I paid for a gigabit and I can’t use the whole thing”… but like you didn’t pay for a gigabit you paid for a gigabit shared among 100 other people, which means peak-of-sums you should usually get gigabit, but it’s not guaranteed. The internet is a series of tubes! You can get a dedicated gigabit sized tube but it’ll cost 1-2 orders of magnitude more. E: Even elsewhere on this thread people are like > I dunno, I pay $70 a month for gigabit from Google Fiber and absolutely saturate that thing all day long up and down. Yes! You are the noisy neighbor getting lucky that your neighbors aren’t also noisy! reply ahnick 17 hours agorootparentIt's pretty obvious isn't it? They don't want anyone to understand how the system really works. They should not be allowed to put the words \"Unlimited\" anywhere in their advertisement. period. It's all deceptive advertising and they should be raked over the coals for it. If it's shared then say \"Shared gigabit internet for only X dollars!\" I guess the reason they don't do that is because a lot of people would choose competitor services if they were honest. Cable companies are soul sucking monopolies/duopolies and deserve no quarter. reply Sophira 12 hours agorootparentThat reminds me of the way JCPenney had a thing where they would do no promotional pricing in a bid to be honest with the consumer about the actual price of their products... and it backfired massively. People assumed that because they didn't have any sales that they weren't the cheapest prices. In the end, people go for what they perceive to be the cheapest prices, not necessarily the prices that actually are the cheapest. reply nyjah 16 hours agorootparentprevI guess the reason they don't do that is because a lot of people would choose competitor services if they were honest Competitor services? Starlink aside, I have no options but what I have. I think many people at least in USA are in similar situation. reply SkiFire13 12 hours agorootparentprev> If it's shared then say \"Shared gigabit internet for only X dollars!\" I guess the reason they don't do that is because a lot of people would choose competitor services if they were honest. I don't think any competitor will give you a dedicated gigabit to you for a reasonable price, especially if everyone suddently starts asking for one. reply no_wizard 12 hours agorootparentI have Ziply Fiber in Oregon. I pay for a Symmetrical gigabit connection, it’s 60 dollars a month. I record speed tests multiple times a day every day and have ever since I got the service last year. They’re growing gang busters too, my entire neighborhood is on Ziply (90% of household converted from what I understand) Aside from them adjusting some things due to the rapid unexpected uptake, I have gotten full connection speeds for upload and download every day for over a year. Its been uptime of 99.999% (the adjustment period happened over 2 days and they only slowed service to 300/300 temporarily) It can be done. It won’t be done by Comcast et. al. reply SkiFire13 10 hours agorootparentThis doesn't prove anything, it just means that when you're doing a speedtest there aren't other users that are also saturating the connection. Note that this doesn't means that there are exactly 0 users downloading in those moments. Usually there are multiple gigabits dedicated to a group of users, so that multiple users can navigate at 1Gbps without slowing down others, but not all the group at once. How much bandwidth is allocated to how many users can vary though, and some providers might allocate less total bandwidth to more users. In practice this works out fine most of the time and most users won't notice slowdowns like you do, but if everyone started a speedtest at the same time you will notice it. reply daeros 10 hours agorootparentprevi'm in oregon and those assholes won't provide fiber to the home to my neighborhood on the far western edge of the metro area out near forest grove. reply trilbyglens 12 hours agorootparentprevThem none should be allowed to advertise as such reply internet101010 15 hours agorootparentprevThere usually are no competitors. reply brewdad 15 hours agorootparentMost people should have at least two choices. Their cable company and their phone company. These choices may be comparable in price and service level or wildly divergent depending on your specific location however. reply kelnos 12 hours agorootparentI live in San Francisco, and Comcast's DOCSIS 3.1 offering (~1Gbps down / 25Gbps up) is my only useful option. AT&T offers DSL, and MonkeyBrains will give me a microwave link (more or less symmetric, but probably would top out at around 100Mbps), but that's it, aside from the LTE/5G providers. I live one block away from one of the main fiber trunks in the city, but I was quoted (both by Comcast and AT&T) that it would be $20k-$30k to run that fiber to my building. Unfortunately I think my experience is pretty common in the US, though sure, there are plenty of people who can choose between e.g. cable and fiber. reply saagarjha 11 hours agorootparentI'm sorry 25 Gbps up? reply daeros 10 hours agorootparentprevThey won't even let me pay them the 20k-30k even after I made it clear that it might take me awhile to save it up, but I could feasibly do it. reply dehrmann 12 hours agorootparentprevThere's a difference between a data center connection and a home connection. For 99% of home users, moderately oversubscribed gigabit is perfectly fine, and no one would pay the premium (and it's a big premium) for more. Once 1 GB downloads are slow or the connection can't handle 5 HD streams, it's getting into false advertising territory. reply userbinator 17 hours agorootparentprevThere's two (interrelated) values here --- speed (\"flow rate\") and volume. \"Unlimited data\" refers to volume. Gigabit refers to speed. This customer presumably isn't too worried about the speed, but is rightly under the impression that he isn't being charged on volume and can thus use as much as the speed allows. reply vlz 11 hours agorootparentOk, but you cannot truthfully advertise unlimited volume if you put a limit on the speed which is in turn also limiting the volume. reply SAI_Peregrinus 16 hours agorootparentprevWhen it first started back in the Before Times, \"Unlimited\" internet was in contrast to dial-up connections which weren't always on. It's unlimited in time (as long as you're subscribed), not necessarily guaranteed to keep the max speed for the entire time. That contrast is now gone, so it's become deceptive IMO. reply lostlogin 16 hours agorootparentThat isn’t my recollection. We had dial up which had a data use cap. We had to stay under the cap or got stung. Later on ‘unlimited’ dial up became a thing. reply willcipriano 16 hours agorootparentNetZero and AOL both advertised as unlimited.

I don't think I even had 18GB of disk space back then. reply lostlogin 2 hours agorootparentMy dad bought a 600mb disk at vast expense. What did your dad have? reply pixelatedindex 15 hours agorootparentprevThat was a ton back then! I suppose 300TB/month is a lot too but it doesn’t feel that big anymore reply plussed_reader 13 hours agorootparentprevFor as long as you'd pay the phone bill plus isp sub. reply zie 15 hours agorootparentprevWhen I ran an ISP or two back in the dialup days, we advertised unlimited, but we didn't mean anything with that word, it was just what every other ISP also used in their marketing, we were just following along. The same is true today with Cellphones and ISP's, they ALL offer \"unlimited\", but they all have different interpretations of that word. As far as I can tell, none of the employees understand what \"unlimited\" means either. Technically what we offered was shared dialup access to a T1 or a T3 upstream. They just looked for the word \"unlimited\". Customers didn't know what it meant either, except it was \"better\". If you were doing anything we thought of as \"abusive\" we would hang up on you. You could immediately call back in, and we were fine with that. Normally after the 2nd or 3rd time we caught you being \"abusive\", we would call you and have a chat: try to figure out what the heck you were doing and why. Most of the time we would just run their data on one of our machines and save the dialup space. They could telnet in and do what they needed doing on occasion. Dialup lines were expensive compared to process space. Of course we were also one of the few weirdos that had a \"community\" linux box with the root password in the login banner, so everyone could create their own account and help maintain the community box. It worked really well for several years, until some meanies found it and ruined it. After that we put the root password in /etc/motd, so every logged in user could do root things if needed. That also worked really well for many years. Different times for sure! reply throwup238 17 hours agorootparentprevIf that’s the case they should market the plan’s throttling upfront. “Unlimited mobile data” comes with very clear fine print that isn’t buried in the TOS about how many gigabytes the customer gets before it drops them to 3g speed. reply userbinator 16 hours agorootparentI believe in those cases even after you pass the throttling limit you can continue to transfer data at however much 3g speeds will get you for the rest of the billing period, and thus they won't cut off your service for using \"too much\". reply MichaelZuo 13 hours agorootparent3G speeds can technically mean as low as 256kbps so it would in fact be literally unlimited since it’s not that much data total even running 24/7. reply wmf 17 hours agorootparentprevOversubscription ratios vary from neighborhood to neighborhood. Perhaps ISPs could advertise the worst case but that would make their service look worse than it is. And of course no ISP will be the first to disclose. BTW the FCC recently introduced \"nutrition labels\" for ISPs. https://www.fcc.gov/broadbandlabels reply presentation 17 hours agorootparentThat’s why I think this has to come through rules and regs - any individual company can be honest, but it would probably come at the cost of dishonest competitors winning customers. reply mattnewton 16 hours agorootparentIt has to be regulated because in most of the US ISPs have a de-facto monopoly on the infrastructure; the market has failed to produce more competitors with permits to dig and place fiber for a bunch of reasons. reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparentprev> So many people are mad because “I paid for a gigabit and I can’t use the whole thing”… but like you didn’t pay for a gigabit you paid for a gigabit shared among 100 other people, which means peak-of-sums you should usually get gigabit, but it’s not guaranteed. But that's something different than what Cox is doing. \"Unlimited\" and over-subscription aren't incompatible. You have a gigabit connection, the 40Gbps uplink is shared between 1000 other people who each have a gigabit connection, the over-subscription rate is 25:1. That's fine as long as the average usage during peak hours is 4% -- which it might very well be. A 4k Netflix stream is 25Mbps, which is 2.5% of a gigabit connection, so you're not above that even if everybody is streaming in 4k at once. You're even fine if everybody is streaming in 4k at once and then on top of that 15 people want to fully max out their connections. And everybody using their connections at once doesn't really happen. At any given time a lot of people will be using zero. Now, there will be times that are outliers. Maybe a popular video game drops without staggering the release and suddenly 30% of the customers are maxing out their connections at once to download an update and the average speed drops from 1000Mbps to 100Mbps for a couple hours. That's why it says \"up to\", right? That isn't artificially limiting anyone, that's just everyone getting their pro rata share in a time of atypical demand. But on a typical day with an adequately provisioned network you should be able to get the speed on the label, and there is still no reason to be limiting anyone's speeds during times the network isn't over capacity. The issue is they don't want to over-subscribe their network at only the ratio that would allow them to provide the rated speed on a typical day, they want to promise more than they can deliver and deflect blame onto people who are only using what they were promised. reply bobdvb 4 hours agorootparentThat's true, although the reality is that the capacity is much more limited in many providers local infrastructure than you'd like to think. Those 1000 users will only get 10G at best, and remember that both in Cable and FTTH the spectrum allocation on the local segment is asymmetric. You have a finite downlink capacity and a finite uplink capacity, users are not just competing for the same time on the wire, they're competing for spectrum. If everyone was on Ethernet to the home then you'd be right, but FTTH and Cable are in physically contended spectrum in the cabinet/cable itself. Proper fibre ethernet costs more per user than FTTH/Cable because each user needs a port on a switch, instead of using TDMA and everyone being on the same wire at the other end. reply maxerickson 2 hours agorootparentThere's not really any real tension between \"you should know their stated rates are bullshit\" and \"they should accurately describe the service they are willing and able to provide\". One is a stupid way to run a society and the other isn't. reply sqeaky 15 hours agorootparentprevI have paid for two gigabit connections and I sometimes saturate them for days at time. Doesn't cost that much. If I am not to use it like that then it should say clearly on the paperwork that I have data limits, and I don't have any such notifications. reply nixosbestos 17 hours agorootparentprevEdit: removing an apparently quite inaccurate comment.

Sure they could ensure that 48 port switch you're connected to has no contention, but non-blocking networks aren't cheap, and are needed in the vast majority of cases. reply namibj 10 hours agorootparentThat said, the classic case of game release can be handled with a bit of P2P if the oversubscription happens late enough to have sufficiently many downloads that can share among themselves without causing congestion for others. Just traffic shape that protocol/connection to only use a connection free share of upstream if upstream is currently close to dropping packets, and work a bit with others to get swarms to prioritize downloading from nodes close in IPv6 address space. reply jpambrun 6 hours agorootparentprevBecause it's none of our business as customers. This oversubscription rate is a risk they calibrate on their side. Given the marketing material, if all customers decide to use more bandwidth, it up to the utility to upgrade their infra to match in a timely manner. This is the risk they took and competed on. reply godelski 16 hours agorootparentprev> I don’t know why they don’t advertise their oversubscription rate. They typically advertise as \"up to\" and often hide data limits in small text. This is also common among phone carriers who say \"unlimited data\" or worse, \"unlimited 5G\" but then throttle you after you hit a certain data limit. I'm not saying this to justify their actions. I actually think this is worse because it demonstrates clear intention to mislead. But it's something to be aware of because they will argue (and frequently some smug person that I guess has a boot fetish) and then blame you for not reading. But I strongly disagree. Words mean things, and they mean what a reasonable person would interrupt. You can't just hide stuff in legal language. No person has enough time to read all those TOS agreements and even if they did, it's not in normal language that's understandable by the average person. If a contact is fair only if participants are informed and consenting, then I don't think most of these contacts should hold up (they do). But hey, we live in a world where courts have decided that \"boneless wings\" doing clearly mean \"without bones\". But I for one don't want to live in a country where that's okay. There's a lot of smoke and mirrors with the legal system and I for one don't think enough people are upset. Apathy isn't working. reply verisimi 14 hours agorootparent> Words mean things, and they mean what a reasonable person would interrupt. Interpret. Words mean things, you know. reply godelski 10 hours agorootparentAutocorrect. But surprisingly you can still understand because the context. Language is crazy like that.

Apples and oranges. HE only has to run relatively short cables within a datacenter, which is designed for running those things, while residential fiber has to be run much further through much more hostile terrain.

They started charging me overage fees. I called them up and asked them to explain why they were charging me overage fees on an unlimited bandwidth account. Their explanation was that the bandwidth was unlimited in when I could use it, not in how much I could use. Fortunately for me, there were other providers in the market that I could switch to. So I did. reply kstrauser 17 hours agoparentprevPut another way, if they're saying 12TB is their unadvertised effective data cap, he's only allowed to use his connection for 1 day a month. My ISP lets me use the service all of the days of the month, not just one. His ludicrously low limit is unfathomable. reply kristopolous 17 hours agoparentprevA number of years ago one of the isps, might have been att dsl, argued that \"unlimited\" was a branding name for a tier. They had meant an affectation of limitless possibilities as a marketing term similar to \"plus\", \"extreme\" or \"pro\" and not that there was no cap on the data. I always ignore that word now and look for the actual terms reply thunky 6 hours agoparentprev\"Unlimited data\" means that you can use as much as you want/can without being charged more based on usage. Otherwise there would be a cap and you are charged extra when you go over it. It has nothing to do with speed/bandwidth. Just like \"unlimited text\" plans don't charge per text message. But there is still a physical limit for how many texts you can send. reply mindslight 17 hours agoparentprevHear hear! Furthermore any plans with \"caps\" should have to list the average bandwidth as the largest headline, with the peak bandwidth relegated to a subpoint. For example 1TB/month is 386 kB/sec. That's on par with a DSL connection, not 2024 broadband. reply tzs 16 hours agorootparentThat would mislead and confuse a lot of consumers. It would suggest that a 5 Mb/s DSL connection with no data limit would be better than a 500 Mb/s cable connection with a 1 TB data limit, when in fact something like 90% of users will not come anywhere near 1 TB of data/month and will be much much much happier on the cable plan. reply userbinator 15 hours agorootparentIt would suggest that a 5 Mb/s DSL connection with no data limit That turns out to be a ~1.6TB/month limit. Hence why I think both speed and volume limits should be advertised prominently. \"Up to 5Mbps (1.6TB/month)\" or \"Up to 500Mbps (or 1TB/month, whichever comes first)\" gives users a clear idea of what their service is. reply mindslight 4 hours agorootparentprevIt works fine over in the cell phone market, where carriers market themselves in terms of HSPA/4G/LTE/5G while plans are sold in terms of data used. Rough instantaneous bandwidth (and latency!) is fine for knowing what applications will work. 300Mb/s vs 500Mb/s isn't going to make much of a difference for most, and certainly not more than ISPs necessarily massage the numbers when talking about shared mediums like docsis/gpon. The point I am making is that if fixed carriers seemingly no longer want to be selling connections by last-mile bandwidth (with implied statistical oversubscription and a fall-back to best effort), and instead want to move to selling specific amounts of data delivered, then their big-print marketing should have to reflect that! Or alternatively, if they want to stick with selling the instantaneous last mile connection speed, then data quotas should have to raise along with that according to a standard benchmark consumer usage - say 2 hours of nameplate usage per day, meaning a 300Mb/s connection would be ~6TB/month. And then additional data usage should cost the same (or lower) as the monthly plan - for example $120/month for that 6TB/month plan is $20/TB, so 1TB of additional data should cost no more than $20 rather than the current punitive or even unobtainable pricing. Also I'd guess your 90%/1TB figure is quite out of date, which gets to the heart of the problem here - these limits have remained arbitrary and opaque rather than being expressed in the market. It gets even more rotten when talking about national policy where these ISPs have been able to claim they're providing modern \"broadband\" while their backhaul networks have been seemingly frozen in time for a decade+. Although, a disclaimer: I only read these threads to gawk at the train wreck and check if the Internet access market is really still this bad. I've got municipal gpon at 1Gb/s symmetric, no caps (I've asked multiple times), with a fixed price every month. Which really just underscores the absurdity of talking about this topic in a negative-sum parceling out of bits and bytes, which mostly stems from Ma Coax wanting to continue milking their captive markets on aging infrastructure. reply exabrial 12 hours agoparentprevSo call it 300tb/month, not unlimited, and quit lying? reply datahack 15 hours agoparentprevHow is this nonsense still legal?

Then the cherry on top was they wouldn't even put me back on my old plan because it \"wasn't offered any more\". So they tried to charge me an extra $15/month for half the speed I was getting before. I switched to a local wireless ISP that ended up being even more expensive for even slower service -- but at least they weren't liars and when I had a problem I could talk directly with the owner if it wasn't sorted (and no data caps). reply idatum 17 hours agoparentI can't but think this is the business practice of a dying technology, yet another example.

While I have not yet run into any caps with my gigabit plan I am painfully aware of how limited the so called \"unlimited\" gigabit plan is. During COVID it was particularly egregious. I was paying about what Mike was paying except from the hours of 11am to around 9pm my download would be capped at 10Mbps or so and my upload halved from whatever it is to around 2Mbps. Cox didn't have the common courtesy to tell anyone that they were QoSing entire city blocks because their \"infrastructure couldn't handle it\". I only learned this by isolating the network and running my own tests. After what felt like 30 escalations with their tech support and a large portion of my night they all but confirmed they were doing this to handle the \"streaming services\". I work from home - this was a major problem. Despite this I was simply upsold yet another super-duper plan rather than given anything I could work with. I get regular outages with them and run my own tests on the coax. Despite having noise levels that are pretty good for the most part their service still doesn't work right all the time. Despite my insistence calling a tech out their labyrinthine tech support tree all but prevents you from talking to anyone but a moron with a flowchart where all roads lead to \"reset the modem\" or \"upsell hardware\" and a hands free phone. I used to run my own modem as I prefer to control my hardware. When I upgraded to gigabit years ago I was forced to lease a modem from them as prior to this they refused to service my house with third party hardware installed. All problems were always blamed on my modem, or my router, or anything they could point to that wasn't them. Dealing with their technical support or on-call techs was worse than pulling teeth. It was like performing dental surgery with a sledgehammer. I won't get into what it was like cancelling my cable TV. Yet another mess made more complicated by the same situation. At least it was easy to drop off the set-top boxes at the local store. I hate the amount of control ISPs have over us with the last-mile laws. Companies like Cox can more-or-less do whatever they want in my town because they're the biggest players with the most pipes. The result is as expected - terrible service, fine print bear traps, and high cost. reply saxonww 18 hours agoparentI'm in the same city as Mike and have been a Cox customer for 15+ years. While I have had problems, for the most part I've been satisfied. I've not historically been a top-speed-tier customer though. They are running some kind of promotion right now where they've moved me from 500Mbps to 1Gbps for 12 months at no charge, and it's the first time where I've not gotten really anywhere close to the advertised speed (not even 500, now). I'm not sure what this accomplishes for them; maybe they'll cut speeds in half next year and try to suggest I just got accustomed to faster speeds. Support is challenging when you need it. You usually have to talk to multiple people before your problem is resolved. For example, last time I got a new modem I had to be handed off twice before I got to a level where they could 'reset my registration,' and I definitely got the figurative stink eye over the phone for not renting their modem (which, is probably why it didn't \"just work\"). They usually try to sell you something like wiring insurance as well, and really like to emphasize the potential cost to you if they feel like they have to roll a truck. Fortunately, I've only had perhaps 3 support engagements (1 truck) in that 15+ years. Otherwise I'd be a lot less satisfied. I'm hopeful that the various fiber providers 'coming soon to my area' will help with this. AT&T is here but not cheaper - they force you to rent their equipment - and I don't want to be an AT&T customer. At the very least it might stop Cox from raising rates $3-$6 a year. reply hi-v-rocknroll 17 hours agoprevI get 250 Mbps download and 2 Mbps upload on Spectrum (Charter Communications) in semi-rural Texas for $60/month. (I'm itching to switch to GVEC.) Recently, I had Google Fiber 2 Gbps symmetric with an option for 5 and 8 Gbps with a trial for 20 Gbps. reply walrus01 19 hours agoprevThe root cause of the problem is that copper coaxial cable tv based (DOCSIS3.0, DOCSIS3.1, etc) last mile internet infrastructure is a shared/contended access medium for many modems connected to it. It's built on a limited number of RF channels in a certain segment that have many modems all going to a single \"port\" on a DOCSIS CMTS (cablemodem termination system). There is a great deal of absurdity in their claims to be selling a gigabit service product using coax-based technology, when the oversubscription ratio is INSANE. If you had more than a few customers on a segment trying to actually make use of gigabit speeds at one time (just 2 or 3 people downloading a torrent of a popular linux ISO at 980 Mbps will eat a huge amount of the total aggregate capacity of that coax segment). Cox and Comcast and RCN and similar operators are squeezing every last dollar possible for the ROI out of legacy copper coaxial last mile stuff. Only in places where the local phone company or another operator is building proper FTTH (GPON/XGSPON) are they starting to overbuild their own network with their own FTTH. Comcast is doing it in the Seattle area, for instance, in areas where the local telco (Ziply or Centurylink) offers a symmetric 1 Gbps product based on single strand FTTH/GPON. Your average coaxial cable tv last mile operator like Cox is a telecom industry dinosaur. The article here was published in early 2020 during peak covid19 lockdown but the general technology problem of copper/coaxial last mile stuff from 25+ years ago is exactly the same today. reply zamadatix 18 hours agoparentThe FTTH offerings from Ziply, Cox, Comcast, Google, ATT, Centurylink etc are all the same \"shared media with high oversubscription\" design too. Among them the typical ratio is ~32 PON users for the given \"base rate\" PON standard, similar to a typical ~20-50 for coax at a given DOCSIS standard. Both have better/worse examples (particularly early gigabit PON deployments were 64) but FTTH has rarely been about getting dedicated bandwidth up to the neighborhood box... honestly most of the time the lion's share of the benefits are \"it's a sign your area just got upgraded cabling and equipment for the first time in many many years\" than anything to do with the physicalities of the wire. For GPON that's 2.5 Gbps for downstream and 1.25 Gbps for upstream. So with a 32 split it's the same story of 2-3 people downloading a popular Linux ISO at 980 Mbps still eat up the entire fiber line for all 32 people. The difference on the fiber, outside the better upload symmetry we already see, is it will be able to scale a lot more in the future. Some places already have 10G PON (which, unlike GPON, is usually actually said speed) such as where ATT offers 2G and 5G symmetric service. The next step will be 25G PON (again, about the actual nominal speed). reply wincy 18 hours agorootparentAn actual Google PM called me up the other day trying to upsell me to $200 a month 20 gigabit. Said they’d give me a router but I’m free to hook whatever I want to the fiber, saturate it as much as I want, no worries. They must have a lot of extra bandwidth if this is a service they’re offering in my neighborhood. reply matrix_overload 13 hours agorootparentGoogle is sadly known for doing cool proof-of-concept stuff with no regard for profitability, and then axing it when the hype is over. reply cavisne 18 hours agorootparentprevIm not sure Google is GPON (or has passive splitters at all). They were very early to deployments, and their plans are always symmetrical (which doesnt make sense for any standard *PON deployment). reply wmf 17 hours agorootparentIt is PON. When the underlying network is 2.4 down, 1.2 up you can offer 1/1 plans (with some degree of prayer). reply walrus01 17 hours agorootparentprev> The FTTH offerings from Ziply, Cox, Comcast, Google, ATT, Centurylink etc are all the same \"shared media with high oversubscription\" design too. No, they're really not, you can't compare single strand FTTH XGSPON on singlemode fiber (16:1 or 32:1 contention ratio), something that is built on 10G XGSPON tech, to something that is built on bonded RF channels on coax copper. The aggregate capacity per oversubscribed network segment is radically different. Now, all of these cable operators also ARE building actual FTTH networks in certain areas because they see the writing on the wall for the longevity of how much more they can squeeze out of the copper. So in some very specific places the Comcast 1 Gbps last mile product is functionally equivalent to the local Verizon, or Ziply, or Lumen (Centurylink, now branded as Quantum Fiber) FTTH product. reply condiment 18 hours agoparentprevThis reads as though the cable companies aren’t aware of the limitations of their tech and that couldn’t be farther from the truth. The last mile isn’t the same as today. Docsis technology continues to improve, more RF channels are being allocated to high speed internet, and cable companies are wholesale replacing their CMTS infrastructure with higher frequency (read: more channels) equipment. The truth is that only some cable companies make these investments - you can look up “fiber node size” for respective performance across different companies. A fiber node being the place where optical is terminated and switched to coax. These have been getting smaller everywhere, but it only makes sense to invest there when the upstream infrastructure can support it. So from a consumer perspective, your “Linux isos” will be slow to download in any case until the upstream network is upgraded and your node is split to offer higher performance. reply walrus01 16 hours agorootparent> This reads as though the cable companies aren’t aware of the limitations of their tech and that couldn’t be farther from the truth. I know, and you know, that the people doing the more serious engineering for DOCSIS based cable last mile segments are well aware of the limitations of the tech. What I was saying is that they are milking every last dollar of ROI out of the existing physical plant because overbuilding your entire network with XGSPON (it would be dumb to do 2.5G PON in 2024/2025) is a very capital intensive endeavour. The shareholder value and profits of the company are increased in the short term by continuing to do copper as long as possible, even at the cost of thousands of unhappy customers dragging your company's name into the mud. It's the fundamental business model problem, and executives at big dinosaur coax operator telecoms that have made the decision to do it this way as long as possible, until the coax/oversubcription situation becomes completely untenable in an area, or until a real XGSPON operator (maybe Lumen, or Ziply, or similar) which overlaps with your historical cable tv network rolls out a better product and you have no choice but to spend the money to keep up with the local competition. You and I also know that no matter how much they mess about with DOCSIS3.1 and channel sizes and different RF configurations, the aggregate capacity of a few strands of fiber (using even the lowest cost and most rudimentary WDM) is much greater than RF over coax. Squeezing 2048/4096QAM RF stuff into coax is polishing the brass doorknobs on the titanic. It's not a viable long term solution! reply wmf 19 hours agoparentprevCable is definitely shared but CMTSes added bandwidth management features years ago. Cox could just slow down the \"hogs\" but they're too lazy/incompetent or they're using really old equipment. reply fat_cantor 16 hours agoprevA year ago, I had fast Cox internet for $70 per month. I moved a mile away, and Cox wanted at least $233 for any connection at any speed because AT&T was not a competitor in that neighborhood. I said no and relied on 5G until AT&T moved in a few months later with the $70 market rate. When business people take control of companies from engineers, we get enshittification. Cox has somehow managed to make me nostalgic for the enshittification phase, which has morphed into this logjammin phase where no one even pretends to be competent enough to fix the cable. reply kkfx 9 hours agoprevFormal complaint for false advertisement and contractual breach, nothing strange. reply qwertyuiop_ 18 hours agoprevMeanwhile billions and lofty promises don’t translate to benefits for real people. https://www.atr.org/senators-demand-bead-program-accountabil... https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases... https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/kamala-harris-announces-plan-... reply JohnMakin 19 hours agoprevman, as much as I hate spectrum, I will say, as much as I want to pay them for bandwidth and speed they’ll give me what I want, and sometimes even more.

    "originLink": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/159-employees-are-leaving-automattic-as-ceos-fight-with-wp-engine-escalates/",
    "originBody": "Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg said on Thursday that 159 employees (roughly 8.4% of staff) accepted a severance package that the company had offered to those who disagreed with his direction of WordPress and his handling of the tussle with web hosting provider WP Engine. In a blog post, Mullenweg said the package offered $30,000 or six months of salary, whichever is higher, but the employees who took it would not be eligible to be re-hired by Automattic. Nearly 80% of people who took the offer worked in the company’s Ecosystem / WordPress division, and the rest were in Automattic’s Cosmos businesses, consisting of apps like Pocket Casts, Day One, Tumblr and Cloudup. Mullenweg, who co-created WordPress and is arguably the face of the open-source project, tried to put a positive spin on the announcement, writing that the company “decided to design the most generous buy-out package possible, we called it an Alignment Offer.” “HR added some extra details to sweeten the deal; we wanted to make it as enticing as possible,” he wrote, and later on added: “159 people took the offer, 8.4% of the company, the other 91.6% gave up $126M of potential severance to stay!” “It was an emotional roller coaster of a week. The day you hire someone, you aren’t expecting them to resign or be fired; you’re hoping for a long and mutually beneficial relationship. Every resignation stings a bit,” Mullenweg wrote. Some employees who left the company include the head of WordPress.com (Automattic’s commercial WordPress hosting arm), Daniel Bachhuber, head of programs and contributor experience Naoko Takano, the Principal architect for AI, Daniel Walmsley. Mullenweg and Automattic have been in a skirmish with WP Engine for almost two weeks now, in which the CEO has called WP Engine a “cancer to WordPress,” accusing it of wrongfully using the WordPress and WooCommerce trademarks, and banning the company from accessing the open-source WordPress.org resources. Both WP Engine and Automattic have sent each other cease-and-desist letters. And WP Engine earlier on Thursday filed a lawsuit against Automattic and Mullenweg, accusing the company and its CEO of “abuse of power,” extortion, and saying the WordPress co-creator has conflicts of interest in handling WordPress as an open-source project. Automattic has so far called all of WP Engine’s claims meritless. “I stayed up last night reading WP Engine’s Complaint, trying to find any merit anywhere to it. The whole thing is meritless, and we look forward to the federal court’s consideration of their lawsuit,” the company’s legal representative, Neal Katyal, said in a blog post. Over the last few days, several people on X have hinted about a severance offer being circulated among Automattic employees. Mullenweg also allegedly DM’d a former employee who posted about the offer and accused her of attacking the company and him. Today, some Automattic employees who opted to keep their jobs posted messages in support of the company and Mullenweg.

Website developers, plugin makers, theme designers, etc. Everyone is using the Wordpress trademark to promote their service and the plugins library to keep their services updated. If that's the legal precedent being used now, Automattic winning the lawsuit implies that nearly the entire community loses it's legal right to exist. reply Manuel_D 2 hours agoparentIt's unclear if WP Engine is actually violating any copyright or trademark: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/automattic-deman... > WP Engine's lawsuit points to promises made by Mullenweg and Automattic nearly 15 years ago. \"In 2010, in response to mounting public concern, the WordPress source code and trademarks were placed into the nonprofit WordPress Foundation (which Mullenweg created), with Mullenweg and Automattic making sweeping promises of open access for all,\" the lawsuit said. > Mullenweg wrote at the time that \"Automattic has transferred the WordPress trademark to the WordPress Foundation, the nonprofit dedicated to promoting and ensuring access to WordPress and related open source projects in perpetuity. This means that the most central piece of WordPress's identity, its name, is now fully independent from any company.\" This sure sounds like Automattic made WordPress - both it's technology and the trademark - free to use. Apparently Automattic basically lied about making WordPress open: > WP Engine alleges that Automattic and Mullenweg did not disclose \"that while they were publicly touting their purported good deed of moving this intellectual property away from a private company, and into the safe hands of a nonprofit, Defendants in fact had quietly transferred irrevocable, exclusive, royalty-free rights in the WordPress trademarks right back to Automattic that very same day in 2010. This meant that far from being 'independent of any company' as Defendants had promised, control over the WordPress trademarks effectively never left Automattic's hands.\" It's possible that Automattic's trademark claims are not valid. Trademark claims become weaker if companies don't actively defend the use of their trademark. Even if the secret revocation of its permission to use the WordPress trademark is real, the fact that they've ignored 15 years of WP Engine's use of the trademark really weakens their case. reply ubermonkey 4 hours agoparentprevI mean, nothing.

Wordpress can be entrenching software but I have also found that a lot of the plugin heavy sites are just using plugins/customizations for trivial things you could easily eclipse. Migrating off of it is easier done than said in that case. We will be leaving WP Engine and Wordpress behind after we spend 2 months rebuilding on sensible software on a sensible host (WP engine is also terrible) this Q4.

Congrats to these employees on fleeing what appears to be tyranny for the Automattic employees and the customers. Good riddance Wordpress. reply keiferski 3 hours agoparentProbably not too many. The average WordPress site is run by a small business that doesn’t care the slightest bit about tech industry drama, or what open source even means. reply Topgamer7 3 hours agorootparentI think these days, the average WordPress site runner is trying to find a cheap/free. Non-technical solution. I help out with a sports league who run a couple wordpress sites. - One, its totally the wrong CMS for how they use it. - Two, they have almost no ability to diagnose and debug issues themselves. Honestly 80% of the issues that get raised to me are even just solved by clicking \"keep plugin automatically updated\" They really just want a CMS that allows them to share announcements, post schedules and where to show up to play. But it gets the job done, for cheap, and there is a decent community on plugins and themes. Wordpress was originally popular because of its openness and community right? I wonder if that's still the platform it is. reply righthand 3 hours agorootparentNo I don’t see it as an open platform with a strong community. Matt has demonstrated he will shut off features for large swaths of sites where is the openness there? The community plugins are loyal to a few popular plugins that all have pay walls if you want to do more than the basics. Any time Wordpress implements a new feature they have to do so it doesn’t completely crush the plugin community. Like site maps for example are trapped behind using a wordpress hook or using a plugin like Yoast to customize them. reply ppseafield 2 hours agorootparentprevI'll second the sibling poster here by saying anything useful you want to do with WordPress will probably have a non-negligible cost, and usually a subscription. WooCommerce for instance requires a subscription to add a minimum quantity to a product! I volunteer for a non-profit that uses it, and it's absolutely insane how many plugins will give you a little for free but charge $5/month or $50/year for just slightly more features. reply withinboredom 1 hour agorootparentAbout a decade ago, there was a huge kerfluffle about making the plugin directory include pricing and payments (like an app store). Matt was hugely against it. I think they did themselves a huge disservice. Pricing is opaque until you install the plugin, often requiring you to go \"off site\" to install the paid version (or it silently uses a different plugin repository). Lastly, there is no quality control or even ensuring that best/ethical practices are being followed. So, you end up with this scummy feeling every time you install a plugin and discover its pricing. reply dgacmu 2 hours agorootparentprevIf you were to guide them today, what would you set them up that's not WP that gives functionality similar to wp+woo?

I was incredibly disappointed in how the plugin ecosystem is dominated by \"freemium\" plugins that don't really seem in the spirit of open source. Even Automattic's own jetpack seems nothing more than a connector to a proprietary SaaS. I still don't understand how the new template system is supposed to work either. Maybe I'd feel different if I was doing this for a company, but I was doing this for free for a charity with near zero budget. The only real competition seems to be ghost though, and it doesn't even have a real plugin system. If you want something simple like a event calendar you need to host it entirely separately. reply righthand 2 hours agorootparent> I still don't understand how the new template system is supposed to work either. Oh gosh I had to use a blog post to even find documentation on it. It’s basically a pile of hidden legos, for a simple table with columns you have to essentially implement it yourself with a few helper methods to help out. Then there’s the new system based on react because they could that has an entirely separate implementation stack. Also for a simple table you end up implementing all the functions and JSX yourself. reply ValentineC 2 hours agorootparentprev> I was incredibly disappointed in how the plugin ecosystem is dominated by \"freemium\" plugins that don't really seem in the spirit of open source. I haven't been doing WordPress for a few years now, but plugin maintenance does take up either money or time. \"Freemium\" is how everyone gets the end customer to contribute something if they want something readily off-the-shelf, considering how low the barrier of entry for plugin installation is. reply doublerabbit 2 hours agorootparentprev> its totally the wrong CMS for how they use it. As the same for most sites hosted with WP. reply righthand 3 hours agorootparentprevThat may be enough, the average Wordpress site probably is subsidized by the larger sites that may leave. I don’t see the amount of employees exiting as a small amount even though it’s not even 20%. reply keiferski 3 hours agorootparentPretty unlikely. In my experience, WordPress is basically the go-to solution for people that need a cheap website and don't want to think about it too much. Especially for non-technical people running a law firm, consultancy, etc. The technical folks that care about recent events most likely left WP years ago. reply righthand 3 hours agorootparentI’m not sure what’s unlikely. Customers leaving? My company is a customer, we’re leaving. Or that most free sites are subsidized by paying customers? Why is that unlikely that seems pretty par for the course for free services. reply keiferski 2 hours agorootparentI'm saying that WordPress is incredibly widespread, far more than I think most tech industry people realize. The average WordPress site builder doesn't know or care who Matt Mullenweg is or what open source means. WordPress is just the simplest way to make a usable website – and has been for the last 20 years, almost. reply righthand 2 hours agorootparentOkay I get that but I’m discussing people that don’t self host or need more than the basics. Those are the users affected by Matt’s action. For example, our site repos only include the site theme we deploy to WP Engine, so our stack is essentially Wordpress, not WP Engine Wordpress. All the WP Engine stuff is handled once deployed invisible to us. So when we log in we expect Wordpress features. Yes there are a lot of Wordpress installs, a lot of them perhaps never even updated. You can claim those as being loyal to Wordpress but if they just set it up and forget it then there’s probably no real loyalty to Automattic. If you have concerns about just setting up a site on a different platform outside of Automattic for whatever reason, why would you trust it any longer? Those people will move on to another just as easy to install cms. Wordpress hasn’t gotten easier to customize in the last x years since your 3.0 install or whatever. Easy to install and forget isn’t a Wordpress exclusive idea. It perhaps has a lot of mind share, but this is the 2nd time Matt has taken drastic action. It’s now at historical precedent levels. reply keiferski 2 hours agorootparentThey don't need to be loyal, they just need to be lazy, lazy enough to not want to learn a new technology and spend money + time switching to it. They won't move on to another CMS, because they don't care about WordPress tech industry drama and they don't know who Matt Mullenweg is. WordPress will continue to work just fine for them and they will continue not caring about an issue that will be forgotten about in a month. The vast, vast majority of people using WordPress think of it as an old, reliable, simple way to make a website, and nothing more. reply righthand 2 hours agorootparentI bet they know someone who cares and all a switch takes is “hey I found this other cms just as easy as wordpress to setup and it’s less confusing to manage”. Yes there will be people who will never switch, but there are also people that do the advising to those people. If you’re not technically inclined you probably have someone you keep around that IS technically inclined, no? reply keiferski 2 hours agorootparentIn my experience, it's more that a small webdev company runs these sites and the client pays $50-200/month to maintain it, maybe do a little SEO, etc. To recreate the site in another CMS will cost hundreds of more dollars, at minimum, (probably thousands, realistically) and even then: what CMS are they switching to that's easier to use and has as wide a variety of plugins as WordPress? Because I'm not sure that CMS exists. So the conclusion is: why switch? WordPress is perfectly fine for these people. reply righthand 1 hour agorootparentOkay you seem pretty cemented in this belief. My belief is that there are plenty of CMSes available. The plugin ecosystem is a side effect of a poorly developed cms, not really a feature. You can abstract a lot of need for plugins by using a CMS that isn’t “just the basics to support a plugin culture”. If you want to lock yourself into wordpress requirements then you’ll never escape it. reply miramba 0 minutes agorootparentWhich CMS would you recommend? keiferski 1 hour agorootparentprevI don't disagree with you that there are alternatives, I'm just saying that this requires a level of knowledge, expertise, and desire that the average WordPress user simply doesn't have.

He wants WP Engine to fork, but then he asks them to pay. He wants Wordpress to grow and be open source, but suddenly he champions branding and restricting trademarks. It's hard to know what his stated end goal in all of this is - maybe he's okay shrinking the Wordpress community so long as they control a bigger slice of it? reply righthand 2 hours agorootparentAnd WP Engine could fork and call it Wordpresss.

Not all remote is built equal. reply ufmace 5 hours agorootparentThis actually makes me really suspicious about Automattic. Companies generally don't refuse to hire outside of certain countries just to be jerks, they do it because complying with international tax obligations while paying employees in dozens of countries is complex and expensive. Given that, and the behavior we've seen from Matt and Automattic so far, what are the odds that they've actually got a bunch of really great international accountants and are doing everything correctly everywhere, versus they're just ignoring all of the tax laws and winging it, and are therefore at high risk of getting smacked down once the relevant authorities get wind of what's going on there? reply rafram 4 hours agorootparentRead up on employers of record: https://www.adp.com/resources/articles-and-insights/articles...

There are much more openings without time zone issues. reply tzs 5 hours agorootparentJurisdiction issues are also probably a big factor. If you have employees in N jurisdictions you potentially have to deal with N different sets of laws and regulations concerning income taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, health insurance, employment contracts, layoffs, maternity/paternity leave, unions, and probably many I've overlooked. Remote employees in the same city? Trivial. Different cities in the same county? Possibly slightly more work. Different counties in the state? Maybe a slight step up in work. Different states in the same country? Could be a big step up in work. Different countries? Likely much more work than for employees in your country. With employees in different states in your own country things will work similarly.

And I noted the team is lead by Rachel Kassabian who was lead counsel for Google which in Perfect 10 v Amazon (originally it was against Google) resulted in thumbnail of copyright images in search results being fair use. Automattic chose Neal Katyal. His latest accomplishment was trying to defend Johnson & Johnson 's dicey \"Texas Two-Step\" and lost while billing $2,465 an hour. A hell lot of money will be spent on this case, that's for sure. reply the_mitsuhiko 8 hours agoparentHere is now Automattic is presenting this for an opposing view: > Neal has been adverse to Quinn Emanuel a number of times, and won every case. reply Aeolun 9 hours agoparentprevLike, I know they bill by value delivered, but would a $500/hour lawyer really be that much worse? reply pjc50 8 hours agorootparentDo you know the phenomenon of \"Tournament wages\"? Very prevalent in sports, it's why Ronaldo is worth a billion dollars. Because the lawyer's work is only valuable if they actually win, it's a very binary payout, and that drives up competition for \"the best\". reply chx 8 hours agorootparentprevMy guess is WPEngine looked at the amount being asked from them (the lawsuit says \"tens of millions of dollars\" based on public posts indeed it seems above thirty million a year), divided it by the hourly rate of the best legal representation they thought they can get and decided it's cheaper. They wanted to take no risks. From the other side, after you are sued by Rachel Kassabian you really have no choice but get the best you can find and they thought a former (Acting) Solicitor General of the United States is it. As they say, that escalated quickly. There's not really a measure to say how much worse an $1000 or $500 per hour lawyer would be but no one is taking chances when you have this much money on the line. reply Aeolun 6 hours agorootparentI mean, presumably you can look at a history of wins in similar cases instead of hourly rate or reputation? reply ValentineC 1 hour agorootparentThis isn't like a football match where the variables are well-known. Lawsuits are decided on facts if they end up going to court, and every case is unique even if they follow similar fact patterns. reply chx 5 hours agorootparentprevThe case could go to trial but most cases are settled outside of court.

It's really only a very limited amount of cities that have $60k salaries for bus drivers.. and they're all cities where $60k doesn't get you that far. For a comparison, starting salary for a bus driver in Paris is 30k euros (with no prerequisites, they will send you to learn how to drive a bus). I'd imagine the conditions are much better (a lot more time off, lower working hours), and the cost of living is lower, so those compensate for some of the difference. reply pavlov 8 hours agorootparentAutomattic is headquartered in San Francisco, where $60k is a bus driver's salary.

Mullenweg has been pretty good for the FOSS ecosystem as a whole, and he's just going after one particular company This is actually far from Matt's first rodeo: He described Movable Type as \"desperate and dirty players\" for having a section in their docs on how to migrate WordPress content into a Movable Type blog. When Envato started allowing people to publish themes they had created with a proprietary license, he retaliated by banning any developer on the Envato platform from speaking at any WordPress-related event (sound familiar to punishing the users for a disagreement with a platform?) Wix was accused by Matt of using WP's mobile text editor in violation of the GPL. Wix showed that they had actually adhered to the license terms, and then forker their own version under the MIT license. > one particular company (arguably one particular board member of such company, the SilverLake guy), that he now sees as parasitical to the ecosystem.

Interestingly, for someone who has such hatred for Private Equity as \"leeches and freeloaders and parasites upon open source software and communities\", the ONLY other active member of the WordPress Foundation board (than Matt) is the Managing Partner of a Private Equity firm that Matt himself appointed.

But you’d lose access to Automattic that evening, and you wouldn’t be eligible to boomerang (what we call re-hires). HR added some extra details to sweeten the deal; we wanted to make it as enticing as possible. Mullenweg doesn't explain when the offer was announced, but the earliest I can imagine is the Monday after he blocked WPE customers from accessing wordpress.org, which would mean employees had a max of four days to consider this deal. If it was after the WPE lawsuit, then employees had less than a day to consider it. For comparison, when Basecamp did this in 2021, they originally had a deadline for the offer but extended it indefinitely.[0] It's interesting to compare the way DHH presents the buyouts to the way Mullenweg does. Here's DHH[1]: >Yesterday, we offered everyone at Basecamp an option of a severance package worth up to six months salary for those who've been with the company over three years, and three months salary for those at the company less than that. No hard feelings, no questions asked. For those who cannot see a future at Basecamp under this new direction, we'll help them in every which way we can to land somewhere else. DHH's explanation of the buyout feels gracious and that he genuinely wished well to the employees who accepted the buyout. Mullenweg explaining his buyout just feels like a petty tyrant purging anyone who won't pledge loyalty to him. He highlights the tight deadline and the immediate shunning of employees who take the deal. He uses the word \"enticing\" as if the employees who accept the deal are the weak-willed ones who succumbed to temptation. [0] https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22418208/basecamp-all-hand...

Sucks, but then you can't draw that conclusion, at least not definitively. I can believe, though, that you're at least somewhat correct that the mass firings were responsible for Twitter's decline.

While we were profitable on a GAAP basis in 2018, we believe that our future revenue growth and our ability to maintain profitability will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract new users, increase user engagement and ad engagement, increase our brand awareness, compete effectively, maximize our sales efforts, demonstrate a positive return on investment for advertisers, and successfully develop new products and services. *Accordingly, you should not rely on the revenue growth of any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance.* reply pavlov 9 hours agorootparentThis is standard boilerplate that every public company puts in their official statements to pre-empt any shareholder lawsuits in case something goes wrong.

Never underestimate the skill of the employees to save their boss from horrible decisions. That said, Twitter is no longer \"open\" like it used to be - I bet it just won't handle the public traffic anymore.

Major respect for the the work they're doing at xAI, but the hardest challenges building Twitter itself are social. reply lesuorac 7 hours agorootparentprevUh, it has doomed them. Have you not heard about their massive drop in revenue as advertisers leave? Sure, the advertisers say its because of the platform being a cesspool. But I mean anything on Twitter is on FaceBook or YouTube; you might have to look faster or harder. However, that stuff isn't where FaceBook / YouTube sends your ads. The targeting on Twitter is so bad compared to alternatives that advertisers just don't care to use it. This is an engineering problem caused by having nobody to fix it. reply izacus 9 hours agorootparentprevTwitter revenue is down 84% and is continuing to collapse every month. If that is \"Working\", then I'd love to laugh at your definition of failing :D reply jeroenhd 8 hours agorootparentThe revenue problem is mostly because of Twitter's new leadership, on the technical side the few people that remained have managed to keep the platform running quite well. Sure, it has been plagued by the occasional random errors and downtime ever since Musk came in, but I don't expect most companies to remain operational on a technical level when 80% leaves. An important lesson for tech companies: hire strategic H1B employees throughout your company so when times are real tough, you're sure you can maintain operations with desperate staff that can't afford to leave. reply toyg 3 hours agorootparent> hire strategic H1B employees [so that] you can maintain operations with desperate staff that can't afford to leave In other words: slavery has only upsides for slaveowners. reply fire_lake 9 hours agorootparentprevTwitter was profitable just before Elon purchased it and gutted it. So far his plan is not working. reply CaptainFever 9 hours agorootparentI was curious if this is true or not. Found this: https://www.investing.com/academy/statistics/twitter-facts-s... which came from before Twitter went private. It's technically correct that they did make a profit (e.g. 2022 Q1), but also made a lot of loss (e.g. 2022 Q2). Comparatively, it's hard to find information about Twitter now. Most news articles mocks the revenue, but has no information about profit. However, given that Elon said Twitter \"will be\" profitable in 2024, I think it's safe to assume it isn't profitable yet? This surprises me, I thought it became profitable from cutting expenses, but the truth is complicated. It used to be both profitable and not profitable at the same time (see the first link), but now it's mostly not profitable. reply jeroenhd 8 hours agorootparentThe massive debt Elon has set Twitter up with is probably driving their current losses. Advertisers wanting nothing to do with him after telling them to fuck off is one thing, but the interest on those billions of borrowed money aren't cheap to hold on to. What also doesn't help Twitter's case is that employees are still fighting to get paid their severance fees. That's a couple hundred million dollars that Elon probably assumes he doesn't need to pay. Other fees on the order of tens of millions of dollars also include the rent that Elon decided he doesn't need to pay, as well as a bunch of other bunch of unpaid stuff. My guess is that Twitter is banking on not having to pay all of its debts at once, slowly building up a profit and regaining its value so it can have the cashflow to pay back its arrears later, but that's a risky move that may lead to a debt spiral or bankruptcy. reply saagarjha 8 hours agorootparentprevElon made substantial cuts but he has debt servicing that itself is a very large cost. reply onion2k 4 hours agorootparentprevWorking in the sense that the app is still up and running, sure.

Based on public posts only, Matt Mullenweg, CEO of Automattic, founder of Wodpress completely lost his mind and went into war against WPEngine for unclear reasons (many suspect it's money pressure perhaps from investors). He claims they don't contribute to Wordpress and WPEngine says while they don't contribute to the core product they contribute aplenty to plugins, sponsor camps and documentation. He claims WPEngine \"butchers\" WordPress, WPEngine claims they host an unchanged version. (Note: WordPress is a codebase under GPL, you can change it). He claims WPEngine disables revisions and indeed they do and you need to contact support to get it switched on -- but the ability to disable revisions is included with WordPress although normally it's a simple setting. WPEngine claims they do this for performance reasons while Matt claims this is done only because of greed. He claims they violate trademarks, WPEngine says they didn't change how they use trademarks over more than a decade and their usage is referential (nominative) which is legal. Further, WPEngine points out as recently as 2023 Matt had a positive opinion of them at a fireside chat at DE{CODE} 2023 \"when you support companies like a WP Engine, who don’t just provide a commercial service, but are also part of a wider open source community, you’re saying, hey, I want more of this in the world\". https://wpengine.com/resources/decode-2023-fireside-chat-mul... This was merely an argument between the two but then Matt decided to cut WPEngine off from wordpress.org making installing and updating a much more arduous manual process for every WPEngine customer. He did this without any notice to WPEngine. Dragging users into this seriously and negatively impacts WordPress itself and calls have mounted for a WordPress governance overhaul eg https://x.com/QuinnyPig/status/1839340016738480226 That he is not acting rationally was crystal clear when the lawsuit got filed because he came to this very place and started commenting on it while multiple people begged him to just stop because he is digging himself deeper into a hole. Everyone knows you shut up the moment you are sued. And after that he cut off the Advanced Custom Fields plugin team who is employed by WPEngine from wordpress.org. This plugin has a few million users. https://x.com/wp_acf/status/1841843084700598355 My personal take on this is obviously not positive. This entire debacle hurts open source itself. Mind you: I do not know whether Matt is right or not but there was no need for any of this. If Matt thinks WPEngine violated his trademarks? Asking for a license fee, sending a C&D and suing them are what a trademark holder normally does. Indeed, it might even be beneficial for us all to get judicial review on trademark usage like this, mostly these open source trademarks operate on \"gentleman's agreements\", I don't think they have ever been tested in court. If Matt has a beef with WPEngine using too much wordpress.org resources? 1) he could've announced that in say three months there will be a cutoff so WPEngine can implement a proxy 2) either fastly or cloudflare would've been happy to take that traffic off his hands (indeed, Matt said after the cutoff both reached out to him). For both of them a thriving web ecosystem means more business and it has a nice marketing value too. Finally, if he has a problem with the amount WPEngine contributes? That's a very hard problem, some ideas are at https://dri.es/solving-the-maker-taker-problem but inconveniencing countless sites because you have a beef with their hosting company is not going to help that's for sure. reply jart 7 hours agorootparentReading WPEngine's legal complaint https://wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Complaint-WP... they sound like cuckoos. My best guess is WPE's WordPress hosting business grew larger than Automattic and they're lashing out to survive. For example, WPE has 1000 employees and Automattic has 1700, but Automattic has their attention divided on 20 other products too, which left them blindsided when WPE forked their product, made it their core focus, outcompeted them on rizz alone, and cut them out of the profits without contributing to the costs. At that point Automattic is de facto unpaid employees of WPE and they're probably not happy about that. Their WordPress division is either going to be destroyed or have to use its guns. They chose the latter and many of their employees were angry because they signed up to be benevolent open source people. Unfortunately that's only really practical for a business when it possesses great advantage i.e. not being laid low by private equity. We should worry about Automattic's because if WordPress crumbles, Tumblr and a lot of other stuff may too. reply lsaferite 5 hours agorootparentDid WPE fork WordPress though? They clearly claim in their legal filing that the WordPress installs they use come directly from the official sources. I don't use WordPress or WPE, but I would (perhaps naively) assume that if they are making a clear statement of fact in a court filing that they are not lying about that fact. reply jart 3 hours agorootparentThey forked their business, which is WordPress hosting. In the complaint they brag about how they haven't changed a single line of code in WordPress itself. That's way more adversarial than forking the codebase, since the GPL ensures people still give back when they go their own way. reply chx 1 hour agorootparent> They forked their business, which is WordPress hosting.

This is the big one. I believe his argument was that when WPE customers updated they were using WP.org bandwidth for free. That's a reasonable point. But...doesn't that also apply to nearly everyone else who is running WP somewhere other than via a paid plan on WP.com? If I download the install zip from WP.org and install WP on my own server, won't it get updates from WP.org? If I get shared hosting at one of the zillion shared hosting companies that include cPanel or something similar, and click the button to set up WP, won't that then get its updates from WP.org? What about if I use the Wordpress docker image from docker.com? That comes configured by default to just do the initial install from the WP that is included in the image and then update that as needed, so it seems that if I go that way and don't explicitly change it to be static (and then do updates by redeploy when new images are available) I'm going to be hitting WP.org. Do I need to be worrying that if I use WP in any of those ways I'm going to be cut off from updates because WP.org isn't getting paid when I update? reply hanikesn 5 hours agorootparentprevWow, blocking ACF is quite the move.

Is this a bug? That wouldn't exactly be a bug. The code is undoubtedly calculating the Chebyshev coefficients by evaluating the function on something like x_j = (xmin) + (xmax - xmin)/2(1 + cos(pi[0..j-1]/(j-1)). If one of those grid points happens to be exactly 0, it will try to evaluate Math.sin(0)/0, giving the NaN. Another workaround is to have a slightly asymmetric range, such as [-3,+3.0000001] reply stuffmatic 3 hours agoparentprevYes, that is a bug, good catch.

I saw a video the other day about how the Nintendo 64 did not have the ability to calculate sine, so they used a lookup table from 0 to 2PI (with some clever trick to reduce the size of the table). Would it have been possibly to train a NN and store the weights or even a function and store the coefficients to calculate the sine, cosine? reply mandibles 4 hours agoparentNeural networks often have trigonometric functions internally, so it would be massively more computation than necessary. If you have a few spare CPU cycles, a hybrid approximation could start with a sparse lookup table of values as the initial guess for a few rounds of a numerical approximation technique. Or you just store the first few coefficients of a polynomial approximation (as in the OP's work). reply EdgeExplorer 3 hours agoparentprevObviously you could train some kind of neural net to calculate any function, but this would never make sense for a well-known function like sine. Neural nets are a great solution when you need to evaluate something that isn't easy to analyze mathematically, but there are already many known techniques for calculating and approximating trigonometric functions. Training a neural net to calculate sines is like the math equivalent of using an LLM to reverse a string. Sure, you *can*, but the idea only makes sense if you don't understand how fundamentally solvable the problem is with a more direct approach. It's always worth looking if mathematicians already have a solution to a problem before reaching for AI/ML techniques. Unfortunately, a lot of effort is probably being spent these days programming some kind of AI/ML to solve problems that have a known, efficient, maybe even proven optimal solution that developers just don't know about. reply kevin_thibedeau 3 hours agoparentprevThe usual conservation trick is to have a table from 0 to PI/2 and use two additional index bits to generate the other three quadrants. reply CamperBob2 1 hour agoparentprevTake a look at CORDIC if you aren't familiar with it; that was a common trig hack back in the day, and still sees some use in the embedded space.

Using React Native is far better than trying to mimic platform UI in the web, which is always terrible. * When tapping on an item on the “Feed”, the transition is made to the details _and then_ the navigation bar has a sudden title transition. This is weird. * The button in the upper left to switch between light and dark mode is nice but it should default to the system setting. It did not for me. * The Notifications tab content isn’t scrollable at all on my phone. Seems like a bug. * If you tap on an item in Notifications you navigate deeper in, but when you hit back you are back on the Feed tab. Coming from native app development, it has the normal uncanny valley feeling that React Native gives off but for normal users they may not notice it as much. reply nwienert 1 hour agoparentGlad to hear! That title jump and dark mode stuff we can fix, and honestly we can make it feel a lot better. As you can maybe guess our small team had a hundred things to pull off to launch so that demo app actually just has minimal investment. Appreciate the feedback! reply darcien 32 minutes agoprevHi Nate and team, congrats on the launch! What an exciting time to have an Expo alternative for cross platform app! I know the project is still in beta, but do you have some thoughts already around testing a One app? I watched the intro video but it didn't mention any. Since the native is powered by RN, maybe unit test will be using jest? Or vitest should be used because the app bundler is already using vite? And what about testing platform specific code? Asking this because \"unified\" framework like One or Expo usually only covers 80% of the development process, and the remaining 20% part like testing need custom solutions. reply stragio 3 hours agoprevGood to see this on HN, I’d love to share my journey with Takeout! I first encountered Takeout about a year ago while experimenting with cross-platform development after reading this blog post: The Different Tech Strategies for Building a Cross-Platform App (https://magnemg.eu/the-different-tech-strategies-for-buildin...) At work, we urgently needed an iOS app to enable push notifications for our logistics app, but our frontend was web-only and built with React/Next.js. Since the codebase was already several years old with many screens, we decided to port it to Capacitor, which led us to adopt a stack with Next.js and Capacitor (https://github.com/RobSchilderr/nextjs-native-starter). However, once we began working with Capacitor, we ran into numerous issues. Dealing with the iOS keyboard and Safari WebView was almost impossible with famous scrolling issues, and Android’s Chrome WebView also suffered from poor performance (https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor/discussions/3899). This experience pushed me to switch to Expo with Solito and Tamagui, and the new stack has been a game changer. The support from Nate and the Tamagui team has been outstanding. Also Expo and EAS has been working flawlessly. Now, with One, cross platform development is entering a new phase which address the final challenges of cross-platform development. Sharing code with Expo and Tamagui used to be manageable only for those familiar with cross-platform solutions, but now it’s becoming accessible to everyone. I bet it will be easier for new folks to understand how to work with Expo and Tamagui. Combine that with local-first, and small teams will be able to build high-performance applications across three platforms using just one simple codebase quickly. reply redbar0n 1 hour agoparentContext: Tamagui Takeout is a paid fullstack starter kit based on Tamagui (and Drizzle): https://tamagui.dev/takeout They’ve started a rewrite of Takeout to One (Zero instead of Drizzle, etc.), and are grandfathering in all existing users (also those who start using it before the rewrite is released).

It has its flaws but it's the easiest stack to get up for web/ios/android. reply mstade 2 hours agoprevHi Nate! You don't know me and I don't know you, but I know of you through your work on Tamagui. Very excited to see this coming from someone with your kind of experience – we desperately need something to challenge Expo and hopefully truly bridge the native/web divide in a way that actually works, without leaky abstractions everywhere. Very hopeful that your experience and knowledge in the space will get us there – thank you for your efforts! I will be checking this out in earnest as soon as possible. Very exciting! reply nwienert 1 hour agoparentThank you, love to hear it! reply jeremy_k 2 hours agoprevRails mentioned! As a long time Rails dev who has primarily worked in stacks of Rails APIs and React UIs, does One fit into this category? I'm excited about local first, but I haven't played around with any of the existing solutions because I was hoping to get my hands dirty with Zero. Thus I come from a point of ignorance. Are there any limitations? Will Zero need adapters to different frameworks or does it hook directly into your running postgres instance so the backend doesn't matter? reply nwienert 1 hour agoparentOne is like the halfway point between Next.js and Rails. Well, at least once Zero is out. It won't have all the stuff Rails has for now, just the data solution (and we have a drizzle-to-zero adapter and setup we'll be recommending as well so you get schema/migrations). So yea we want to bring the ethos of Rails to JS, but do it in a way that isn't NIH. Explained a bit more here: https://onestack.dev/docs/introduction#our-full-stack-philos... reply jeremy_k 58 minutes agorootparentGot it. So you're aiming to be a full stack framework. Let's say I want to keep all my business logic and schema in Rails. But I want a UI for web + native, would One work in this case? It is kind of where my lack of knowledge about how Zero works is causing my confusion on all this. reply lxe 10 minutes agoprevFunny I was just hacking on an Expo side project... might try this instead. reply raybb 1 hour agoprevI'm extremely excited for this! Especially with Zero on it's way. I have a super basic reason and use case. I've been using spliit.app (https://github.com/spliit-app/spliit) while traveling and having very slow internet. The app is amazing with fast internet but absolutely doesn't work well with spotty connections. It often makes two entries if I tap submit twice because I think the request failed after so long and it's really slow to switch pages. The design is generally great and works well but I want to add much better offline support. Maybe it means forking it and doing CRDTs and something like One. I haven't looked at their codebase much yet but I'm hopeful some improvements can be made! Anyways thanks for the great work with your framework and I really look forward to trying it out in the future. reply spullara 49 minutes agoprevfirst thing I noticed when I pasted the link into Slack is that it doesn't generate a preview reply nwienert 28 minutes agoparentWe have a proper OG, its been working on messages app, twitter... will have to test with Slack thanks for heads up, maybe just sub-pages? reply recursive 1 hour agoprevI tried `npx one` to get an idea what this is about, as the description sounds too magical for me to make sense of.

I'll be keeping a close eye on these. reply rgbrgb 1 hour agoprevCongrats on the launch! Stoked for another effort to do a typescript rails. That's a very different and IMO much more ambitious goal than doing a simpler next.js. RedwoodJS is the current notable effort in that realm but sadly doesn't seem to have gotten too much traction. The local-first angle is a compelling difference too. My wishlist as you build this out: - email / messaging support - background jobs / queues / workers - postgres / support - auth - testing - \"one man framework\" design goal... focus on how this enables a tiny team to build a company and avoid the common TS tarpits where you're thinking about the stack more than the customer problem or paying for a SaaS spiderweb that is very hard to test, monitor, reason about. For me, that tight integration is what made and continues to make rails valuable. Of course, this stuff should not be first-party / developed by you, but having an omakase set of tools for building a product company with a happy path for composing it all is really lacking in the most popular js frameworks. Edit: Just read the \"Our Full-Stack Philosophy\" section and realized you're not actually going for a rails that handles modeling all the business logic stuff. Seems more like a local-first next alternative. Still very cool and good luck, but I guess disregard most of the wishlist. reply thegreatpeter 2 hours agoprevAs a long time fan of Rails, Expo Router, Tamagui, I'm super excited to see One Stack. Great work :) reply moomoo11 1 hour agoprevThis is cool and I’ll definitely try it out some time. Serious question though. Who is this for? I’ve done mobile app dev in all the popular ways - native, flutter, and react native. Both flutter and react native bring up a ton of issues anytime the app becomes more complex than rendering a list with some detail pages. I wrote so much custom code bridging gaps. Swift and Kotlin make native dev so easy and straightforward. With flutter (which I have the most experience with along with native) I had to anyway write bridge code for handling both platforms. I think considering how easy it is to write APIs, isn’t it better to just use native for both platforms to deliver a fantastic user experience built on those APIs? Is this another project that’s suitable for simple apps or will it actually be useful for very complex UIs and deep device integration. I mean flutter still has open issues around scroll to top breaking which I fixed with custom bridge code. It’s impossible to get issues addressed. Like say it takes 3 days to make a complex UI. Then a week or more to write and test the bridge code. I’d rather take 6 days writing platform appropriate code and save a day or more of pain. And when that breaks fix it. Over time this adds up to a lot of saved time I think. reply darcien 14 minutes agoparent> Who is this for? Speaking with my experience with Expo, this kind of framework works great for their purpose in enabling a small team of engineers working closely with products and business analyst to deliver features as fast as possible. From business perspective, turns out not everything needs to be a blazing fast native code. That means if you can write code once and it will run in other platforms with minimal changes, you save some time. More time to ship more features! In a zero sum market where every extra features could bring more customers, this could become important factor when picking the tech stack. More so when you're running on investors money and need to make profit ASAP. reply redbar0n 1 hour agoparentprevTo target iOS, Android and Web, you’d have to write 3 apps / frontends then, instead of just 1 (with One). On React Native then One uses Expo, which is used in a lot of top tier and complex apps. For more about the CTO type decision of going with 3 apps or 1, and the various options from RN, Flutter, Ionic Capacitor, NativeScript (etc.) then you’ll likely find my comprehensive blog post helpful: https://magnemg.eu/the-different-tech-strategies-for-buildin... reply moomoo11 49 minutes agorootparentNot arguing with you there, of course there will be 3 apps. If the app is simple, as many of the top tier apps are, I'd recommend flutter/RN/One* in a heartbeat. However, many apps are also quite complex, and should be built for the target platforms to provide a great user experience. However, as even Airbnb found out, they're spending half their time writing bridge code to make things work. At that point I'd almost argue you're better off having 3 apps. FWIW I used to work at a tech unicorn that had a great exit, and we had native applications. We did some research projects to see if we could leverage RN and Flutter but found the headache was not worth it. Most of the libraries out there are low quality and without any tests let alone good documentation. That means we would most likely have to write our own (which we did). Then, we found out the underlying abstraction layer (flutter/RN) had its own set of issues. Then we started maintaining bridge code for those.. as I mentioned basic interactions were broken, which you'd think are the lowest hanging fruit. reply redbar0n 42 minutes agorootparentYeah, I’ll add that the decision to use RN if you already have a couple of native apps is way harder than if you are starting out with RN. I think the former was why AirBnB reverted their RN foray, and it seems to match your experience. reply timr 1 hour agoprev> We've collectively complicated the hell out of things. Yes. > I loved Rails, it made me as a young developer able to finally realize way more ambitious projects than I'd ever done before. I also liked the promise (not implementation) of Meteor - it felt like the clear future, I guess just a bit too early (and a bit too scope-creeped). Meteor and Rails were fundamentally incompatible views of the world, and the root of the \"complicated the hell out of things\" problem is that the Meteor approach wasn't practical for the vast majority of web development projects. Once you've decided to build everything in the front end and turn the server channel into a glorified database connection, you've created a nightmare for yourself on multiple levels. Setting aside the fact that javascript lacked (lacks?) even the basics of a practical programming language -- real packages and dependency management and the like, all of which needed to be implemented via a panoply of non-standard libraries that have been subsequently re-written every 2.5 weeks -- you're re-inventing wheels (like routing, rendering, cacheing and a request/response paradigm) that the browser does for you, for free. Maybe that's worth it in a few niche cases (say, making a web-based code editor), but for the vast majority of CRUD websites, you're just swimming upstream. Spinning languages and libraries misses the point that the problem is fundamental to the approach. I guess what I'm saying is: lean into your first instinct. It's all too complex. Go back to the root of what makes Rails -- traditional web development, really -- good. reply CharlieDigital 1 hour agoparentGiven that we're not dumping JS anytime soon, I think that the shortcomings of JS are kind of moot. Once you accept that 1) JS and the ecosystem has a ton of shortcomings, 2) JS isn't going to be replaced on the web for front-end for a while, then I think you can move on and think about things more objectively. I like this project because at this point in 2024, it feels like it should be easier to build and deploy cross platform web/mobile apps (I blame Apple for PWA not taking off). React is not my cup of tea, but if One's mission pans out, then I'd use it to streamline my workflow if I were building across web and mobile. I'd personally prefer PWAs and Apple making it easier to install PWAs as apps since that would make it even easier and more streamlined from a DX perspective. Right now, we all have to jump through these hoops and build this extraneous tooling and infrastructure because of Apple's resistance on installable web apps. reply timr 1 hour agorootparentNobody said \"dump Javascript\", and that clearly isn't what I meant [1]. I put that part in only to illustrate that these problems were knowable at the time that Meteor was created. What I am saying is that the paradigms of \"modern\" front-end development are all wrong. Don't re-invent basic functionalities of the browser. Don't try to turn the web server connection into a glorified database (either by implementing bastardized HTTP-SQL, or by treating the socket as a bidirectional JSON channel). Accept that server-side generation of HTML is fundamental to the medium. Embrace progressive enhancement. I could go on. None of these things requires that you drop JS as your language. If you wanted to build Rails in JS, you totally could [2]. If I had to draw a crude metaphor, the state of web development today would be as if an entirely new generation of engineers decided that TCP was wrong because most stacks are implemented in C, and therefore re-created bad versions of handshakes, etc. by writing a new protocol on top of UDP in Javascript. It's not the language, it's the architecture. [1] Though you absolutely should consider that JS isn't perhaps isn't a great language for most forms of development, and be open to, you know...using better tools when they're available, instead of trying to do everything in the lowest common denominator, while patching over all of the stuff you're missing with gobs and gobs of bad libraries. [2] Though again, why would you want to? I submit that the core cognitive dissonance here is that as soon as you accept that these \"modern\" paradigms are wrong, you quickly conclude that Javascript is a net burden on your development process. But sure, if you really like it for some reason, then great. You can use it. reply bbor 1 hour agoparentprevTo play devil’s/react-dev’s advocate: the appeal of local-first is that you can easily configure which business logic you want done on the server, leaving anything that can be done on the client to the client for latency and cloud bill reasons. javascript lacked (lacks?) even the basics of a practical programming language -- real packages and the like Interesting. As a typescript user with a million npm packages this surprises me. In the sense of “managed dependencies” JS/TS has tons of packages, but I’m getting the sense that you mean something else? Like, splitting up your code into packages gets you some performance benefit in other languages? I have python packages (read: __init__.py files) in my Flask app, but I’m not sure I’ve ever missed them in TS - am I missing some big picture? In general web bundling is so complex I tend to treat it as a black box, so that could easily be on me. you're re-inventing wheels (like routing, rendering, a request/response paradigm) that the browser does for you, for free. I’m having trouble seeing what you mean here. I know the typical “implementing an SPA is tough because you have to fake pathname manipulation/history” warnings, but I think you’re going a step beyond that. React does rendering on a way more performant level than browsers if you’re just changing subsets of the DOM, and I’m really not sure what you mean by the “request/response” paradigm at all, sorry. SPAs do have to handle async requests on the client and normal websites make the server do that when building the page, but ultimately the difference seems slight. What am I missing? for the vast majority of CRUD websites I mean, do people making crud websites really need any frameworks, and do they browse hacker news? Aren’t static sites a pretty solved problem by people like WordPress? Seems like the hard part of that would just be writing content and filling templates, maybe some styling — not any engineering work. reply rgbrgb 1 hour agorootparentAgree with you pushing back on the TS hate. The ecosystem and tooling have gotten very mature and very productive IMO for building UIs. However, static sites are by definition not CRUD sites and yes I would guess most HN web devs make CRUD sites. And I would submit that in 2024 there is still not a rails-level happy path for doing that in ts (though Redwood is trying). reply timr 46 minutes agorootparentprev> Interesting. As a typescript user with a million npm packages this surprises me. In the sense of “managed dependencies” JS/TS has tons of packages, but I’m getting the sense that you mean something else? The very fact that you cite Typescript (itself a hack built on top of Javascript to make up for its deficiencies), and npm (a third-party packaging system...since, you know...JS doesn't/didn't have one), is just emphasizing my point. Setting aside the goodness or badness of either of these things, you're so immersed in the complexity of all of the hacks that you don't even see it anymore. It's the old joke about the fish and water. Imagine a world where packages and types were a built-in, first-class feature of the language...oh wait. reply android521 2 hours agoprevLooks good . Will give it a try this weekend reply bbor 1 hour agoprevGreat writeup(s), thanks for sharing! My immediate reaction was “that sounds too good to be true”, which is a nice compliment I think. I have some high level questions if you find the interest: 1. Why have a React Native clone of your SPA instead of just doing a PWA? Does it provide some technical benefit (better offline local data persistence, maybe?) or is it just to get your site advertised on the App Store? Surely all the device APIs for movement, multitouch, etc. are supported on mobile browsers? This has been bothering me for a while, so perhaps too broad of a question. 2. What’s the rough timeline and funding look like for this? In my eyes this is a solution to, like, all complex web apps ever, so I was shocked to see just a few developers. I know you acknowledge some bugs in the Native implementation, but besides that, do you feel like this could be used for a data intensive Postgres-backed TS application today with minimal chances of bugs, or is it still a bit more experimental? I guess I’m looking for a bit of clarification on the intended meaning of “production ready”, since it seems so damn ambitious. Either way, Godspeed! Your website is gorgeous, and the whole project is insanely up my alley. Plus ‘npx one’ is just slick as hell reply nwienert 25 minutes agoparent1. With Tamagui you can share almost 100% code, so it's not a re-write, and mostly the reasoning is that it feels a lot more native. Especially interactions, scrolling, and being able to use native UI and libraries anywhere you want. Performance is a bit better too in general. It's a bit more work for sure, but I think Tamagui + One really does make it a ton more doable than before. 2. Tamagui is bootstrapped and makes some money, we haven't raised and aren't sure yet if we will. But we may need to if we want to compete long-term against well funded competition. Honestly web works really well, we have a few sites in production already. Native works pretty decent but we just want to add a lot of tests and get a more apps into the app store before we call it stable. I'd estimate 6 months it'll be stable, but you can probably reliably deploy an app within 3. reply motoxpro 1 hour agoparentpreveven being a \"tech\" person i havent ever installed a PWA and no one in my \"non tech\" circle even knows that they exist. Lots of user education to do there for them to work in my opinion. reply redbar0n 2 hours agoprevSomeone asked on the other news item about onestack.dev : > What is the added value of using it over just Expo? My answer: The added value of One is crossplatform compatibility with SSR, and HMR, all using Vite as the single bundler on all platforms. Nate baked in his vxrn.dev project to get off of Metro and forked Expo Router to do that. Since Expo Web has a large bundle size, requires NextJS for SSR, Solito for unified filesystem routing, and 2 bundlers: Metro as a bundler on RN plus a separate bundler like Webpack for web. With One then all of that is integrated. With Zero as the optional data sync engine. reply darcien 1 hour agoparentMetro is the default web bundler since Expo SDK 49[1] albeit missing vital features like bundle splitting. I think web bundle splitting is there in SDK 50? And the migration path from webpack to metro was pretty painful for big existing app. So yes, the fact One use one single bundler from the start is nice win. Also, looking at the direction Expo is taking, I believe they will eventually introduce SSR mode to Expo Router in the future.

    "originBody": "Estimates for achieving intermediate fluency in Mandarin Chinese range up to spending years and around 4000 total hours (2,200h classroom hours, 1,800 outside). I did it in 1500 hours total and less than a year. [1] Over the last 365 days, I studied Mandarin for fun. With anki, tutors, and traveling accelerating my learning, I ended up getting to the level of comfortable conversational fluency. My Mandarin isn't perfect nor perfectly fluent, but I can now handle everything up to technical conversations in the area of my PhD. For serious language learners, I also jotted down a longer list of methodds: isaak.net/mandarinmethods Humble Beginnings — 筚路蓝缕 Month 1: Last September, I was deep into my math undergrad. It was pretty dry. I was looking for some fun non-math side project. [1] I flirted with French, Russian, archery, parkour, and Japanese. But those didn’t ignite my passion. I happened to watch a snippet of the anime Demon Slayer in an obscure Chinese fan dub. Ironically, this caught my attention. I also had lots of Chinese friends, so why not learn a little Mandarin? Oh my, I had no idea how obsessed I'd end up with this \"little\" side project. Berkeley had a breakneck-speed Mandarin beginner class. I loved it. Within a week, we learned pinyin. We learned the tones. We learned to read. We learned to write. Then started talking immediately, every single day. Talking in horribly horribly broken Chinese, but nevertheless having conversations. [2] I learned the very most important survival vocabulary, like: I am Isaak and Yes, I live in America and Sorry, no, I’m not a basketball player for the Golden State Warriors. Sorry no, I’m not Steph Curry. But come chat anyway! (Qingyuan, China) The beginning was by far the hardest time, and many tuned out or dropped out. But I had lots of fun. I played a lot. I wrote a horrible poem about humanity colonizing Mars. My Chinese was absolute crap, but I was improving fast. Chinese is my fifth language, and I had a few tricks up my sleeve: Intense Self-Study — 自强不息 Month 3: Spaced repetition is a superweapon. The spaced repetition app Anki is the core reason why I was able to study Chinese efficiently. Alongside Anki, I adopted other methods to learn faster. Frequency-based learning. Comprehensible input. Reading lots as soon as I could, especially graded readers. Buying a calligraphy pen-brush and learned how to write the 600 Chinese characters. FSRS. Creating a 100,000-card Anki megadeck. For all the nitty-gritty language learning tips, check out my methods post. Early on, I started watching anime dubs like Boruto or Scissor Seven. I really enjoyed myself despite barely understanding anything. Every few minutes I collected a new word to study. The content I watched in those early days felt like colorful images with funny sounds which occasionally made sense. Colorful images with funny sounds which occasionally make sense On day 70 I reached a vocabulary of 1050, of which 460 characters. [1] The other superweapon I implemented was personalized tutoring. My first month studying Chinese was mostly in a 20-people class. But then, I took Bloom's Two-Sigma effect to heart and got myself lots of 1-1 tutoring. The more time I spent on tutoring, the more it accelerated my studies. [1] There’s legends like Tamu spending dozens of hours with tutors, but I’d mostly spend up to six hours a week. More would start to detract from my main focus, which were still my math studies. My default for working with tutors was to lead a \"normal\" conversation. I had two strict rules for conversations with tutors: 1. Only Chinese, no English. 2. Correct every single mistake I make. I definitely lost all my social anxiety after 3 days of walking around tourist-packed Hawaii beaches loudly talking broken Chinese At the start, this tutoring was excruciatingly slow. But it was very worth it. After the chat, I’d ask them to send me a summary of my key mistakes and newly learned vocabulary. It’d add that to my Anki. I made lots of mistakes. I still do. Tutoring gives me a tight and fast feedback loop on fixing my mistakes. Traveling — 学以致用 Month 4: Winter break was approaching. I knew all the Chinese I needed to know to travel. (No, sorry, I’m not LeBron James.) I figured out tourist visas, and just went for it. After Christmas in chafing-lips-freezing-cold Austria, I found myself wandering around fogged-up-glasses-humid Taipei. [1] Too humid to see, too humid to sweat, too cool to break a sweat 😎 I usually like to travel alone, and then figure out things on the spot. I’d walk around with airpods in, sugar-shocked from eating too many sugar gourds, explaining to my tutor in great detail what tasty novel things I ate at the night market. When not on a tutoring call, I’d sit in cafes and study, wander around markets, or talk to locals. Being a foreigner with passable Mandarin is... amusing. When meditating in a small Buddhist temple town in middle-of-nowhere rural Sichuan, I was a local celebrity. 300 primary schooler filed past me, who definitely hadn't seen an Austrian-African foreigner speaking Mandarin. They totally lost it. It was fun, but also tiring. Eventually I preferred to be in the cities, where being a foreigner wasn’t a miracle. At least, I got a good taste of why being famous must be great for exactly three minutes, and then quite frankly horrible forever after. Not again. I’m okay, thanks. In total, I was in Mainland China three times this year, for a total of two months. [1] It goes without saying that every journey gave me an enormous boost in my learning pace. The first time travelling got me from broken to comfortable in all day-to-day situations. Every time I travelled I learned roughly 1000 new words/characters. Every time immensely boosted my fluent expression and listening ability. Hot single qi sources near you (Emeishan, Sichuan) The Marathon — 持之以恒 Month 6: My Chinese still had far to go. Apart from the study sprints while traveling, I tried to keep up a consistently high pace back at home. Chinese wasn’t my focus then — math and neuro were. Chinese was consistently the largest side project, clocking some 15 hours a week. Consistency was the most important part to keep a high pace of progress. Here’s what a typical focused day might’ve looked like: Wake up, 1 hour of Anki Do my main thing for 8-9 hours (math undergrad, neuro grad school, …) 1 hour tutoring call before dinner some days 1 hour of Chinese content before sleep, e.g. anime dubs or books It was quite literally the marathon. Here’s my habitually doing Anki on a treadmill: 0:00 /0:11 1× Some 7 months from start, I reached 5,000 known words/characters. The old highest level (HSK6) also required a vocabulary of 5,000 (different) words. So this was an epic goal to hit. '> [1] Immersion is best done while traveling. Still, I started to immerse myself as well as I could at home. My devices would be in Chinese. I started taking some notes primarily in Mandarin. I had lots of social support throughout too: I was lucky to be able to build new relationships entirely in Chinese. For example, my grad school supervisor, a Tsinghua graduate now at MIT, was more than happy to teach me neuroscience in Chinese. I had tutors. I turned older relationships fully Chinese. This had me constantly speaking Mandarin day-to-day. Month 12: Exactly 365 days after I started, I reached a vocabulary of 8000 words and characters. 8000 words and characters makes most content I encounter relatively understandable. My vocabulary is a weird personal mix: Basics including everything up to HSK5, anime vocabulary, biology, mathematics, and random everyday stuff from travelling. Vocabulary is only one part of fluency. It's important to keep eyes on the goal: The goal of any language is to communicate effectively. Prompted for feedback on my progress, my usually reserved tutor recently commented: “This was the fastest learning pace from zero to advanced conversational fluency I have ever seen.\" That's kind, but being fluent feels like it’ll always be an overstatement. Especially for Chinese. I’m definitely not Fluent™. I sometimes still get my tones wrong. Full-speed native speech is sometimes still tough. Local dialects remain a complete mystery to me. I’d say I’m comfortable with Chinese. I can comfortably travel in any Mandarin-speaking place. I can comfortably hold long conversations. I can comfortably watch most content. I can comfortably build relationships entirely in Mandarin. The goal? I want to reach a level where the legendary Three-Body Problem will be comfortably readable. Curious about more?

In the first 4-5 months of being truly consistent with ~1hr a day of Anki and Peppa pig I got to around 2,000 words and was able to have a great experience when I traveled to Taiwan, so I can vouch for the core methodology in this post. It’s not “easy”, but it’s definitely the most effective way to learn a foreign language that I know of. The CI community has come a long way in the last ~5 or so years - the general consensus looks a lot like OP’s methods, which I would summarize as: 1. Brute force [premade Anki flashcard decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/810519009) for the first ~1k most common words 2. Start watching comprehensible input as soon as you can, ideally for an hour a day or more 3. [Sentence mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBcQJESGQvc)the comprehensible input and add it to the daily SRS flashcard grind The best summary of these methods that I’ve found is https://refold.la/ Self plug: I’ve been working on a way to generate Mandarin audio comprehensible input using LLMs/TTS models. The idea is that there aren’t many great CI options between 500 words and ~3k-5k words - OP himself mentions that when he started watching Scissor Seven 刺客伍六七 he barely understood anything, which is pretty hard to “push through” without some hardcore willpower. My project https://plusonechinese.com makes Mandarin audio stories that are 85% comprehensible at any level from 400 words all the way to 8k or more words and then auto-imports the audio snippets into SRS flashcards, which makes a CI workflow like this a lot easier to engage with at a lower level and without advanced willpower. Still working on making the content _truly_ interesting, but would love some feedback! reply neves 3 minutes agoparentPeppa Pig is hard :-) What would a be a good child animation for learning a foreign language?

My dopamine system is at a point where I can't do anything for a long time that isn't interesting, has immediate or intermediate rewards, or can capture attention for a long time. And on top of that, repeating that habit requires all these criteria. Examples: Scrolling on the phone?: Basically direct dopamine injected into my brain. Can do indefinitely. Not good. Programming? Sure I can put a few hours in, or even days if building quick prototypes where the payoff is imminent. Reading? Can go on indefinitely, depending on the book: it's just continual stream of interesting immersive stuff Exercise? Well that depends on the activity. Running indoors without any stimulation: absolutely cannot do. Cycling or running or walking outside with an audiobook, or music? Absolutely: constant stimulation plus endorphins. Learning Piano? Only if I can bang out a few good tunes immediately in the session, then I can allow myself to struggle with the difficult stuff in between. Absolutely cannot and won't do rote deliberate practice. This hinders my progress significantly, but at least I have fun. Learning a language? Well, unless I can get imminent rewards, or be continually interested and engaged, there's just no way I'll be able to do this. And I feel like rote, deliberate practice is just impossible for me to build a habit out of. One way I know for a fact that I can learn another language is through necessity to communicate with it. Let's say I'm thrown into an environment where the ONLY way I can get anything done is through having to communicate directly, without the aid of translators or tools. I think this is how babies learn. reply hintymad 30 minutes agoparent> I don't think I can do SRS No need. :-) Comprehensible Input and immersive language usage can be your superpower. reply pessimizer 14 minutes agorootparentWith old-school graded readers. Turns out that the people in past centuries who we ridiculed for their antiquated approaches for learning languages all spoke multiple languages. They didn't have comic books, though, which are another good source of interesting reading material that also comes with elaborate visual hints to what is being said. If I were trying to learn Mandarin, I'd scour the internet for bootleg scans of Jademan comics from the 80s. reply hintymad 9 minutes agorootparentYes. That's how I learned my native language and that's how I learned other languages. Super effective, and super fun. No rote memory whatsoever. BTW, Chinese didn't have a tradition of producing comic books, but they were big on turning classics into so-called 小人书，a perfect source for learning authentic, highly contextual, yet simple Chinese.

Mind you, I'll never tire of (partially) understanding what people say about me when they think I don't understand.

I'm a random white dude and I've been to Beijing and Shanghai many times over the past 15 years, and while I was asked for a photo a few times at parks or touristy places, it was far from feeling like a celeb or anything. And it has gotten less and less over the past years, but maybe that's because I'm getting older and more boring. :) reply hangonhn 1 hour agorootparentYou need to leave Beijing and especially Shanghai and head farther inland to regain your celebrity status! I (ethnic Chinese) went to China with two friends from Texas in the early 2010s. One of them has long blonde hair. She was never stopped in Shanghai, a couple of times in Beijing, but in Chengdu, they were just so amazed by her and her husband (but mostly her and her long blonde hair). People wanted to take pictures with my friends. Maybe things have changed a lot since then but worth a try! Chengdu is definitely worth visiting and I'm sure there are many very interesting more inland cities in China to visit (and maybe be a celebrity for a moment). reply iforgotpassword 1 hour agorootparentYes, going to smaller cities has always been on my list but never worked out. I did Tianjin and Qingdao last and this year, but they are still too big it seems. Stayed three days both times and there was nothing more than a few stares. reply Terr_ 1 hour agoparentprev> I had the same \"local celebrity\" experience when visiting Beijing. My own dimly-remembered anecdote involves passing through mainland China back in the 90s in tow of my parents, as an elementary-schooler with very blond hair. (Two qualities that are no longer true.) Even in the downtown areas of Beijing it drew attention, but if you went further out to more-rural zones... Well, imagine small crowds coming up to gawk and indicating they'd like to touch your hair to confirm it's real and/or for good luck. It wasn't just a lack of in-person visitors, but also that the standard of living there 30 years ago there was a much lower, and even the locally-affluent were unlikely to get much media from outside the country. reply jmyeet 11 minutes agoparentprevSo ~20 years ago I went to Kuala Lumpur. For those not knowing where or what that is, it's the capital city of Malaysia with a population of ~1.8 million people. It once held the title for the world's tallent building (ie the Petronas Towers). So this is a modern city not that far from Singapore. I happened to catch a train to one of the shopping centers while I was there so this was the mass transit system in a relatively modern city. This boy of 7 or so kept gawking at me. He was with his father. I looked up at him, curious, and his father said in passable English that his son has never seen a white person before. That was quite a surreal experience for me, particularly given the environment. I can't imagine what it must be like in rural China with few Western visitors. reply anal_reactor 1 hour agoparentprevI am a polyglot but I have slight hearing impairment, which means that unless someone is directly talking to me, I won't understand anything.

But you seem to be consistently pushing a specific agenda in the way you choose to address it. Why? reply agency 32 minutes agorootparentprevI suppose I'm lucky to live in the US where we have no problems with ultranationalist sentiment and racially motivated hate crimes. I wonder if any anti-Japanese sentiment has to do with the fact that, to this day, the ruling party/LDP actively denies the numerous war crimes perpetrated against the Chinese in the second world war, including the Nanjing massacre. But I guess it must be all that propaganda. Though the Chinese may need to fine-tune their approach, since per the Newsweek article you linked \"Among Japanese respondents, 92.2 percent had an unfavorable opinion of China, up from 87.3 percent in 2022. On the Chinese side, 62.9 percent viewed Japan negatively, about the same as the previous year.\" reply curiousgal 1 hour agorootparentprevI am curious, do you actually believe these things? reply pc86 28 minutes agorootparentNot the GP but this question has me wondering what you mean, precisely. 75% of the comment is just things that happened, so there's nothing to \"believe\" there. For the rest it's basically two statements: 1. Ultra-nationalism is on the rise in China 2. Going to China as an outsider is ill-advised OK so #1 may or may not be true but either way is an objective thing, it's either rising or it's not. So again, not really anything to be \"believed,\" although you could certainly think it's moving one direction and just be wrong about it. So the charitable reading of the only remaining statement is essentially \"you probably shouldn't go to China if you're a foreigner\" which yeah is an opinion, and not one I'd take particularly seriously, but it's also not outlandish that someone would believe that. There are plenty of places in the world to visit and if there's a place with a higher chance the locals don't actually want me there, I'll go elsewhere. Most of the time when I see questions like this asking if someone \"actually\" believes something, the implied second part of the question is either \"or are you a troll\" or \"because no rational person could possibly believe that,\" neither of which seem appropriate in this instance. reply rootsudo 55 minutes agorootparentprevNo, if anything it is well advised: 1. You are fluent in the langauge. 2. While acquiring fluency, you learn the culture. 3. You will be able to hold your own w/o a local interperter. 4. You can change locals mind and let them see their news/version of events isn't all secular (e.g. laowai adapts culture, learns langauge, not to fit in, but complimentary to living/being in China, etc.) So, I would say for someone that is fluent, it is the best time to go. General tourism, business investment, FDI, etc I'd say yes don't be too special. Note that the links you used really reference tourists. reply pragmomm 48 minutes agorootparentI think most people do have a good idea that it's not a good time to go to China for tourism or FDI, which is why: Investment into China by foreign businesses slumped to a 30-year low in 2023 https://qz.com/china-foreign-investment-30-year-low-18512681...

Remember that as the Chinese economy worsens, the average citizens are going to convert their anger into violence against foreigners. reply kentosi-dw 2 hours agoprevThe importance of an SRS system like Anki cannot be overstated. However I can see how this might be a burden to some when it comes to entering in your own sentences. For this, I highly recommend making use of your OS's dictation (speech to text) feature. You get to practice speaking _and_ enter sentences much quicker. reply cblum 1 hour agoparentI use Anki but oh did I have to learn to discipline myself. Anki’s extreme flexibility coupled with an engineer’s mind had me spending whole stretches of days or even weeks just tweaking my card templates, hoping to achieve some sort of optimal card format that will maximize my acquisition of the language (Mandarin like in the post). At some point I had enough scripts in there that I had turned it into my own Duolingo-like app. These days I reign that impulse in and force myself to stick to simple card formats. Creating cards should take as little time as possible. The Chinese Support add-on is super useful for that by the way. Another thing about Anki is that it can feel oppressive sometimes, because if you don’t do your reps they just pile up and it becomes a drag to clear the “debt.” Staying on top of my reps before I had a baby and life was chill was easy; now with the baby I sometimes feel like Anki takes away from the already limited time I have to expose myself to the language by reading books, watching videos, etc. I stick to it though, since for a language that distant from the two other languages I speak, memorization work is a must. reply ziddoap 48 minutes agoparentprev>SRS Spaced repetition system (or maybe software?) for people like me who were not familiar with this acronym. reply g9yuayon 39 minutes agoparentprev> The importance of an SRS system like Anki cannot be overstated. I'm not sure if I agree with that, as no native speakers need to have an SRS to learn their native languages. No doubt that SRS will allow us to remember words, yet few can really acquire those words intuitively. When starting to learn English in school, we used some kind of SRS system to memorize words and phrases and sentences, and man, the result was abysmal. We spent 10 years learning English (3 years of middle school, 3 years of high school, and 4 years of college), trying to memorize new words every day, passing TOEFL and later GRE through intense SRS, yet few students could understand TV shows, read fictions, or communicate with English speakers. And the learning was arduous, to say the least. In contrast, I was lucky enough that my mom gave me a set of graded readers compiled by National Geographic, and simply asked me to read them through. And then Sidney Sheldon's books, Friends, etc and etc. So basically I immersed myself into the language, never having to do SRS, and I could easily pass TOEFL and the GRE Verbal years before graduating college. As a bonus, I started to enjoy TV shows and movies early on, and was able to socialize with my classmates and professors without even trying. I also used the method to learn Spanish and Japanese, and the results are similar. No SRS needed but consistent exposure to the languages. In less than two years, I can read books like The Alchemist, If Tomorrow Comes, and Project Hail Mary. Another interesting contrast is that I couldn't understand much conversation in those languages, precisely because I spent most of my spare time in reading. reply Trufa 1 hour agoparentprevI'm learning Indonesian the right way after having learned German in the wrongest possible way and ANKI is just amazing for language learning, 4 months in and I'm having basic conversations. reply alanwreath 1 hour agorootparentSorry maybe this is the wrong question.

Yes, learning all the characters has a steep learning curve, but once one passes that stage, it's all about combination of the characters. That Chinese's grammar is heavily influenced by modern English also helped.

For basically being a very competent super knowledgeable tutor of every single language. So if I have some weird question about some language mechanism I can ask it in the domain that I know which is English or a romance language and it will do some compare and contrast. I can ask it about the etymology of the word and the development of certain verbs which helps me to really remember things. The way that it knows what you mean because it has such a vast knowledge base but also the fact that it is an expert in both source and target languages, and how nowadays with voice chat it speaks it with a correct accent means there's really nothing else like it to be honest Like, is there potentially a human being who can surpass the abilities of GPT in this domain? Absolutely but that particular professor or tutor needs to not only be native proficient in both languages, speak both without accidents, but also be patient and understand what you're trying to ask without any judgment.

But Japanese actors on set have commented at how surprised they were in his mastery of the language off camera in such a short amount of time. reply wenc 1 hour agoparentI agree with peer comment. The actor was not learning the language but the pronunciation. In opera, singers usually sing in different languages that they don’t speak (Italian, German, French) so they learn how to pronounce. I grew up multilingual (3 languages at home, 3 at school) so I already have a repository of phonemes in several language families that I can draw from. I can learn to to say common phrases and sound near native in a number of languages in a month. I can also mimic accents. I noticed that someone like Trevor Noah has the same ability because they grew up multilingual. But sounding native doesn’t mean learning the language. Japanese also has relatively simple phonology. Just have to pay attention to pitch accent. Try sounding native in a tonal language in a month. reply joshdavham 1 hour agoparentprevI'm not familiar with the show, but, you can't learn any language in one month. That is a myth. The reason for this is actually mathematical. To understand a language you need to know at least a couple thousand words and you can't realistically learn thousands of words in a month. That takes time. reply pastage 53 minutes agorootparentThe state department says 88 weeks for Japanese[1]. A month is a long time with full immersion, getting the basics right will get you far enough that people will help you with the rest.

Hitchhiking is by far one of the best ways to learn a new language. Long hours with a wide variety of individuals, mostly one-on-one. If you're young, and you're reading this, go hitchhike. It's not as safe as staying home with mom, but it's not as dangerous as people who have never done it say it is. I \"achieved intermediate fluency\" during that time. But it's gone now.

You'll learn quicker than you think, and no need to learn the language beforehand, it'll be great fun to try to understand something completely foreign, and gets a lot easier when you see people's faces and hands :) If you're young, you still have time to move to another country, and move back home if you get bored/scared. It's not as difficult or dangerous as most people think. reply cynicalpeace 50 minutes agorootparentYes agree. I lived in Colombia for 4 years. But hitchhiking is learning on overdrive. Not just language, but what they like to call \"agency\". I slightly disagree that you don't need to learn the language beforehand. You don't NEED to, but I would actually recommend getting a 4 week crash course beforehand. Because I've seen so many expats that don't even know where to start so they just hang out with other expats and that's how you end up living in a foreign country for 10 years and you can't speak the language. The most minimal thing is you need to learn how to point at a thing and say \"How do you say?\" and refuse to revert to your native language. reply realusername 33 minutes agorootparentprevI've done it this way and didn't learn much, I learned more by self-studying after I left. Thinking that I would just learn my target language just by being there was my biggest mistake. Sure, if your target language isn't too far from your native one, learning it on the go probably works fine. But you aren't going to get from English to Chinese casually by picking up stuff though, you'll end up knowing a hundred words tops for your daily life and that's it. reply cynicalpeace 19 minutes agorootparentYeah that's why I think you need a small, but solid base to really take advantage of being there. reply realusername 16 minutes agorootparentIndeed that's also my opinion, sure if you spend 6 months before going there and reach a lower B1, that's not the same story. reply cynicalpeace 54 minutes agoparentprevYou can read some stories about that trip here: https://medium.com/p/d4c0358c3097 I wish I came up with a better title. reply vunderba 52 minutes agoparentprevOr go teach. Barrier to entry to becoming an ESL teacher particularly in southeast Asia is relatively low, and its the best way to integrate into the culture. reply cynicalpeace 49 minutes agorootparentI don't have first hand experience with that, but it seems that might actually be a poor way to learn, because everyone will want to speak English to you. I've had to selfishly refuse to speak English to people many times. reply vunderba 46 minutes agorootparentEveryone in your class of course, but its not like you're wearing a tag that say \"English Teacher\" when you're just walking around. I also bypassed this pretty easily, my extended family / name is Italian, so I would always respond back in Italian, and then we'd revert to Chinese pretty quickly because NOBODY speaks Italian over there. Further since you're there on a work visa, you can eventually transition into translation work / etc. to really refine your language mastery. 3 months isn't bad, but I'd recommend a solid year. Following my time in Asia, I lived in Russia where I basically didn't use my Chinese for a couple years, but on a quick business trip to Taipei my fluency was there when I needed it. reply cynicalpeace 39 minutes agorootparentlol nice trick with the Italian. I'd say to master any language there is no period of time that is sufficient. I've even gotten worse at speaking my native language since I speak Spanish all day.

For me, I don't understand much and my mind starts to wander pretty quickly. reply alexawarrior4 1 hour agoparentI had the same problem, the solution is to start with extremely easy content, either from a language learning site/channel or content targeted at toddlers. Even 2 year olds already have quite advanced language skills! Peppa Pig is a perennial favorite. You build up from there with childrens' shows, cartoons, and at some point later on introduce graded readers. Watching full-speed native TV shows is like the final exam after 1500+ hours of study, and even then may have a lot not understood if you aren't familiar with the slang/dialect. This is especially true for heavily dialectical languages such as Chinese where it's common to always watch with subtitles on. reply bigstrat2003 14 minutes agorootparentBesides watching things aimed at young children, another tactic I have found effective is to watch something you already know very well in English (or whatever your native language). For me, this has been South Park. I'll watch episodes that I practically know by heart already, so that even if I don't understand all the Spanish words I can pick up things from knowing what is happening. reply cblum 55 minutes agoparentprevI too find it wild when people do it at a beginner stage. Back when I was learning English during my school years, I only started seriously watching native content after I already had either a B1 or B2 certificate. At that point I already knew most of what was being said, I just wasn’t used to hearing/parsing it in real-time and without the “padding” that comes with learner-oriented content. So the gap I had to bridge there was small. The burden of learning basically everything at the same time - word meanings, grammar patterns, native-level speech patterns and speed - sounds daunting to me. But I think if you are at a life stage where you can put tons of time into it, it works. reply cmuguythrow 9 minutes agoparentprevYeah this is a huge problem. AFAICT the \"solution\" currently is basically to just grind to the point you can understand Peppa Pig or the rough equivalent at ~40%-50% comprehension, and then sentence mine each episode painstakingly using something like Migaku + Anki flashcards until you can watch a brand new Peppa episode at ~80% comprehension. Its painful but after this you really \"unlock\" content and its a lot smoother and more interesting after that (the stone finally starts rolling _downhill\") I'm making an app to try to help with low level comprehensible input, posted elsewhere in this thread reply thatsnotmepls 1 hour agoparentprevUse subtitles and the extension Language Reactor. You can translate any sentence or word on the fly. reply joshdavham 1 hour agoparentprevThere are five tricks I'd recommend to stay focused. 1. Try watching something that is actually interesting. Often this could be something you'd like to rewatch that you've seen before, but now dubbed in your target language. 2. Try watching something that you understand. Search \"[target language] comprehensible input\". This content has been simplified for people like you. 3. Focus on what you DO understand, not what you don't understand. Not only does this not weigh you down, it also give you something to focus on. 4. Pop bubble wrap (or something). Watching a TV show is effectively \"doing nothing\" and this makes some people uncomfortable (sorta like struggling to meditate). If you can find something to do while you're \"doing nothing\", this can help a lot! reply vunderba 2 hours agoprevI commend the author's discipline - this is a pretty standard approach. TLDR - Move as many things as possible in regular life to the target language (software, tv shows, reading, etc) to maintain the language - There is no substitute for full immersion if you have the opportunity. I learned traditional Chinese in Taiwan while I was an ESL teacher. - The power of SRS (spaced repetition system) cannot be overstated I will add my own bit to it. If you like mnemonic systems, Heisig wrote a very good book called \"Remembering Traditional Hanzi\" where the idea is to use the radicals in the character to construct a visual image to aid in recall.

Guess I traded a bit of my fluency in English for Chinese. :p reply alexawarrior4 1 hour agoparentprev\"The power of SRS (spaced repetition system) cannot be overstated\" For an alternative take, there is at least some evidence that SRS is entirely unnecessary and can even hinder language learning. I know it at least is not required by first language speakers, and have also seen many examples of fluent second and third language speakers who never use SRS, or any other kind of \"practiced\" language acquisition such as learning vocabulary, grammar, etc. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis For instance here's a PhD thesis of someone who learned French to fluency with only watching TV and (later) reading books: https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9b49365 reply vunderba 58 minutes agorootparentOne of the points in Input Hypothesis is something I'm sure everybody would agree with: This states that learners progress in their knowledge of the language when they comprehend language input that is slightly more advanced than their current level. Krashen called this level of input \"i+1\", where \"i\" is the learner's interlanguage and \"+1\" is the next stage of language acquisition. Informally I've always called it \"walking the knife's edge\" - you have to be always on the slight edge of feeling uncomfortable to realize meaningful gains. I mean it makes logical sense. The brain is ALWAYS trying to optimize away through chunking/patterns/etc. so you have to be constantly challenging it. It's the reason why there's a huge skill difference between a driver at one month vs 1 year, but a far less difference between a driver at one year vs ten years. reply senkora 1 hour agoparentprevI worked through “Remembering Simplified Hanzi” and my one complaint is that I wish that it were “grouped by frequency” a bit more. The way that these books work is that the first one is the most common ~1500 characters grouped by radical / component, and then the second one is the next most common ~1500 characters grouped the same way. The problem is that this means that you have to learn 1500 characters before you know all of the most common 1500. I stopped after 1000 characters and was left not knowing many extremely common characters that hadn’t been introduced yet. I think that a better organization would have been 500, 1000, 1500 instead of 1500, 1500. Other than that, great books that I also recommend. reply Al-Khwarizmi 1 hour agorootparentTuttle \"Learning Chinese Characters\" by Matthews and Matthews is organized in the way you mention.

Definitely more language learners should be using an SRS, but there are lots of people who take it way too far (I have way too many stories). Where things go wrong for most people is their understanding of the role of the SRS. The SRS to language learning is what protein shakes are to bodybuilding. But while no serious body builder would try to get ripped by drinking protein shakes and neglecting working out, there are unfortunately tons of language learners doing basically just that with the SRS.

Whether $5 or $50, every contribution counts. Support us to deliver journalism without an agenda. Louise Thomas Editor Find out more T hey were supposed to be real-life fountains of youth. In March 2000 the term “Blue Zone” was first used to describe Sardinia, an Italian island that appeared to be home to a statistically improbable number of people living past the age of 100. In the decades since, four more areas have been identified around the globe where locals apparently have an increased chance of becoming a centenarian: Okinawa in Japan; Nicoya in Costa Rica; Ikaria in Greece and Loma Linda in California. These so-called Blue Zones have inspired countless studies, cookbooks, travel stories and even their own Netflix documentary series (2023’s Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zones). The trouble is, the outlandish claims about the life-giving properties of these regions just don’t stand up to close scrutiny. Last month, Dr Saul Newman of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his work debunking Blue Zones. Newman’s investigation into serious flaws in the data about the world’s oldest people saw him take home an award that has been handed out since 1991 for scientific research that “makes people laugh, and then think.” Newman says that when he looked into the claims about Blue Zones he found a pattern of significant data being routinely ignored if it didn’t fit the desired narrative, and statistical anomalies that could be better explained by administrative errors or cases of pension fraud. “It’s as if you gave the captain of the Titanic nine goes at it and he’s smacked into the iceberg every time,” Newman tells The Independent of the research. “What’s most astounding is that nobody in the academic community seems to have thought it’s ridiculous before this. It’s absurd.” Take Sardinia, the original Blue Zone. While it was purported to be home to crowds of centenarians, European Union figures show that the island only ranks around 36-44th for longevity in the continent. Many of those who were supposed to have reached very old age in their Italian idyll turned out to in fact be dead, they just hadn’t been reported as such to the authorities. “Sometimes the mafia is involved, sometimes it’s carers,” says Newman. “There’s a lot of cases in Italy where younger relatives have just kept claiming the pension even though granddad’s out the back in the olive garden.” open image in gallery Natividad Talia Matarrita Fonseca, 93, at home in the supposed ‘Blue Zone’ of Nicoya, Costa Rica (Ezequiel Becerra/AFP via Getty Images) Something similar seems to have been happening in Nicoya in Costa Rica, where around 40-50% of centenarians were found to have misreported their ages, and on the Greek island of Ikaria. In 2015, Germany requested that Greece audit their spending as a condition of their bailout during the financial crisis. Until then, Greece had been paying pensions to around 9,000 centenarians. After the audit, that figure dropped by 72%. “That number comes from the Greek minister who was handing out the pensions,” says Newman. “He’s the guy with the most incentive to minimize the problem of anybody in the world, and he’s saying that 72% are rubbish.” When they’ve measured Okinawa it doesn’t do any of the things they claim Blue Zones do. Not even close. It’s comedically wrong Dr Saul Newman Claims about the Blue Zones have gone far beyond simply saying that people in the regions live longer than average. Author Dan Buettner, who founded the Blue Zones LLC marketing company in 2008, has outlined what he calls the “Power 9” factors prevalent in these areas that contribute to long, healthy lives. These are: exercising by moving naturally, having a purpose, “downshifting” routines to reduce stress, stopping eating when 80% full, eating largely plant-based diets, drinking 1-2 glasses of wine per day, a sense of religious faith or belonging, putting their families first and living in positive social networks. However, when Newman looked into whether these characteristics are true in Okinawa, he found a wide gap between the claims and reality. “There’s some extraordinary cognitive dissonance going on,” he says. “The Japanese run one of the largest and longest-running nutritional surveys in the world. It covers 96% of their citizens, and when they’ve measured Okinawa it doesn’t do any of the things they claim Blue Zones do. Not even close. It’s comedically wrong.” Take for example the claim made on BlueZones.com that Okinawans are disproportionately filled with “Ikigai”, a sense of purpose in their life. That’s just not true: in fact, Okinawa has the 4th highest suicide rate in Japan. Similarly, claims that the area is particularly religious don’t hold water. “They’re the least religious place in Japan,” says Newman. “93% atheist.” How did the idea that Okinawa is a great place to grow old take root in the first place? Newman attributes it in part to the fire-bombing of the area by the US during World War II, which caused the destruction of countless birth certificates and other records. “Within Okinawa, the distribution of centenarians is predicted by who had their Hall of Records blown up,” he says. “You have an occupying army of GIs who don’t really speak Japanese replacing birth certificates because they’ve just blown them sky high. In a town where this has happened, you have more centenarians.” open image in gallery US Marines pass each other going to and from the battlefront during the Battle of Okinawa circa June 1945 (Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images) This wouldn’t be the first time that dubious record-keeping has led to false claims of extreme longevity. For decades, the Guinness Book of Records stated that the world’s oldest man was Pierre Joubert, who had lived to the grand old age of 113 years, 124 days. It later turned out that record keepers had conflated a father’s birth date with the death date of his son, who was also named Pierre Joubert. In fact, the elder Joubert had died at the more reasonable age of 65 – a fact that had been written on his death certificate the whole time, if anybody had bothered to check. For Newman, claims about the health benefits of the supposed Blue Zone lifestyle lose all credibility when you understand how unsupported the premise is by empirical data. “Firstly, does lying to the public matter?” he asks. “Secondly, the astounding thing is that one of the guidelines is that you should drink every day at twice the NHS heavy drinking guidelines. That is a recipe for alcoholism. It’s mad that it’s being propelled as health advice. If you were a doctor telling your patient to drink every day, you’d get disbarred.” The suggestion that daily boozing is a cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle is particularly strange when you consider the fifth Blue Zone, Loma Linda. This small city in Southern California is home to a large community of tee-total Seventh Day Adventists. The area was added to the list in 2008, and then in 2020 Buettner sold Blue Zones LLC to Adventist Health, the health care system of the Seventh Day Adventist Church. “Why are Seventh Day Adventists, who claim this as their core belief, pushing people to drink?” asks Newman. “They’re supposed to be sober. It’s just baffling to me.” The Independent has approached Blue Zones LLC for comment. In the end, it might be time to retire the concept of Blue Zones and write the whole thing off as a collective case of wishful thinking. “People do not want to go jogging,” says Newman. “They don’t want to give up drinking. They don’t want to give up smoking. They want there to be some far flung, exotic island where everything’s okay and if you eat the goji berries you’re gold. It’s a nice dream, and it has always, throughout the entirety of history, sold well. But is it true?

Proposed drivers of remarkable longevity include high vegetable intake, strong social connections, and genetic markers. Here, we reveal new predictors of remarkable longevity and ‘supercentenarian’ status. In the United States, supercentenarian status is predicted by the absence of vital registration. The state-specific introduction of birth certificates is associated with a 69-82% fall in the number of supercentenarian records. In Italy, which has more uniform vital registration, remarkable longevity is instead predicted by low per capita incomes and a short life expectancy. Finally, the designated ‘blue zones’ of Sardinia, Okinawa, and Ikaria corresponded to regions with low incomes, low literacy, high crime rate and short life expectancy relative to their national average. As such, relative poverty and short lifespan constitute unexpected predictors of centenarian and supercentenarian status, and support a primary role of fraud and error in generating remarkable human age records.

Not much content but seems like the author went through a lot of research. He comes to conclusion based on this tons of data that all we really know for sure is that people living in these blue regions are living much longer and it seems to be related to what they eat. That it is basically the only solid and stable data point we have. Welp.

It establishes that error rates are high in those areas, demolishing the centarian numbers. It doesn't give much investigation into the averages at all. Where it does, it seems to compare adjusted numbers of one data set with unadjusted numbers of another. If you really want to get into the averages, you'd have to determine error rates and adjustments for each specific area, probably by jurisdiction or record keeper, and then compare them. The problem is, nobody is going through that process for the entire world so we just use the face value numbers until we want disprove a specific area and then compare the adjusted numbers against unadjusted numbers. The data is too massive to rigorously investigate. But this whole effort is moot. What tangible benefit comes from disproving blue zone data? These population level studies aren't meant to provide answers. They're meant to provide new variables. Each of the blue zone longevity recommendations have their own studies to either prove (food stuff) or disprove (drinking wine daily) them. So yeah, it's great the errors in the data have been called out it's a bit surprising that the author interviewed is so angry in the article. I guess it's fitting that he got the Ig nobel, since this correction doesn't have any applicable impact to end result, which were additonal studies investigating the individual suggestions/variables, such as specific dietary practices. reply adamc 5 hours agorootparentIf the error rates are high, there is no reliable signal that these areas are different, so how the hell can looking at their \"new variables\" help? reply giantg2 5 hours agorootparentGo look up the studies that came out of it. It would be different if these were new studies, but this is all in the past. This new finding of unreliability doesn't have any impact, hence the Ig nobel instead of the real nobel. reply mfer 5 hours agorootparentprevExcept, it misses the point and doesn't really do that while being persuasive. According to the Blue Zone researchers, some of the Blue Zones are disappearing because the generations that came after the oldest live differently and much shorter. By differently, their eating, body movement, and other characteristics are different. Looking at the whole population doesn't segment for differences between generation. So, nuance is lost. In some areas, like the Blue Zone in the US other research is finding the people who live there are healthier than the surrounding populations. Then you have to ask, what area do you average over for your measurement and statistics? reply giantg2 5 hours agorootparent\"Then you have to ask, what area do you average over for your measurement and statistics?\" This is a big thing that I didn't seen in the paper this article is based on. It seemed like the author was comparing adjusted numbers from the blue zone with unadjusted numbers from non-blue zones. Without comprehensive investigation of error rates and even different error mechanisms by locale, it seems like a poor comparison to make. Comparing life expectancies is better than comparing outlier centarian numbers, but you are right that it depends on what other areas we are using as the baseline or average (and I take it a step farther by saying it depends on what error adjustments need to be made to both data sets). The whole blue zone idea is a bit misapplied though. These population studies find new variables to look at. Then you have targeted studies to investigate thos variables. Discrediting the centarian numbers doesn't discredit the findings on stuff like a mederteranian diet having better health outcomes than the standard western diet, etc. reply mywacaday 3 hours agorootparentprevI listened to an interview with the author during the week, in short as soon as you start getting reliable recording of births and clamp down on old age welfare fraud the phenomenon disappears. reply jimberlage 1 hour agorootparentprevKinda depends on how much you value inductive vs. deductive reasoning, but the authors make the deductive case that: - There's strong incentives to misreport in these areas (the compelling example from Sardinia was that the person is alive for the purposes of pension fraud, but really dead) - People who are incentivized to report people being older than they are will do so And the inductive case relies on data, which is presumed to be totally flawed because of the misaligned incentives. reply mannykannot 4 hours agorootparentprevIt is very much to the point, addressing the specific claims and methodology of a specific (and apparently somewhat influential) study.

The counter to that might be the average life span in the region isn't an outlier. In one case you're looking at a targeted subgroup and the other your looking at the population as a whole.

Some examples of things that caught me poor and leading... * The Blue Zones claim that most places that list many centurions are false due to bad record keeping. Only a few places have good enough records that are trustworthy. In this authors research he called out places that were not blue zones as examples of bad data against Blue Zones. * In Okinawa the Blue Zones claim that only the oldest generation fits the Blue Zone model. That more recent generations eat poorly and have bad health. That this Blue Zone is going away. This researcher has focused on the more recent food and health of younger generations to discount it being a Blue Zone for that oldest generation. * In the US he fails to find fault in record keeping (last I dug into it) with the only location that is considered a Blue Zone. Instead he focuses on generalities. There are more examples like this. This all seems disingenuous. It's not to agree with Blue Zones but rather to look at his arguments against those put forward for Blue Zones. I keep thinking of the phrase \"Lies, Damn Lines, and Statistics\" reply minifridge 4 hours agorootparentIt is definitely a bit fishy. I am sure there are other places with bad record keeping which were not included in the study to deflate the pvalues of book keeping. reply gpderetta 4 hours agorootparentprevYes, I did a bit of investigation and I commented on it the few times this article made the rounds on HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20633769 I don't think it is just bad statistics, it is very poor data extractions. Just an example: \"Like the ‘blue zone’ islands of Sardinia and Ikaria, Okinawa also represents the shortest-lived and second-poorest region of a rich high-welfare state\" Sardinia[1], at 83.8, had in 2018 one of the EU highest life expectancies, certainly higher than the rest of Italy (83.4). Like the rest of Italy it was badly hit by COVID in 2020. Life expectancy at 55 is 30.6 vs 30.1 for the rest of Italy. I don't know how to match it with their Figure 2 that shows the all Sardinian provinces being extreme outliers in negative other than they completely misinterpreted the data. Also the same graph shows 7 blue dots for Sardinian provinces, historically Sardinia had only 4 provinces and has had 8 only for a short period in the mid 2000s. [edit: The newer version of the paper[2] is different and doesn't have figure 2] [1] https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/demo_r_mlifex... (Sardegna In the table).

Table S1 is also relevant: all four Sardinian provinces that appear in that table have existed only from 2005 to 2016. The other 4 historical provinces do not appear. I can't help but think that they didn't somehow account for that and it messed up their data. Although the fact that those four provinces stick out as extreme outliers in their graph should have clued them that something was wrong. reply brushfoot 8 hours agoprevThis doesn't really address Loma Linda, California, the Adventist blue zone. The researcher's criticism of Loma Linda isn't that people don't live longer there; it's that Adventist Health purchased Dan Buettner's marketing company Blue Zones LLC in 2020. Adventists are teetotalers, so he questions why they'd want to be associated with the Blue Zones guideline of drinking \"every day at twice the NHS heavy drinking guidelines.\" Which is a fair question -- but it doesn't have anything to do with whether Loma Linda is an area with greater longevity. reply vitorfblima 7 hours agoparentFrom the paper: For example, the Centres for Disease Control generated an independent estimate of average longevity across the USA: they found that Loma Linda, a Blue Zone supposedly characterised by a ‘remarkable’ average lifespan 10 years above the national average, instead has an unremarkable average lifespan29 (27th-75th percentile; Fig S6). reply brushfoot 6 hours agorootparentThis misses the forest for the trees. The CDC looked at average life expectancy in Loma Linda across all demographics. Purely geographical and on average. The blue zones focused on the greater longevity specifically of Adventists in Loma Linda. It wasn't a question of whether living inside the municipal boundaries of Loma Linda automatically conferred some special health benefits -- clearly it doesn't. It was, \"Why is there an unusually high concentration of outliers living here, and what behaviors cause them to live longer than average?\" reply maartenscholl 3 hours agorootparentI don't think that is right. In the Blue Zones marketing material, they characterise Loma Linda's 9000 Adventists, who make up 40% of the population, as living a decade longer on average. That is the claim being investigated. This claim is hard to reconcile with the CDC's official numbers which show a typical life expectancy for the entire area, unless living next to Adventists somehow lowers the life expectancy for the remaining 60% of the population, which would be far more interesting. reply brushfoot 2 hours agorootparent> they characterise Loma Linda's 9000 Adventists, who make up 40% of the population, as living a decade longer on average > This claim is hard to reconcile with the CDC's official numbers which show a typical life expectancy for the entire area Buettner's focus was on the outliers. Loma Linda is a longevity hotspot, and the question is why. He found the long-living outliers practiced certain behaviors that they associated with Adventism, like vegetarianism. Not all Adventists practice those behaviors. About half of Adventists eat meat, for example. But the long-living outliers were Adventist and practiced the behaviors that he highlighted. So that was his takeaway. reply maartenscholl 2 hours agorootparentSure Buettner does focus on the older people of the community by interviewing them, but that does not generalise to the claim of the book (or the website to this day) that this community has a high life expectancy, which is shown to be false by the corrected statistics. This is known as a \"population fallacy\". By focusing on the older people only in such a small population, he is introducing selection bias and survivorship bias. Moreover, he did not control or compare studies. I believe there are more than one Adventist community in the US, yet those are not Blue Zones somehow? reply em500 6 hours agorootparentprevSo first it was Sardinia, Okinawa, Ikaria, Loma Linda.

It's only relevant given the misconception that Loma Linda itself has some special properties of rejuvenation. But that doesn't mean it's not a longevity hotspot. Even if the average lifespan there were lower than normal -- say a large number of unhealthy people lived there -- it still wouldn't negate that, if an abnormally high number of healthy centenarians also live there. reply PleasureBot 3 hours agorootparentThis is just the No true Scottsman fallacy. \"Loma Linda residents have some of the highest lifespans in the world.\" \"Well it turns out they actually just have average lifespans.\" \"Only true Loma Linda residents have the highest lifespans.\" If you discount everyone who died at a normal age, you can conclude that Loma Linda residents are doing something special. reply brushfoot 3 hours agorootparentLoma Linda residents do have some of the highest lifespans in the world. Not on average -- but that wasn't Buettner's point.

And honestly, it’s just Bayesian statistics—if they present 5 data points, and 4 of those data points are floating somewhere between data errors and fraud, then odds are, that last data point is flawed somehow as well. Certainly they would need to do some extra work to prove that it isn’t. reply neaden 7 hours agoparentprevThis seems pretty explainable by Seventh Day Adventists' behavioral factors leading to increased life, a group with very little smoking and drinking living longer isn't surprising. reply happymellon 7 hours agoparentprevIt does if you read it.

How do you compare a population that went through that to a population that didn't? reply CareerAdvice01 7 hours agoprevI come from one of these blue zones on the southern coast of Europe. That low income low literacy people live longer, provided they have good genetics seems plausible to me. These people tend to lead a semi-agrarian life and remain active well into their 80s. Their more educated higher income counterparts will probably have spent their life being sedentary and their retirement in a coffee shop indulging themselves. If food plays a role, it's only insofar as them being less indulgent. Otherwise I believe the obsession on diet is only because it is one factor that is relatively easy for people to change. Genetics plays a huge role, because if your body betrays you early on, you won't be able to remain active and focused on life in your later years. Climate probably also plays a role because again, you need good climate to remain active all year round. So does family. Seeing your family everyday keeps you planted in life. Healthcare might also play a role. Our healthcare is much more caring than the one in the northern European states. They should make a study focusing on northern European retirees who decide to live here on the coast. We have quite a few of those and I wonder whether they tend to live longer compared to their counterparts back home. The allegation that its simply fraud is ridiculous. If someone in the village dies, the whole village would know before sunset, and pretty much nobody dies at home anyway. And what about inheritance? Or paying rent? No, that's completely ridiculous.

Where do people actually live the longest in other words? reply bluepizza 8 hours agoparentHighly developed countries with access to affordable or free healthcare seem to be real blue zones. Especially in highly urban areas. Hong Kong, Singapore, and the big cities of some countries (Tokyo, Sydney) have very high life expectancy numbers. Seems like getting treatment when you're sick, and having regular check ups to induce lifestyle changes are what makes a place a blue zone. reply giantg2 7 hours agorootparent\"having regular check ups to induce lifestyle changes\" More likely that those areas have society level positive lifestyles by default, especially relating to foods (eg Okinawa eating until 80% full, Italy and the mederteranian diet, Loma Linda plant heavy diet, etc). Plenty of people get at least an annual covered checkup, but that doesn't mean they will make lifestyle changes. Even the ones that try end up like a new years resolution - not being strict about it or giving up after a month or two. Edit: why disagree? reply bglazer 7 hours agorootparentIsn’t the whole point of this research that people Okinawa and Italy probably don’t live any longer. In fact these areas have shorter average life span? So, all the stories about the benefit of the Mediterranean fish heavy diet are post-hoc rationalizations of bad data? reply giantg2 6 hours agorootparent\"Isn’t the whole point of this research that people Okinawa and Italy probably don’t live any longer.\" I didn't see that claim in the article. What I did see is that the data on centarians was shown to be invalid. It's certainly possible that the overall life expectancy stats could be distorted. In most cases (excluding Okinawa), I doubt that the mistakes or fraud are that rampant. The problem with the blue zone studies is that they explicitly focused on outliers from the beginning. Any mistakes or fraud become a big impact in a small population like that. If you use population level life expectancy, the impact should become much smaller, or at the very least any systemic fraud and mistakes should become readily visible and be able to be corrected in the numbers if further studies are done to measure it. The article is very emotional and seems to mischaracterize some things, such as claiming that every blue zone must fit each piece of the suggestions. The idea of drinking every day is probably not a good suggestion as there is some research contesting the benefits of a glass of wine a day. But let's take Okinawa as an example. It's uncontested that the records have problems, it's trending in the wrong direction (younger generations, probably better records), and it doesn't fit all the practices (eg religion). But does this invalidate the longevity recommendation of eating to 80% full that comes out of the blue zone recommendation? No. There are independent studies showing the benefits of this practice to reduce cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and obesity. So even if the blue zone centarian data is wrong (it is), that doesn't say anything about the suggested practices. Those have always needed their own studies to validate the suggested practices anyways. Fot example, there are numerous studies on the mederteranian diet that shows it is beneficial compared to a typical western diet and especially compared to the typical American diet. reply simiones 4 hours agorootparentThe point is that, if the Blue Zones concept is BS and none of these places have high life expectancy, then there is no reason to discuss them in the context of nutrition or lifestyle recommendations of any kind. Those recommendations may be good or bad, but they are unrelated to the non-existent longevity of these \"blue zones\". reply giantg2 4 hours agorootparentYeah, but it's all ancient history at this point. The recommendations have already been proven or disproven through followup studies. Disproving blue zones at this point in time is basically moot. reply fnands 9 hours agoparentprevThe real Blue Zones are the friends we made along the way. The problem will always be that you need to find places that keep good records, and have done so for the last century. What they set out to do was to find correlations between lifestyle and longevity, and what they ended up finding was a great tool for spotting pension fraud. reply giantg2 7 hours agorootparentThe levels of fraud aren't that rampant. Focusing on life expectancy in those regions still seems to have some valid correlation. It was a mistake from the beginning to try to focus on outliers (people living over 100). reply lolinder 6 hours agorootparentPart of the research shows that when you drop the outliers these regions have a lower than average life expectancy. reply giantg2 5 hours agorootparentYeah, it does show that for some of the areas, but not others. The problem with these population studies is they do not give you answers, only new variables. In my view, the whole blue zone study is moot, at least in the way it is typically applied. What it does give us are new variables to study. Those smaller studied can control for variables that the population level cannot. They can also apply those studies to populations of different decent (genetics). The glass of wine recommendation has had many studies done and the results are conflicting. The eating guidelines like heavy in plants, mederteranian, eating to 80% full all have multiple studies showing benefits over the typical western diet and especially the typical American diet. It's a no brainer that if you want to live a long life you have a better chance of doing that if you have a reduced risk of heart attack, stroke, diabetes, etc. reply simiones 4 hours agorootparentMost of these guidelines are based on the same sort of flawed population-level studies that can't control for many other aspects. For example, the \"Mediterranean diet\" is consumed in countries that have all sorts of other specific lifestyle differences that are just as likely to influence health and longevity - siesta, a general tendency not to stress or work in exaggerated amounts, a month or more of vacation per year, significant sun exposure, good social healthcare, and many others. All of these together have certain (mild) effects on longevity and health, but there is virtually no way to isolate any one from all of the others. There are also many studies that suggest other kinds of diets are beneficial, and many populations that consume significantly different diets and have even better health than the average person around the Mediterranean. For example, inuit populations also display generally low obesity and risks of heart attack, stroke, diabetes etc - while consuming almost the opposite of a Mediterranean diet or of plant heavy diets. reply lolinder 5 hours agorootparentprevRight, I have no problem with dietary recommendations that are inspired by \"blue zones\" and then validated with research in other populations. reply 93po 23 minutes agorootparentprevi mean there are studies that show good socialization leads to longer life expectancy so you're not wrong reply hieKVj2ECC 9 hours agorootparentprevso no correlations between lifestyle and longevity? doubt reply resoluteteeth 7 hours agorootparentThere are it's just the outlier blue zones where people are supposed to be reaching very hugh maximum ages at a surprising rate that are probably not real.

The incidence rates for cancer overall climb steadily as age increases, from fewer than 25 cases per 100,000 people in age groups under age 20, to about 350 per 100,000 people among those aged 45–49, to more than 1,000 per 100,000 people in age groups 60 years and older.

It's not really a secret that if you are active, eat fairly healthy, aeent obese, and don't drink or smoke that you will be significantly healthier than the baseline rates in the US. reply nucleardog 3 hours agorootparentCould be that that \"more primitive lifestyle\" could fall victim to some of the same issues that lead us to see the cancer rates throughout history as much lower. (E.g., lack of diagnosis) I took a look at the Hutterites in Canada because while they live a simpler lifestyle with a more traditional diet, no smoking, and minimal alcohol consumption, they are generally much less averse to modern conveniences where they supplement their lifestyle. Combined with Canada's public health system, that means they have few barriers in the way of receiving modern medical care. It's a bit old, but I found a study from the 80s[0] that found men have significantly lower rates of lung cancer (yep, not smoking helps) but they found an increased risk of stomach cancer and leukemias. Women had lower rates of uterine cancer. This was fairly consistent across all three traditional groups in North America. Other sources seem to show their life expectancy is in line with the general population, removing that as a factor. So not smoking helps. If I had to take a wild guess, the lower rate of uterine cancer could potentially be explained by lower rates of HPV as we now know that's the main risk factor for developing cervical cancer. I can't find any reports on the rates of STDs among the Hutterites, but I would hazard a guess it's \"lower\".

This is further confounded when you have generations that have lived longer, as we do in the first world, because now not only do the sickly ones live long enough to get modern diseases, they also live long enough to reproduce and pass on the previously-non-viable genes.

According to The Times newspaper, the limits are not based on any science whatsoever, rather \"a feeling that you had to say something\" about what would be a safe drinking level. This is all according to Richard Smith, a member of the Royal College of Physicians working party who produced the guidelines.

He also argued that the figures were \"in the right ball park\", and called for heavier taxes to cut consumption The numbers were based on no evidence but also amazingly in the right ballpark. No contradiction there if you work in public health.

VSCode is built on open source of course, but the the OSS version is \"Code - OSS\". When Microsoft builds it and releases it, it becomes VSCode with the Visual Studio trademark and what not. PearAI's Code fork is using the real VSCode marketplace which has strict \"This has to be used with Visual Studio products\" (well, and some other MS / GitHub bits), so they can't use that. If you look at other VSCode-adjacent editors, they all use open-vsix.org instead. They also use extensions that are licensed in the same way: https://trypear.ai/blog/wsl-setup They have instructions on setting up the WSL extension...which has a \"This can only be used in Visual Studio Code\" License too, so it can't be used in their PearAI fork.

What is the path forward? reply tptacek 15 hours agoparentPeople have weird ideas about what YC is and does. People apply to YC: you can go look at the application. They get gajillions of them. They downselect applications to interviews. The interviews are brief. They downselect interviews to offers to join a cohort. Every company in the cohort gets a group partner that they do regular \"office hours\" meetups with. There are internal events and talks and stuff. There's a standard investment, and demo day. That's it. YC doesn't operate YC companies. They're investors. They aren't your boss. They're not looking at your code. They're almost certainly not doing any meaningful technical due diligence. These are things that happen, to an extent, in priced rounds that happpen after your seed round (A-round technical due diligence is also a joke, but whatever, stipulate). The whole point of YC is that they're investing in big batches of startups, at a scale that is a big multiple of what an A-round VC does in a whole year. Tan is apparently apologizing because he spoke up on behalf of a batch company, or repeated some misinformation TechCrunch published. But it is very weird to ask them how their selection process would change to account for this happening. reply imiric 14 hours agorootparent> YC doesn't operate YC companies. They're investors. YC also offers mentoring and coaching services, which goes beyond what a traditional investment firm does. That's part of their appeal, anyway. > They're not looking at your code. They're almost certainly not doing any meaningful technical due diligence. Maybe they should? If their job is to find talented, and hopefully also ethical and honest, people, then doing a basic check like ensuring that the project they're being pitched was actually authored by the candidates should be part of the vetting process. If, OTOH, their job is to bet on anyone who's likely to give them the highest ROI, regardless of their personal values, then they don't need to do any of this, and cases like PearAI should be acceptable. But that's not what YC claims to be about. > The whole point of YC is that they're investing in big batches of startups, at a scale that is a big multiple of what an A-round VC does in a whole year. Maybe that's part of the problem then. When you're trying to fund and mentor hundreds of companies in a few months, it's impractical to think you'll be able to successfully screen all of them. But the startups must grow... reply tptacek 14 hours agorootparentHaving seen/participated in it firsthand several times, I don't believe priced, institutional A-round technical due diligence would have turned any of this up. It is not realistic to think YC would have. reply bambax 8 hours agorootparentThe problem is not with tech due diligence. YC can never say enough that they invest in people, that only the people matter, etc. \"Founders, Founders, Founders\" is YC's answer to Balmer's \"Developers, Developers, Developers\". That they decided to fund bros that simply copy-and-paste others' code (!) and are happy to declare publicly that they \"chatgpt'd the licence\" (!!) and \"can't be bothered with legal\" (!!!) is... alarming? reply shawndrost 45 minutes agorootparentOne thing that's happening here is that YC believes \"sloppy copy-paste is Good, Actually\" more than you do. Maybe more than is polite to say in public. I don't mean to defend PearAI, which seems to be doing dumb and unacceptable things. But in YC's circles, if you say \"I can't be bothered with legal\" about something, they would be more likely to say \"yeah makes sense\" than \"!!!\". If YC rejected everyone who was offended by sloppy shortcuts, they would not be YC, and they would have rejected many of their unicorns. Shortcuts are core to the professional practice of founding startups in the culture of YC. Even the sloppy kind that offend people, like Airbnb's launch-era marketing that violated Craigslist's TOS, or Reddit's founders posting under fake accounts. The message of YC during the program is that you have exactly one job: make your key metric (revenue, users, whatever) grow 5%-10% week-over-week. When founders internalize this, they often do work that contains shortcuts, including shortcuts which might offend people. It is a challenge for some people with a professional or personal aversion to sloppy shortcuts. (This isn't to say that sloppy is the standard at YC. \"Sweat the details until 100 users really love your product\" is canonical YC wisdom. Time forces you to be sloppy on everything else. And if you tell a YC partner that you're just buying bot traffic to hit your numbers, they will tell you that is a dumb plan.) reply tptacek 2 hours agorootparentprevThe things you're talking about appear to have happened (or surfaced) after YC accepted them into the Fall cohort. reply threeseed 12 hours agorootparentprev> I don't believe priced, institutional A-round technical due diligence would have turned any of this up I've only done it once but doing a cursory check of the commits and who owns the copyrights etc is pretty fundamental during due diligence. reply tptacek 12 hours agorootparentI'm skeptical.

The cost (in money and time) of adequately vetting every company they've ever invested in would dwarf the cost of this little brouhaha. Even in later rounds due diligence skews non-technical.

Would a bare minimum of due diligence not be ok lol? reply tempusalaria 5 hours agorootparentYC cannot do a ton of due diligence. Their strategy is to back many companies with small amounts of money, basically in the hope that a few companies in the batch end up as unicorns. This means they want to select founders capable of getting those outcomes, which will also select many liars/psychopaths due to the need for variance/risk taking behaviors in these founders. Now is there a problem where YC and many other VCs basically advise founders to commit fraud and lie to customers/stakeholders? Yes but that has nothing to do with YC admissions strategy. I’ve seen many VCs (including YC) advocate for lying and unethical behavior by their founders. It’s a big problem in the startup industry, and often the biggest brunt of this is taken by unsuspecting employees. One reason I would never advise someone to join a startup is the massive prevalence of unethical and dishonest founders. reply tptacek 4 hours agorootparentI have not (W20) seen any instances of YC advising companies to commit fraud. reply skeptrune 14 hours agoprevSubtle touch here in linking repeatedly to Continue and not Pear.

    "originBody": "Oct. 3 (UPI) -- The U.S. Department of Energy Thursday announced a $1.5 billion transmission investment to improve electric grid reliability. The Energy Department said the $1.5 billion will fund four transmission projects \"that will improve grid reliability and resilience, relieve costly transmission congestion, and open access to affordable energy to millions of Americans across the country.\" ADVERTISEMENT \"The U.S. transmission network is the backbone of our nation's electricity system. Though our grid has served U.S. energy needs for more than a century, our country's needs are changing,\" said U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy David Turk in a statement. The projects will increase grid capacity and are funded by the Biden-Harris administration's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Related U.S. replenishes strategic oil reserve after tapping it for Russia's invasion of Ukraine Energy Department grants $2.26B loan for Nevada lithium project Energy Department announces $400M for solar energy in Puerto Rico The projects will enable nearly 1,000 miles of new electric transmission development and 7,100 megawatts of new capacity in Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. The department said the the projects will also create 9,000 good-paying jobs. They include the Aroostook Renewable Project in Maine, the Cimarron Link in Oklahoma, Southern Spirit connecting the Texas grid for the first time to southeastern U.S. power markets and Southline in New Mexico. The Energy Department's National Transmission Planning study released Thursday was meant to be a long-term planning tool. ADVERTISEMENT It found that a substantial expansion of the transmission system throughout the entire contiguous United States would deliver the biggest grid benefits. That could also save the national electric system between $270 billion to $490 billion through 2050. \"The NTP Study is designed to enhance and encourage interregional planning efforts,\" the DOE said in a statement. \"It does not replace industry planning or identify a specific set of transmission lines that should be built. Rather, the NTP Study identifies potential opportunities for industry planners to consider projects that would benefit customers under a wide range of future scenarios.\"",

This is essentially the same dynamic as the home solar problem above. > on the scale of the entire country they're fairly reliable and predictable. That's due to the way the grid itself is structure not how any one power source performs. No source of power is particularly reliable and unexpected maintenance intervals always occur. Point here being, if you try to switch a grid that's based on a mix of sources, over to a grid that isn't, you're probably going to end up with a surprising result or two during that misguided process. reply vitus 19 hours agorootparent>> Let's brainstorm how to decarbonize fertilizer, or concrete. > I don't think you can. I think you should worry more about how concrete and fertilizer get _distributed_. This is essentially the same dynamic as the home solar problem above. Isn't the primary source of CO2 from fertilizer production a byproduct of producing hydrogen gas via steam methane reforming? We can make hydrogen without starting from methane (namely: via electrolysis), but it's not economical in comparison, at this time. (Or clearly able to scale to quite the same degree, for that matter.) But I reject the claim that it's not possible (or, for that matter, that we don't know how to do it). The issue is that the negative externalities from CO2 emissions are not priced in such a way to render existing processes less cost-effective than carbon-free alternatives. That said, I share some of your skepticism regarding how much we can conceivably decarbonize concrete production. reply thinkcontext 20 hours agorootparentprev> home solar should be the way it get the majority of it's power This would be a bad idea as it costs 3x more than utility scale PV. reply akira2501 19 hours agorootparentAren't those cost factors based upon the type of load curves we currently see? Isn't there some reason to suspect that the efficiency rating will drop if we experience much greater offsets between time of generation and time of demand with the types of peaks that EV charging might bring? Wouldn't it be nice to have all this without having to engage with the daunting prospect that is the \"smart grid?\" reply nostrademons 19 hours agorootparentThere's a common misconception that thinks of electricity like a fluid or supply chain. If you generate more of it locally, it reduces the load on the grid and you need to spend proportionally less on distribution. This is false: the actual electrons in AC move a small fraction of a millimeter, electrical potential travels at a speed that is effectively the speed of light, electric conductivity is all-or-nothing, and if you need the grid at all, you need the full expense of building and maintaining that segment of grid. You probably need some form of grid if only to even out load spikes (running your clothes dryer often takes 20x the power as all the lights and electronics in your house, but not everybody runs their clothes dryer at once) and manage seasonal variations (solar power, particularly in northern latitudes, can be 5x higher in summer than winter, which is not a problem when you're powering southerly residents' air conditioning but is when your cold house doesn't need A/C). The load curve over time only matters to the extent that you can entirely remove remote consumption. You can use batteries to smooth out night and day. You can reduce the use of batteries by sponsoring V2H EVs and workplace charging, so that you charge your EV when solar is abundant in the day, and then drive it home to power the rest of your house. But this does nothing for summer vs. winter, it does nothing for wanting to run a clothes dryer or space heater (many of which actually exceed the max power draw of a whole-home battery), it does nothing for wanting to charge your EV up to full before a long road trip. I am in favor of microgrids, but this is more a statement that we should rationalize our distribution infrastructure rather than that get rid of the grid entirely. When power plants were large centralized industrial buildings that needed a steady supply of fossil fuels delivered by road or rail, it made sense to just build a few of them and then have a huge grid that distributed the electricity everywhere. When you can put solar on every rooftop, it might make more sense to have the smaller remote communities all invest in rooftop or community solar, wire them up in a microgrid of ~1000 homes, put in a big utility-scale battery, but otherwise disconnect them from the main grid so that power lines don't go through tinder forests. And then the big cities draw from big utility-scale solar and wind farms in the desert, connected by conventional power lines along major transportation arteries. But there's still some grid there, it's just a smaller, cheaper grid where you make the connections that are easy to maintain and distribute generation to the remote communities that can run their own self-sufficient grid. reply thinkcontext 19 hours agorootparentprev> Aren't those cost factors based upon the type of load curves we currently see? No, that would effect the price the electricity would fetch, not the cost to buy panels and put them on the grid. Home rooftop panels are so much more expensive because of economies of scale. reply recursive 19 hours agorootparentprevAnd it still costs well below what my utility charges me. If the real cost of a thing is supposed to weigh into my incentives, I need to be able to buy it for that price. reply thinkcontext 19 hours agorootparentThe 30% federal tax credit is not a good deal for taxpayers. You probably also benefit from net metering and the utility probably doesn't recover infrastructure costs from you due to your reduced usage. That's a bad deal for ratepayers. reply pstuart 19 hours agorootparentprevPorque no los dos? Home solar/battery would provide a level of independence for each home and would lessen the load on the grid for air conditioning alone (almost 20% of grid utilization). More of both! reply thinkcontext 19 hours agorootparentAt 3x the price it's not a good deal for taxpayers or ratepayers. If homeowners want to do it for independence that's fine but the cost should be on them. I'm fine with giving them a credit for reduced ghg emissions. reply pstuart 14 hours agorootparentSure, let them pay for it. Perhaps a low interest loan to help incentivize it but theoretically it pays off in 6-9 years and then free power and less grid load, and the loan is paid back. reply s1artibartfast 20 hours agorootparentprevEven if you have rooftop solar, you still need a grid capable of supplying 100% the power because there are cloudy days and long sequences of cloudy days reply akira2501 20 hours agorootparentYes but EVs have batteries and people don't drive them to depletion every single day. I should have been more clear, I didn't mean the whole house, I meant the just the EVs specifically, for now. It would completely alleviate their impact on the grid as a consumer power source. reply s1artibartfast 17 hours agorootparentEven then, there are huge efficiencies of scale favoring industrial solar over rooftop. The cost per KWH is at least 10x lower, and getting better. This is more than enough to counter the distribution costs. The same is true for industrial storage. All told, the only upside to rooftop is avoiding grid operators, Which will just raise their price to counteract any savings on the part of homeowners. everyone is still stuck with them unless they go to municipal operators reply dangrossman 19 hours agorootparentprevThe 800,000 American homes that added solar to their roofs last year cover 100% of the electric used by every EV that's ever been sold in the US. They cover the electric usage by the EVs purchased last year by multiples. At this rate, you can do nothing and residential solar will already add much more capacity to the grid than EVs are taking from it. reply SoftTalker 18 hours agorootparentThat’s only because a tiny number of EVs have been sold. We’re being told it’s the only option by 2035. reply dangrossman 17 hours agorootparentPotentially FROM 2035 only electric vehicles would be for sale on new car lots. Most gas cars already on the road will still be there for 10-20 years after that. By then, Edison Electric Institute (a trade-group for utility companies) predicts 70-80 million EVs on the road in the US. By 2030, 15% of US homes are forecast to have solar on the roof, which would continue covering 100% of the electric use of the nation's electric vehicles. The average residential solar installation generates enough energy to cover a 14,000-mile-per-year vehicle's charging 3.5-4.5 times over. Each house with solar panels generates enough energy for its cars and some of the neighbors' cars that don't have solar. I put solar on my roof two years ago. It's the average system size, taking up 2/3rds of the south-facing side of my roof. It cost 1/3rd the price of my car to get installed, it completely covers my fuel use for two cars, and it covers 100% of my home electric and heating bill 9 months out of the year. EV electric use isn't a problem utilities need to solve so much as a solution to a lot of utilities' problems. 70 million EVs are many gigawatt-hours of battery storage that will be connected to the grid bidirectionally in the not-distant future. They can store renewable energy during the day and feed it back to the grid at night, they can power houses and businesses during peak load events so peaker plants don't need to be spun up, and lots of other things that will make the grid more resilient and cheaper to operate without significant capital expense to the utilities. reply maxerickson 17 hours agorootparentIt's likely enough that there is a step change in technology by 2035 that pushes away from current estimates. reply onlyrealcuzzo 21 hours agoparentprev> Let's brainstorm how to decarbonize fertilize Haber-Bosch process with green hydrogen... reply colechristensen 21 hours agoparentprevIndeed, it is an annoying argument that boils down to \"What will we do!? Current supply doesn't meet future demand!\" >That being said I am really glad to see more grid buildup! Especially as more renewables hit the grid. While locally intermittent, on the scale of the entire country they're fairly reliable and predictable. Here's what's coming that makes people uncomfortable and they don't expect or understand: Oversupply. Seasonally, during good weather, during certain times of day, there's just going to be more electricity produced by solar/wind than anybody needs. You don't need to store it or use every bit of it, the grid is going to say no and because they're just solar panels, they are perfectly fine. Solar electricity is so cheap that it just doesn't matter. What customers will end up paying for is capacity instead of usage. Maybe there will be instantaneous pricing that will drop to zero-ish intermittently and consumers and industry will find ways of profiting from that. But a whole lot of \"problems\" people complain about with solar are very much reduced if you just have \"too many\" solar panels. And they're cheap so who cares? Like what would California do with way too much solar power? Boil water in the cheapest possible infrastructure for desalination, an enormous still. Very energy inefficient, but who cares if you just have the amps to spare? There are a lot of industrial processes where energy efficiency is a problem and so simple processes are replaced by more efficient complex ones... but if you have free energy building out that simple infrastructure to only run when energy is cheap suddenly makes a lot more sense. reply jujube3 20 hours agorootparentThe \"annoying\" thing that the naysayers are pointing out is that we are not building enough power generation to support universally switching to electric vehicles. Unfortunately this \"annoyance\" happens to be true. Also, California struggles to get new desalination plants through environmental approval. And most industrial processes need continuous power, not just power whenever the weather looks good. reply doublepg23 20 hours agorootparentSpeaking to people in the industry I get a vibe that there’s permits and regulations that are severely bottlenecking new green energy deployments https://finance-commerce.com/2024/03/report-inefficient-perm... reply colechristensen 19 hours agorootparentprevEh. Solar installs are growing faster than electric car purchases. (roughly 30% YoY vs 20%) People just make up statistics in their head supporting their position. Go look for the statistics for vehicle purchases and PV installs. PV installs are outpacing anyone's previous estimation by a significant margin. reply jujube3 19 hours agorootparentI have solar panels myself. But let's be honest about what the technology can and cannot do. Solar only makes energy while the sun is shining. Most people want to charge their electric cars at night, unless their employer has a charging station ready for them to use at work. (Many employers have a small number of charging stations for this purpose, but none of them that I'm aware of have enough charging stations for everyone.) reply recursive 19 hours agorootparentDespite the rapid growth in solar deployments, time-of-use charges for power are generally still lowest in the middle of the night.

There is no breakthrough technology to be made here, just make charging ports available everywhere so that people can charge during the day. This will make peak consumption happen during the day and PV viable. During the night, you can exploit CSP with salt batteries. Balance your electric usage and you aren now 100% fully electric.

They include the Aroostook Renewable Project in Maine, the Cimarron Link in Oklahoma, Southern Spirit connecting the Texas grid for the first time to southeastern U.S. power markets and Southline in New Mexico. The Energy Department's National Transmission Planning study released Thursday was meant to be a long-term planning tool.

Southern Spirit is a new HVDC transmission line (which is awesome and what we need, more please!). There are already Eastern DC grid ties.

Could someone shed more light on that for me? reply tech_ken 19 hours agorootparentDefinitely not the first, surprisingly hard to find clear data about the endpoints of the ties themselves but this random court document has a fairly clear diagram on page 3: https://www.nrg.com/assets/documents/energy-policy/ferc_work... ERCOT also reports flows for the four existing DC ties: https://www.ercot.com/gridmktinfo/dashboards/dctieflows With that said the biggest tie is like half a GW, so my guess is that they used the term \"power markets\"\" rather than \"power grids\" because the current links don't really function as a way to transfer bulk power between markets, even if the Texas grid is technically already connected outwards. Like in an emergency they can import a miniscule amount of power, but nobody's going to be seriously arb'ing power with the existing ties. reply smitty1110 19 hours agorootparentprevThe Wikipedia article[3] is not entirely clear and has a shocking failure to cite sources, but it claims the the Texas grid connects to the Eastern grid in two place with DC lines, and has an AC connection that has only been activated once in the Houston area.

It is a High-voltage DC transmission line and the infrastructure to connect to it. It runs HVDC, so there's no grid synchronization needed. The grid will still be \"isolated\", as there are already DC ties. reply AtlasBarfed 19 hours agoparentprevI think our energy policy the domestic kind is stuck in a centralized supply-centric policy, when home solar and storage offer a fundamental alternative. Home solar combined with storage that can enable house to be temporarily or perhaps even permanently off-grid increases resiliency of communities tremendously during emergency situations, which are more common than you think they are. In addition, by encouraging policies that will help drop the price of home solar closer to grid solar prices and storage costs, you may eliminate a lot of the need to upgrade the grid in order to provide home charging for EVs. I don't deny the grid needs massive amounts of investment in order to enable it to adapt to new pricing, realities of solar and wind. But I dislike that the home aspect of power generation is essentially ignored at the federal policy level from department of energy. reply Retric 19 hours agorootparentRegions are all going to experience the same weather at the same time so long distance transmission saves you a vast investment in solar panels and local batteries at 99.9% uptime. The huge advantage of local solar is intermittent power is useful even if it’s not that reliable. Being able to run a fridge/freezer 8 hours a day dramatically extends how long it takes food to spoil in the summer. Similarly there’s a huge difference in comfortable temperatures and what’s required to avoid your pipes freezing. Obviously larger investments mean you’re more comfortable in a major disaster, but a mid sized solar install + backup generator + a grid connection is generally more cost effective. reply seadan83 19 hours agorootparentYou undersell the benefits of intermittent power.

State or even sub-State policy is way better suited to manage the highly heterogeneous landscape of generating power at individual homes, both because the problem is smaller $ but also just has a lot of little regional wrinkles (what power mix is best for the location, what does existing land-use look like, etc). All IMO of course, also the Federal gov't has done a lot to support basic research for solar on a very general level, I think it's just a difference of what scope best suits which governing body. reply FactKnower69 21 hours agoprevnext [9 more] [flagged] jncfhnb 21 hours agoparentThe Biden administration has spent many multiples more on climate / grid investments than on the Ukraine war reply JumpCrisscross 20 hours agorootparentWould add that U.S. military spending as a fraction of GDP is close to post-WWII lows [1].

    "originLink": "https://nv1t.github.io/blog/kekz-headphones/",
    "originBody": "Reverse Engineering and Dismantling Kekz Headphones 02.10.2024 Close to a year ago, I stumbled upon the Kekz Headphones, which seemed like an interesting approach on the whole digital audio device space. They claimed to work without any internet connection and all of the content already on the headphones itself. They are On-Ear Headphones, which work by placing a small chip (I call them “Kekz” or “Cookie”) into a little nook on the side and it plays an audio story. I was intrigued, because there were some speculations going around, how they operate with those “Kekz”-Chips. I invite you to join me on a journey into the inner workings of those headphones. We will talk about accessing the encrypted files on the device, breaking the crypto and discovering disclosure of data from customers. Opening the headphones I sourced my headphones from “Kleinanzeigen” (something like craigslist, or facebook marketplace) to keep the research costs low and maybe get some cookies with it. I got the wonderful colour red. After opening up the headphones, you will have 2 PCBs which are connected by 7 wires. Two speakers and a battery. The chinese lettering in the silk layer is just the colour description of the wires itself. You don’t see any interesting breakout for anything here. The Pin-Row in the middle is for the NFC antenna on the other side of the board. You see two Vias with the label DP and DM, which is on the USB line. This will be interesting at a later stage. The first thing that stands out is a Jieli Chip, which appears to be the core component of the entire headset. These chips are mostly used in cheap Bluetooth hardware and are difficult to determine which version is currently running. From a quick search i think this Chip (AC21BP0H733-51C8) is probably some version of the AC6951C. The chip on the bottom, TSC9883, is a NFC Reader IC, which I don’t care for. It has two infrared proximity sensors to detect the ear and cookie insertion to prevent from reading a cookie more than once and stop when taking off the headphones. On the right of the PCB you see an SD cardholder, which has a 32gb SD Card on the inside. The SD Card has a Fat32 Filesystem with 276 directories. There is an update, which ups that to around 369 directories. Each directory has multiple files with the extension kez, which are most likely encrypted. Interestingly, I was looking at the SD Card before and I connected the headphones to the accompanied Windows Application. After the connection, the files were gone and I was kinda puzzled, until I found the following code in the application: public static void HideFolders() {if (Globals.Drive == null){ throw new Exception(\"Drive not set\");}string drive = Globals.Drive;string[] directories = Directory.GetDirectories(drive);for (int i = 0; ihf mfu info [=] --- Tag Information -------------------------- [+] TYPE: NTAG 213 144bytes (NT2H1311G0DU) [=] --- Tag Counter [=] [02]: 00 00 00 [+] - 00 tearing ( fail ) [=] --- Tag Signature [=] Elliptic curve parameters: NID_secp128r1 [=] TAG IC Signature: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 [+] Signature verification ( fail ) [=] --- Tag Version [=] Raw bytes: 00 53 04 02 01 00 0F 03 [=] Vendor ID: 53, Shanghai Feiju Microelectronics Co.

It then tries to read the 0 block and the 7th block. The 0 block is only the ID of the tag which bears no relevance. If we look into the 7th block and further, though, we can see a string “en002071696263”, if we dump the whole cookie. That is quite interesting.

Therefore, we can clone cookies now. Even if the outside looks different, it plays the same content and is a bunny by heart. At this point, it is possible to read this string and build a database to decrypt all content. We just have access to the ones we have already seen. As those tags are 13.35Mhz, is is also possible to write them by your Phones NFC (you will see this later on) What does this string mean? We have this weird string en002071696263 which has something to do with playing the content and we know the content is probably one of those directories we did see earlier on the SD-card. If we begin to delete one directory after the other, we can determine which directory has the desired content inside. For this cookie, the directory is 0020. If we look into other cookies we will see the structure is: Cookie String Cookie Crew 1 en 0020 71696263 Cookie Crew 1 en 0020 71696263 Feuerwehrman Sam en 0002 6161777a Was ist Was en 0031 67766172 Hotzenplotz en 0006 73657463 I can move those files to a directory 4444, the files will be played, but garbage output. This means the 0020 is important for the decryption phase. Renaming 0020 to something else will result in an “unbaked” Chip. If i move the files to a directory 1020, they will be played just fine, after rebranding the chip to en102071696263 We could try more stuff to understand the encryption, but…let us recap the four integers number after en is the directory they are partially important for the decryption. four bytes in the end, we don’t know the purpose, but they are essential for decryption Moar…give me moaaaaar The only crux is, we only can decrypt stuff we have already seen, but i want to have an attack on everything. We could brute force the 4 Bytes. Without any further assumption, this would be 255**4 possibilities, which is way to many. But if we look into the last four bytes more closely, we can assume one last thing: In our examples, the four bytes are hex representation for four small letters from the alphabet. With this assumption, we can bring this down to 26**4. That sounds more reasonable, but can we attack the crypto further? Lucky for us, they published an application which can write a cookie named “Wunderkekz”. This App can encrypt arbitrary MP3 files to the correct kez-Fileformat. And more Lucky for us: it is written in csharp. Therefore, we can take a look into the encryption routine (i translated it to python, variable naming directly from the original decompilation): str_crumb_hex = sys.argv[3] # #\"E9-F5-33-6B\" # Assuming this value based on your previous examples directory_raw = sys.argv[1] filename_raw = sys.argv[2] directory = bytearray(directory_raw, 'ascii') filename = bytearray(filename_raw, 'ascii') array = str_crumb_hex.split(') b, b2, b3, b4 = [int(value, 16) for value in array] str_crumb_hex_unpacked = bytearray([b, b2, b3, b4]) b5 = (str_crumb_hex_unpacked[0] ^ directory[0]) >> 4 b6 = (str_crumb_hex_unpacked[1] ^ directory[1]) >> 5 b7 = (str_crumb_hex_unpacked[2] ^ directory[2]) >> 3 b8 = (str_crumb_hex_unpacked[3] ^ directory[3]) >> 2 array3 = bytearray([b5, b6, b7, b8]) b9 = (filename[0] + filename[1] + filename[2] + filename[3]) % 10 - 1 if b9 >= 9 or b9 > (8 - b9))(array4[i] > 4 b6 = (str_crumb_hex_unpacked[1] ^ directory[1]) >> 5 b7 = (str_crumb_hex_unpacked[2] ^ directory[2]) >> 3 b8 = (str_crumb_hex_unpacked[3] ^ directory[3]) >> 2 array3 = bytearray([b5, b6, b7, b8]) ret[f\"{array3[0]},{array3[1]},{array3[2]},{array3[3]}\"] = array3return ret Currently, i take one file, calculate the shift b9 and decrypt the file multiple times for every possible key found from the pre_calc_array3 method print(\"Starting Brute Force\") for i in tqdm(array3_poss):na = i.replace(',',')array3 = array3_poss[i] #return Truewith open(\"%s/%s/%s.kez\" % (location,directory.decode('utf-8'),filename.decode('utf-8')),'rb') as fh: array6 = bytearray(fh.read()) array4_reversed = bytearray(len(array6)) for i in range(len(array6)):# Reverse the bitwise rotationarray4_reversed[i] = ((array6[i] > b9)) & 0xFF# Reverse the XOR operationarray4_reversed[i] ^= array3[i % 4]with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile('wb') as fh: fh.write(array4_reversed) returned_output = os.popen(\"mpck -q %s\" % (fh.name)).read() if \": Ok\" in returned_output:break else:return False The Main Problem relies on checking for a valid MP3 files. Because of the shift and the 4 byte xor key you need to check every MP3 Frame, which takes time on larger files. I currently use an external tool called “checkmate”. It has the most robust MP3 validity solution. It basically checks every Frame. (Maybe Fork and implement it in Python? ) Do you have an App for that? I’ve created, for my use and not publication, a small application to read and write the Cookies with my mobile phone. “Kekzmonster” takes in QR Codes, or reads the cookie with NFC and can back up all cookies in my possession. It is not intended to unlock content, which i don’t own. The Encryption/Decryption String can be written to any cookie with this application as well. Files without breaking the headphones We can now encrypt, decrypt and brute force the cookie content, but you won’t get ny files onto or from the headset on your own, without opening up the headphones and accessing the SD Card. Connecting the headphones to an USB port only charges them and they are listed within Linux as HID Device: Bus 003 Device 012: ID 33f5:0001 Kekz Gmbh kekz headphone Device Descriptor: bLength 18 bDescriptorType 1 bcdUSB 1.10 bDeviceClass 0 bDeviceSubClass 0 bDeviceProtocol 0 bMaxPacketSize0 64 idVendor 0x33f5 idProduct 0x0001 bcdDevice 1.00 iManufacturer 1 Kekz Gmbh iProduct 2 kekz headphone iSerial 3 2021082200001002 bNumConfigurations 1 Configuration Descriptor: bLength 9 bDescriptorType 2 wTotalLength 0x0022 bNumInterfaces 1 bConfigurationValue 1 iConfiguration 0 bmAttributes 0x80 (Bus Powered) MaxPower 100mA Interface Descriptor: bLength 9 bDescriptorType 4 bInterfaceNumber 0 bAlternateSetting 0 bNumEndpoints 1 bInterfaceClass 3 Human Interface Device bInterfaceSubClass 0 bInterfaceProtocol 0 iInterface 0 HID Device Descriptor: bLength 9 bDescriptorType 33 bcdHID 2.01 bCountryCode 0 Not supported bNumDescriptors 1 bDescriptorType 34 Report wDescriptorLength 27 Report Descriptors: ** UNAVAILABLE ** Endpoint Descriptor: bLength 7 bDescriptorType 5 bEndpointAddress 0x82 EP 2 IN bmAttributes 3 Transfer Type Interrupt Synch Type None Usage Type Data wMaxPacketSize 0x0008 1x 8 bytes bInterval 1 Device Status: 0x0000 (Bus Powered) We talked about the two vias DP and DM. Interestingly, we are not finding any other connection to the chip, no UART, no JTAG, nothing. Looking into Jie-li, they are pretty weird chips. The documentation and various sources, state they are programmed over the normal USB Data lines. There are two main methods to control them. Signaling DP/DM on USB The normal way to put the chip into DFU mode would be sending a custom pullup/pulldown over the D+ and D-: After this signal, D+ and D- gets pulled to Ground for 2ms and the device boots up into the DFU Mode with uboot. There are special programmer to achieve this, but i’ve seen a post, where somebody build his/her own programmer with an arduino. I tried to achieve this with a raspberry pi pico and couldn’t get the Chip into DFU mode. I even tried to use the special programmer for this, but still…no luck. In addition, i thought, the windows application does some magic to connect them and read/write content of the headphones. How?! That has to work without any extra hardware and you don’t have such control over the USB data lines from an operating system application. HID Communication The other more convenient option for these chips are: they might have special commands over HID which reconnect them in different stages. These are not really documented and can be different for each chip, as it depends on the firmware (i think so, that is what i got in rough translations). DFU Mode Using the Python HID Library, this is effortless. The important thing to know is the dfu_payload which get’s send to the device. dfu_payload = [0, 85, 170, 1, 2, 3, 4, 170, 85] device = hid.device() device.open(vendor_id,product_id) print(f\"HID: Found Device: {device.get_manufacturer_string()} {device.get_product_string()}\") data = bytearray(byte_array_left_pad([0, 33, 9, 0, 2, 1, 0, 64, 0], 0, 65)) buffer_payload = bytearray(byte_array_left_pad(dfu_payload, 0, 65)) device.write(data) try:device.write(buffer_payload) except Exception:print(\"Communication Error or DFU Success...\") You can now flash new firmware on the chip. Connecting to copy The same will go for the connection of the headphones as “normal USB Stick”. The payload is a little bit different: connect_payload = [0, 85, 170, 3, 1, 41, 40, 170, 85] After sending this payload, the headphones disconnect and reconnect as a normal USB Stick. Keep in mind, that if you run or ran the application, the files are with the Windows hidden attribute. Success…we can now encrypt custom files, put them into custom directories and write our own cookies. We now fully pwn the headphones. Other Discoveries Browsing through the source code of the application and website, i found other things, which are weren’t mentioned before. Creating a list of all public cookies There are multiple cookies, which are not public yet, but as we know from above, we can decrypt all of them. Unfortunately, we have no idea, what is in those directories. But, i found a pretty neat trick to generate a list of all already public cookies: The Kekz Webshop is/was built upon a WordPress installation. Fortunately for us, the upload’s directory has directory listing enabled. I can download all images ever shown in this webshop. These files are pretty important for us, because you see, every cookie has an ID, for “Raeuber Hotzenplotz”, it is 1-1.0066 and interestingly, the directory is “0006”. If we look into all the images, we can see product images from the packaging as well. This packaging has a barcode with this ID as well. Therefore, we can automate downloading all images and scanning for barcodes and extracting the directory. With this information, we can determine about 1/3 of the content is officially released already in the shop. Moar Wunderkekze Apparently the directories 0990 until 0996 are used for the WunderKekzChips, whereas Green, Orange and Purple are already in circulation. Maybe the plan is to add more cookies to the mix. return wChip switch {WunderkekzChipEnum.Green => \"0996\",WunderkekzChipEnum.Orange => \"0995\",WunderkekzChipEnum.Purple => \"0994\",WunderkekzChipEnum.NineThree => \"0993\",WunderkekzChipEnum.NineTwo => \"0992\",WunderkekzChipEnum.NineOne => \"0991\",WunderkekzChipEnum.NineZero => \"0990\",_ => \"0035\", }; User Data collection This topic is not so nice. While looking through the application, i discovered some not so nice stuff, which wasn’t mentioned in the privacy policy anywhere (Archive). Point 1.10 about the Kekz App was added at a later stage, after my disclosure emails. ID3 Tags ID3 tags are metadata containers used to store information about an MP3 audio file, such as the song’s title, artist, album, and other details. They help media players and libraries organize and display information about the audio files. The ID3 tags are stored within the MP3 file itself. If you are using an Wunderkekz from the Kekz company, and you use the standard windows application (because there is no other), the ID3 tags are uploaded to an Azure Cosmos database. WunderkekzUploadMetadata wunderkekzUploadMetadata = new WunderkekzUploadMetadata(); try {FileInfo fileInfo = new FileInfo(path);wunderkekzUploadMetadata.FileName = fileInfo.Name;wunderkekzUploadMetadata.FileSize = fileInfo.Length;wunderkekzUploadMetadata.EventId = Globals.CurrentEventId;using TagLib.File file = TagLib.File.Create(path);wunderkekzUploadMetadata.Id3Title = file.Tag.Title;wunderkekzUploadMetadata.Id3Artist = file.Tag.FirstPerformer;wunderkekzUploadMetadata.Id3Album = file.Tag.Album;wunderkekzUploadMetadata.Id3Year = (int)file.Tag.Year;wunderkekzUploadMetadata.Id3Track = (int)file.Tag.Track;wunderkekzUploadMetadata.Id3Genre = file.Tag.FirstGenre;wunderkekzUploadMetadata.Id3Comment = file.Tag.Comment;return wunderkekzUploadMetadata; } catch (Exception ex) {Trace.WriteLine(ex.Message);return wunderkekzUploadMetadata; } Geolocation Furthermore, the application tries not only uploading the ID3 Tags, but also geolocation data, which is most likely gathered from Wi-Fi triangulation from windows itself. The MainView calls a GeoLocation Service: public async Task GetCurrentLocation() {string strLocation = null;try{ Location lastLocation = await Geolocation.Default.GetLastKnownLocationAsync(); Location location = (await Geolocation.Default.GetLocationAsync()) ?? lastLocation; if (location != null) {DefaultInterpolatedStringHandler defaultInterpolatedStringHandler = new DefaultInterpolatedStringHandler(1, 2);defaultInterpolatedStringHandler.AppendFormatted(location.Latitude);defaultInterpolatedStringHandler.AppendLiteral(\":\");defaultInterpolatedStringHandler.AppendFormatted(location.Longitude);strLocation = (Globals.GeoData = defaultInterpolatedStringHandler.ToStringAndClear()); } return strLocation;}catch (Exception ex){ Console.WriteLine(ex.Message); return strLocation;} } This is also save within the Cosmos DB as seen in already present locations: { \"id\": \"29c01f2e-f4cd-4671-9257-a7432b15fc0d\", \"EventTypeId\": \"1\", \"DeviceGuid\": \"3cf4caf5-3f6e-4199-bbf0-ba1abe69a6e9\", \"WunderkekzId\": \"994\", \"GeoLocation\": \"48,xxxxxxxxxxxxxx:11,xxxxxxxxxxxxxx\", \"UploadedAt\": \"2023-10-24T21:03:28.4478194+02:00\", \"_rid\": \"E9MJAL2dw5WRAAAAAAAAAA==\", \"_self\": \"dbs/E9MJAA==/colls/E9MJAL2dw5U=/docs/E9MJAL2dw5WRAAAAAAAAAA==/\", \"_etag\": \"\\\"3e009e56-0000-0d00-0000-653815010000\\\"\", \"_attachments\": \"attachments/\", \"_ts\": 1698174209 } { \"id\": \"e3e1482f-1b62-4780-aff1-70593aa79d56\", \"EventTypeId\": \"1\", \"DeviceGuid\": \"a7bc4474-570d-4ece-b1f5-aa3e9a36c1ce\", \"WunderkekzId\": \"995\", \"GeoLocation\": \"48,xxxxxxxxxxxxxx:11,xxxxxxxxxxxxxx\", \"UploadedAt\": \"2023-10-24T21:17:59.1191164+02:00\", \"_rid\": \"E9MJAL2dw5WSAAAAAAAAAA==\", \"_self\": \"dbs/E9MJAA==/colls/E9MJAL2dw5U=/docs/E9MJAL2dw5WSAAAAAAAAAA==/\", \"_etag\": \"\\\"3e009f58-0000-0d00-0000-653818690000\\\"\", \"_attachments\": \"attachments/\", \"_ts\": 1698175081 } Because the Geolocation data is only cross-referenced with die Device GUID and not the content itself, the enforcement for regional content does not make sense in their newest copy of the privacy policy. PII Data There is some PII Data involved, but i think those are just test data from some ordering processes. Even the headphones can only be cross-linked to the geolocation data and not the content played. It could maybe be cross-referenced with the time, but haven’t checked into that, as the main concern is the data being public. Who is Special? In addition, the connection string to this Azure cosmos database is accessible within the Decompilation of the application itself and therefore is disclosed. So everybody looking into the source code of the application can get information on usage of the headphones, location of some of the headphones and files listened too. There is some usage in Dublin as well, but only wanted to include the DACH Region. Normalizing ID3 Tag Meta Data from various sources is really cumbersome. I tried, but i gave up pretty quickly, because it was just my own curiosity what kids are listening to these days. Let me say that: Bibi Blocksberg, Bibi & Tina, Benjaming Bluemchen, Paw Patrol, Drei Fragezeichen, and various songs, are the all time favourits. (for the english speaking community: except Paw Patrol, are all Children Listening experiences from germany, which exist since 1970 or 1980) Disclosure 19.10.2023: i reached out to the CTO of Kekz, who told me, he developed the headphones, but is no longer associated with the company. To my knowledge, he forwarded the information to the CEOs. Never heard back. 27.02.2024: i reached out to the CEOs of Kekz (Adin and Carl) with my security concerns. Never heard back. -> A few weeks later, the privacy policy was changed to include the Kekz-App, therefore i conclude my email was read Open Questions What is the full functionality of the Jieli-Chip? These chips are strange and challenging to identify. I only guessed which Chip it could be and got lucky with the HID Interface through the Windows Application What does the other Jieli-Chip on the other PCB Do? A full application to create a custom SD Card with a content manager to not only support the content already present on the Kekz Headphones, but furthermore all non-taken directories. Are there more HID commands? How good is the Geolocation Data sourced from a Laptop, which is probably triangulated Wifi Signals? Do the 30m-500m from the privacy policy hold up, or can it be narrowed down? What is this PII Data in the Azure cosmos database? There are most likely more open questions on this one. You are welcome to research further on your own.

Without any further assumption, this would be 255**4 possibilities, which is way to many. The author comes up with a much simpler attack in the end, but a 2^32 bruteforce would also have been perfectly doable, taking ~seconds with optimized code on modern hardware. reply nuitgaspard 4 hours agoparentAgreed :) the problem is though, that you have to decrypt the whole file everytime and not just a few bytes, which makes this still a little bit longer. You get files, which identify as mp3, but are garbage, and have to check multiple frames. But agreed bruteforcing 2*32 key is possible. The \"way to many\" was: \"Way to many \" for my taste. reply Jerrrrrrry 2 hours agorootparent\"ID3\" should be the first few bytes. You could also put garbage data in nearly every frame and most modern codecs will fit it the best they can - for mp3 anyway. reply nuitgaspard 33 minutes agorootparentJap...Checking for ID3 is not good enough in checking for correctly decrypted MP3. Brute Forcing with only small letters, you get approx 43k possibilities with \"ID3\" as the first 3 letters, that makes ~10% of all 26*4 possibilities. Jap, you only have to decrypt those 43k possibilities, but you have to look at the whole file. Even if you have garbage in the file, it is not the correct file, as the codec will ignore it, and the output is garbage. I haven't tried how many of these 43k actually work, or give you at least partialy good result. reply consp 4 hours agoparentprevWhile I agree, isn't figuring out what kind of obfuscation they used is part of the fun? reply finaard 6 hours agoprevThis is pretty interesting to me for two reasons. First, I just came back from Germany where I've seen that thing in a shop. Didn't have much time to investigate due to the kids, but guessed that it's just NFC chips with data on the headphores. Second, I've been thinking about building a simple MP3-player for my kids for quite a while now, and (minus the obfuscation there) that's not far from what I've been thinking about doing. reply netsharc 3 hours agoparentI was thinking of a steampunk music player using floppy disks: store a 32-bit (4 billion songs should be enough right?) ID onto a floppy, and have a player (it can be a Raspberry Pi with a USB floppy drive) read the ID, lookup the MP3 the ID corresponds to and play the MP3 from an attached storage device. Because floppies get bad sectors, the ID should be stored repeatedly on it, 4 bytes repeated to fill 1.38 MB should be redundant enough! I suppose without ID's, one can also store the artist name and song title, and do some text search to find the MP3. Or a YouTube video. reply finaard 3 hours agorootparentI was thinking child friendly, so using NFC tags isn't such a bad idea - plus I have a few hundred spare ones in nice plastic casings. I'd also just store IDs on them, and either have the media files preloaded (as seems to be the case here), or have it download it from my media server on first use. Other thing I want (which they don't do) is the ability of resuming playback at the same position, even when putting it into a different player - that's one reason I still have some audio cassettes for the kids. No other medium I'm aware of does that kind of easy state saving. My idea there is to have the tags locked in the player in a way that gives me enough time to write the position if the user tries to remove it. reply nuitgaspard 4 hours agoparentprevThere have been multiple devices. I have been looking into the jooki box as well, which is quite hackable, tonibox is nice hardware (with already good firmware replacement), yoto is weird. reply taldo 5 hours agoparentprevThere's also yotoplay.com, although that one does seem to require wi-fi and cloud thingies. reply dud3333 4 hours agoparentprevGoogle tonuino. There are readymade pcbs you can buy for it reply zkirill 6 hours agoprevAwesome article. Just wondering, how can a hardware company voluntarily submit their device for reverse engineering and dismantling as a show of good faith? Given the right circumstances this is basically a free security audit and marketing for the company. reply wpietri 6 hours agoparentIf a company wants somebody to do a hardware audit for marketing purposes, they should pay money for that. Please fairly value people's labor, especially when you seek to profit from it. reply cheschire 6 hours agorootparentWell, influencers are able to work out alternative means of compensation because the content is more valuable than the work performed. For example a blogger that is renowned for teardowns might do the work in exchange for access to early release models so that their content is highly relevant. That is worth more than the hourly cost to perform the teardown work. Compensation negotiation is part of the art of that deal. reply wpietri 6 hours agorootparentIf an influencer is indeed able to monetize the content sufficient to match market price for the labor, then sure, that is also fairly valuing people's labor. But that's definitely not what's happening here. reply Jerrrrrrry 42 minutes agorootparentright circumstances reply bigallen 6 hours agorootparentprevIf someone wants to do the hardware audit for free, or in exchange for some kind of promotional exchange, is that a bad thing? I’d breakdown a lot of devices if I could get a duplicate one intact, for free reply wpietri 6 hours agorootparentThis was a low-priced consumer good, so I don't think anything is stopping you from doing teardowns like this on your own. reply dylan604 4 hours agoparentprevThey could just provided schematics, blueprints, parts explosion graphics, etc. I have been a fan of the Sony MDR-7502 headphones since Moses was in a basket. They provide an explosion of each of the parts and their numbers so that you can order replacements. Granted, these are \"old skool\" dumb wired headphones, so no software is needed, nor are chips necessary to look up and what not. reply spookie 4 hours agorootparentSame for the MDR-7506! Speaking of wireless, their battery problems over time have already bit me, will continue buying \"dumb\" ones in the future. reply Retr0id 4 hours agoparentprevAny company with sufficiently interesting hardware is welcome to send me a copy. Most hardware isn't very interesting though, so they'd likely have to pay me too. reply justinclift 6 hours agoprevUgh: ... the application tries not only uploading the ID3 Tags, but also geolocation data, which is most likely gathered from Wi-Fi triangulation from windows itself.
