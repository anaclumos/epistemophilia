Brand new interviews with the Half-Life 2 dev team! Our Half-Life 1 25th anniversary documentary went so well that we invited Secret Tape back to make another one—this time focusing on Half-Life 2. And it's about a lot more than just the making of a game. Running out of money. Getting hacked, and an early version being leaked online. Being sued by our publisher. Trying to build Steam. It's all in there! Brand new interviews with the Half-Life 2 dev team! Our Half-Life 1 25th anniversary documentary went so well that we invited Secret Tape back to make another one—this time focusing on Half-Life 2. And it's about a lot more than just the making of a game. Running out of money. Getting hacked, and an early version being leaked online. Being sued by our publisher. Trying to build Steam. It's all in there! The 20th Anniversary Update for Half-Life 2 includes: New Features Episode One and Two Expansions in the box Half-Life 2 now includes the complete Episode One and Episode Two expansions along with the base game. They’re accessible from the main menu, and you will automatically advance to the next expansion after completing each one. Half-Life 2 Developer Commentary When we shipped \"Lost Coast\" a year after Half-Life 2, we included an interactive developer commentary mode to offer interested players a deep dive into the new technology that inspired the demo. We did it again for every Half-Life and Portal game afterwards, but Half-Life 2 itself never had commentary... until now. We got the original HL2 team back together to record brand new commentary tracks for the whole game. Steam Workshop Support Browse, install, and play user-created content for Half-Life 2 without ever leaving the game. Look for it in the Extras menu! Steam Game Recording Preserve your precious memories of City 17 with the help of Steam! Take a look at the Game Recording timeline in your Steam Overlay for event markers that commemorate big and surprising moments in your playthrough. Updates and Fixes Updated Game Content Every map in Half-Life 2 has been looked over by Valve level designers to fix longstanding bugs, restore content and features lost to time, and improve the quality of a few things like lightmap resolution and fog: Fixed pops, holes in the world, fading-out and disappearing objects across the game. Rebalanced the lighting across Half-Life 2 to account for playing with HDR on or off, using the original release as reference. Cleaner, smoother horizon lines thanks to new radial fog! Added higher-resolution lightmaps across the game! Removed green glow from the G-Man model’s eyes in the opening of the game, and restored the reflective glint as seen in the original release. Fixed missing grass sprites and blacked-out models throughout the game! Updated Graphics Settings Choose either the original launch day blood and fire effects, or those created for the episodes, when playing the Half-Life 2 base game! Play with only the highest detail models in High Quality mode! Get smoother lightmap shadows at Very High shader detail, thanks to new bicubic lightmap filtering! Gamepad, Input, and Steam Deck Updates Gamepad controls have been updated to match the Half-Life 1 anniversary update. Aim Assistance has gotten an overhaul making it feel better to use, and there are more configuration options available. Aim Assistance can be enabled separately for gamepad or mouse/keyboard input. The amount of assistance can be tuned up and down, and it’s no longer tied to a skill setting. Want to play on Hard with high aim assist, or Easy with it off? Knock yourself out. The Steam Deck main menu has been updated with all of today’s additions including the Episodes, Workshop, and new input configuration. The Steam Deck version of the main menu will also appear when you play Half-Life 2 on a PC running Big Picture Mode. Long-Lost Looks into Half-Life 2's development Stuff to Watch Watch old videos from the early days of Half-Life 2 We rescued these old demos from the hard drives of ancient computers scattered around the office, and are offering them up as high quality videos: E3 2003 The demo that revealed Half-Life 2 and the Source engine to the world. This was previously only available as shakycam recorded from our E3 booth, now available as direct capture. E3 2002 We built this demo to bring to E3 a year earlier, and then decided at the last minute we weren’t ready to show the game. 20 years later, we’re okay with you seeing this stuff. SIGGRAPH 2000 Also known as the “Free TVs” demo, this was shown at the SIGGRAPH computer graphics conference, hot on the heels of the release of the original Half-Life. This is the highest quality video we’ve still got from this era of Half-Life 2’s development. E3 2003 The demo that revealed Half-Life 2 and the Source engine to the world.

Re-Raising the Bar Stuff to Read A new edition of Raising the Bar is coming back into print in 2025, expanded to include the Half-Life 2 Episodes Nearly two decades since it first went out of print, Raising the Bar is set to return with an expanded second edition—offering a comprehensive look into the creation of the Half-Life 2. Originally published in 2004, this book captured the story of Half-Life 2's development but missed the episodic content that followed. This new edition concludes the Half-Life 2 development story, with never-before-seen concept art from Episode One and Episode Two, along with ideas and experiments for the third episode that never came to be. Looking for something to read right now? The Final Hours of Half-Life 2 was written twenty years ago by Geoff Keighley after spending time in Valve's offices during... you guessed it.

The previous version of the game has been archived to a publicly visible Beta branch named \"steam_legacy\", with the description \"Pre-20th Anniversary Build.\" If a mod or feature is behaving in an unexpected way, you may need to run this archived build until the issue is resolved in the default build. With the Episodes and Lost Coast now contained within Half-Life 2 itself, we'll be reducing the visibility of the standalone versions on the Steam Store. The old standalone applications will remain available to ensure community projects that rely on them still function properly but they will now appear within the Tools menu on your Steam Library.

They’ve bundled them and kinda archived them old standalone. reply XorNot 19 hours agoparentprevAlso I highly recommend Black Mesa, which is the remake of HL1 in the HL2 engine. The Xen levels went from what they were to possibly some of my favorite levels in the game, and the music scoring is top-notch. It feels great to play. reply Timon3 19 hours agorootparentAnd regarding another fan project - turns out the Prologue for Project Borealis has been released on November 11th! They're trying to make HL3 according to the Epistle 3 post from a couple of years ago. https://projectborealis.com/prologue-release/ Looks great, and feels pretty close to HL2 mechanics! Definitely has to be optimized more, but a very promising start (albeit short, ~10-15 minutes). reply mepian 17 hours agorootparentI worked on this in the first year, on the gameplay code. Glad it’s finally bearing some fruit. reply chii 13 hours agorootparentGood stuff. I have seen a lot of \"complaints\" from various people that they shouldn't have chosen UE, as it will have made the game much slower to develop since everything needed to be done from scratch. But the graphics looked much nicer in UE and not to mention the tooling is nicer than what one could use with mods. Surely, the upfront cost of porting aspects of HL2 over to UE is not investment lost. reply KronisLV 3 hours agorootparentHasn't Unreal Engine 5 gotten a bunch of criticism about a lot of the games made with it having high system requirements, and often playing like a stuttery mess? Though it's hard to tell where the technical decisions end and developers not caring much about optimization (or expecting people to use upscaling even for 1080p) starts. Recently, it was revealed that even the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 benchmarks used upscaling and the problems with visually stunning but horribly performing games like The Forever Winter were also pretty obvious. I did very much appreciate what Black Mesa did, though. Maybe Project Borealis will also be a success story in due time. reply talldayo 47 minutes agorootparentIt's complicated. There is Unreal 5 tech that is extremely slow in and of itself (Lumen and Nanite come to mind), but most of the stutter comes from UE5's notorious shader compilation pipeline. Instead of pre-compiling shaders on first launch, UE5 will automatically compile and cache shaders while the user is playing which obviously hits the CPU and causes slowdown in unfamiliar areas. However, it should be noted that this isn't an issue for consoles (where precompiled shaders come with the game) or Steam Deck (where shaders are compiled via Fossilize before the game is even launched). It's most notable on DirectX programs during the first run, which hits benchmarks quite badly but also becomes less stuttery as more shaders are cached. reply Timon3 8 hours agorootparentprevThank you for your contribution! I'm sure it's frustrating to have your own work not be released for such a long time, but it definitely seems to have been worth it :) reply throwaway314155 19 hours agorootparentprevI had a lot of issues getting black mesa to run on linux natively or via proton. Frequently crashes. Not uncommon per protondb. Food for thought of you're on a linux setup. reply jsheard 19 hours agorootparentprevBlack Mesa is also 75% off right now, incidentally. Seems like everything Half Life is either free or on deep discount for the anniversary. reply bdjsiqoocwk 19 hours agorootparentnext [16 more] [flagged] throw10920 18 hours agorootparentTangential, irrelevant, \"flamebait...generic tangents...internet tropes.\" \"reminder\" that the guidelines explicitly say to avoid. Nobody mentioned ownership or licensing or anything tangentially related until you did. https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html reply jsheard 19 hours agorootparentprevAnd when you buy an album on CD you just license it for personal use, you can't play it on the radio or in a commercial space. \"Buying\" a copy of some intellectual property always had strings attached even in the age of physical media. reply SuperNinKenDo 19 hours agorootparentTo add to bdjsiqoocwk pointing out the self-evident, in many jurisdictions you have both the right, and the tools to make backups of media for personal use. What exactly is legally permissible and actually possible with non-physical stuff is much more complicated. reply bdjsiqoocwk 19 hours agorootparentprevSteam can delete a game from your account, they can't delete a cd that I physically have with me. Why does this even need to be spelled out... reply ruggeri 19 hours agorootparentNot contradicting your point, but adding tangential interesting information. Blu-Ray UHD discs can no longer be played on modern computers as Intel has removed the trusted execution environment needed to decrypt them. Blu-Ray UHD players do a handshake that verifies the use of Intel SGX. One might have always been skeptical of these discs, especially as AMD had never implemented those TEE instructions. But I believe the interesting takeaway is that even physical media is becoming something you can’t count on using without the continued permission/assistance of some outside party. Without regulation I would expect that all new media will eventually require players to be always-online. reply Halian 18 hours agorootparentWhy hasn’t the requisite software been updated to perform a non-SGX handshake? That seems like a yawning oversight. o_O reply jsheard 18 hours agorootparentThe UHD DRM scheme requires some kind of secure enclave for key management, and SGX was the only suitable system for that on PCs. There is no non-SGX system they would certify. reply ethbr1 19 hours agorootparentprevThis should be so trivially apparent to anyone on HN using Steam that pointing it out is like noting the sky is blue. reply taeric 19 hours agorootparentprevDo they have a record of doing this? Paranoia here is largely warranted. But people had fewer rights than they realized before. And finding a way to play older media is often a rather expensive endeavor. Edit to add: I also find picking on Valve awkward here. Microsoft? Sony? I would be far more inline. Even Nintendo. Valve seems to be much more on favor of empowering users, though. reply Uvix 16 hours agorootparentMicrosoft, Sony, and Nintendo all have physical releases for most of their games that they can't take from my cold dead hands. Valve has singlehandedly killed that market for PC games. reply taeric 14 hours agorootparentNintendo has some where you can't rent anymore, because the save data is on cartridge. They all have limitations on regions. Again, Steam /could/ do this. Has it? The others have done the things. reply opan 9 hours agorootparent3DS saved to the cart and had region-locking. Neither applies to Switch. You can get a JP copy of Splatoon 3, play it on your NA Switch, swap to the NA version of the game, and not lose anything. reply wkat4242 18 hours agorootparentprevTrue but a lot of games require an online launcher to even start, even if they are also distributed on physical media I buy most of my games on GOG for that reason. At least you can download a DRM-free copy that can never be taken away. reply newdee 18 hours agorootparentprev> Why does this even need to be spelled out... Indeed. Why did you bother? reply dekhn 18 hours agorootparentprevIn my decade+ of using steam, this has never been an issue. reply va1a 19 hours agorootparentprevMaybe even in a game period. Beautifully done remake. reply 0x1ceb00da 16 hours agoparentprevInside the trash can is the garden gnome from episode 2. reply gordon_freeman 14 hours agoparentprevI think they are also merging Ep1 and Ep2 together into HL2 now and have gradual progression of HL2 to E1 and then to E2. I just browsed my Steam game library and can't find separate copies of E1 and E2 there because of being merged with HL2. reply parasti 11 hours agorootparentThis is in the article. reply kolbusa 19 hours agoparentprevAlso try playing with the can and the trash bin. reply eknkc 19 hours agoprev20-25 years ago a handful of companies had a weird hold on me. I’d jump on anything Google made back then. Blizzard could sell me any game they came up with. If it was from Blizzard, it was gonna be great. Lost all of it obviously. Not a single company has my loyalty anymore. Except if valve were to release a mystery black box with faint lambda symbol on it. I’d pay whatever they asked for it. reply tikhonj 19 hours agoparentThat's pretty much exactly the logic that got me to buy a Valve Index + Half Life Alyx and it was totally worth it. VR turned out to be cooler than I expected and both the game and the Index were just so satisfyingly well-executed. It's nice to have products which clearly had far more attention to detail and quality than was economically necessary. It's clearly the result of a different philosophy than I've seen at most tech companies. I had the same experience with the Steam Deck: just very well done, including side things like the case that came with the device. I've grown used to accessories bundled with electronics ranging from basically garbage to okay (but not great), while Valve's case was as good as I'd expect from a high-end third-party product. reply jsheard 19 hours agorootparentUnfortunately VR also showed the flipside of Valves approach to development - putting extreme amounts of money and effort into a project, then abruptly dropping it and moving on to something else. The Index was great at the time but now it's five years old, dated in numerous aspects, and hasn't even had a price cut since launch. Alyx is great but it came out four years ago and Valve has done nothing with VR games since, either themselves or by using their infinite bankroll to help fund third party PC VR development until it's more sustainable. reply AceJohnny2 18 hours agorootparentVR continues to lack a Killer App to sustain the field (I say this as owner of 3 VR devices, including the Index) Valve tried to make it with Alyx, and while it is amazing, it did not inspire the industry to follow up on. I do not blame Valve for moving on when nobody followed them. reply jsheard 18 hours agorootparentI think it's pretty obvious that Alyx didn't inspire the industry because it's a giga-budget game addressed to a tiny potential market, that Valve could only afford to make due to Steam being an infinite money printer. It wouldn't surprise me if Alyx never recouped its development costs despite the immense hype around it. If Valve wanted more Alyx'es to happen they needed to spread their wealth around until the VR market gained more momentum and became self-sustaining. reply bsimpson 18 hours agorootparentIt's also a $60 purchase that requires a beefy Windows machine in addition to the headset. VR is a small market to begin with, and most VR people can't play Alyx without buying a whole new computer. reply wolrah 15 hours agorootparent> most VR people can't play Alyx without buying a whole new computer. When Alyx first came out I had a PC that was the minimum recommended specs for VR from the day the Vive launched (4790K and Geforce 970). The game ran fine. It sure as hell got better when I upgraded to a 3900X and 3070, but it plays just fine on the original minimum requirements VR PC which was a $1500 PC in 2015. The idea that PC VR requires a massive rig is just nonsense. Computers that run VR perfectly fine are literally being forced in to retirement, they're officially obsolete. reply talldayo 12 hours agorootparentYeah, I think it's a pretty nonsense arguement if you've tried running it on constrained hardware. I played Alyx on a 1050ti and it was pretty much flawless for 72hz gameplay. Anything weaker than that outright isn't going to run anything in VR very well. Also worth noting - you don't need Windows to play Alyx either. SteamVR supports Linux perfectly well, and other games that don't ship native Linux-native builds can still run through Proton. If you own VR in any capacity whatsoever, you should be capable of playing Half Life Alyx; that was Valve's selling point for anyone that had Steam and a headset. reply dcan 18 hours agorootparentprevDoes Half Life Alyx not come with the headset anymore? reply bsimpson 18 hours agorootparentEven among people on Steam (who have those beefy Windows machines for VR), more than half of headsets are an Oculus, and only 17% are an Index: https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Softw... reply Wololooo 8 hours agorootparentprevValve moved a lot of Indexes because of it. reply Plasmoid 14 hours agorootparentprevHave you tried \"I expect you to die\"? It's a really compelling VR game. reply cladopa 17 hours agorootparentprevThere is a reason for that: Meta focused on VR with \"infinite money\", hiring almost the entire VR development team from Valve. Valve just could not compete. They could not spend 10 billion dollars like Meta did. Creating a working nuclear fusion device could be cheaper than that. reply willis936 19 hours agorootparentprevI've been patiently waiting for an index 2 or a price cut. I will continue to patiently wait. I threw my CV1 that I bought secondhand in the trash when facebook bought oculus then forced login. Maybe I'll return to the market when it supplies something I want. reply jsheard 18 hours agorootparentFor better or worse Facebook are the ones keeping VR on life support, without them it would have flatlined years ago. They have the only good affordable headsets, they throw tons of money around to bankroll VR game studios in exchange for exclusivity, and even for games they don't bankroll it's a no-brainer to prioritize their platform because >90% of sales happen there. https://x.com/MuchRockness/status/1849543449906942094 Even the minority who do buy VR games on Steam are mostly playing them on a cheap Meta headset, so without Meta those sales might not have happened either. The most recent Steam hardware survey shows that of the users who have a VR headset, nearly two thirds of them are using an Oculus/Meta model. reply willis936 17 hours agorootparentI'm happy for them. I'd rather never touch VR again than plug my eyes into facebook. reply jsheard 17 hours agorootparent> I'm happy for them. It's a pyrrhic victory, they may have cornered the market but it's still losing them $4-5 billion every quarter with no end in sight. https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/metas-reality-labs-posts-4po... reply maroonblazer 17 hours agorootparentprevI have the Quest 3 and Arkham Shadow gives me all the same feels as Half Life Alyx. Before AS dropped I hadn't turned on my Q3 for over 6 months. reply archon810 1 hour agorootparentprevI also own a Deck OLED and I have to disagree on the polish.

And even on my old Quest 2 it doesn't look too horrible on the device itself (without PC) reply keyringlight 19 hours agoparentprevMy theory is that there's a period when a studio has huge early success (plus in the case of Valve, they started with huge amounts of money from being former MS employees) that lets them devote themselves to their mission of making games, before either mission creep or dilution with new hires occurs over time either from staff naturally changing over time or expanding. Another factor is that when aiming to 'go big' and realize what they can do with lots of resources, they need to partner/join with others that don't work the same way and will influence them. reply ramesh31 19 hours agorootparentValve is still a top tier org, but they simply make too much money in the publishing business to bother with game development anymore. Any sales would be peanuts to what they are making through developer fees and the marketplace. This is why all of their releases in the last decade have been F2P. reply willis936 18 hours agorootparentSounds like a perfect environment to make games. No budget or schedule pressure, virtually limitless resources so the staff can strive to make art with love and without the corruption of chasing a bottom line. The entire media industry on almost every format is chasing nostalgia because they refuse to recreate the environment that made endearing stories and experiences in the first place. reply pxoe 1 hour agorootparentValve has demonstrated that it is not a perfect environment to make games because they just hardly made any. Perhaps it's precisely because there's no pressure, as well as their \"flat structure\" (which also results in a lack of pressure) that got blamed by their own employees for their lack of releases.

They do a \"tech demo\", they move on from that tech, leaving the game and it's world and community behind. Plot? What plot? Perhaps they're also stalling on making continuations or even new releases in search of some \"gimmick technology\" to pair a game with, instead of just telling a story through their games.

Ads, \"suggestions\", automatically reenabling features, UI complexity, hard to read text, unintuitive UI, performance issues, audio device issues, useless background processes, new layers on top of configuration UI rather than replacing/updating old layers. I think those have all gotten worse since Win7, some since XP. And I thought I saw that opinion corroborated generally.

I don't know what it is, maybe expectation from the praise it receives left me underwhelmed, or maybe it's the fact that I was quite literally a toddler when the game came out and only first played it in 2019? To be fair, I did enjoy it and could feel the intent of it being the horror section.

But I think most of the hype was multiplied by HL2 being such a massive step up in graphics. Nobody in my friend group played Doom 3, so for us it was going straight from HL1 and CS 1.6 to HL2. Compare the 2 games side by side and HL2 literally looked futuristic, like it shouldn't even be possible with the hardware at the time. (And to be fair my graphics card burst into flames trying to push 15 fps in the canals section so maybe it wasn't). reply yesco 12 hours agorootparentprevI think an important aspect that's kinda faded away here is the visceral detail of the zombies, which were unusual at the time, mixed with the fact that you need to utilize the physics engine to get around, which created a unique kind of \"panic\" since at a glance there often seemed like there was no escape from certain circumstances. If you want a similar feeling from a more modern game I recommend trying Prey (the new one).

HL3 isn’t going to have live service or esports applications that make money like their other games do. It probably won’t be a big earner compared to those other games.

And those that were have been burned before/changed and would probably need to see raving reviews to be that interested. Portal 3 seems like the easy money grab. That had more lasting pop culture relevance, and \"it's more Portal\" would be enough for a bunch of people to buy it. reply jcranmer 14 hours agoparentprevThe documentary on this page does explain why they didn't make it, at the very end (it's half the section on the HL2 episodes). In short, they started working on episode 3, and made it about the point where the game development progresses from \"here's demos of what could be set pieces in the episode\" to putting together the sketch of the game narrative [1] when the developers were pulled to crunch for Left 4 Dead. After Left 4 Dead released, Gabe felt the window for an HL2e3 had closed, so it would be HL3 instead... and that because HL1 and HL2 had both heralded genre shifts, HL3 needed something to push that shift as well. But there weren't any such ideas for that shift (except maybe VR, which hasn't exactly panned out), and Gabe also felt that releasing a HL3 just to complete the story wouldn't cut it, so it never got made. Which pretty much matches everybody's speculation for the past decade.

I think seeing the sheer scope of that codebase and realizing how much I didn’t understand and still had to learn is part of what put me in my path into both the game industry and software startups.

The Steam Deck is giving me a chance to catch up on all the computer games that I didn't have the hardware for when they were popular. I've now caught up on Arkham, but I just can't get into Alice. The graphics and the controls are so bad from a modern perspective that it distracts from any desire I have to explore that world.

It got to the point that I couldn't make it more than 30 minutes into a new game without losing interest and eventually I just stopped buying games altogether and that was it. I'm still not sure if this is a good or bad thing. reply imiric 19 hours agoprevIf there is any game worthy of a remaster or remake it's HL2, and all of its episodes. It remains one of my most memorable gaming experiences, and not just because of nostalgia. The story, writing, characters, dialogue, environments, gameplay, graphics, audio... Everything was pretty much revolutionary back then. I remember being awed by the physics in the demo, and couldn't get enough of the gravity gun once I got the game. It was so brilliantly versatile and satisfying to use. And yet these days we get \"remasters\" of games that are not even 5 years old. Most of the AAA industry is just putting out lazy cash grabs and predatory live service garbage. Valve itself has profited immensely from the live service business model. I just wish they would get back to development, or sell someone else the rights to their single-player franchises. Spinoffs like HL: Alyx and Aperture Desk Job don't really cut it for me.

A bit like the genre-defining movies such as Star Wars, the Matrix, or Terminator 2. It's hard to put a finger on it, but it was a combination of a truly imaginative setting on-par with a decent science fiction movie or novel and the \"show, don't tell\" style of proper world-building. It presented a uniquely interesting dystopia, discoverable through a game instead of a movie or book. I think it was one of the first games I played that was dark. For example, the \"police\" are cybernetically enhanced, but in a disturbing way (\"transhuman\"). The low-ranked troopers \"just\" have permanently worn facemasks a bit like Darth Vader, with an implication that they may not be functional without them. The higher-ranked shock troops have increasing levels of augmentations until some have only a single central \"eye\" in their visor.

    "originLink": "https://anderegg.ca/2024/11/15/maybe-bluesky-has-won",
    "originBody": "Maybe Bluesky has \"won\" November 15, 2024 November has sucked so far. One upside of the terrible nonsense is that more people are fleeing X. Many are choosing Bluesky. I’ve seen a bunch of takes about this recently, but I keep seeing things I disagree with. I figure that’s a good enough excuse to write more about this weird-assed social network. Decentralized? Federated? Neither. When writing about Bluesky, I’ve seen folks mention that it’s either federated or decentralized. I’m here to tell you that it’s currently neither. This one really irks me because the service is getting the credit for work it hasn’t done. One problem here is that the whole “decentralized” thing is complicated. I believe the Bluesky team is putting in a lot of good-faith effort to becoming a decentralized platform. But, this work is tricky because their architectural choices are quite novel. As I’ve written previosuly, the AT Protocol (atproto) that powers Bluesky is really complex. It’s made up of three main parts: Personal Data Servers (PDSs), Relays, and App Views. Currently people can set up their own PDSs, which will host both their identity’s signing keys and their content on Bluesky. Setting this up requires a fair amount of server-level knowledge, but it’s relatively cheap (maybe $15/month USD) and lets people control their own data. This is kind of like hosting your own website. The content will be available if someone knows how to get to it. By default, it’s just some stuff sitting on a server somewhere. The PDS part of the stack is interesting to me. In Bluesky’s view, it’s great if people start hosting their own PDSs — it means they don’t have to pay for people’s content storage! It also means that users can relocate their data at any time. This is something that ActivityPub should do better. That said: yes, it’s a bit of a pain to move my data from one Mastodon server to another, but it’s something that’s currently possible. The only server that’s actively reading PDSs and doing anything productive with them is the one Bluesky controls. More on this in a second. Next up the chain are Relays. These are what gather data from PDSs and make it available to the atproto ecosystem. If a PDS is like a website, a Relay is like Google. Relays constantly look at PDSs to see if there’s any new content, and then index that content so it’s actually useful. The trouble with this is that it’s expensive and there’s a lot of data. I recently read an interesting post outlining the steps required to self-host Bluesky content. The author mentions that setting up a Relay requires around 4.5 TB of disk space, and that it’s growing by around 18 GB a day. However, that was said before the most recent bump in growth. The data and processing requirements will only accelerate as more people use the service. While the Relay aggregates the data, it doesn’t do anything to display it to users. That’s up to the App View, which is what most people think of as “Bluesky”. This is the piece that pulls out data that has been scraped by a Relay and turns it into something useful. In the case of Bluesky — the social network — it’s about showing you posts from people you follow, not showing you stuff from people you’ve blocked, and notifying you of people who’ve mentioned you. The idea here is that this part could be replaced with something that isn’t a social network, and could be used for just about anything. The problem is that it’s currently extremely loosely defined, and also hasn’t been implemented by anyone else. There are two other things that are directly under Bluesky’s control: the DID:PLC and DMs. DIDs are an open standard to allow people to identify things in a distributed way. However, the PLC method that Bluesky uses is currently under their control. It was previously known as the “placeholder” method, because they intended to get away from it as soon as they could build something decentralized. Instead, they (I think wisely) decided to stick with it for the meantime. However, if you want to look up a DID:PLC, you need to query the Bluesky servers. This is important because every user is identified by a DID:PLC, and all interactions need to reference them. Similarly, DMs are currently handled outside of atproto. They’re not part of the atproto spec, and need to go through Bluesky’s servers. I’m not sure how or when these will be updated. All this to say: the Bluesky team seems like they’re earnestly working toward a decentralized platform, but they have a lot of work ahead of them. Years of effort, in my estimation. In the meantime, Bluesky is slightly more decentralized than, say, Facebook — but not by much. Yes, you can host your own data. Yes, you can scrape all of the content on the network. But you can’t do anything with it unless you’re attached to the Bluesky service. I believe this will change with time, but it will be prohibitively expensive and we’re not there yet. I’ll also add that the reason I’m a big fan of a ActivityPub solution like Mastodon is that it’s quite inexpensive to run your own complete stack unless you’re extremely famous. Hosting a Mastodon instance is a one-step process, and you then control everything. To get the same experience with atproto, you’ll need to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars a month, and even then you still don’t control everything as of today. Radically open I think some might be surprised to learn how open Bluesky is. It’s trivially easy to grab an export of any user’s data. It’s also a core assumption of the service that all the data (aside from out-of-protocol stuff like DMs) is completely open. You can watch the firehose of data go by if you’d like. If you want to run a Relay, you have to download all the data. This is because the data in the network is all cryptographically signed based on what came before it. The protocol does this using the Merkle tree structure, which is also how Git stores data. The issue with this is: if you want to look at one piece of content in the system, you also need to know about everything that happened before. For people using the Bluesky service, this isn’t something you need to think about. But behind the scenes, it’s helpful to know that everything being added to the service could potentially be available for anyone else to use for any purpose. Financial concerns Bluesky is currently free to use, and I think they intend it to stay that way. This is easier when there are fewer users, and I’d bet that the technical choices discussed above make things more expensive to run. The CEO, Jay Graber, seems like a smart person who’s trying to do the right thing. However, she’s also someone with a background in the crypto industry who recently accepted funding lead by a crypto investor. What does that mean for the service? Who knows! But it doesn’t sound great to me. Investors like to make returns. Bluesky is currently only making money by reselling domains for usernames. That’s not exactly a high-margin business. Small things The above pieces are things I worry about, but I’m pretty sure I’m in the minority. Most people don’t care about decentralization or even if their content is being scraped. I can’t imagine they care how the service is being paid for. But here are two nitpicks I’ll add here that I think are more product-level: repost control and post editing. On Mastodon and Twitter-of-old, I was able to follow a user, but only see posts from them. Many people hit the repost button a lot, and overwhelm my feed. I’d love the ability to selectively disable reposts from a user without having to build a custom feed to do so. Also, it would be great to edit posts! I believe this is tricky because of the Merkle tree structure mentioned above, but it’s a pain these days when every other platform has the feature. Good things Now that I’ve gotten some grumpiness out of my system, I would like to recognise some legitimately great things that Bluesky is doing. First up, domain-based usernames. You can follow me on Bluesky as @gavin.anderegg.ca. I was able to set this up easily by adding a TXT record to my domain that links to my DID:PLC. This is great! It allows me to effectively “blue check” myself, in a similar way to Mastodon. The domain-based approach is quite flexible, and I think it’s a great solution. Bluesky also offers both composable moderation and the ability to choose your own algorithm. I’m someone who just wants to see a chronological feed of posts from the folks I follow, but I absolutely understand the appeal of these features. It’s made especially clear when compared to Threads, which only wants to show me inane engagement bait by default. There are even some third-party services which make setting up your own custom feed easier. I also really love the idea of starter packs. If you’re someone who’s joining the service, picking who you want to follow is rough. A starter pack lets you to follow a set of users recommended by someone you trust. Anyone can create a starter pack, so it’s easy to grab a few and have a lively feed a few moments after joining. Everyone’s experience is different As people are fleeing X, I’ve seen a lot of thoughts from people about engagement. I’m on Mastodon, Bluesky, and Threads. On each network, I’ve seen a post like, “I joined and I’ve got more engagement here than anywhere else”. I’m certain that’s true for that person, but I think this is so variable as to be useless. I joined Mastodon in late 2022, along with the Relay, ATP, and Daring Fireball crowd. I get a lot of engagement on Mastodon! I’m also a white guy who cares too much about expensive technology. Bluesky seems to be winning with artists and random local groups. I mentioned this before, but my new city councillor campaigned on Bluesky and it was to her credit! I bring this up because I think different social networks might “fit” better for some than others. I’ve seen Bluesky described as having “theater kid energy”, which, heck, I’m here for! Others have said Mastodon has a “homeowner’s association” vibe. I haven’t personally felt that, but I recognise that the content warnings and block lists can give that impression. Maybe Bluesky has “won” I don’t know what the social media landscape will look like in 6 months, but I’d bet things will change. If Bluesky comes out as a “winner” and more posting happens there, I think I’m generally fine with that. At least for now. The whole Twitter mess has taught me not to attach myself too closely with these things anymore. I hung on far too long to Twitter while it made me feel terrible. My goal going forward is to post more to my own site and aggregate to any social channel I currently care about. I’m happy to interact on any that I’m a part of, but I’m also going to be much quicker to pull the ripcord if things start going down hill.",

    "commentBody": "Maybe Bluesky has \"won\" (anderegg.ca)422 points by GavinAnderegg 23 hours agohidepastfavorite729 comments PaulHoule 21 hours agoMy take is that Bluesky is a nicer place than Mastodon. Personally I think politics are terrible on microblogging platforms for the reason that you can't say very much in 140 characters or even 1400 characters. A common kind of profile on that kind of platform is: \"There are good people and bad people and I'm one of the good people\" It is very easy to other people and share memes that build group cohesion while driving other people away. Really making progress requires in politics a lot of \"I agree with you about 90% but there is 10% that I don't\" or \"Well, I negotiated something in the backroom that you'd really hate but headed off a situation you would have thought was catastrophic but you won't appreciate that I did it so you and I are both better off if I don't tell you\" and other sorts of nuance, you don't want to see how the sausage is made, etc. To stand Mastodon (where you would have thought fascists were taking over the world a year ago if you believed what you read) I have to have about 20 or so block rules. I see some people with the same kind of profiles on Bluesky but see a lot less othering in my feed because the \"Discover\" feed on Bluesky filters out a lot of angry content. My rough estimate is that it removes about 75% of the divisive political junk. That (1) Immediately improves my feed, but also (2) Reduces the amount of re-posted angry political content (it's like adding some boron to the coolant in a nuclear reactor) and (3) Since angry political memes don't work anymore people find a different game to play My guess is the X-odus folks are less agreeable than average for the same reason why people who \"left California\" to go to Colorado or someplace else are less agreeable. Those who go are less agreeable than those who stay. On the other hand, a certain amount of suppression of negativity could stop it from spreading and might not even be noticed as \"censorship\". reply ASalazarMX 21 hours agoparentThe most crucial decision when joining Mastodon is choosing the most friendly instance. I have a strong interest in interacting with cybersecurity professionals, so infosec.exchange was perfect for me, either browsing subscribed or local posts. Browsing all is something I do only when I'm bored, because many posts are not what I'd like to see. You can always migrate your account if you want. https://instances.social/ That being said, BlueSky is simpler and easier because there's no real federation yet, and even if they have a \"Discovery\" algorithm, you get many options to control what you want to see. It's feels great, like Twitter before their 2012(ish?) IPO. reply JoshTriplett 19 hours agorootparent> The most crucial decision when joining Mastodon is choosing the most friendly instance. Consider using a self-hosting service, like https://togethr.party/ , to have your own instance on your own domain. Much like email, you should never be beholden to another party for your identity; your hosting service should be an invisible detail that can change without anyone interacting with you needing to notice. I've watched several instances shut down over the years, and have never once regretted the decision to have an instance on my own domain. My social network handle is now the same as my email address, with an extra @ in front. reply danpalmer 18 hours agorootparentI regretted my decision to self host. It’s expensive (for what it is), there are federation issues with some instances, some admins don’t like smaller unknown instances, it requires a fair bit of active management to keep an instance healthy, and you can’t migrate post history. reply JoshTriplett 17 hours agorootparentA good self-hosting service should provide full access to extract all your data, such that you can import it into a different service later. I'm paying ~$7/month to own my own fediverse identity, which seems cheap to me. You're right about federation issues, though that's more a limitation of the fediverse protocols and fediverse software that really needs fixing. Fediverse instances don't automatically fetch and show all replies to posts you see, even if it knows they exist, unless your server is already fetching other things from the server hosting those posts. So it's a little harder to see other people's replies, which contributes to the problem of 20 people replying with the same answers because they can't see that other people have already replied. Large instances work around that because everyone's already talking to at least one account on that server. I hope those limitations get fixed someday, but for now they're fundamental to the fediverse. reply kelnos 15 hours agorootparent> I'm paying ~$7/month to own my own fediverse identity, which seems cheap to me. I very much agree with you in owning your identity on this sort of thing, but I wouldn't pay $7/mo in order to participate in any social network. I have my own email domain, and I can host it myself, or have someone else host it for me, on shared infrastructure. Fastmail charges me ~$4/mo, and that's for email, something anyone on the internet requires in order to interact with online services. I think $4/mo for a communications necessity is reasonable, and there are cheaper (even free) providers if I wanted to go that route. $7/mo for a social network is nuts. I'm not sure how services like togethr.party work, but is it safe to assume that they have to spin up a completely new copy of the server software for each domain? That seems like a big problem, and is probably why this is so expensive. I recently set up my own Matrix instance (using Synapse) and found it to be pretty wasteful, resource-wise. This is a solved problem with email servers, where one server can host as many domains as you have storage and processing power for; not sure why the chat/social platforms haven't caught up architecture-wise. reply rglullis 7 hours agorootparentFWIW, $7/month is a figure for running a whole server just for your domain. Mastodon absolutely sucks for single-user instances. I offer Takahe hosting for $39/year if you want to use your own domain, or Mastodon + Matrix + Funkwhale + Lemmy for $29/year if you just want an account on the communick servers. reply vidarh 16 hours agorootparentprevYou can extract your data, but you can't import your posts on another Mastodon instance. It's fixable, but thorny. Personally, I think Bluesky is a mix of NIH with a dash of wanting to be a central point of control, that is doomed in the long run - anything that works well for Bluesky can be copied, but the real benefit for the Fediverse in the long run is that Mastodon is just one of many services, or types of services. Every new service gets to hook into an existing network instead of starting from scratch. reply danpalmer 14 hours agorootparentprev> though that's more a limitation of the fediverse protocols and fediverse software that really needs fixing I don't believe ATProto has the same issues, and I believe it would take quite a rearchitecture of ActivityPub to solve. > such that you can import it into a different service later This is the key issue. There is no way to import posts in Mastodon without manually fudging the database (which I also had to do when running my own instance). As another commenter mentioned, it's a tricky issue, in large part because it's not part of the federation protocol. Bluesky solves this by separating the storage from the other parts of the distributed system, such that you don't need to move your storage to change your identity, hosting, moderation, etc. Keeping them independent is a smart move. reply circuit10 6 hours agorootparentprevOracle Cloud Free Tier ARM instances are really good, I don’t host Mastodon on mine but I assume you can, of course you still have to pay for a domain name but you can get a cheap one reply nulbyte 16 hours agorootparentprev> It’s expensive (for what it is)...

I self host lots of stuff but I've tried 3 times to self host a fediverse instance and stopped all three times.

I think what you're saying here is not that politics are terrible on microblogging platforms, but that microblogging platforms are terrible, which is a pretty valid sentiment. reply safety1st 13 hours agorootparentI was surprised to learn recently that Rousseau, who is usually seen as a radical egalitarian, hated the democratization of publishing. [1] His reasoning was complex but a lot of it revolved around the simple fact that as you get more people publishing, the intellectual quality of the average published work goes down. I'm not ready to roll back the printing press, but in retrospect the digital era has proven him right about this. For instance his position kind of predicts Eternal September - the easier it gets to post online, the more numbskulls you have doing it. Microblogging is the ultimate expression of this and frequently the content you find on microblogging platforms is the absolute worst hot takes and generally the most vile stuff the moderation rules will permit because shock value generates impressions. It's every idiot on earth competing to be as flagrant and base as possible. We usually hold up free speech as a virtue in Western societies and there are a lot of good reasons for that, but I'm increasingly inclined to treat microblogging less like publishing, and more like alcohol/tobacco/gambling, like it's something people do but they know it's not good for them, they do it anyway because it's addictive and easy. [1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8ucJ29O1kM reply PaulHoule 3 hours agorootparentIt’s generally true that the literary quality of a movement goes down as it grows and gets larger —- early adopters are often better writers if not smarter than the people who follow them From the viewpoint of a library patron, for instance, feminism is a literary movement because it has left behind a large literature frozen in amber. The earliest authors of the second wave, say Friedan, Steinem, or de Beauvoir were good reads but in 10 years the movement becomes a lot more “vulgar” (in the Latin sense of “common”) and at its worst you find large format books, cheaply bound and typeset with illustrations that probably got mimeographed before they saw the lithography camera full of radical and sometimes hateful rants. reply kristianc 10 hours agorootparentprevThat’s a pretty broad sweep (mis)characterization of Rousseau’s work. He was neither a radical egalitarian or hated the democratization of publishing. He argues for a society where people are both free and equal, but he recognized that some forms of inequality could coexist with freedom, provided they were rooted in merit or necessity, rather than arbitrary privilege. Also, when he talked about the Rights of Man, it wasn’t a rhetorical flourishes, he did mean man. It’s a mischaracterization too to say he hated the democratization of publishing. His own ideas gained traction precisely because publishing allowed them to reach broader audiences. His critiques of printing and arts weren’t aimed at access itself but at the unintended consequences that came with it. reply satvikpendem 15 hours agorootparentprevNot really, microblogging is great to get quick news or life updates from people you follow. Yes, if you're trying to engage in discussion then it's not that useful but that is not its only use case. reply Gormo 12 hours agorootparentQuick news is usually poor-quality news, and \"life updates from people you follow\" is another way of saying \"pointless trivia from people you don't know actually know\". reply satvikpendem 12 hours agorootparentAgain, not really. News can just be links to articles, or just headlines. The quickness of the news conveyed has no bearing on its quality.

Some people actually do care about what's happening in the world; say, for example, the UN calling out a genocide backed by Western powers with our tax money.

Many countries leaders and media are complicit. * Fascism isn't just rising in America. * American politics affects the entire world. Simply look at a map of US military bases, or the threats we level against courts and regulators and leaders. * Most platforms heavily suppress huge swathes of political content which falls outside the current Overton window (which has, indeed, been moving toward fascism for decades across the West). Second, Mastodon is a decentralized forum. Complaining about political content on it, in a time of historic inequality, and then asking if all platforms need to be a \"frontline of American politics\" is really quite silly.

After many years of being around that (I'm a queer/non-binary, an atheist, and politically far left) I stopped enjoying it and just started blocking folks. I still seek out contrary opinions- that is why I regularly look at HN. However, in my daily feed of stuff like \"pictures of my nieces\" and \"birth/death announcements from my larger community\" I don't really feel like I need to be confronted by folks who consider me to be literally demonic. And, for the record, I don't expect those same people to be constantly subjected to my own opinions.

The EU doesn't really do integration, it assumes everyone is a self-motivated tech worker who will do all the integration work themselves. reply KronisLV 6 hours agorootparentI feel like people's perceptions around certain topics might shift quite a bit, depending on how those are implemented. Suppose you have a fairly open border policy. Lots of folks get to contribute to the economy, there’s some cultural exchange, it’s pretty okay. What if there isn’t a good plan in place for making people integrate with the local culture and you end up with large groups of people whose beliefs and behaviour are incompatible with those of the local population, e.g. calls for religious rule in an otherwise democratic country and increased violence? Not the blown out of proportion election claims in the US, but rather the real question of what happens to people after they cross the border? If that detail is unaddressed then people might grow to desire more closed borders, even if the issues lie elsewhere. It’s a bit similar to the self-described “pro-life” movement, except when you look past those strongly held beliefs, things get more complex. For example, if children are born in families that can’t really afford them, will there be enough government assistance to school and feed them? What about daycare? What about neither of the people being mature enough to be good parents? That’s setting the personal freedom argument aside for just a second, it’s like they care about the births but don’t have the rest figured out, similarly to the discourse about borders. I think you’re correct that the right solution would involve focusing on integration. reply msm_ 1 hour agorootparentprev>That's why the US doesn't have a migrant integration crisis like the EU does - we know how to welcome and inculturate people I believe you got this other way around. The US doesn't have a migrant immigration crisis like the EU does, because it's a big isolated island with relatively strict immigration policy. The people who immigrate to the US are exactly the kind of self-motivated workers who do the integration work themselves. Many here believed that investing in integration will magically make open borders policies work, and the countries did. Less people in Europe believe it now. Another thing is, how much immigration does US get? In Europe, many countries can have a significant fraction (a few percent) of their population immigrate over a few years (for example check how big UA immigration was). That makes integration much harder. To be clear, I'm not against immigration, but it's a complex topic and I believe you're a bit too optimistic and extreme about it. >For the sake of full transparency: I'm an open borders maniac, which makes me left wing by American standards and basically persona non grata in Europe.

The amount of state expenditure on facilitating and integrating immigrants in western Europe is insane.

Also even the illegal immigrants that come to the US is easier to integrate than the immigrants from MENA in Europe.

A lot of folks I know find all kinds of things \"left wing\". A lot of my liberal friends think they are leftists, though most of my leftist friends would disagree. My conservative friends don't really draw that distinction between liberals and leftists, and at the same time my liberal friends often think my anarchist friends to be about on par with literal Nazis, horeshoe-theory wise. I suspect a lot of the Dem establishment neo-liberals (who are rapidly becoming neocons ala Rumsfield/Cheney) who make up a lot of this site see themselves as slightly left. Rationally left, but not part of the \"revolutionary\" left. Which, from my position, puts them fairly close to the Reagan conservatives, if you overlook some issues about gay folks and are took the 80s conservatives at their word rather than their deeds when it comes to race issues. However, I don't find this place to be a meeting of the minds. I find that HN is a place where I can observe what the sociopaths who have real capital and thus material political power think about the world, or at least what the their sycophantic mandarins work for those folks might think. I listen to what folks say here because I am genuinely curious about what their alien-to-me understandings of technology and political ethics will do in the larger world. I listen to folks here for the same reason I listen to left-wing folks digest nazi propaganda, read a lot of history, and try to hear what conversations are happening at the red neck bars and at gun shops I hang around. Cause that's who has no problem fucking with my world, and fuck with my world they have indeed. HN is not a place where I think any of my actual politics will find an audience.

I naively assumed that it was only those more right-of-center that felt their worldviews and opinions were unwelcome here, judging from the instantly dead posts I see of anything remotely right-aligned.

The balanced presentation of news is of minor interest and a means to an end rather than a primary goal. This, with Murdoch, harks back in a lesser way to his father, then to his expansion into the UK Fleet Street and eventual transition in US media, in Canada with Conrad Black, in the US pre Murdoch with Hearst, Pulitzer, Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick, in the UK pre Murdoch with Alfred Harmsworth and the like.

There are also extremes on both sides that should be recognized and rejected as such. And the only way to sift out the two and make sure you're not accidentally skewing towards one extreme is to consistently try to understand other people's perspectives. This practice is both educational—it helps you see where you might be wrong after all—and crucial for anyone who wants to actually make a difference in the world.

But the existence of that extreme is used to argue that anything short of full endorsement of everything labeled a right is that extreme of denial of the right to exist, which is patently false. A less extreme formulation that regularly gets lumped in with \"no right to continue to exist\" is: Some people are born with various shades of physical differences that lead to different mental and emotional states. Those who are different from the majority deserve our love and support, but we should attempt to provide that support in a way that doesn't encourage people to self-diagnose with these very real diversities when they don't, in fact, have them. It's a tricky balance to maintain and one that we hope we can get right, but when it comes to sweeping cultural change it's better to move slowly and observe the outcomes carefully. In the meantime we should try as hard as possible to support those who we do identify as being truly divergent. I'm willing to bet that a substantial number of people reading the position described above will be unable to distinguish it from \"no right to continue to exist\", and therein lies the problem. reply BeefWellington 4 hours agorootparentDoes a person self-diagnose as Black?

The best thing we can do for trans rights is acknowledge that we recognize it as a complicated issue that needs to be worked through carefully, but internet rhetoric invariably breaks it down into extremes.

When people don't vaccinate themselves they become a walking vector that affects society as a whole. Yes, personally, they might be healthy. But there's people out there who can't take the vaccines and should they get sick of COVID they could die. There's people out there who, even after being vaccinated, are still at higher risk should they get the disease (the vaccine doesn't prevent you getting sick, rather it makes it more difficult for the virus to transmit and lowes it's effectiveness and how dangerous it is for you). So people not vaccinating puts the whole of society at risk. On the other hand, abortion is very much a familial issue. It affects the woman that is pregnant the most. The rest of the people around her are affected only tangentially, yes, the parents might want to become grandparents or the person that got her pregnant might also want to have a child. And those are inputs that are necessary when coming to the decision of performing an abortion or not. Now, where does \"your body, my choice\" come into play? Do abortions cause the societal harm that vaccines cause? I don't think there's any evidence to this, it's all moral standings. But we legislate for everyone, we don't legislate for a group of people that happen to have a particular religious view of the world. Now, these people have a lot of power and influence and that's why their view is imposed on most of society. Ultimately though, these issues are different and shouldn't be treated as mirrors of each others. I think that's a mistake. reply valval 1 hour agorootparentThese topics are very clear cut to me.

If not wanting to be subjected to uninteresting insults is an \"echo chamber\" is that so bad? Twitter was interesting because you could have on-topic conversations with world experts and random people. By protecting the uncivil, and even elevating it with for-purchase blue checks, people find better uses of their time. The destruction of value in the transition of Twitter to X is something to behold. The person who bought it had no clue about the value of what he bought and what drove the value.

It's sort of consistent with what you're saying but sort of not. The problem to me is more that whenever you have a centralized platform that's associated with a single owner, it inherits all the issues of that owner, good and bad. It's inevitable. I'm not sure it's an issue with people not wanting to hear other viewpoints, it's more so people have decided they have had enough of, say, Musk, and don't want to support him. With Facebook stuff came up about that. The other stuff, about feeling like they're drowning in abusive right-wing stuff is also part of it but I think if it were just, say, like the web, they'd say \"well this is the web\" like people say \"this is the news\". Once you can point to, say, Musk, and say \"he made it this way\" or \"I don't want to support a person like this\", regardless of whether or not it's true or whatever, if enough people feel that way, they're going to want an alternative. This won't really go away until there's a decentralized open system that's easy to use, and not associated with any given \"owner\". Mastodon/AP is close but things there are so closely associated with hosts that the host starts to become a dominant issue (see Threads), as does figuring out where to go, and transferability of accounts across servers. As for \"why Bluesky\"? Probably because it looks like Twitter and a lot of journalists and politics people were complaining about Threads rules prohibiting things they wanted to post. Not because it's left or right wing, but because of links and political content period. I don't know enough about Threads policies but independently lots of journalists on Bluesky were saying they just couldn't post content on Threads even if it was fairly neutral, or that it wouldn't get any visibility? Bluesky is easy to sign up for and fairly open. Once you get the journalists and news organizations on there, and a critical mass it grows. Personally from a technical standpoint I'd like to see Nostr take off but that community currently is very heavily crypto-focused. Network effects and feedback loops are a pain. reply dekervin 6 hours agorootparentI find it weird those analysis that forget the obvious Brazil moment. It provided the coordination needed to execute the exodus. The momentary Banning of twitter in Brazil, provided the impetus for a large amount of normal people there to look for a close alternative. And BlueSky is a more normie friendly. Now a simple network analysis will show you that a lot of \"tech-normie\" people, but heavy user of social networks, in the US have an extended network that touches Brazil, especially for people of color and blacks. their social contact primed them for changing to Bluesky. In a sense it was the dry powder. Now came the election, where Elon Musk took a central role and where more than 80% of black voted against his prefered candidate.

Twitter isn't some neutral place where beliefs are on even footing. Twitter is owned by a right-wing, MAGA, conspiracy theory and propaganda spreading man-child. He bought Twitter to be able to shape the platform to his image of the world, while claiming it was about freedom or some such thing.

If the political alignment of those posts resonates with you, it isn't as annoying. It's noteworthy that with AI, so far we will just get more / louder / more awful posts, rather than a potential for superior moderation and appreciation for nuance. After all, the busted metrics that AI will be aligned to are the same old flawed ones that reward sociopathy. reply somethoughts 21 hours agoparentprevIt'll be interesting if Twitter/X does drift rightward amongst contributors and still keeps its For You feed oriented toward \"engagement\" and view counts, whether or not it will just end up leading to infighting between far right and moderate right views. reply mrtksn 21 hours agorootparentI think so, extreme ideologues like communists, islamists or any other hardcore ideologues fight among each other and in their own tribes all the time because they are actually divided quite a bit on the implementation details.

Bluesky seems a bit more like a 140 Characters mashed with Reddit with subtopics/submods of feeds as the focus. Also it seems to highlight the custom feeds feature which you can manage yourself. Twitter/X has such features but for the most part you are nudged away from these to improve \"engagement\" metrics.

First, incendiary posts seem to get boosted by the algorithm. It's good for engagement, which keeps people online and hooked, which feeds more ads, and is good for the business. Elon and his CEO of the company know this. Second, the more you look at the replies, the more you find people who are weirdly into Elon Musk. They'll bring him up even in a thread where he's not mentioned and the topic isn't about him. \"Thank god Elon saved free speech!\" or something rather. Just profoundly weird stuff that I can't help but feel is designed to stroke his ego. Again, I believe the algorithm is intentionally boosting these things. It also serves to create a cult of personality. He's not just the site owner, but he's its \"savior\". Lastly, the company is clearly in trouble financially. Revenue is down substantially by all accounts, and there's a very high valuation to live up to. They want to get people to pay money, look at ads, and keep them coming back again and again for more. Being community-first and focused on people having the kind of good time they want in their communities just doesn't align with those very difficult business constraints. reply lupire 19 hours agoparentprevDuocultures, not monoculture.

The protocol does this using the Merkle tree structure, which is also how Git stores data. The issue with this is: if you want to look at one piece of content in the system, you also need to know about everything that happened before. This isn't quite accurate. You only need the MST blocks in the merkle path(s) back to the root, for the subset of records that you care about. For a single record, that's O(logn) blocks on average, where n is the total number of records in the repo. For a full checkout, the MST block count is ~33% of the number records in the repo, on average.

It’s also a core assumption of the service that all the data (aside from out-of-protocol stuff like DMs) is completely open. I'm still skeptical of Bluesky having \"won\" until the average user is completely aware of things like this. I fully expect that there will be some drama about this openness at some point in the future. When this happens, we'll see if people go back to Twitter again (how many times has it been already?); or if they embrace this new social network where your art and posts can be scraped waaaaaay more easily than in Twitter, so they're probably more likely to be used for AI training anyway.

My assumption is most people don't want corruption or abuse or racism or fascism; if you think that too then you might have better success helping people understand why they are mistaken about what looks like corruption instead of telling people to just stop sharing opinions you're personally tired of reading. reply valval 10 hours agorootparentAh great, he doubles down on it.

Because, unless my math is wrong, that means there were more people who were so unmoved by either party that they couldn't be arsed to go out and vote, than there were voters for either party. And all those people are pissed off. Personally, I think stuff like comments on HN and Twitter are gonna be a good pressure valve over the next few years. Maybe even some Onion, Saturday Night Live and Daily Show for those masses. Because if those people ever get what they perceive to be a reason? I mean, they've already shown fairly consistently that they're no longer interested in the whole non-violent democratic norm of voting thing. And if a guy like Trump can't even bring them out, that means they're not at all interested in anything either side is selling. After looking at those numbers, I guess I just wouldn't be so sure that the people making these comments are liberals. Or even independents for that matter. Independents on the sidelines are, at least, reasonable and vote. What we have boiling outside the stadium, so to speak, is something different entirely.

Educate yourself before someone else does and sells you short. Fluoride can damage the liver in a number of ways, including: Liver function enzymes: Fluoride can increase the activity of liver enzymes like transaminases and phosphatases, which can indicate liver damage. Liver cell membrane: Fluoride can rupture the liver cell membrane. Mitochondrial damage: Fluoride can damage mitochondria in liver cells. Protein synthesis: Fluoride can prevent the liver from producing important proteins like albumin and clotting factors. Glucose metabolism: Fluoride can disrupt the liver's ability to regulate glucose metabolism, which can lead to metabolic disorders like diabetes. Histological changes: Fluoride can cause histological changes in the liver. Fluoride is a small, active molecule that can easily enter cells and cause damage to tissues and organs. Studies have shown that fluoride exposure can cause liver damage in a variety of animals, including rats, mice, goats, and cattle. To treat fluoride toxicity, you can try: Calcium chloride: Lavage with a 1-5% calcium chloride solution to bind the fluoride in the stomach.

And yet we not only want to revert any decision that was made that we think correlates with an unhappy situation, we also want to choose people who are as different as possible from the guys we think are responsible for the unwanted status quo. So if the current politicians are serious people who talk in an articulate way we conclude that seriousness is a problem, because it's two faced. We conclude that being articulated is a problem because it's judgemental, it's a symbol of being elites. If you conclude that serious looking articulated people are two-faced lying elites there are many alternatives in a multidimensional solution space. You could desire honest serious elites, or honest serious commoners, or many variations on the theme. But no, we obviously want to get exactly the opposite, because that's the monodimensional thing to do! It's simpler. Let's pick the exact opposite of the people we have.

But I think Trump usually tries to deliver on whatever he said in the campaign (like in 2016), like you can expect wide reaching tariffs in January or February (especially since half-way competent advisors, congress, and the courts are probably not going to moderate him as much this time). Maybe make any computer purchases in December just to be safe. reply giantg2 16 hours agorootparentThat would be pretty ironic if Trump is able to deliver more on his promises than other politicians. reply collingreen 14 hours agorootparentWhy would it be ironic? He has less regard for the political group and general stability than a more run of the mill politician and now there is explicit immunity for anything he wants to do, like when he sold classified documents but \"declassified them in his mind\" right before once he got caught. We watched four years of this already, including a rally with gallows being built in the crowd being told to march on the Capitol (he claims figuratively, and everyone just misunderstood, despite all the posts and planning and travel and tour groups). Last time it was absurd news headline after headline just to distract from the other things going on. We saw some bonkers stuff that would have disqualified other candidates in the past (or at least most candidates probably thought it would). At this point I think his promises are easier to deliver on and he doesn't care about (and has been made immune from) the consequences that usually temper a politician's ability to deliver. Tariffs, no health plan, another wall (remember when he pardoned bannon for stealing the money they raised for the wall?), \"stopping the war in Ukraine\" but without a free Ukraine at the end, and decimating government regulatory agencies.

There’s a reason advertisers spend so much money and effort cultivating a very specific customer image: it works. In the case of Tesla - and I cannot overstress enough how much lf this is purely subjective conjecture on my part and not a statement of fact - the image cultivated by the company and its Chief Executive is very much one of rejecting norms and expectations, fierce independence, and a hostility towards others (mostly from the Cybertruck unveiling onward). The people who relate to that brand would, I would think, be more likely to flout laws like speed limits, failing to use indicators for turns or merges, and drive more aggressively than a brand that emphasizes safety or enjoyment of experience (like Hondas and Toyotas). My purely subjective experiences bear this out, and I’m consistently rewarded giving Teslas a wider berth on the roads.

This data is interesting, but not really useful for decisionmaking if we can't isolate the extent to which the disparities are caused by features of the actual vehicle, as opposed to driver selection factors. Is anyone making an argument that the Model Y has an actual safety problem in its design? I'd like to hear about which physical aspect of the car people think is making it 4x less safe than the average car? I don't see anything obvious. Its crash test performance is fine.

As safety features go up, complacency goes up, and to be blunt that's combining with the fact that drivers are getting consistently worse overall at the skill anyway. Between EV's that are much, much heavier than ICE cars and SUVs/Trucks that are much larger than they need to be, vehicles themselves, despite having more safety features than ever, are also better at killing that they've been at a long time too. We really need to get serious about improving our transportation infrastructure. reply toast0 21 hours agorootparent> In a bigger picture, cars are a bad solution to the problem of transportation at scale They're not a great solution to transportation at scale, but they're pretty good at small volume point to point traffic. There's not enough people going my way on most of my trips to make transportation at scale worthwhile. Ferries work well for part of many of my trips, but I can take a car on the ferry to deal with the lack of scale on either side. I could sometimes take a bus to the ferry, walk to light rail and take light rail to the airport. But the bus only runs during commute times, so that impacts viable flight times, and the walk to the light rail got pretty sketchy in the past several years and light rail itself can be sketchy too. Most of my cars run fine any time of day, although peak traffic is annoying, and I'm dealing with lighting issues on one so I can't take it out unless I know I'll be home before dusk. reply thebruce87m 10 hours agorootparentprev> much, much heavier https://thedriven.io/2024/05/03/are-evs-really-much-heavier-... > full electric versions are only around 10% to 15% heavier than their direct ICE equivalent I don’t think “much, much” should be used when we are talking 10-15%. This will mislead people. There are outliers of course. reply randomdata 22 hours agorootparentprev> We really need to get serious about improving our transportation infrastructure. Better yet, we really need to consider urbanization. That way everything you need is right there by your own two feet. No need for any extra special transportation at all.

I'm not sure we can actually overcome that pressure. reply p_j_w 21 hours agorootparentEven with heavy urbanization you'll need some form of transit on top of walking. Have you ever visited any really big cities (eg. Tokyo)? Every time I'm in one, I get the impression they would grind to a standstill without their mass transit systems. reply CalRobert 21 hours agorootparentEven a decent town puts most things within a walk or bike ride. San Luis Obispo comes to mind as an example. reply oblio 21 hours agorootparentI've never understood the argument about small towns being worse for urbanism. Back in the day, before cars were widespread, everything had to be close by. You don't even have to sacrifice the backyard for that, you can have a city layout that puts the houses themselves fairly close to each other, and the yards can radiate outwards. Then you connect each cluster's main street with the other ones, but unlike suburbs, you make each \"subdivision\" mixed-use and you allow public transit , pedestrians and cyclists to cut across subdivisions for easy access everywhere. If anything, small towns should be urbanism done right, because they don't (shouldn't?) have the money for sprawl and they don't have all the pressures for increasing density a lot, that big cities have. reply CalRobert 9 hours agorootparentIndeed, and there are small businesses mixed in with the houses. But the problem is cars (it's always cars). A coffee shop next to your house is fine - a delight even - when 20 people arrive by walking or biking. When it's 20 cars though it's misery. reply rufus_foreman 19 hours agorootparentprev>> Back in the day, before cars were widespread, everything had to be close by. My grandparents, and their parents and grandparents before them, all grew up on farms (as did the majority of Americans during that time). No, everything did not have to be close by. They certainly did appreciate cars when they became affordable though. reply randomdata 21 hours agorootparentprev> Have you ever visited any really big cities (eg. Tokyo) Yes, these are the rural areas of which we speak. Everything gets spread out and then you're stuck travelling long distances to do anything, just like those who live in actual rural areas. There is no question that transportation is necessary in a rural area. A proper urban environment, however, puts everything right there in a short distance. No need to ever travel beyond where your feet can take you. That's the whole reason for living so close to other people. But it's clear that people want to live in (or pretend to live in) rural areas. It seems to be in our nature. As such, there is a lot of pressure to maintain the way things are. Hence the ill-conceived cries for better transportation to maintain the rural way of life instead of actually embracing urbanity. reply ToucanLoucan 21 hours agorootparentI would say that's better characterized as an opposition to urbanization that's designed for and presumes the ownership of cars by those who live there, and to that I heartily agree! Gridlock-bound US cities are a nightmare to navigate, but again, that is not the fault of the city, that is also the fault of the car and how inefficient it is as a transport solution. If cars simply didn't exist, our cities would not, could never have, been designed the way they are, in any way. reply randomdata 21 hours agorootparent> If cars simply didn't exist, our cities would not, could never have, been designed the way they are, in any way. Nah. Many cities long predate the car. They absolutely were designed in the same way they are still found now, aside from what are now roads were squares for people to walk in.

But most places will never have that... reply nradov 21 hours agorootparentEven nice apartments are pretty miserable places to live if you have multiple small children, or engage in hobbies or activities that require much equipment. Imagine coming home to your apartment with a muddy mountain bike. Do you haul it up to the 4th floor in the elevator and wash it in your shower?

Maybe $500,000? How much does 160 acres of land cost in Manhattan? Maybe $800,000,000? Urbanization decreases some costs and increases others. reply ToucanLoucan 21 hours agorootparentprevI mean the problem isn't those who don't want to live in cities nor is it those who want to live in cities: the problem is the suburbs, which is where those two meet. People who aren't in and do not desire an actual rural lifestyle where one has a standalone home on a large plot of land in the middle of nowhere, but also don't want a condo. They want their own little plot of land, with a small yard, and a standalone home. And like, same. That's also me. But the problem is the actual costs of that style of home are incredibly, heavily subsidized by the cities they surround and indeed even the rural areas they border, because suburbs are just... a bad goddamn way to house people. They're incredibly inefficient, basically require your own personal car, require the most infrastructure build-out for the smallest population, require the largest footprint of services over the largest area to serve the smallest number of people, etc. etc. And like, I don't think it's unreasonable to say if you want to live this way, that's fine, but then you need to actually pay for it. Your property taxes need to reflect how much it actually costs to serve your property, to build the huge number of roads needed to access it, to maintain those roads, to maintain the electrical grids, to maintain the water and sewage services, to bus kids to schools, etc. etc. etc. And yeah that's going to make suburbs WAY less appealing because they're going to be fucking expensive but like, the alternative is, again, everyone wanting that, and not paying for it. The dense urban centers they surround absolutely hemorrhage money supporting the suburbs around them. reply ghaff 21 hours agorootparentAround where I live (greater Boston metro) most of the tech jobs are actually out in the suburbs/exurbubs.

I know I certainly don’t. reply afavour 21 hours agorootparentI think a lot of people would be happy to use it if it was convenient and reliable. I live in NYC and haven’t had to drive to/from work in over a decade. I consider the subway ride a vast, vast improvement over driving… but only when the subway works right. reply nomel 21 hours agorootparentThe vast majority of people I talk to, including myself, don't use public transportation for: 1. Time. For example, my commute is 25 minutes, but 2 hours ride and three mile walk by public transport. 2. Safety, intimately tied to the homeless problem. 3. Cleanliness. In my experience, related to #2, and the fact that government institutions are incapable of caring about user experience, because they get funding regardless. Matted, stained fabric seat cushions, and dried whatever caked on the floor. There's nothing better or remotely alluring about public transportation for the vast majority of people (as shown by gridlock traffic). reply afavour 21 hours agorootparentLike I said, when it works right. A 2 hour ride and three mile walk is very obviously not a viable commute. As for safety, you’re orders of magnitude more likely to get into a car crash than have anything happen to you on the NYC subway. Yes, incidents happen but they’re dramatically inflated in the public consciousness. Your objection (and most of the others I see) aren’t objections to the fundamental nature of public transit, rather they’re objections to shit public transit or to urban life in general (whole lotta city car parks that aren’t clean!). Which is entirely understandable. But there are plenty of examples of functional public transit serving millions of people in cities across the world. Those people aren’t all secretly wishing they were in a car. reply SamoyedFurFluff 21 hours agorootparentprevI just think you have shite public transport, mate.

Sure if I said public transport is strictly superior because I drive a car that breaks down constantly, you’d see the problems not cars, yeah? reply maxerickson 21 hours agorootparentprevIt's kind of boring to respond to a comment about public transit needing to work well by complaining about how it doesn't. Especially when limiting investment has often been an explicit choice in whatever given area. reply gorbachev 21 hours agorootparentprevThat's because most Americans haven't seen a public transport service that works well. Visit or live in a major European city for a while and you are likely change your tune. reply ToucanLoucan 21 hours agorootparentprevYour desire to not be inconvenienced is not as important as the lives of other people who are being killed unnecessarily for it. That being said, to be clear, I don't think we need to make driving illegal or whatever. I think a TON of people would happily not be saddled with the expense of owning a car or the task of driving if there were reasonable alternatives on offer, which in the few pockets of the US that actually have decent mass transit, is broadly the case. reply ghaff 21 hours agorootparentThat said, I drove into a nearby city after dark which is increasingly early last night. There are no reasonable alternatives--I will for a 9-5 event but just doesn't work for the evening. There's a decent mass transit system including commuter rail but it it's just not organized around coming in at 5pm. It's chaos with cars/cycles/escooters/pedestrians often randomly crossing streets, poor visibility, etc. I mostly just don't go in any longer. reply Mountain_Skies 20 hours agoparentprev>In the US at least, the top killer of drivers are trees on the side of the road. A decade or so ago the Georgia Department of Transportation tried to do away with the trees between streets and sidewalks because of so many fatalities coming from collisions with trees. Clearing out an \"automative recovery zone\" as they called it likely would have saved lives of some people in vehicles but of course it would increase the danger to pedestrians, who might or might not be present at that moment. Lots of trade offs in these types of analysis and not all of them are always immediately obvious. reply littlestymaar 21 hours agoparentprev> You can load the cars with safety features, but it doesn't change the fact that these cars are very heavy Being heavy is actually a safety feature of sort (but just for the people inside the car, it increases overall fatality). reply Gigachad 21 hours agorootparentTrees are anchored to the ground. Being heavier just reduces your ability to stop. reply bastloing 21 hours agorootparentDecreases your tendency to flip over. I'm astonished by all the dashcam videos out there showing collisions, usually the first thing an ice car does is flip over. Not EVs though. reply bena 20 hours agorootparentThat's more a factor of weight distribution rather than weight itself. EVs carry their weight lower to the ground. SUVs and pickup trucks are more top heavy. Passenger cars have a higher probability to rollover, but not that much greater than an EV. reply bastloing 20 hours agorootparentIce cars have a much higher rollover risk compared to EVs. All the data supports that along with physics. Absolutely weight distribution. Compare the heavy battery in an EV vs the heavy motor that's up a bit higher in an ice car. Pretty much any hit over around 20mph to the front quarter panel of an ice car, truck, or SUV will flip it over. reply rich_sasha 21 hours agorootparentprevMaybe that's good when hitting a tree? Slower deceleration, less force. reply jkaptur 21 hours agorootparentI think they meant that it's more difficult to stop before beginning to impact the tree. reply rich_sasha 20 hours agorootparentStill. If I'm going to hit a tree, I'd rather drive a tank than a motorbike. reply JasonSage 20 hours agorootparentCars have crumple zones which a motorbike does not. A lighter car requires less work from the crumple zone to decelerate the car into non-fatal territory than a heavy car. reply postalrat 21 hours agorootparentprevIt ain't working then because these heavy cars tend to have more fatalities. reply almatabata 20 hours agorootparentThe study seems to contradict this: \"When broken out by size, small cars have the highest fatal accident rate while midsize and full-size cars are both below average.\" And later in the study, “When two small cars collide the forces are equalized and both vehicles tend to hold up well. But if a compact hatchback and a full-size pickup truck try to occupy the same space at the same time, the smaller car always loses.” reply legitster 21 hours agorootparentprevIn insurance they call it the \"law of lugnuts\" - bigger cars have better survivability in direct collisions. However, most traffic fatalities do not come from direct collisions. They come from driver hitting immobile objects. Smaller, lighter cars take less kinetic energy with them around corners, are easier to steer and avoid obstacles, and are more likely to stay upright when leaving the road. reply jvandonsel 20 hours agoparentprevSimple solution. Cut down all the trees on the side of the road. You’re welcome. reply Alupis 20 hours agoprev> The study's authors make clear that the results do not indicate Tesla vehicles are inherently unsafe or have design flaws. In fact, Tesla vehicles are loaded with safety technology; the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) named the 2024 Model Y as a Top Safety Pick+ award winner, for example. Many of the other cars that ranked highly on the list have also been given high ratings for safety by the likes of IIHS and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, as well. > So, why are Teslas — and many other ostensibly safe cars on the list — involved in so many fatal crashes? “The models on this list likely reflect a combination of driver behavior and driving conditions, leading to increased crashes and fatalities,” iSeeCars executive analyst Karl Brauer said in the report. “A focused, alert driver, traveling at a legal or prudent speed, without being under the influence of drugs or alcohol, is the most likely to arrive safely regardless of the vehicle they’re driving.” Ok so Tesla's aren't less safe than any other vehicle in this lineup. It's just that Tesla drivers are more likely to be careless. reply aziaziazi 18 hours agoparent> So, why are Teslas — and many other ostensibly safe cars on the list Interesting, my initial mental concern was: \"So, why IIHS ranked cars highly involved in crash with Top Safety+?\" Didn’t they though using statistics could help prevent accidents in praxi? reply Nasrudith 20 hours agoparentprevMy first thought was if mass got factored into it, but it looks like mass has already crept up pretty high for other cars. A Toyota Prius is about 3200 lbs and a Model 3 is about 4000 lbs or 3800 lbs for their lightest variant. My mental models were outdated and still imagined sedans as about one ton and change.

Could Tesla drivers be taking bigger risks because they think the car's software will save them from the negative consequences of their risky decisions?

I drove 50 miles to and from work every day for 5 years, around Stockholm, Sweden. 80 % highway traffic. The only driving aid I use (rely on) on is ACC (Automatic Cruise Control), to keep my speed and distance (maximum) to the car in front of me. I almost always stay in the rightmost lane doing the speed limit. Without a doubt Tesla drivers consistently stood out as the most \"strange\". Drivers of all brands can be stressed and drive too fast, but Tesla drivers were janky, couldn't stay in their lanes, and very often didn't keep a safe distance to the car in front of them. Worst part, they didn't seem aware of their surroundings. They would merge in the most insane situations/positions or dangerously try to pass other drivers.

If an EV had the same range as the ICE then it would be massively heavier, but with significantly reduced range it is only slightly heavier. reply thebruce87m 5 hours agorootparentI don’t think people talk about hypothetical EV weight when they make such claims, the claims tend to revolve around EVs currently on the road. We should also try to discuss “waiting time” rather than range so that people start to think in these terms. My overall waiting time is much lower for my EV than my old diesel, despite the range of the EV being lower. Less time waiting to fill up on a weekly basis (0 mins while I sleep vs 5 mins filling up + journey time to the petrol station), less time defrosting in the winter (0 mins remote pre-heat vs 5+ scraping), less time waiting to fill up on long journeys (0 extra mins while I eat vs 5 extra mins filling up).

What viewers got instead was an amalgam of buffering issues, choppy analysis and the dreaded \"black screen of death.\" Paul and Tyson have yet to make their way to the ring for Friday night's blockbuster bout. But as the main card rolls on, more and more subscribers are taking to social media to express frustration over Netflix's performance. With the streaming giant set to host not one but two NFL games on Christmas Day later this year, Friday's showing could be a bad omen for the sports fans. Here's what you need to know. MORE PAUL VS.

Netflix buffering issues, explained Countless Netflix users complained about the quality of Friday night's stream. Some were presented with lengthy loading screens, while others were dealt a more tragic fate: being hit with the \"black screen of death.\" Increased viewership did little to stop the issue.

There are numerous people with experience building these systems they could have hired and listened to. It isn’t a novel problem.

Full stop. It's not full stop. There are reasons why they failed, and for many it's useful and entertaining to dissect them. This is not \"making excuses\" and does not get in the way of you, apparently, prioritizing making a moral judgment. reply softwaredoug 1 hour agoprevThe way to deal with this is to constantly do live events, and actually build organizational muscle. Not these massive one off events in an area the tech team has no experience in. reply _fat_santa 2 hours agoprevWhen you step back and look at the situation, it's not hard to see why Netflix dropped the ball here. Here's now I see it (not affiliated with Netflix, pure speculation): - Months ago, the \"higher ups\" at Netflix struck a deal to stream the fight on Netflix. The exec that signed the deal was probably over the moon because it would get Netflix into a brand new space and bring in large audience numbers. Along the way the individuals were probably told that Netflix doesn't do livestreaming but they ignored it and assumed their talented Engineers could pull it off. - Once the deal was signed then it became the Engineer's problem. They now had to figure out how to shift their infrastructure to a whole new set of assumptions around live events that you don't really have to think about when streaming static content. - Engineering probably did their absolute best to pull this off but they had two main disadvantages, first off they don't have any of the institutional knowledge about live streaming and they don't really know how to predict demand for something like this. In the end they probably beefed up livestreaming as much as they could but still didn't go far enough because again, no one there really knows how something like this will pan out. - Evening started off fine but crap hit the fan later in the show as more people tuned in for the main card. Engineering probably did their best to mitigate this but again, since they don't have the institutional knowledge of live events, they were shooting in the dark hoping their fixes would stick. Yes Netflix as a whole screwed this one up but I'm tempted to give them more grace than usual here. First off the deal that they struck was probably one they couldn't ignore and as for Engineering, I think those guys did the freaking best they could given their situation and lack of institutional knowledge. This is just a classic case of biting off more than one can chew, even if you're an SV heavyweight. reply TheAceOfHearts 2 hours agoparentThis isn't Netflix's first foray into livestreaming. They tried a livestream last year for a reunion episode of one of their reality TV shows which encountered similar issues [0]. Netflix already has a contract to livestream a football event on Christmas, so it'll be interesting to see if their engineers are able to get anything done in a little over a month. These failures reflect very poorly on Netflix leadership. But we all know that leadership is never held accountable for their failures.

In other words: Company A: \"We can provide web scale live streaming service around the world to 10 billion humans across the planet, even the bots will be watching.\" Company B: \"OK, sounds good, Yes, here is a $2B contract.\" Company A: \"Now team I know we don't have the capability, but how do we build, test and ship this in under 6 months???\" reply 999900000999 1 hour agorootparentStartups absolutely sell things they haven't made yet and might not even be capable of doing. Next thing you know it's 9pm on a Sunday night and your desperately trying to ship a build for a client. Netflix isn't some scrappy company though. If I had to guess they threw money at the problem. A much better approach would of been to slowly scale over the course of a year. Maybe stream some college basketball games first, slowly picking more popular events to get some real prod experience. Instead this is like their 3rd or 4th live stream ever. Even a pre show a week before would of allowed for greater testing. I'm not a CTO of a billion dollar company though. I'm just an IC who's seen a few sites go down underload. To be fair no one knows how it's going to go before it happens. It would of been more surprising for them to pull this off without issues... It's a matter of managing those issues. I know if I had paid 30$ for a Netflix subscription to watch this specific event I'd assume I got ripped off. reply yorwba 41 minutes agorootparentprevYou don't necessarily have to make false promises. You can be totally honest and upfront that the functionality doesn't exist yet and needs to be built first, but that you think you understand the problem space and can handle the engineering, provided you can secure the necessary funding, where, by the way, getting a contract and some nominal revenue now could greatly help make this a reality... And if the upside sounds convincing enough, a potential customer might happily sign up to cover part of your costs so they can be beta testers and observe and influence ongoing development. Of course it happens all the time that the problem space turns out to be more difficult than expected, in which case they might terminate the partnership early and then the whole thing collapses from lack of funding. reply whstl 55 minutes agorootparentprevIf anything, startups are more transparent about it.

And if there's anyone it should apply to it would be a little startup company that needs to focus on their core area. Every off the shelf component on the market needs institutional knowledge to implement, operate, and maintain it. Even Apple's \"it just works\" mantra is pretty laughable in the cold light of day. Very rarely in my experience do you ever get to just benefit from someone else's hard work in production without having an idea how properly implement, operate, and maintain it.

Once you have the video encoded on a server with a stable connection the hard part is over. What netflix failed to do is spread the files to enough servers around the globe to handle the load. I'm surprised they were unable(?) to use their network of edge servers to handle the live stream. Just run the stream with a 10 second delay and in that time push the stream segments to the edge server reply dylan604 2 hours agorootparentThis right here is where I'd expect the failure to occur. This isn't Joey Beercan running OBS using their home internet connectivity. This is a major broadcast. I'd expect a full on broadcast truck/trailer. If they were attempting to broadcast this with the ($) option directly to a server from onsite, then I would demand my money back. Broadcasting a live IP signal just falls on its face so many times it's only the cheap bastard option. Get the video signal as a video signal away from the live location to a facility with stable redundant networking. This is the kind of thinking someone only familiar with computers/software/networking would think of rather than someone in broadcasting. It's nice to think about disrupting, but this is the kind of failure that disruptors never think about.

From a livestreaming standpoint, netflix is 0/x - for many large events such as love is blind, etc. From a livestreaming standpoint, look to broadcast news, sports / Olympics broadcasters, etc and you'll see technology, equipment, bandwidth, planning, and professionalism at 1000x of netflix. Heck, for publicly traded quarterly earnings livestream meetings, they book direct satellite time in addition to fiber to make sure they don't rely only on terrestrial networks which can fail. From a business standpoint, failure during a quarterly meeting stream can mean the destruction of a company (by making shareholders mad that they can't see and vote during the meeting making them push for internal change) - so the stakes are much higher than live entertainment streaming.

Livestream focused outfits do this all day, everyday. Netflix doesn't even come close to scratching the \"beginner\" level of these kinds of live events. It's a matter of competencies.

They do make you code but the questions were 1. Not on hacker rank or leetcode 2. Pratical coding questions that didn't require anything more than basic hashmaps/lists/loops/recursion if you want. Some string parsing, etc. They were still hard, you had to code a fast, but no tricky algorithms required. It also felt very collaborative, it felt like you were driving pair programming.

Reminded me of Netflix a dozen years ago. reply spike021 14 hours agorootparentAmazon Prime isn't so great. Lots of for rent/purchase content or content with ads these days. And they end up repeating slots of content in all the rows in their UI, so I end up seeing the same suggestions everywhere rather than much that's new (other than first party productions). To me they're basically padding their front page. But honestly that's most of the major streaming platforms these days. I recently cancelled Disney Plus for similar reasons. The only reasons I don't cancel prime or Netflix are because I have family members I split the memberships with to share. reply chamomeal 13 hours agorootparentI recently found a lil dvd rental place in my city. It’s a non-profit, they also do archivals and stuff. It’s pretty much a two-story townhouse packed head to toe with DVDs (lots of blu rays!) You don’t realize how limited the streaming collection is until you’re back in a movie store, looking through thousands and thousands of movies you would never find otherwise. Since I found it, I’ve started doing movie night every week with my friends. It’s such an absolute blast. We go to the store, each pick out a random movie that looks good (or bad, in a good way) or just different. All of a sudden, I love movies again!! reply spike021 13 hours agorootparentThat's an excellent option. I think it'd be remiss not to mention local libraries. Of course, your mileage may vary, but the ones I've gone to do seem to have adequate selections. I just don't often make time to go there and browse like I would have at traditional video rental places back in the day. Heck, mine even have some video games; though from when I've checked they're usually pretty back-reserved. reply bsimpson 12 hours agorootparentprevI was in high school in the early 00s, and going to the movies was such a big part of my life.

I've had an account for ~15y and only really use it for airplanes unless there's a specific thing I'm excited to watch. I'm in the same boat where as soon as they make it too hard to share, I'll probably cancel it. I think the main reason their sharing crackdown hasn't been a problem so far is that I use it so seldomly, it thinks the \"main\" address is my parents, which makes it easy for me to pass the \"are you traveling\" 2FA on my own phone when I do want to watch something. reply nicce 14 hours agorootparentprevAmazon Prime front page includes currently a lot of ads for movies that you can rent or ”buy”.

I think it got worse for sellers recently too. If I search for something, like a specific item using its description, sometimes the only result for it shows \"sponsored\". It used to show up as sponsored and also unsponsored below. If this changed, I assume it is bad for the seller. Either they pay for all search results, or their metrics are skewed because all searches were helped by \"sponsorship\" (and there are no longer unsponsored hits) reply unsnap_biceps 14 hours agorootparentprevI was watching the rings of power and it started with a \"Commercial free experience provided by so and so\" with a long ad at the start of the episode, and then a third of the way into the episode, at a critical action part, it broke in the middle of the actor's sentence to a 6 minute ad block.

That's the only thing that seems fair. It has been pretty useless. At the moment seems to be working only when running in non-live mode several minutes behind. So if there are 1 million trying to stream it, that means they would lose $15 million. So.. they might only give a partial refund.

Also people are gambling on the outcomes so watching a few minutes behind is a big deal reply dh2022 12 hours agoparentprevI think why I will remember about this fight is not the (small) streaming issue I encountered as much as the poor quality of the fight itself. For me that was the reputational loss. Netflix was touting “NFL is coming to Netflix”. This fight did not really make me want to watch that. reply MyFedora 7 hours agoparentprevNetflix won't take a hit here. Most people pay Netflix to watch movies and tv shows, not sports. If I hadn't checked Hacker News today, I wouldn't even know they streamed sports, let alone that they had issues with it. Even now that I do, it doesn't affect how I see their core offering, which is their library of on-demand content. Netflix's infrastructure is clearly built for static content, not live events, so it's no shock they aren't as polished in this area. Streaming anything live over the internet is a tough technical challenge compared to traditional cable. reply oplav 7 hours agorootparentNetflix is trying to expand into live sports. This event wasn’t a one off thing. There is an NFL game they are streaming at the end of the year. reply oaththrowaway 14 hours agoparentprevI used to work for a live streaming platform once. We always joked that VOD (Netflix) was \"easy\" compared to live. reply taeric 12 hours agorootparentNot really a joke, though? VOD has obvious methods to cheat a bit. Redundancy abounds and you can even network shape for costs. Could probably get even better compression for clear reasons. Live, not so much. One source that you have to fanout from and absolutely no way to get cheap redundancy. Right? reply oaththrowaway 2 hours agorootparentYes, of course but it was still a cope because we never saw more than maybe 3M concurrent viewers at a time reply Yeul 8 hours agoparentprevThere's a difference between live broadcasts and serving up content that's sitting on a server I guess?

It's not just about the sheer numbers of viewers, it's that a live model totally undermines their entire infrastructure advantage. See: https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/ reply stingraycharles 14 hours agorootparentCorrect, this is not Netflix’ regular cup of tea, and it’s a very different problem to solve. They can probably use their edge caches, but it’s challenging. reply nicce 14 hours agorootparentHow YouTube does this? Netflix is like drop in the ocean when compared to. reply unsnap_biceps 14 hours agorootparentMy wild assed guess is the differences in the edge nodes. Netflix's edge nodes are optimized for streaming already encoded videos to end users. They have to transcode some number of formats from the source and send them all to the edge nodes to flow out. It's harder to manage a ton of different streams flowing out to the edge nodes cleanly. I would guess YouTube, being built on google's infrastructure , has powerful enough edge nodes that they stream one video stream to each edge location and the edges transcode for the clients. Only one stream from source to edge to worry about and is much simpler to support and reason about. But that's just my wild assed guess. reply vitus 13 hours agorootparent> I would guess YouTube, being built on google's infrastructure , has powerful enough edge nodes that they stream one video stream to each edge location and the edges transcode for the clients. Ha, no, our edge nodes don't have anywhere near enough spare CPU to do transcoding on the fly. We have our own issues with livestreaming, but our system's developed differently over the past 15 years compared to Netflix's. While they've historically focused on intelligent pre-placement of data (which of course doesn't work for livestreaming), such an approach was never feasible for YT with the sheer size of our catalog (thanks to user-generated content). Netflix is still new to the space, and there isn't a good substitute for real-world experience for understanding how your systems behave under wildly different traffic patterns. Give them some time. reply kortilla 13 hours agorootparentIt also helps that youtube serves shit tier quality videos more gracefully. Everyone is used to the step down to pixel-world on youtube to the point where they don’t complain much. reply Ekaros 12 hours agorootparentAnd decent part of these users are on free tier, so they are not paying for it. That alone gives you some level of forgiveness. At least I am not paying anything for this experience. reply spike021 14 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience even YouTubeTV has problems sometimes. I'll have the 1080p (and enhanced mode also I think) quality set and still deal with a lot of compression artifacts. reply Bilal_io 14 hours agorootparentprevNot sure how Netflix does it. But this is not very time sensitive, and I would have delayed the stream by 15 to 30 seconds to cache it and then deliver to everyone. reply sgarland 14 hours agorootparentprevI wonder how effective it would be to cache live events with a delay. Write to the tail, read from the head. reply thefreeman 14 hours agorootparentthat’s totally unacceptable for live sports which people are able to bet on reply kortilla 13 hours agorootparentI have bad news for you. This is how it works already for “live” sports reply jrpelkonen 17 minutes agorootparentCorrect. Here are some latency numbers from the last SuperBowl: https://www.phenixrts.com/resource/super-bowl-2024 Even the best latency is dozens of seconds behind live action. reply YZF 11 hours agorootparentprevYep. Having actually worked on this sort of stuff I can confirm. Your ISP doesn't have enough bandwidth to the Internet (generally speaking) for all users to get their feed directly from a central location. And that central location doesn't have enough bandwidth to serve all users even if the ISP could. That said, the delay can be pretty small, e.g. the first user to hit the cache goes upstream, the others basically get the stream as it comes in to the cache. This doesn't make things worse, it makes them better. reply squeaky-clean 12 hours agorootparentprevI don't bet so I have no clue, but why is that? Are people able to place bets in the middle of the match or something? I would have assumed bets get locked in when the fight starts reply umanwizard 12 hours agorootparentIdk about traditional sports books but on Polymarket you can certainly continue betting at any time until the market resolves. reply pests 11 hours agorootparentThey end betting some minutes before the fight ends.

You know, like every other broadcaster, streaming platform, and company that does live content has been able to do. Acting like this is a novel, hard problem that needs to be solved and we need to \"upsell\" it in tiers because Netflix is incompetent and live broadcasting hasn't been around for 80+ years is so fucking stupid. reply kortilla 13 hours agorootparentEvery other live platform has a delay of multiple seconds reply dullcrisp 14 hours agorootparentprevLive sports require microwave relays for high frequency sports bets reply andreimackenzie 14 hours agorootparentprevI would be surprised if they don't already do this. The question is how big a buffer to trade off for delay... reply ethbr1 14 hours agorootparentprevI'm curious if the root cause is more variable than usual latency. Sample size 1, but... I saw a ton of buffering and failure on an embedded Netflix app on a TV, including some infinite freezes. Moved over to laptop, zero buffering. I assume the web app runs with a lot bigger buffer than whatever is squeezed into the underpowered TV. reply YZF 11 hours agorootparentLikely these devices use different media formats and/or quality levels. And yes, it's possible one device buffers more than the other. Infinite freezes sounds like some routing issues or bugs. reply ethbr1 6 hours agorootparentWhen I was watching the behavior on the tv, was wondering if buffering sends some separate, non-business-as-usual requests, and that part of Netflix's delivery architecture was being overloaded. E.g. \"give me this previous chunk\" vs \"send me the current stream\" reply h4l 14 hours agorootparentprevThat model still works for streaming. You have a central source stream only to the distributed edge locations, then have clients only stream from their local edge location. Even if one region is overwhelmed, the rest can still work. Load on the central source is bounded. reply pinkmuffinere 14 hours agorootparentprevDamn that sucks. I wonder if they could have intentionally streamed it 5 min late? I don’t have all the context around the fight though — maybe a competing service would win if Netflix intentionally induced delay? reply adrr 12 hours agorootparentthey were introducing 5 minute delays on some of the clients. I noticed my ipad was always live and the smart tv had a 5 minute delay but you could fast forward to live. reply _dark_matter_ 14 hours agorootparentprevI don't think that live doesn't work with caches. No one watching live would care about a O(s) delay, which is highly amenable to caching at ISPs and streaming changes from there to downstream clients. Offhand I'd say that would support O(ms) delay but no less. reply bushbaba 14 hours agorootparentprevNot sure I fully buy that. The “live” stream is rarely “live”. It’s often a highly cached buffer that’s a few mins from latest. Those in isp caches can still help here. reply apexalpha 10 hours agoparentprev>but my impression still has always been that Netflix is a step above the rest technically.

Looks fine now though. reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 14 hours agoparentprevIs cable and broadcast better for live TV? No scaling issues. Doesn't matter how many people tune in. reply vitus 13 hours agorootparentIt's fundamentally different, for sure. Most third-party internet-based streaming solutions are overlaid on top of a point-to-point network, while broadcast is one-to-many, and even cable tends to use multicast within the cable provider's network. You have potentially different problems, e.g. limited bandwidth / spectrum. If, say, there are multiple games going on at the same time, you can only watch whichever feed the broadcaster decides to air. And, of course, regardless of the technology in use, there are matters of acquiring rights for various events. One benefit of internet-based streaming is that one service can acquire the rights and be able to reach everyone, whereas an individual cable provider might only reach its direct subscribers. reply Ekaros 12 hours agorootparentOn cable(terrestrial is entirely different) even the bandwidth or spectrum is less limiting for broadcasting multiple games. Hard thing is the other parts of production, like cameras, live-directing and live commentary. Adding new channels is less challenging than actual producing content at expected level there. reply betaby 13 hours agorootparentprevInterestingly that TV nowadays is delivered through IP. reply Valord 13 hours agorootparentprevSeems like it reply Fire-Dragon-DoL 14 hours agoparentprevFor me, netflix constantly forget the last episode/spot I was in a TV show.

If they botch the NFL games, it will surely hurt their reputation. reply that_guy_iain 14 hours agoparentprevI don't think it'll be long-term. Most people will forget about this really quickly.

YouTube, Twitch, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc have all demonstrated to stream simultaneously to hundreds of millions live without any issues. This was Netflix's chance to do this and they have largely failed at this. There are no excuses or juniors to blame this time. Quite the inexperience from the 'senior' engineers at Netflix not being able to handle the scale of live-streaming which they may lose contracts for this given the downtime across the world over this high impact event.

I wouldn't be surprised if lots of engineers at Netflix are currently now writing up a length post mortem of this.

And there are full blown CDN companies that will write an enterprise contract with you that can do this stuff with ease. Akamai is like 25 years old now.

I wonder if we got lucky on this or just some areas got unlucky. reply ilaksh 9 hours agoprevI guarantee this is a management issue. Somebody needed to bear down at some point and put the resources into load testing. The engineers told them it probably won't be sufficient. I assume this came down to some technical manager saying they didn't have the human and server resources for the project to work smoothly and a VP or something saying \"well, just do the best you can.. surely it will be at least a little better than last time we tried something live, right?\" I think there should be a $20 million class action lawsuit, which should be settled as automatic refunds for everyone who streamed the fight. And two executives should get fired. At least.. that's how it would be if there was any justice in the world.

I'd think this isn't too crazy to stress test. If you have 300 million users signed up then you're stress test should be 300 million simultaneous streams in HD for 4 hours. I just don't see how Netflix screws this up. Maybe it was a management incompetence thing? Manager says something like \"We only need to support 20 million simultaneous streams\" and engineers implement to that spec even if the 20 million number is wildly incorrect. reply margaretdouglas 12 hours agoparentHas there ever been a 300m concurrent live stream? I thought Disney+ had the record at something like 60m. reply nonameiguess 7 hours agorootparentThere's no way 300 million people watched this, especially if that number is representing every Netflix subscriber. The largest claimed live broadcast across all platforms is last year's Super Bowl with 202 million unique viewers for at least part of it, but that includes CBS, Nickelodeon, and Univision, not just streaming audiences. Its average viewers for the whole game was 123 million, which is second all-time to the Apollo 11 moon landing. reply vitus 6 hours agorootparentFIFA claimed the 2022 World Cup final reached 1.5 billion people worldwide, but again that seems like it was mostly via broadcast television and cable. As far as single stream, Disney's Hotstar claimed 59 million for last year's Cricket World Cup, and as far as the YT platform, the Chandrayaan-3 lunar landing hit 8 million. 100 million is a lot of streams, let alone 300. But also note that not every stream reaches a single individual. And, as far as the 59 million concurrent streams in India, the bitrate was probably very low (I'd wager no more than 720p on average, possibly even 480p in many cases). It's again a very different problem across the board due to regional differences (such as spread of devices, quality of network, even behavioral differences). reply markus92 7 hours agorootparentprevWorld Cup final, if you add up all streams worldwide? reply JCharante 10 hours agorootparentprevprobably an esports match hosted on bilibili reply l33t7332273 2 hours agoprevI thought Netflix’s biggest advantage was the quality/salary of its engineers.

In a protocol where a oft-repeated request goes through multiple intermediaries, usually every intermediate will be able to cache the response for common queries (Eg: DNS). In theory, ISPs would be able to do the same with the HTTP. Although I am not aware of anyone doing such (since it will rightfully raise concerns of privacy and tampering). Now TLS (or other encryption) will break this abstraction. Every user, even if they request a live stream, receives a differently encrypted response. But live stream of a popular boxing match has nothing to do with the \"confidentiality\" of encryption protocol, only integrity. Do we have a protocol which allows downstream intermediates eg ISPs to cache content of the stream based on demand, while a digital signature / other attestation being still cryptographically verified by the client? reply curiousDog 14 hours agoprevUtter incompetence from senior leadership at Netflix.

I have only work with HLS live streaming where playlist is constantly changing compared to VOD. Live video chunks work same as VOD. CloudFront also has a feature request collapsing that greatly help live streaming. So, my question is if Netflix has already figured out CDN, why their live infrastructure failing?

I built this earlier this week since I wanted a simple API to do OCR – it uses llama 3.2 vision (hosted on together.ai, where i work) to parse images into structured markdown. I also have it available as an npm package. Planning to add a bunch of other features like the ability to parse PDFs, output a response in JSON, ect...

If you want to use a different model you can, but you will want to edit the instruct template to match. * https://github.com/jabberjabberjabber/LLMOCR reply nirav72 8 hours agorootparentMiniCPM-v 2.6 is probably the best self-hosted vision model I have used so far. Not just for OCR, but also image analysis. I have it setup, so my NVR (frigate) sends couple of images upon motion alert from a driveway security camera to Ollama with minicpm-v 2.6. I’m able to get a reasonably accurate description of the vehicle that pulled into the driveway. Including describing the person that exits the vehicle and also the license plate. All sent to my phone. reply sdflhasjd 6 hours agoprevHere's a bit of a quirk: I uploaded a webcomic as an example, all the dialog was ALL CAPS, but the output was inconsistently either sentence case or title case between panels. I also tried some real examples a problem I'd like to use OCR with: I've got some old slides that needs digitising, and most of them are labelled, uploading one of these provides the output: The image appears to be a photograph of a slide or film frame, possibly from an old camera or projector. The slide is yellowed with age and has a rectangular cutout in the center, which is filled with a dark gray or black material. The cutout is surrounded by a thin border, and there is some text written on the slide in black ink. The text reads \"Once Upon a Time\" and is written in a cursive font. It is located at the bottom of the slide, below the cutout. There is also a small number \"1069\" written in the same font and color, but it is not clear what this number refers to. Overall, the image suggests that the slide is an old photograph or film frame that has been preserved for many years. The yellowing of the slide and the cursive writing suggest that it may be from the early 20th century or earlier. So aside from unnecessary repetitious description of the slide, (and the \"yellowing\" is actually just white balance being off, though I can forgive that), the actual written text (not cursive) was \"Once Uniquitous.\" and the number was 106g. It's very clearly a 'g' and not a '9'. What I think is interesting about this is that it might be a demonstration of biases in models, it focuses too much on the slide being an antique that it hallucinated a completely cliche title. Also, it missed the forest for the trees and that the \"black square\" was the slide being front-lit so the text could be read, so the transparency wasn't visible. Additionally, the API itself seems to have file size or resolution limits that are not documented reply philips 11 hours agoprevI have recently used llama3.2-vision to handle some paper bidsheets for a charity auction and it is fairly accurate with some terrible handwriting. I hope to use it for my event next year. I do find it rather annoying not being able to get it to consistently output a CSV though. ChatGPT and Gemini seem better at doing that but I haven’t tried to automate it. The scale of my problem is about 100 pages of bidsheets and so some manual cleaning is ok. It is certainly better than burning volunteers time. https://github.com/philips/paper-bidsheets reply mosselman 9 hours agoparentWhat about using llama3.2-vision to do the OCR bit and then deferring to ChatGPT to do the CSV part? reply notsylver 12 hours agoprevI've been doing a lot of OCR recently, mostly digitising text from family photos. Normal OCR models are terrible at it, LLMs do far better. Gemini Flash came out on top from the models I tested and it wasn't even close. It still had enough failures and hallucinations to make it faster to write it in by hand. Annoying considering how close it feels to working. This seems worse. Sometimes it replies with just the text, sometimes it replies with a full \"The image is a scanned document with handwritten text...\". I was hoping for some fine tuning or something for it to beat Gemini Flash, it would save me a lot of time. :( reply danvk 4 hours agoparentI've had really good luck recently running OCR over a corpus of images using gpt-4o. The most important thing I realized was that non-fancy data prep is still important, even with fancy LLMs. Cropping my images to just the text (excluding any borders) and increasing the contrast of the image helped enormously. (I wrote about this in 2015 and this post still holds up well with GPT: https://www.danvk.org/2015/01/07/finding-blocks-of-text-in-a...). I also found that giving GPT at most a few paragraphs at a time worked better than giving it whole pages. Shorter text = less chance to hallucinate. reply pbhjpbhj 4 hours agorootparentHave you tried doing a verification pass: so giving gpt-4o the output of the first pass, and the image, and asking if they can correct the text (or if they match, or...)? Just curious whether repetition increases accuracy or of it hurt increases the opportunities for hallucinations? reply philips 11 hours agoparentprevHave you tried downscaling the images?

I was using scans made with mobile phone cameras for this. convert -density 76 input.pdf output-%d.png https://github.com/philips/paper-bidsheets reply notsylver 10 hours agorootparentThat's interesting. I downscaled the images to something like 800px but that was mostly to try improve upload times. I wonder if downscaling further and with a better algorithm would help.. I remember using CLIP and found different scaling algorithms helped text readability. Maybe the text is just being butchered when its rescaled. Though I also tried with the high detail setting which I think would deal with most issues that come from that and it didn't seem to help much reply og_kalu 12 hours agoparentprev>Normal OCR models are terrible at it, LLMs do far better. Gemini Flash came out on top from the models I tested and it wasn't even close. For Normal models, the state of Open Source OCR is pretty terrible. Unfortunately, the closed options from Microsoft, Google etc are much better. Did you try those ? Interesting about Flash, what LLMs did you test ? reply notsylver 11 hours agorootparentI tried open source and closed source OCR models, all were pretty bad. Google vision was probably the best of the \"OCR\" models, but it liked adding spaces between characters and had other issues I've forgotten. It was bad enough that I wondered if I was using it wrong. By the time I was trying to pass the text to an LLM with the image so it could do \"touchups\" and fix the mistakes, I gave up and decided to try LLMs for the whole task. I don't remember the exact models, I more or less just went through the OpenRouter vision model list and tried them all. Gemini Flash performed the best, somehow better than Gemini Pro. GPT-4o/mini was terrible and expensive enough that it would have had to be near perfect to consider it. Pixtral did terribly. That's all I remember, but I tried more than just those. I think Llama 3.2 is the only one I haven't properly tried, but I don't have high hopes for it. I think even if OCR models were perfect, they couldn't have done some of the things I was using LLMs for. Like extracting structured information at the same time as the plain text - extracting any dates listed in the text into a standard ISO format was nice, as well as grabbing peoples names. Being able to say \"Only look at the hand-written text, ignore printed text\" and have it work was incredible. reply dleeftink 7 hours agorootparentWordNinja is pretty good as a post-processing step on wrongly split/concatenated words: [0]: https://github.com/keredson/wordninja reply pbhjpbhj 4 hours agorootparentprevThe OCR in OneNote is incredible IME.

I'm trying to do the exact same thing right now, digitize family photos. Some of mine have German on the back. The last OCR to hit headlines was terrible, was hoping this would be better. ChatGPT 4o has been good though, when I paste individual images into the chat. I haven't tried with the API yet, not sure how much that would cost me to process 6500 photos, many of which are blank but I don't have an easy way to filter them either. reply notsylver 10 hours agorootparentI found 4o to be one of the worst, but I was using the API. I didn't test it but sometimes it feels like images uploaded through ChatGPT work better than ones through the API. I was using Gemini Flash in the end, it seemed better than 4o and the images are so cheap that I have a hard time believing google is making any money even by bandwidth costs I also tried preprocessing images before sending them through. I tried cropping it to just the text to see if it helped. Then I tried filtering on top to try brighten the text, somehow that all made it worse. The most success I had was just holding the image in my hand and taking a photo of it, the busy background seemed to help but I have absolutely no idea why. The main problem was that it would work well for a few dozen images, you'd start to trust it, and then it'd hallucinate or not understand a crossed out word with a correction or wouldn't see text that had faded. I've pretty much given up on the idea. My new plan is to repurpose the website I made for verifying the results into one where you enter the text manually, as well as date/location/favourite status. reply bosie 11 hours agorootparentprevUse a local rubbish model to extract text.

It is a visual composition of circles and does not convey any information that can be translated into Markdown format. reply Vetch 9 hours agoparentBased on the fact that squinting works, I applied a Gaussian blur to the image. Here's the response I got: Markdown: The provided image is a blurred text that reads \"STOP THINKING IN CIRCLES.\" There are no other visible elements such as headers, footers, subtexts, images, or tables. Markdown Content: STOP THINKING IN CIRCLES As the response is not deterministic, I also tried several times with the unprocessed image but it never worked. However, all the low-pass filter effects I applied worked with a high success rate. https://imgur.com/q7Zd7fa reply mg 8 hours agorootparentI guess blurring it is similar to reducing the resolution or to looking at the image from further away. It's interesting that the neural net figures out the circles, but not the words. Because the circles are also not so easily apparent from looking closely at the image.

Note that this is just as open to hallucination as any other LLM output, because what it is doing is not reading the pixels looking for text characters, but describing the picture, which uses the images it trained on and their captions to determine what the text is.

In short, your username maps to an internal database, which is what X does too. 2. Bluesky’s basically Twitter before it needed to give money back to investors. I’d bet money that we will be seeing more broken features ten years from now when Bluesky will have to focus on how to give the money back to investors. (Yes, I am slightly biased towards ActivityPub, even though Bluesky has better architecture.) reply LeoPanthera 17 hours agoparentprev> Your username can be your website. I'm @bradgessler.com.

My show HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6529523 This probably sounds silly but in the end I didn’t actually use Bluesky because they don’t support emoji domains. reply extraduder_ire 16 hours agorootparentDid you try using the emoji domain as-is, or did you use the punycode version? e.g. .com vs xn--w77hd.com Because I can imagine them not implementing support to limit lookalike codepoints being used in handles, or they just hadn't gotten around to supporting punycode in their domain verifier. reply throwawaycities 15 hours agorootparentI attempted both the emoji character and punycode. Emojis are tricky, most domain registrars can’t get them right, most browsers can’t get at least some right (usually the ones with ZWJ characters. So by no means a knock on Bluesky, but I was waiting for an invite code for so long just to be able to use an emoji as my identity. Not directed at you, but not sure why my initial comment was downvoted, it’s pretty damn hard for new social media platforms to get users from other platforms - and as domain identity/usernames is a main competitive feature and I was super excited then didn’t end up using it, sharing my experience might be worth more than downvoting reply Joker_vD 10 hours agorootparentWell, the last time I checked (it was 2 years ago so maybe something has changed since), all of the emojis were explicitly on the list of codepoints that are prohibited from appearing in IDNs. So all those domain registrars that accept emojis in the domain names just simply didn't bother to read the standards they were supposed to implement. reply throwawaycities 8 hours agorootparentYes I believe that is correct emojis are not IDNs; however, ICANN authorizes ccTLDs support emojis separately I think it’s just considered punycode. Only about a dozen ccTLDs have authorized support for them and allow them to be registered. Browsers support them, it’s just certain emojis a nearly universally problematic and don’t resolve. Otherwise long as the ccTLD supports DNSSEC the emoji domain names support DNSSEC just the same include those that don’t resolve it browsers. ICANN rules allow ccTLDs to create emoji/punycode domains - domain registrars and TLD owners are not going rouge and allowing registration of domains in violation of ICANN rules or policies. Not sure if you know Ben he’s launched a lot of small projects here on HN a few hitting front page and going viral in the HN/product hunt communities, but one of them was Mailoji - basically a cool story of him registering hundreds of single emoji domains and creating email (forwarding) service with them. As one might imagine it didn’t just go viral on HN/product hunt but on TikTok with the kids. As far as Bluesky they definitely could support emoji domains, I understand the argument that it takes extra effort to do that and they may not see it as worth the time and effort - but I’d be more open minded about the opportunity and appeal to younger users. reply Vaslo 17 hours agoparentprevIt’s going to go the way of Threads and Mastadon. Lukewarm results at best, but glad you are enjoying it. reply nmfisher 15 hours agorootparentI jumped on Bluesky, Mastodon and Threads during earlier exodi. They all waned for various reasons (Mastodon was slow and unreliable, Threads was basically an Instagram feed of nothingness, and Bluesky was dead at the time). This wave does feel very different though. People joining in large numbers (I gained more followers in a day than in a year on Mastodon). The Bluesky app itself is actually very nice. Twitter is becoming more and more unbearable with the force-feeding of ads and totally broken search (that's without even mentioning the post-election environment).

I wonder if instead of black+repeating images (assumption here is that's the display and not an artifact of the firehose, the same unique image often repeats a lot in the same short instance) it'd be cleaner to have some sort of exponential backoff queue (the closer it is to empty the slower it empties like 0.5s/numInQueue, last element in queue will wait no less than 0.5s but also wait for the next element to queue). This would make the flow a bit more consistent, never blank, and never repeating. Also if images kept their aspect ratio. reply cyberlimerence 17 hours agoparentprevI like the concept, but it is flashing way too fast. Maybe do a random selection every 1 sec, rather than a straight fire hose ? reply esperent 18 hours agoparentprevIs there any way to make it flash less?

    "originBody": "First impressions: Lenovo T14s with Qualcomm Snapdragon ARM64 CPU Go to: [ bottom of page ] [ top of archives ] [ this month ] From: Poul-Henning KampDate: Fri, 15 Nov 2024 20:52:03 UTC Those of you how know me, know that I am not a big fan of the X86 architecture, which I think is a bad mess, mangled by market power considerations, rather than the CPU architecture this world actually needs, in particular in terms of performance/energy ratio. So when my regular HW-pusher had a T14s G6 with Qualcomm Snapdragon ARM64 CPU, for only EUR1000 + VAT, and I couldn't resist. Physical: --------- Lenovo T-series as we know it. FreeBSD-current status: ----------------------- -CURRENT needed some patches to ARM64-specific interrupt stuff, that too half a day or so, patches are in transit. A lot of my time were spent trying to slow down the EFI console enough to be able to capture the boot messages with my mobile phone's camera. One particular note here is that the VT console switches to a 25Hz timer driven screen update once interupts are supposed to work, and if they dont, you wont see why on the screen. I think we ought to have a loader-tunable, settable to a number, which slows down the console proportional to that number, and if non-zero, the VT console should not rely on the timer. That would have saved me some trouble and confusion yesterday. With those pending patches: What works: Screen, NVME, the two USB-A ports and that's probably about it. What does not work: Keyboard, mouse, TB & USB-C ports, thermal/freq mgt. What is not tested: Everything else Worldstone: ----------->>> World built in 3210 seconds, ncpu: 12, make -j12 ... using 24 Wh of energy, measured with a proper power-meter. Likely explanation: Twelve real CPUs and none of that HTT-crap ?

They love to boast about technical achievements instead of doing something that would actually enable real-world regular-usage scenarios.

For what it's worth, the majority of mechanical RGB keyboards and mice are USB-A anyways, so, if you're fine with a very powerful machine that wouldn't have an internal keyboard support for a few weeks, sounds like a good advice anyways! reply smolder 7 hours agorootparentI'm unsure what RGB or a keyboard being mechanical has to do with it being USB-A, or what the relevance is, but yes, there are many USB-A peripherals available. reply cnst 42 minutes agorootparent> The only thing my post was addressing is that you called out RGB mechanical keyboards specifically when there are also plenty of non-RGB and non-mechanical options. It was bizarre, like this reply. The point was that even the more \"premium\" products are still USB-A, not USB-C. USB-A simply isn't going anywhere. Personally, I find USB-A more useful than HDMI, since HDMI is kind of inferior to USB-C in every possible way. I've tried using a 43\" UHD TV as a monitor, since they're as cheap as $149.99 USD brand new, but it had noticeable delay even at 4k@60Hz, and just didn't feel right. The UHD resolution at 43\" itself would actually be perfect, since 1080p at 20.5in used to be my fav a few years ago (before QHD at 23\" started reaching the sub-$200 range), but, alas, the specs of a proper monitor (brightness, matte, USB-C with PD and a hub) are just better suited for a display compared to a TV, even if the resolution itself may seem ideal. reply cnst 4 hours agorootparentprevThe point is that most of the keyboards for sale on Amazon are still USB-A, even the more fancy ones, even though Apple useds tend to portray USB-A as last-century and deprecated. USB mice is still faster and more fluid cursor movement than Bluetooth, too. Also of note, even the most premium keyboards and mice are Full Speed USB 1.1, running at up to 12Mbps. You can verify this yourself through the Apple menu, About This Mac, System Report, USB, and look for your external USB keyboard or mouse. Compare to the USB-C USB4 ports being capable of up to 40000Mbps. And, to be full-featured, they need to support up to 100W, or more, of power input, as well as output in excess of what would be required for a USB-A USB3 5000Mbps or even 10000Mbps port. Which is to say, for the cost of a single USB-C, a manufacturer can easily provide 4 or more USB-A ports, with a change to spare. That would avoid unnecessary adapters and improve compatibility. Not to mention that most of the memory sticks are still USB-A, too, and there's no Fit USB sticks for USB-C at all, only for USB-A. Which means that it's far easier to semi-permanently extend storage of a USB-A laptop than of a USB-C one, which you may want to do to try out a system without messing up with your main Windows installation. It's basically a nab against Apple's decision to remove a useful port, especially on the M4 Mac mini, where they now have USB-C ports that are not fully-featured anymore — the ports at the front have a different spec than the ones at the back, which we all remember now at the time of the announcement, but imagine dealing with it several years down the line, where you'll have to be looking up specs and troubleshooting your things not working the way you expect. They could have easily avoided it by NOT including the 2 slow USB-C ports, and including like 4 USB-A ones instead. reply glitchc 18 hours agorootparentprevAn ARM64 is \"a very powerful computer\"?

It convinced me that we're not ready for ARM Linux desktops for general-purpose, regular-person use. Besides all the crappy Linux desktop software today (I have been trying multiple recent distros out on multiple new laptops... all the Linux desktop stuff now is buggy, features are gone that were there 10 years ago... it's annoying as hell). The ARM experience is one of being a second-class citizen. A ton of apps are released as AppImages or Snaps/Flatpaks. But they have to be built for both X86_64 and ARM64, and extremely few are built for the latter. Even when they are built for it, they have their own bugs to be worked around, and there's fewer users, so you wait longer for a bugfix. The end result is you have fewer choices, compatibility and support. I love the idea of an ARM desktop. But it's going to cause fragmentation of available developer (and corporate/3rd-party) resources. ARM devices individually are even more unique than X86_64 gear is, so each one requires more integration. I'm sticking to X86_64 so I don't have to deal with another set of problems. reply raegis 19 hours agoparentOne hopeful note: the developers for the Snapdragon X Elite are active on the kernel mailing list, and they are supplying patches for specific laptops, including the T14s.

The only notable exception here is Apple with their absolutely bonkers RAM upgrade prices, which is why I would never buy a Macbook.

You're right, and when I read that I assumed the usual HN context of engineering == the kind of software engineering most often discussed on here. I see what you meant now. Here's where I was coming from anyway, reframed in the context of your comment: Web dev is painful on Windows. NTFS really can't deal with 50k+ files in node_modules, I think it's something like 50-100x slower still. Not to mention that Windows by default _still_ tries to go and index your entire node_modules and silently poops the bed. This is one of the main reasons behind WSL's popularity, but that only works if you don't have your code on a mounted NTFS volume. Make the mistake of reopening the same repo you started working on in Windows in WSL2 thinking that you'll see an improvement & you'll bed disappointed - silently. You have to move your react project out of NTFS entirely and let the virtualised linux kernel manage those descriptors if you want to get work done. macOS has a similar problem - not with NTFS but with Docker / virtiofs. Web development experience is generally awesome on macOS if you're working natively, but if you want to work inside a devcontainer (to maintain consistency with prod) and depend on Docker, it slows down considerably. I've heard that OrbStack and Colima have recently made this much better on macOS, but I've not tried it recently. But other more serious software development scenarios, where you want a might want a local k8s environment or you're writing lambda functions that you want to test locally? You have to use Docker and take the hit. In Linux it has always just worked (podman aside). Not to mention that Chrome's memory management is way better there than in Windows (thanks, ChromeOS). For the rest of these please keep in mind that I explicitly said I was talking about quality of experience rather than quantity of people having to suffer through it, so the whole 'how many X people are on Linux when their manager makes them use Windows' argument is one I was specifically trying to avoid. With that said, I'll try to answer the rest of your qs: > Anything graphics programming related. D3D and Metal are significantly more prevalent than OpenGL or Vulkan. Agree almost completely - you wouldn't be building most graphics to run on Linux, so why not develop where your target platform is best supported. I disagree with your assertions around opengl or vulkan (see android), but UE5/Unity support in Windows vs elsewhere proves your point. > Anything CAD related, because there’s next to no professionally used CAD software on Linux. Agree, again obviously. In my case I love Onshape, and it works really well on Linux (apart from spacemouse driver support, which is a spacemouse issue not an Onshape one - there's no such thing as a class-compliant spacemouse interface and direct usb access for chrome would need them to implement a full driver; they invested heavily in getting a hack working on Windows but obviously not worth it for Linux, if for no reason other than that their target userbase will be extremely accustomed to Windows because of historical software availability and compatibility). But yeah, Onshape is an exception. > Audio stuff. How many DAWs have a significant Linux user base? Ardour supposedly has some recent converts, and the kernel is supposed to be acceptably good at realtime stuff now, pulseaudio/jack are supposedly better now. Regardless, you're right - it's too little too late. FWIW last time I did any real audio work absolutely nothing came close to CoreAudio (even on intel hackintoshes, or _especially_ on intel hackintoshes vs Windows on the same hardware). I don't think that has changed much since. RME drivers make a difference on Windows but WMI still sucks and ASIO on windows still isn't as stable as mac. Reaper officially supports Linux ( And even beyond that, how many website devs are on Linux Almost all of the ones I know, with a few of them still on Mac but curious. Literally none on Windows. > Flip that around, why would someone use Linux to develop when they could use macOS? Can you give a non-subjective answer? Then try the opposite. Hopefully I did that when I explained myself above. > Even if you’re developing for Linux deployments, you can still do most of it local and then spin up docker in the VM on demand. > The number of software developers who need to run a Linux VM on their Mac/Windows are a vast minority. I think I already answered this, but for my (admittedly ignorant initial) definition of \"actual engineering\", unless you're targeting iOS or desktop development, _everyone_ is developing for linux as their primary target. Everyone. I directly disagree with your final two statements, and that's kind of the point I was trying to make. For modern cloud/infra/saas/product/platform/web dev, i.e. the arguably subjective definition of \"actual engineering\", everything else is a compromise. Docker is, VMs are, WSL is. reply dagmx 3 hours agorootparentNot to be flippant, but don’t your final two paragraphs boil down to : “if you ignore all the non-Linux stuff, everyone is on Linux?” Also why is that the “arguable subjective definition”? Why are we trying to define “actual engineering” at all, even if subjective? On what scale are you defining that? Users? Complexity? Not to be rude, but it feels like “people in a Linux bubble are just reluctant to admit that there’s a wider non-Linux world out there”. You said “most of the engineering discussed on here” but there’s tons of posts about graphics engineering. It just happens that web/saas is the most approachable end of software engineering.

If Qualcomm continues to actually work on Linux, rather than let enthusiasts do all of the work for them like Apple, I think ARM on Linux is going to be all Qualcomm with Macs yet again being a second citizen in the Linux world.

Asking since I've been considering doing the same thing reply imiric 18 hours agorootparentMitchell Hashimoto has written extensively about his use of Linux in a VM on macOS. He published a NixOS configuration[1] which seems easy to use. I recently bought a Mac mini M4 to experiment with this setup, and am strongly considering getting a MBP if it works as advertised. As a longtime ThinkPad user and F/LOSS enthusiast, it feels awful giving money to Apple to run Linux as a second-class citizen, but honestly there is just no comparable hardware that does what Apple has accomplished. [1]: https://github.com/mitchellh/nixos-config reply kpeeters 9 hours agorootparentprevI have been running Ubuntu inside Parallels on an M1 MacBook for several years now, and am in general quite happy with it. What makes it less than ideal is e.g. that only OpenGL 3.3 is supported in Linux guests (Windows guests get 4.1), but for some reason the Vulkan support is actually quite good, and allows me to run the graphics tools I need. Having most AppImages out there unavailable on ARM64 is also sometimes a problem, but that's not Parallels' fault. Parallels has some glitches (graphical flicker when it runs low on guest memory, less than stellar trackpad scrolling) but is otherwise very stable. I like that I have access to Linux and macOS at the same time, the other side is just a 3 finger swipe away, and cut-n-paste and shared folders work. Sound and video all work, though for things like zoom calls I tend to use the macOS side. All runs happily together with 16GB RAM for each side (and I often have both xcode and android studio open on the macOS side while compiling large projects on the Linux side). reply cnst 20 hours agorootparentprevI'm actually thinking of switching from a Mac back to the PC, since everything is done in a browser anyways, regardless of the system, but the lack of the fanless laptops in the PC world isn't promising. ThinkPad X13s Snapdragon was fanless, but it's a bit old now, plus, only 2x USB-C, without any USB-A ports, and a screen that doesn't open 180°, unlike any other ThinkPad, meh. reply authorfly 10 hours agorootparentOne small tip I didn't appreciate for far too long with \"mac-peer\" laptops that have fans is to use them unplugged. My laptop almost never spins up fans when it is unplugged, and I can get a good batch of work done with the battery levels of today and fast charge over lunch. It's still not quite as ideal nor as long a battery life as Mac. But it feels so beautiful. For the first time on Linux I feel better, like I am not just making sacrafices for values but like the actual whole all-around experience is better in most ways compared to my work Mac (M2 Pro so fans abound and not as aesthetically pleasing as the Airs IMO). It's instantly snappy, I have a nice large SSD, I've already swapped out RAM, no issues with key software, I have a theme with a desktop experience I prefer over the Mac one, and I can go to a presentation and type without fans stressing me out. As someone in AI for a while, personally, I don't value GPUs or NPUs, but that would be a difference.

Most laptops IME mostly get used on a desk whether with additional paraphernalia or not; 'laptop' gets used to describe the class of machine more than whether it's touching your legs or not.

It is designed to be a future-proof and decentralised alternative to the structured routing protocols commonly used today on the Internet, as well as an enabling technology for future large-scale mesh networks. Yggdrasil is: Scalable Supports large, complex or even Internet-scale topologies Self-healing Network responds quickly to connection failures or mobility events Encrypted Traffic sent across the network is always fully end-to-end encrypted Peer-to-peer Works entirely ad-hoc by design with no built-in points of centralisation Cross-platform Supported on Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS, Android and more The current implementation of Yggdrasil is a lightweight userspace software router which is easy to configure and supported on a wide range of platforms. It provides end-to-end encrypted IPv6 routing between all network participants. Peerings between nodes can be configured using TCP/TLS connections over local area networks, point-to-point links or the Internet. Even though the Yggdrasil Network provides IPv6 routing between nodes, peering connections can be set up over either IPv4 or IPv6 networks. This is still an alpha-stage project and there may be some breaking changes in the future. Despite that, Yggdrasil is generally stable enough for day-to-day use and a small number of users have been using and stress-testing Yggdrasil quite heavily for a variety of use cases. If you are interested in or would like to get involved in the Yggdrasil project, start below: Install and configure Yggdrasil on your own computer or router to join the network.

I thought this would be straightforward since it’s advertised as a scheme/protocol, but such a spec isn’t referenced anywhere! Digging on my own I eventually found [1] on a side-branch of one of their other GitHub projects. Kudos to the author: I think it actually covers a lot of what you’d need to know: crypto identities, message formats, wire protocols, peering and stream semantics, spanning tree updates and root selection, the DHT, forwarding logic, sessions, etc. A couple things are TODOs like how to verify and sign root updates, and there’s some ambiguity in the tiebreaker algorithm for next-hop selection. It seems to be very tightly coupled to TCP as the transport layer though, since all packets need to be delivered reliably and in the order they were sent, and need to be capable of being fragmented into smaller packets for varying MTU sizes. [1] https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-specs/blob/ys... reply neilalexander 2 hours agoparentWe did spend a little bit of time documenting the earlier v0.3 protocol, as you have linked, but the protocol has changed significantly in design twice since then. v0.4 changed the DHT quite a bit and v0.5 removed the DHT altogether. As a research project it likely will continue to change until we settle on a design we are happier with, at which point we will definitely spend more time documenting it. The need for ordered/reliable links is mostly for convenience of development at this stage, but that can be fixed for sure. reply Rhapso 1 hour agorootparentLook at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.06461 if you want to try a chord dht again. Kademlia is a lot less intuitive, but by not ever assuming it's tables are correct, it handles and corrects inconsistency (and malicious nodes) better. Chapter 6 of this pile of (my) crap https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cs_diss/106/ talks about doing latency optimization on dht routing. Basically just embedding then network graph into a metric space. reply colordrops 1 hour agoparentprevIs coupling with TCP a problem? Does it do anything that goes against their goal of full decentralization? reply macawfish 1 hour agorootparentMakes it hard to do hole punching I think? At any rate, direct connections currently cannot be established between multi-hop peers, traffic gets routed through peers instead. I think this has something to do with the TCP choice. reply hahajk 4 hours agoprevOk, so as I understand it, yggdrasil and cjdns are virtual P2P networks that offer the normal layer 3 routing services, but built on top of the existing internet. So they still require ISPs and internet backbones, etc. Are there any projects attempting to build a worldwide P2P network that can replace the IP layer? Like a mesh network that can operate without verizon, cisco routers, etc? I know of some mesh network technologies aimed at small disconnected networks but nothing consumer-facing and supporting anything more than a few thousand nodes. reply progval 2 hours agoparentThat was the original goal of cjdns, which is why it automatically peers with other nodes reachable over Ethernet (no IP needed), including WiFi (see the first paragraph of https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/doc/Whitepape...). Unfortunately, its approach to routing turned out to not scale in practice. Yggdrasil uses a different routing algorithm so it might. reply neilalexander 2 hours agorootparentYggdrasil was actually inspired in part by cjdns but the design is very different. We care deeply about scale and we want an Yggdrasil network to be able to grow organically without requiring a strict hierarchy, huge amounts of state etc. We’re still working on it of course but for now the public test network is somewhere around 5000-6000 nodes and continues to work pretty well as it grows. reply YesThatTom2 3 hours agoparentprevIP was originally an overlay network on top of the telco network.

Unfortunately they scale very poorly (among other issues) and this is a fundamental limitation of their design. The Internet (ARPAnet) started out as a mesh network and the concept of trunks, backbones, and routing came about to solve those scaling issues. reply ajsnigrutin 3 hours agoparentprevWhy would you want to remove the IP layer? Or are you thinking about IP layer, just not on the \"internet\", but on a separate network? If this, then how do you suggest connecting people together? Mesh becomes innefficient due to mesh routing at larger sizes and sooner or later you just reinvent \"your own internet\", but not worldwide, because you don't have the resources to actually connect the whole world together. reply hahajk 2 hours agorootparentIn order to access the internet you are required to enter into a contract with a corporate entity. That's not because the internet is \"theirs\" (like Facebook's servers and systems are Meta's), but because the network layer was design with the assumption that companies would do the work of setting up ISPs, core routers, peering agreements, etc. I'd like to see a P2P protocol that doesn't assume this but instead is designed to be completely decentralized, and anyone running the protocol can join. This protocol would provide addressing routing like our current IP protocol, and TCP/UDP etc can run on top of it. Would this be a separate \"internet\" or could it have gateways to the proper internet? Preferably the latter. There are obvious technical challenges with routing, addressing, mobility, all in a decentralized way but are they truly impossible? reply DanAtC 34 minutes agorootparentYggdrasil can do this but you have to bring the physical layer. reply ajsnigrutin 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's not nearly like that, it's designed that you can build your own, separate networks, before the concept of internet providers even existed (and a few colleges and DoD were the only users). It is completely decentralized (with the exception of DNS, which can be decentralized easily, but isn't). Setting up networks is easy and cheap. the expensive part is pulling cables and connecting people, that's why many countries have the local governments do that. If you live in an apartment building, you can easily create a separate network for all the apartments. If you want to connect to the next building, you'll need a lot more cables and someone to actually dig in the cable or erect the poles and use those to carry the cable... but who will pay for that? What if you want to connect to the next city over... who will pay for the cabling, digging etc? And of course, the paperwork? Underseas cable? Good luck with that.

Without a plan on how to supplant those resources, any replacement network will struggle. reply lambdaone 3 hours agorootparentI think the idea here is that somebody else runs an underlying IP layer, and this rides on top as an overlay network. You could, of course, run a local wireless IP layer and use this to route, but peer-to-peer wireless has well-known scaling problems. Still, it looks like a very interesting and reasonably well thoughout out idea. reply linsomniac 4 hours agoprevI was pretty excited about it 3-4 years ago, but it seems like it's kind of an abandoned project at this point. Anyone making use of it and have any impressions? reply neilalexander 2 hours agoparentDefinitely not abandoned, but it’s a free-time project for myself and another developer.

I use it as a VPN to connect my phone to my home network which are both peered privately to a VPS. It's a bit convoluted vs directly connecting to home, but it was easier to set up than worrying about dynamic IPs, port forwarding, and exchanging Wireguard keys. Multicast peering is neat in that I can access my home server directly using the same Ygg IP when I'm home. Problem is, I have to use an IP; the iOS app doesn't support configuring a custom DNS server for the Ygg VPN connection. Headscale is really a better solution for this use-case, but it's kind-of neat to know there's an alternative Internet available with just an additional peering. reply sunshine-o 1 hour agorootparentUsing Yggdrasil as a mesh VPN for your devices could be a great use case.

As I understand, the long term plan is adding a custom protocol which has no limits for address length. reply neilalexander 2 hours agoparentTruncating the public key to fit in an IPv6 address isn’t totally ideal, agreed, but for now it means that just about any existing IPv6-capable application will work over Yggdrasil without modification, which is a nice property for a testnet. reply Retr0id 2 minutes agorootparentWhat about truncating a hash of the whole public key?

It also helps you analyze abnormal network issues and quickly troubleshooting without the complex steps of packet capturing, downloading, and analysis. Powerful Traffic Filtering: Not only can filter based on traditional IP/port information, can also filter by process/container, L7 protocol information, request/response byte size, latency, and more. # Filter by pid ./kyanos watch --pids 1234 # Filter by container id ./kyanos watch --container-id abc # Filter by Redis key ./kyanos watch redis --keys my-key1,my-key2 # Filter by response byte size ./kyanos watch --resp-size 10000 Advanced Analysis Capabilities : Unlike tcpdump, which only provides fine-grained packet capture, Kyanos supports aggregating captured packet metrics across various dimensions, quickly providing the critical data most useful for troubleshooting. Imagine if the bandwidth of your HTTP service is suddenly maxed out—how would you quickly analyze which IPs and which requests are causing it? With Kyanos, you just need one command: kyanos stat http --bigresp to find the largest response byte sizes sent to remote IPs and view specific data on request and response metrics. In-Depth Kernel-Level Latency Details: In real-world, slow queries to remote services like Redis can be challenging to diagnose precisely. Kyanos provides kernel trace points from the arrival of requests/responses at the network card to the kernel socket buffer, displaying these details in a visual format. This allows you to identify exactly which stage is causing delays. Lightweight and Dependency-Free: Almost zero dependencies—just a single binary file and one command, with all results displayed in the command line. Automatic SSL Traffic Decryption : All captured requests and responses are presented in plaintext. Examples Capture HTTP Traffic with Latency Details Run the command: ./kyanos watch http The result is as follows: Capture Redis Traffic with Latency Details Run the command: ./kyanos watch redis The result is as follows: Identify the Slowest Requests in the Last 5 Seconds Run the command: ./kyanos stat --slow --time 5 The result is as follows: ❗ Requirements Kyanos currently supports kernel versions 3.10(from 3.10.0-957) and 4.14 or above (with plans to support versions between 4.7 and 4.14 in the future). You can check your kernel version using uname -r. 🎯 How to get kyanos You can download a statically linked binary compatible with x86_64 and arm64 architectures from the release page: tar xvf kyanos_vx.x.x_linux_x86.tar.gz Then, run: kyanos watch If the following table appears: 🎉 Congratulations! Kyanos has started successfully. 📝 Documentation English Document ⚙ Usage The simplest usage captures all protocols currently supported by Kyanos: ./kyanos watch Each request-response record is stored as a row in a table, with each column capturing basic information about that request. You can use the arrow keys or j/k to move up and down through the records: Press Enter to access the details view: In the details view, the first section shows Latency Details. Each block represents a \"node\" that the data packet passes through, such as the process, network card, and socket buffer. Each block includes a time value indicating the time elapsed from the previous node to this node, showing the process flow from the process sending the request to the network card, to the response being copied to the socket buffer, and finally read by the process, with each step’s duration displayed. The second section provides Detailed Request and Response Content, split into Request and Response parts, and truncates content over 1024 bytes. For targeted traffic capture, such as HTTP traffic: ./kyanos watch http You can narrow it further to capture traffic for a specific HTTP path: ./kyanos watch http --path /abc Learn more: Kyanos Docs 🤝 Feedback and Contributions Important If you encounter any issues or bugs while using the tool, please feel free to ask questions in the issue tracker. 🗨 Contacts For more detailed inquiries, you can use the following contact methods: My Email: hengyoush1@163.com My Blog: http://blog.deadlock.cloud Back to top",

Btw, I'm wondering if OFED and/or DPDK are also still used, and if they're still used for fast packet pushing. reply jpgvm 3 hours agorootparentBy OFED I assume you are meaning RDMA and yes, it's used extensively. Not just in HPC but anywhere you are doing high performance collective communication. Frameworks like MPI, UPC/UPC++, NCCL, UCX etc are all underpinned by RDMA. Most of the AI distributed training frameworks are MPI based for example. OFED is less of a thing now because most of the work has gone upstream, both into the kernel and into the rdma-core userland. Also worth mentioning that MLNX_OFED (sometimes called MOFED) is now being transitioned into DOCA-Host. This is mostly because of that aforementioned upstreaming and the move towards more SmartNIC stuff (ala Bluefield) being the focus as core RDMA support is mostly provided by upstream. reply _zoltan_ 5 hours agorootparentprevCan't use RDMA without MOFED properly on Nvidia cards. reply gotbeans 5 hours agorootparentprevI think there must be still some corp frameworks that do use it extensively, but it's just not heard all that much about.

Does this happen organically, or does PR drop tidbits like this to select sources? It seems like a very specific thing for a reporter to ask and find out about. reply Syonyk 17 hours agoparentLook at the Tweet (X? Blurp? What do we call them now?) - it's got the spectrum of the panel, comparing previous and newer panels. If you know what you're looking for in those, you can identify a lot of different phosphor configurations just by the particular shape of the RGB peaks - the older ones have a distinctive multi-peaked red emission that I've seen in various LED bulbs as well over the years. I doubt Apple mentioned it to anyone. Applying a spectrometer to any new light emitting device is just the sort of thing some people enjoy doing. reply jsheard 16 hours agorootparent> the Tweet (X?

So there's both a supply of people eager to pick their products apart and a market of people eager to hear about all the little details and secrets. While Apple probably does seed some stories intentionally, as their PR teams are sharp, they don't need to be doing so for swarms of these reports to pop up after announcements and first shipments. reply MBCook 18 hours agoparentprevIt could simply be the people are now getting their hands on them and testing them for things that Apple didn’t specifically say in their announcements. reply thrw42A8N 17 hours agorootparentThat's my interpretation too, people start finding out stuff when they get their hands on it, and each has their own interests. reply kmonsen 16 hours agoparentprevI think Apple does not specify to give themselves flexibility to change. It’s not sure everyone will get the same panel. reply kolinko 13 hours agoparentprevI think Apple doesn’t communicate it because it makes some of the laptops with „the same” spec better and some worse. I remember that was the case with ssds some time ago - some of the macbooks had a better one, some had a slightly worse one. reply bzzzt 10 hours agorootparentThe M3 line with 256Gb storage had a single SSD NAND chip which made it measurably slower than the M2 series with the same amount. Although irrelevant for most daily work it was a regression which seems to be fixed in the M4 line. Even then, I presume such a bit of bad news would trigger people looking for 'the best spec' to buy the storage upgrade. reply GoToRO 9 hours agoparentprevI'm pretty sure apple is just a marketing machine. They have pro apple posts and smear campaigns on all samsung forums. Main stream media marketing but also guerrilla marketing on forums, social media, even newspaper comments section. I only see this kind of thing from russian propaganda. reply analog31 16 hours agoprevInteresting. As I understand it, shifting the red curve to shorter wavelengths, even by a seemingly small amount, would improve visibility. And something I've learned is that red vision varies by a fair amount from person to person. reply bhouston 16 hours agoparent> And something I've learned is that red vision varies by a fair amount from person to person. Is there vision tests similar to audio tests where they figure out one's individual responses to different wavelengths of light? Super neat. It would be cool to simulate different people's vision, not just colour-blindness but the more subtle variations. reply NL807 15 hours agorootparent>Is there vision tests similar to audio tests where they figure out one's individual responses to different wavelengths of light? Super neat. Unlike consumer audio equipment where you can easily do a frequency sweep to test hearing, you'd need a specialist light source to do the same. Something like a tunable laser. You could probably use a prism to do a similar sweep from a white light source. reply AlotOfReading 12 hours agorootparentYou don't need a frequency sweep. You take three broad spectrum lights and ask people to adjust their brightnesses to match a selection of reference lights. The tool that does this is called an anomaloscope and it was invented before things like lasers in order to study how color vision worked. That work became the basis of CIE (and other standards) that now define how your screen renders accurate colors. This setup is straightforward to adjust to different types of color vision too. They use 3 lights because that's how many opsins normal humans use for color vision. If you're testing di- or tetrachromats you can use 2 or 4 lights respectively, or 12 if you're testing intelligent mantis shrimp. reply Sephr 18 hours agoprevDoes this mean better motion response times? The M-series MacBook Pro displays have notoriously smeary displays while displaying high-motion content, so this would be a welcome addition. reply compass_copium 12 hours agoparentIt shouldn't make a difference. The film is illuminated by a blue LED and constantly glows uniformly yellow, which is the same mechanism as the white LEDs in a traditional display (blue emitter illuminates yellow phosphor coating). The LCD filters this to make specific pixels and would be more responsible. I worked for a now defunct QD company. reply superjan 8 hours agorootparentThe way I thought LCD/LED displays worked was by RGB filtering a uniform white backlight. Is it only this design that does fosforescence per subpixel? Sounds way more energy efficient. reply usrusr 7 hours agorootparentOh, phosphorescence per subpixel (instead of flooding all in \"white\" that was created through phosphorescence from blue in a central place) sounds like an awesome power optimization for where you still want/need subtractive LCD instead of some *LED with additive per-(sub)pixel emitter. For those following outdoor sports tech, I wonder if this might be the secret sauce that allowed Garmin to abandon transflective screens in the Edge 1050, which unlike their post-transflective watches is still technically an LCD. (the not secret at all meat of the change is a depressingly massive battery and big loss in runtime, but I suspect that the battery alone isn't enough to explain that the loss isn't even bigger) reply xattt 18 hours agoparentprev> latest Cd-free QD films are very efficient, feature as good or better color gamut and better motion performance Possibly yes. reply impure 17 hours agoparentprevNotebookcheck says no. Their M4 Pro only did 5-10% better than last year which is still bad. reply brailsafe 18 hours agoparentprevSo far, the answer anecdotally is no, at least not in situations where lit pixels are moved quickly into black areas. In practice, my obnoxious green text black background terminal was kind of gross to scroll, but haven't experimented much with others yet. Playing games has thus far been fine, scrolling in other contexts is fine for practical purposes. Happy to update this if you want after I ruin my new MacBook by experimenting more reply spacedcowboy 16 hours agorootparentHmm.

Seems ok to me. reply glhaynes 14 hours agorootparentThe response being referred to here is the quickness of the pixels' ability to change. reply brailsafe 13 hours agorootparentprevCertainly a clever way to test it. In terms of response, I meant that at least on a fully black background, you should see ghost lines of text between where the line of text was and where it's going, almost like a mouse cursor with a trail reply numpad0 16 hours agoparentprevWas phosphor afterglow ever an issue with LCDs? Just wondering reply compass_copium 12 hours agorootparentLCD BLUs have a uniformly glowing background which is filtered by the LCD to make pixels. If there is delay in pixels updating, it would be the LCD causing it. reply numpad0 11 hours agorootparentaw. of course. Backlight. Filtering. My brain was hallucinating UV emitting LCD with phosphors in place of filters, that's OLED... thanks. reply brailsafe 18 hours agoprevIs there more to the thread or just this one tweet/X thing? Response times notoriously suck on MacBooks, it would be nice to see that remedied, anecdotally it doesn't seem like that's happened yet.

The way the arrangement typically works is that manufacturers will send Apple preproduction samples and Apple will decide which are worth using for upcoming SKUs. The manufacturer will build out production facilities to meet that demand and whatever specs Apple wants. Apple may also help with investment or R&D to develop products to meet feature roadmap targets and increase supplier competition.

That's up to the display manufacturer to calibrate the screen. The content should just be what it is and specify its colorspace properly. (Note, \"properly\" depends on the environment around you, so if you really care about this you have to participate too.) reply bobmcnamara 4 hours agorootparentprevin addition to tandem OLED... Pixel aperture ratio has increased drastically since the early displays. This drops current density for a given amount of light output, and there's a nonlinear relationship between current density and segregation so that helps a ton. Deuterium helps make more light per unit current, improves current density, improves lifetime. Microlensing of your customers will accept narrower viewing angle, improves brightness and lifetime in the same way. reply glhaynes 14 hours agorootparentprevLots of devices that come with OLED displays come with a \"vibrancy\" mode turned on by default that oversaturates colors until you turn it off. It does look great at a glance tho! reply lloeki 7 hours agorootparentConversely lots of contents is produced on/for less-than-stellar displays and gamma+color-profiles-be-damned overcompensate with more saturated colours at the data level because it's going to show up toned down. When a display is actually able to put out the colours it then looks gaudily oversaturated. I've had such problems already with non-OLED \"somewhat† calibrated\" good quality screens as well. † I mean I did not calibrate them, they were factory calibrated with a good enough test curve slip in the package. reply nicce 13 hours agorootparentprevThere was a time that OLED problems were so huge Lenovo cancelled their usage on laptops for many years (e.g X1 Yoga Series). It was so bad that I got the next generation laptop for free when it was released. reply lloeki 7 hours agorootparentprevOLED has had lower peak brightness than IPS.

YC makes the following argument: Design of customized digital systems [...] has typically been costly because of the amount of custom design, development and testing necessary to bring such a system online. With the advent of large language models, these costs are coming down significantly, such that ever more specialized types of computation could be done. We know there is a clear engineering trade-off: it is possible to optimize especially specialized algorithms or calculations such as cryptocurrency mining, data compression, or special-purpose encryption tasks such that the same computation would happen faster (5x to 100x), and using less energy (10x to 100x). If Gary Tan and YC believe that LLMs will be able to design chips 100x better than humans currently can, they’re significantly underestimating the difficulty of chip design, and the expertise of chip designers. While LLMs are capable of writing functional Verilog sometimes, their performance is still subhuman. More importantly, LLMs aren’t capable of designing novel chip architectures, which is the primary driver of performance improvements for modern accelerator chips. LLMs primarily pump out mediocre Verilog code. The more charitable version of YC’s proposal is that LLM-based tools will significantly reduce the cost of chip design, which will make hardware acceleration more viable for applications where it’s currently cost-prohibitive. Unfortunately, the semiconductor industry already tried something similar. It was called high-level synthesis, and it resoundingly failed. Thanks for reading zach's tech blog! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Subscribe High-level synthesis, all over again. High-level synthesis, or HLS, was born in 1998, when Forte Design Systems was founded. They developed a tool called Cynthesizer, which could automatically translate SystemC to Verilog given certain timing constraints. More generally, HLS tools let engineers write code in a higher-level language like C, C++, or Scala, and automatically convert that code to Verilog, which can in turn be synthesized into logic gates for ASICs and FPGAs. The idea is to make silicon development cheaper and more accessible, especially for teams that don’t have access to deep Verilog expertise. Despite Cynthesizer’s cool name, it never really caught on. Forte was still desperately trying to argue that HLS was the future in 2011. In 2014, they were acquired by Cadence, and Cynthesizer was rolled into Cadence’s new HLS tool, Stratus. Xilinx, now AMD, has been a major proponent of HLS, specifically targeting FPGA acceleration. This makes some sense, as FPGA development is usually done on smaller teams where the additional firepower HLS promises could be super useful. Their Vitis tool is one of the best HLS tools in the industry -- unfortunately, that’s a bit of a low bar. The current state of HLS is best summed up by Lan Huang in the introduction to his survey of the current state-of-the-art in HLS tools: The performance of HLS tools still has limitations. For example, designers remain exposed to various aspects of hardware design, development cycles are still time consuming, and the quality of results (QoR) of HLS tools is far behind that of RTL flows. Other researchers have reported similar disappointing results in their own surveys. Ultimately, while HLS makes designers more productive, it reduces the performance of the designs they make. And if you’re designing high-value chips in a crowded market, like AI accelerators, performance is one of the major metrics you’re expected to compete on. So it makes sense to spend the additional upfront cost to hire talented RTL designers, build chips with better performance, and deliver more successful products. What new kinds of accelerators could LLMs build? So HLS tools failed to gain any traction for high-value, high-volume chips, where performance and efficiency requirements necessitated human engineers writing high-quality Verilog. LLMs, which also produce poor-quality Verilog, will likely face the same challenges But what about other kinds of chips? Could LLMs help there? The few successful applications of HLS enabled engineers without silicon expertise to leverage hardware acceleration. For example, HLS has seen success in FPGA acceleration of genomics workloads and CFD workloads. In both cases, HLS is valuable because the engineers developing the hardware accelerators don’t have the RTL experience to build optimized RTL-level designs from scratch. But this is only the case because the markets for hardware-accelerated genomics and CFD are relatively small. GPUs already serve these use cases somewhat well, and neither use-case would drive even a fraction of the sales volume of AI chips or cryptographic accelerators. If these markets were bigger, it would make economic sense to dedicate talented hardware engineers to build optimized silicon. The idea that YC is proposing falls into the same trap. LLMs can reduce the cost to develop silicon. This might make dedicated ASICs for applications like genomics economically viable, when they previously weren’t. But they weren’t viable for a reason: there isn’t a huge market there. Ultimately trying to leverage LLMs to build hardware accelerators for underserved applications is a loser’s bet.1 If an application doesn’t warrant hardware acceleration yet, it’s probably because it’s a small market, and that makes it a poor target for a startup. So what can LLMs do in chip design? If LLM-based chip design primarily unlocks low-value markets, why are so many startups and established EDA companies trying to leverage LLMs? Well, it turns out that LLMs are also pretty valuable when it comes to chips for lucrative markets -- but they won’t be doing most of the design work. LLM copilots for Verilog are, at best, mediocre. But leveraging an LLM to write small snippets of simple code can still save engineers time, and ultimately save their employers money. More importantly, though, the chip design world is experiencing a massive talent shortage in verification. Normally, you want two verification engineers for every designer, because silicon bugs are incredibly costly. But in the modern era, good verification engineers are hard to come by. If you could leverage LLMs to make verification faster, easier, or more effective, that could be massively valuable to established semiconductor companies and semiconductor startups alike. But actually ensuring that LLMs can actually understand and reason about chip designs specifications is no small task, which is why I’m skeptical of startups like Bronco or Instachip who are naively throwing fine-tuned LLMs at chip verification. First of all, chip specifications are often complex, incomplete, labyrinthine monstrosities -- they were written by people like me, after all. But more importantly, successful verification of a chip requires an LLM to understand the expected internal state of the chip. In essence, the language needs to have some formal model of the chip: think AlphaProof, but for semiconductor verification instead of math. This is one of the things we’re working on at Normal Computing, alongside our novel thermodynamic chip architectures. Ultimately, LLMs will make chip design cheaper. But this will primarily benefit three kinds of companies: large semiconductor companies who can reduce their verification workforce, conventional chip startups who can operate leaner teams, and then the EDA software startups selling LLM-based tools. LLMs won’t build 100x better chips, or enable hardware startups to tackle markets lacking hardware acceleration, because the economics just don’t make sense. Thanks for reading zach's tech blog!

They can't test what is really important, at all. Some development stacks are extremely underpowered for code verification, so they do patch the design issue. Just like some stacks are underpowered for abstraction and need patching by code generation. Both of those solve an immediate problem, in a haphazard and error-prone way, by adding burden on maintenance and code evolution linearly to how much you use it.

Not a single one got it correct - not only did they say the caps were in series (they were not) it even got the series capacitance calculations wrong. I couldn’t believe they whiffed it and had to check myself and sure enough I got the same results as the author and tried all types of prompt magic to get the right answer… no dice. I also saw an ad for an AI tool that’s designed to help you understand schematics. In its pitch to you, it’s showing what looks like a fairly generic guitar distortion pedal circuit and does manage to correctly identify a capacitor as blocking DC but failed to mention it also functions as a component in an RC high-pass filter. I chuckled when the voice over proudly claims “they didn’t even teach me this in 4 years of Electrical Engineering!” (Really? They don’t teach how capacitors block DC and how RC filters work????)

I mean, humans are very good at building businesses and technologies that are resilient to human fallibility. So when we think of applications where LLMs might replace or augment humans, it’s unsurprising that their fallible nature isn’t a showstopper. Sure, EDA tools are deterministic, but the humans who apply them are not. Introducing LLMs to these processes is not some radical and scary departure, it’s an iterative evolution. reply croshan 1 hour agorootparentprevAn interpretation that makes sense to me: humans are non-deterministic black boxes already at the core of complex systems.

Software engineers get hyped when they see the progress in AI coding and immediately begin to extrapolate to other fields—if Copilot can reduce the burden of coding so much, think of all the money we can make selling a similar product to XYZ industries! The problem with this extrapolation is that the software industry is pretty much unique in the amount of information about its inner workings that is publicly available for training on. We've spent the last 20+ years writing millions and millions of lines of code that we published on the internet, not to mention answering questions on Stack Overflow (which still has 3x as many answers as all other Stack Exchanges combined [0]), writing technical blogs, hundreds of thousands of emails in public mailing lists, and so on. Nearly every other industry (with the possible exception of Law) produces publicly-visible output at a tiny fraction of the rate that we do. Ethics of the mass harvesting aside, it's simply not possible for an LLM to have the same skill level in ${insert industry here} as they do with software, so you can't extrapolate from Copilot to other domains. [0] https://stackexchange.com/sites?view=list#answers reply steveBK123 49 minutes agoparentYes this is EXACTLY it, and I was discussing this a bit at work (financial services). In software, we've all self taught, improved, posted Q&A all over the web. Plus all the open source code out there. Just mountains and mountains of free training data. However software is unique in being both well paying and something with freely available, complete information online. A lot of the rest of the world remains far more closed and almost an apprenticeship system. In my domain thinks like company fundamental analysis, algo/quant trading, etc. Lots of books you can buy from the likes of Dalio, but no real (good) step by step research and investment process information online. Likewise I'd imagine heavily patented/regulated/IP industries like chip design, drug design, etc are substantially as closed. Maybe companies using an LLM on their own data internally could make something of their data, but its also quite likely there is no 'data' so much as tacit knowledge handed down over time. reply mountainriver 1 hour agoparentprevYep, this is also the reason LLMs can probably work well for a lot more things if we did have the data reply unoti 1 hour agoparentprev>The problem with this extrapolation is that the software industry is pretty much unique in the amount of information about its inner workings that is publicly available for training on... millions of lines of code that we published on the internet... > Nearly every other industry (with the possible exception of Law) produces publicly-visible output at a tiny fraction of the rate that we do. You are correct! There's lots of information available publicly about certain things like code, and writing SQL queries. But other specialized domains don't have the same kind of information trained into the heart of the model. But importantly, this doesn't mean the LLM can't provide significant value in these other more niche domains. They still can, and I provide this every day in my day job. But it's a lot of work. We (as AI engineers) have to deeply understand the special domain knowledge. The basic process is this: 1. Learn how the subject matter experts do the work. 2. Teach the LLM to do this, using examples, giving it procedures, walking it through the various steps and giving it the guidance and time and space to think. (Multiple prompts, recipes if you will, loops, external memory...) 3. Evaluation, iteration, improvement 4. Scale up to production In many domains I work in, it can be very challenging to get past step 1. If I don't know how to do it effectively, I can't guide the LLM through the steps. Consider an example question like \"what are the top 5 ways to improve my business\" -- the subject matter experts often have difficulty teaching me how to do that. If they don't know how to do it, they can't teach it to me, and I can't teach it to the agent. Another example that will resonate with nerds here is being an effective Dungeons and Dragons DM. But if I actually learn how to do it, and boil it down into repeatable steps, and use GraphRAG, then it becomes another thing entirely. I know this is possible, and expect to see great things in that space, but I estimate it'll take another year or so of development to get it done. But in many domains, I get access to subject matter experts that can tell me pretty specifically how to succeed in an area. These are the top 5 situations you will see, how you can identify which situation type it is, and what you should do when you see that you are in that kind of situation. In domains like this I can in fact make the agent do awesome work and provide value, even when the information is not in the publicly available training data for the LLM. There's this thing about knowing a domain area well enough to do the job, but not having enough mastery to teach others how to do the job. You need domain experts that understand the job well enough to teach you how to do it, and you as the AI engineer need enough mastery over the agent to teach it how to do the job as well. Then the magic happens. When we get AGI we can proceed past this limitation of needing to know how to do the job ourselves. Until we get AGI, then this is how we provide impact using agents. This is why I say that even if LLM technology does not improve any more beyond where it was a year ago, we still have many years worth of untapped potential for AI. It just takes a lot of work, and most engineers today don't understand how to do that work-- principally because they're too busy saying today's technology can't do that work rather than trying to learn how to do it. reply 0xmarcin 2 hours agoprevThis is not my domain so my knowledge is limited, but I wonder if the chip designers have some sort of a standard library of ready to use components. Do you have to design e.g. ALU every time you design a new CPU or is there some standard component to use? I think having a proven components that can be glued on a higher level may be the key to productivity here. Returning to LLMs. I think the problem here may be that there is simply not enough learning material for LLM. Verilog comparing to C is a niche with little documentation and even less open source code. If open hw were more popular I think LLMs could learn to write better Verilog code. Maybe the key is to persuade hardware companies to share their closed source code to teach LLM for the industry benefit? reply AlotOfReading 2 hours agoparentThere are component libraries, though they're usually much lower level than an ALU. For example Synopsys Designware: https://www.synopsys.com/dw/buildingblock.php reply MobiusHorizons 1 hour agoparentprevThe most common thing you see shared is something called IP which does mean intellectual property, but in this context you can think of it like buying ICs that you integrate into your design (ie you wire them up). You can also get Verilog, but that is usually used for verification instead of taping out the peripheral. This is because the company you buy the IP from will tape out the design for a specific node in order to guarantee the specifications. Examples of this would be everything from arm cores to uart and spi controllers as well as pretty much anything you could buy as a standalone IC. reply Filligree 2 hours agoparentprevOr learning through self-play. Chip design sounds like an area where (this would be hard!) a sufficiently powerful simulator and/or FPGA could allow reinforcement learning to work. Current LLMs can’t do it, but the assumption that that’s what YC meant seems wildly premature. reply qwertox 35 minutes agoprev> If Gary Tan and YC believe that LLMs will be able to design chips 100x better than humans currently can, they’re significantly underestimating the difficulty of chip design, and the expertise of chip designers. While LLMs are capable of writing functional Verilog sometimes, their performance is still subhuman. [...] LLMs primarily pump out mediocre Verilog code. What is the quality of Verilog code output by humans? Is it good enough so that a complex AI chip can be created? Or does the human need to use tools in order to generate this code? I've got the feeling that LLMs will be capable of doing everything a human can do, in terms of thinking. There shouldn't be an expectation that an LLM is able to do everything, which in this context would be thinking about the chip and creating the final files in a single pass and without external help. And with external help I don't mean us humans, but tools which are specialized and also generate some additional data (like embeddings) which the LLM (or another LLM) can use in the next pass to evaluate the design. And if we humans have spent enough time in creating these additional tools, there will come a time when LLMs will also be able to create improved versions of them. I mean, when I once randomly checked the content of a file in The Pile, I found an Craigslist \"ad\" for an escort offering her services. No chip-generating AI does need to have this in its parameters in order to do its job. So there is a lot of room for improvement and this improvement will come over time. Such an LLM doesn't need to know that much about humans. reply SoftTalker 59 minutes agoprevIf cryptocurrency mining could be significantly optimized (one of the example goals in the article) wouldn't that just destroy the value of said currency? reply Mistletoe 50 minutes agoparentNo they all have escalating difficulty algorithms. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty reply Neywiny 2 hours agoprevI think this whole article is predicated on misinterpreting the ask. It wasn't for the chip to take 100x less power, it was for the algorithm the chip implements. Modern synthesis tools and optimisers extensively look for design patterns the same way software compilers do. That's why there's recommended inference patterns. I think it's not impossible to expect an LLM to expand the capture range of these patterns to maybe suboptimal HDL. As a simple example, maybe a designer got really turned around and is doing some crazy math, and the LLM can go \"uh, that's just addition my guy, I'll fix that for you.\" reply eight_ender 59 minutes agoparentWas surprised this comment was this far down. I re-read the YC ask three times to make sure I wasn’t crazy. Dude wrote the whole article based on a misunderstanding. reply paulsutter 1 hour agoprevGenerative models are bimodal - in certain tasks they are crazy terrible , and in certain tasks they are better than humans. The key is to recognize which is which. And much more important: - LLMs can suddenly become more competent when you give them the right tools, just like humans. Ever try to drive a nail without a hammer? - Models with spatial and physical awareness are coming and will dramatically broaden what’s possible It’s easy to get stuck on what LLMs are bad at. The art is to apply an LLMs strengths to your specific problem, often by augmenting the LLM with the right custom tools written in regular code reply stefanpie 59 minutes agoprevThis heavily overlaps with my current research focus for my Ph.D., so I wanted to provide some additional perspective to the article. I have worked with Vitis HLS and other HLS tools in the past to build deep learning hardware accelerators. Currently, I am exploring deep learning for design automation and using large language models (LLMs) for hardware design, including leveraging LLMs to write HLS code. I can also offer some insight from the academic perspective. First, I agree that the bar for HLS tools is relatively low, and they are not as good as they could be. Admittedly, there has been significant progress in the academic community to develop open-source HLS tools and integrations with existing tools like Vitis HLS to improve the HLS development workflow. Unfortunately, substantial changes are largely in the hands of companies like Xilinx, Intel, Siemens, Microchip, MathWorks (yes, even Matlab has an HLS tool), and others that produce the \"big-name\" HLS tools. That said, academia has not given up, and there is considerable ongoing HLS tooling research with collaborations between academia and industry. I hope that one day, some lab will say \"enough is enough\" and create a open-source, modular HLS compiler in Rust that is easy to extend and contribute to—but that is my personal pipe dream. However, projects like BambuHLS, Dynamatic, MLIR+CIRCT, and XLS (if Google would release more of their hardware design research and tooling) give me some hope. When it comes to actually using HLS to build hardware designs, I usually suggest it as a first-pass solution to quickly prototype designs for accelerating domain-specific applications. It provides a prototype that is often much faster or more power-efficient than a CPU or GPU solution, which you can implement on an FPGA as proof that a new architectural change has an advantage in a given domain (genomics, high-energy physics, etc.). In this context, it is a great tool for academic researchers. I agree that companies producing cutting-edge chips are probably not using HLS for the majority of their designs. Still, HLS has its niche in FPGA and ASIC design (with Siemens's Catapult being a popular option for ASIC flows). However, the gap between an initial, naive HLS design implementation and one refined by someone with expert HLS knowledge is enormous. This gap is why many of us in academia view the claim that \"HLS allows software developers to do hardware development\" as somewhat moot (albeit still debatable—there is ongoing work on new DSLs and abstractions for HLS tooling which are quite slick and promising). Because of this gap, unless you have team members or grad students familiar with optimizing and rewriting designs to fully exploit HLS benefits while avoiding the tools' quirks and bugs, you won't see substantial performance gains. Al that to say, I don't think it is fair to comply write off HLS as a lost cause or not sucesfull. Regarding LLMs for Verilog generation and verification, there's an important point missing from the article that I've been considering since around 2020 when the LLM-for-chip-design trend began. A significant divide exists between the capabilities of commercial companies and academia/individuals in leveraging LLMs for hardware design. For example, Nvidia released ChipNeMo, an LLM trained on their internal data, including HDL, tool scripts, and issue/project/QA tracking. This gives Nvidia a considerable advantage over smaller models trained in academia, which have much more limited data in terms of quantity, quality, and diversity. It's frustrating to see companies like Nvidia presenting their LLM research at academic conferences without contributing back meaningful technology or data to the community. While I understand they can't share customer data and must protect their business interests, these closed research efforts and closed collaborations they have with academic groups hinder broader progress and open research. This trend isn't unique to Nvidia; other companies follow similar practices. On a more optimistic note, there are now strong efforts within the academic community to tackle these problems independently. These efforts include creating high-quality, diverse hardware design datasets for various LLM tasks and training models to perform better on a wider range of HLS-related tasks. As mentioned in the article, there is also exciting work connecting LLMs with the tools themselves, such as using tool feedback to correct design errors and moving towards even more complex and innovative workflows. These include in-the-loop verification, hierarchical generation, and ML-based performance estimation to enable rapid iteration on designs and debugging with a human in the loop. This is one area I'm actively working on, both at the HDL and HLS levels, so I admit my bias toward this direction. For more references on the latest research in this area, check out the proceedings from the LLM-Aided Design Workshop (now evolving into a conference, ICLAD: https://iclad.ai/), as well as the MLCAD conference (https://mlcad.org/symposium/2024/). Established EDA conferences like DAC and ICCAD have also included sessions and tracks on these topics in recent years. All of this falls within the broader scope of generative AI, which remains a smaller subset of the larger ML4EDA and deep learning for chip design community. However, LLM-aided design research is beginning to break out into its own distinct field, covering a wider range of topics such as LLM-aided design for manufacturing, quantum computing, and biology—areas that the ICLAD conference aims to expand on in future years. reply westurner 1 hour agoprevIDK about LLMs there either.

I think that LLMs are plateauing, but I'm less confident that this necessarily means the capabilities we're using LLMs for right now will also plateau. That is to say it's distinctly possible that all the talent and money sloshing around right now will line up a new breakthrough architecture in time to keep capabilities marching forward at a good pace.

For $work, we can have say 100k video sequences to train a model, they can then be fine tuned on say 2k real videos. That gets it to be slightly under the same quality as if it was train on pure real video. So I'm not that hopeful that synthetic data will provide a breakthrough.

Arash Massoudi, James Fontanella-Khan, Stephen Morris, and Stefania Palma, Financial Times – Nov 15, 2024 2:44 PM60 A Microsoft office (not to be confused with Microsoft Office). Credit: Julien GONG Min / Flickr A Microsoft office (not to be confused with Microsoft Office). Credit: Julien GONG Min / Flickr Text settings The Federal Trade Commission is preparing to launch an investigation into anti-competitive practices at Microsoft’s cloud computing business, as the US regulator continues to pursue Big Tech in the final weeks of Joe Biden’s presidency. The FTC is examining allegations that Microsoft is abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to competitors’ platforms, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. Tactics being examined include substantially increasing subscription fees for those that leave, charging steep exit fees, and allegedly making its Office 365 products incompatible with rival clouds, they added. The FTC is yet to formally request documents or other information from Microsoft as part of the inquiry, the people said. A move to challenge Microsoft’s cloud business practices would mark the latest broadside against Big Tech by the FTC’s chair, Lina Khan, who has centered her tenure on aggressively curbing the monopolistic powers of the likes of Meta and Amazon. Khan, who has become the public enemy for most of Wall Street’s dealmaking community, is set to be replaced after president-elect Donald Trump enters the White House next year. While any successor to Khan may not adopt as tough a stance, potential contenders are expected to continue targeting Big Tech companies that have attracted bipartisan ire in Washington. The Republican Party has accused online platforms of allegedly censoring conservative voices. The decision to launch a formal probe would come after the FTC sought feedback from industry participants and the public on cloud computing providers’ business practices. The results in November last year revealed that most responses raised concerns around competition, the agency said at the time, including software licensing practices that curb the ability to use some software in other cloud providers’ ecosystems. The FTC also highlighted fees charged on users transferring data out of certain cloud systems and minimum spend contracts, which offer discounts to companies in return for a set level of spending. Microsoft has also attracted scrutiny from international regulators over similar matters. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority is investigating Microsoft and Amazon after its fellow watchdog Ofcom found that customers complained about being “locked in” to a single provider, which offers discounts for exclusivity and charge high “egress fees” to leave. In the EU, Microsoft has avoided a formal probe into its cloud business after agreeing to a multimillion-dollar deal with a group of rival cloud providers in July. The FTC in 2022 sued to block Microsoft’s $75 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard over concerns the deal would harm competitors to its Xbox consoles and cloud-gaming business. A federal court shot down an attempt by the FTC to block it, which is being appealed. A revised version of the deal in the meantime closed last year following its clearance by the UK’s CMA. Since its inception 20 years ago, cloud infrastructure and services has grown to become one of the most lucrative business lines for Big Tech as companies outsource their data storage and computing online. More recently, this has been turbocharged by demand for processing power to train and run artificial intelligence models. Spending on cloud services soared to $561 billion in 2023 with market researcher Gartner forecasting it will grow to $675 billion this year and $825 billion in 2025. Microsoft has about a 20 percent market share over the global cloud market, trailing leader Amazon Web Services that has 31 percent, but almost double the size of Google Cloud at 12 percent. There is fierce rivalry between the trio and smaller providers. Last month, Microsoft accused Google of running “shadow campaigns” seeking to undermine its position with regulators by secretly bankrolling hostile lobbying groups. Microsoft also alleged that Google tried to derail its settlement with EU cloud providers by offering them $500 million in cash and credit to reject its deal and continue pursuing litigation.

A decade ago Marc Andressen was lobbying Obama to work on this [0][1] In Andressen's and much of his peer's eyes, most mid-late stage startups should be IPOing sooner than they actually are. And to a certain extent he isn't wrong. Personally, I don't buy Andressen's argument - there is a reason we added added checks and balances in the IPO process. > Could you explain this To go public (just like any other fundraising stage), early stage ownership stakes tend to be diluted in order to attract later investors. IPOs are a fundraising technique like any other, but the benefits tends to bias towards funds that target late stage or roadshow investors at the expense of early investors. In the eyes of Andressen and his peers the IPO process needs to be simplified in order to make it easier for mid-stage startups to go public AND the incentive structures need to be changed so early stage investors (read VCs like A16Z) get outsized benefit. For most funds, this really doesn't matter, but for the mega funds like A16Z, YC, Founders Fund, etc this is a make-or-break policy as most of their portfolio are mid-late stage startups that have been pushing off IPOs because they are too small for the current market, and taking acquisitions at what a number of early stage investors view as a suboptimal price - doesn't matter to the founder because they have cash, but it does to large early stage investors. A direct listing or SPAC would be the ideal \"IPO\" method envisioned, but that has been cracked down on as well (and rightfully so tbh) [0] - https://www.cnbc.com/2013/07/11/andreessen-talks-tech-boom-b...

If you're going to use channels of communication that will be shut down after only a few uses that are contrary to the recipients' interests, they should be saved for issues of real rather than symbolic substance. It does matter whether or not corporations let people easily delete their profiles and accounts, but that won't be solved by a small number of savvy people getting exceptions without actually convincing anyone that the greater principle is important. It will be solved either through regulations, or through convincing the vast majority of users that failing to fulfill this duty irrevocably damages that company's reputation. Regulators this year are just barely on the side of protecting consumers, and next year they will likely begin dismantling many of these requirements. When it comes to actual consumers, I bet barely 10% of people think it is important, and if they do they are convinced it is an inevitability, rather than the type of product defect that justifies them not using a service or product.

Kevin Purdy – Nov 15, 2024 12:05 PM113 Hark! The top portion of a garage door has entered my view, and I shall alert my owner to it. Credit: Kevin Purdy Hark! The top portion of a garage door has entered my view, and I shall alert my owner to it. Credit: Kevin Purdy Text settings Like Ars Senior Technology Editor Lee Hutchinson, I have a garage. The door on that garage is opened and closed by a device made by a company that, as with Lee's, offers you a way to open and close it with a smartphone app. But that app doesn't work with my preferred home automation system, Home Assistant, and also looks and works like an app made by a garage door company. I had looked into the ratgdo Lee installed, and raved about, but hooking it up to my particular Genie/Aladdin system would have required installing limit switches. So I instead installed an OpenGarage unit ($50 plus shipping). My garage opener now works with Home Assistant (and thereby pretty much anything else), it's not subject to the whims of API access, and I've got a few ideas how to make it even better. Allow me to walk you through what I did, why I did it, and what I might do next. Thanks, I’ll take it from here, Genie Genie, maker of my Wi-Fi-capable garage door opener (sold as an \"Aladdin Connect\" system), is not in the same boat as the Chamberlain/myQ setup that inspired Lee's project. There was a working Aladdin Connect integration in Home Assistant, until the company changed its API in January 2024. Genie said it would release its own official Home Assistant integration in June, and it did, but then it was quickly pulled back, seemingly for licensing issues. Since then, no updates on the matter. (I have emailed Genie for comment and will update this post if I receive reply.) This is not egregious behavior, at least on the scale of garage door opener firms. And Aladdin's app works with Google Home and Amazon Alexa, but not with Home Assistant or my secondary/lazy option, HomeKit/Apple Home. It also logs me out \"for security\" more often than I'd like and tells me this only after an iPhone shortcut refuses to fire. It has some decent features, but without deeper integrations, I can't do things like have the brighter ceiling lights turn on when the door opens or flash indoor lights if the garage door stays open too long. At least not without Google or Amazon. I've seen OpenGarage passed around the Home Assistant forums and subreddits over the years. It is, as the name implies, fully open source: hardware design, firmware, and app code, API, everything. It is a tiny ESP board that has an ultrasonic distance sensor and circuit relay attached. You can control and monitor it from a web browser, mobile or desktop, from IFTTT, MQTT, and with the latest firmware, you can get email alerts. I decided to pull out the 6-foot ladder and give it a go. Prototypes of the OpenGarage unit. To me, they look like little USB-powered owls, just with very stubby wings. Credit: OpenGarage Installing the little watching owl You generally mount the OpenGarage unit to the roof of your garage, so the distance sensor can detect if your garage door has rolled up in front of it. There are options for mounting with magnetic contact sensors or a side view of a roll-up door, or you can figure out some other way in which two different sensor depth distances would indicate an open or closed door. If you've got a Security+ 2.0 door (the kind with the yellow antenna, generally), you'll need an adapter, too. The toughest part of an overhead install is finding a spot that gives the unit a view of your garage door, not too close to rails or other obstructing objects, but then close enough for the contact wires and USB micro cable to reach. Ideally, too, it has a view of your car when the door is closed and the car is inside, so it can report its presence. I've yet to find the right thing to do with the \"car is inside or not\" data, but the seed is planted. OpenGarage's introduction and explanation video. My garage setup, like most of them, is pretty simple. There's a big red glowing button on the wall near the door, and there are two very thin wires running from it to the opener. On the opener, there are four ports that you can open up with a screwdriver press. Most of the wires are headed to the safety sensor at the door bottom, while two come in from the opener button. After stripping a bit of wire to expose more cable, I pressed the contact wires from the OpenGarage into those same opener ports. The wire terminal on my Genie garage opener. The green and pink wires lead to the OpenGarage unit. Credit: Kevin Purdy After that, I connected the wires to the OpenGarage unit's screw terminals, then did some pencil work on the garage ceiling to figure out how far I could run the contact and micro-USB power cable, getting the proper door view while maintaining some right-angle sense of order up there. When I had reached a decent compromise between cable tension and placement, I screwed the sensor into an overhead stud and used a staple gun to secure the wires. It doesn't look like a pro installed it, but it's not half bad. Where I ended up installing my OpenGarage unit. Key points: Above the garage door when open, view of the car below, not too close to rails, able to reach power and opener contact. Credit: Kevin Purdy A very versatile board If you've got everything placed and wired up correctly, opening the OpenGarage access point or IP address should give you an interface that shows you the status of your garage, your car (optional), and its Wi-Fi and external connections. The landing screen for the OpenGarage. You can only open the door or change settings if you know the device key (which you should change immediately). Credit: Kevin Purdy It's a handy webpage and a basic opener (provided you know the secret device key you set), but OpenGarage is more powerful in how it uses that data. OpenGarage's device can keep a cloud connection open to Blynk or the maker's own OpenThings.io cloud server. You can hook it up to MQTT or an IFTTT channel. It can send you alerts when your garage has been open a certain amount of time or if it's open after a certain time of day. You're telling me you can just... see the state of these things, at all times, on your own network? Credit: Kevin Purdy You really don’t need a corporate garage coder For me, the greatest benefit is in hooking OpenGarage up to Home Assistant. I've added an opener button to my standard dashboard (one that requires a long-press or two actions to open). I've restored the automation that turns on the overhead bulbs for five minutes when the garage door opens. And I can dig in if I want, like alerting me that it's Monday night at 10 pm and I've yet to open the garage door, indicating I forgot to put the trash out. Or maybe some kind of NFC tag to allow for easy opening while on a bike, if that's not a security nightmare (it might be). Not for nothing, but OpenGarage is also a deeply likable bit of indie kit. It's a two-person operation, with Ray Wang building on his work with the open and handy OpenSprinkler project, trading Arduino for ESP8266, and doing some 3D printing to fit the sensors and switches, and Samer Albahra providing mobile app, documentation, and other help. Their enthusiasm for DIY home control has likely brought out the same in others and certainly in me.

They shut down their integration with his Alexa and other automations later which was amusing, but it kind of just showed off the fact that, yeah, you pretty much push the button in your car or the button inside your garage or on the keypad outside your garage and that’s pretty much all you ever do with a garage door so this smart home stuff doesn’t really add much. reply JoBrad 16 hours agoparentI have an automation that locks my front door, closes the garage door if it’s open, and arms my home alarm.

Otherwise, I've been really happy with the iSmartGate I put in years ago. The wiring isn't difficult, and the HomeKit integration is essential for me. Similar \"that's useful!\" experience as everyone else in the thread, but an annoyance sometimes is that \"closing\" is free, but opening requires \"FaceID\", which makes a ton of sense but means I never use it outside of automations since it requires fishing out the phone and a free hand (and that's just easier to mash the button on the wall). I have automations to automatically close the door at 10:20am, 5:30pm, and \"sunset\" which catches like 90% of the \"accidentally left open\" use cases.

    "originLink": "https://labs.quansight.org/blog/dataframe-group-by",
    "originBody": "Back to blog The Polars vs pandas difference nobody is talking about Published November 11, 2024 MarcoGorelli Marco Gorelli The Polars vs pandas difference nobody is talking about I attended PyData Berlin 2024 in April, and it was a blast! I met so many colleagues, collaborators, and friends. There was quite some talk of Polars - some people even gathered together for a Polars-themed dinner! It's certainly nice to see people talking about it, and the focus tends to be on features such as: lazy execution Rust consistent handling of null values multithreading query optimisation Yet there's one innovation which barely ever gets a mention: non-elementary group-by aggregations. I'll start by introducing the group-by operation. We'll then take a look at elementary aggregations with both the pandas and Polars APIs. Finally, we'll look at non-elementary aggregations, and see how the Polars API enables so much more than the pandas one. What's a group-by? Suppose we start with a (Polars) dataframe such as: shape: (6, 3) ┌─────┬───────┬───────┐ │ id ┆ sales ┆ views │ │ --- ┆ --- ┆ --- │ │ i64 ┆ i64 ┆ i64 │ ╞═════╪═══════╪═══════╡ │ 1 ┆ 4 ┆ 3 │ │ 1 ┆ 1 ┆ 1 │ │ 1 ┆ 2 ┆ 2 │ │ 2 ┆ 7 ┆ 8 │ │ 2 ┆ 6 ┆ 6 │ │ 2 ┆ 7 ┆ 7 │ └─────┴───────┴───────┘ A group-by operation produces a single row per group: df.group_by('id').agg('sales') shape: (2, 2) ┌─────┬───────────┐ │ id ┆ sales │ │ --- ┆ --- │ │ i64 ┆ list[i64] │ ╞═════╪═══════════╡ │ 1 ┆ [4, 1, 2] │ │ 2 ┆ [7, 6, 7] │ └─────┴───────────┘ If we want a single scalar value per group, we can use a reduction ('mean', 'sum', 'std', ...): df.group_by('id').agg(pl.sum('sales')) shape: (2, 2) ┌─────┬───────┐ │ id ┆ sales │ │ --- ┆ --- │ │ i64 ┆ i64 │ ╞═════╪═══════╡ │ 1 ┆ 7 │ │ 2 ┆ 20 │ └─────┴───────┘ Group-by in pandas If you're coming from a pandas-like library, you may have been used to writing the above example as df.groupby('id')['sales'].sum() And indeed, for such a simple task as this one, the pandas API is quite nice. All we had to do was: select which columns we're grouping by select the column(s) we want to aggregate specify an elementary aggregation function Let's try something else: \"find the maximum value of 'views', where 'sales' is greater than its mean, per 'id'\". Unfortunately, the pandas API has no way to express this, meaning that no library which copies the pandas API can truly optimise such an operation in the general case. You might be wondering whether we can just do the following: df.groupby('id').apply( lambda df: df[df['sales'] > df['sales'].mean()]['views'].max() ) However, that uses a Python lambda function and so is generally going to be inefficient. Another solution one might come up with is this one: df[df['sales'] > df.groupby('id')['sales'].transform('mean')].groupby('id')['views'].max() It's not as bad as the apply solution above, but it still looks overly complicated and requires two group-bys. There's actually a third solution, which: relies on GroupBy caching its groups performs in-place mutation of the original dataframe uses the fact that 'max' skips over missing values Realistically, few users would come up with it (most would jump straight to apply), but for completeness, we present it: gb = df.groupby(\"id\") mask = df[\"sales\"] > gb[\"sales\"].transform(\"mean\") df[\"result\"] = df[\"views\"].where(mask) gb[\"result\"].max() Surely it's possible to do better? Non-elementary group-bys in Polars The Polars API lets us pass expressions to GroupBy.agg. So long as you can express your aggregation as an expression, you can use it in a group-by setting. In this case, we can express \"the maximum value of 'views' where 'sales' is greater than its mean\" as pl.col('views').filter(pl.col('sales') > pl.mean('sales')).max() Then, all we need to do is pass this expression to GroupBy.agg: df.group_by('id').agg( pl.col('views').filter(pl.col('sales') > pl.mean('sales')).max() ) Wonderful! Like this, we can express the operation cleanly and without hacks, meaning that any dataframe implementation which follows the Polars API has the possibility to evaluate this efficiently. Conclusion, and a plea to future dataframe authors We've learned about the group-by operation, elementary aggregations in both pandas and Polars, and how Polars' syntax enables users to cleanly express non-elementary aggregations. pandas is a wonderful tool which solves a lot of real problems for a lot of real people. However, when new dataframe libraries insist on copying its API, they are stunting their own potential. If an API doesn't allow for an operation to be expressed and users end up using apply with custom Python lambda functions, then no amount of acceleration is going to make up for that. On the other hand, innovation on the API side can enable new possibilities. There's a reason that I came for the speed, but stayed for the syntax is a common refrain among Polars users. If you'd like to learn about how to use Polars effectively, or how to solve problems in your organisation using Polars, Quansight is here to help - please get in touch - we'd love to hear from you.",

After spark, pandas just seemed frustrating and incomprehensible. Polars is much more like spark and I am very happy about that. DuckDb even goes so far as to include a clone of the pyspark dataframe API, so somebody there must like it too. reply banku_brougham 18 hours agoparentI had a similar experience with spark, especially in the Scala API it felt very expressive and concise once I got used to certain idioms. Also +1 on duckdb which is excellent. There are some frustrations in spark however, I remember getting stuck on Winsorizing over groups. Hilariously there are identical functions called `percentile_approx` and `approx_percentile` and it wasn't clear from the docs they were the same or at least did the same thing. Given all that, the ergonomics of Julia for general purpose data handling is really unmatched IMO. I've got a lot of clean and readable data pipeline and shaping code that I revisited a couple years later and could easily understand. And making updates with new more type-generic functions is a breeze. Very enjoyable. reply appplication 17 hours agorootparentSpark docs are way too minimal for my taste, at least the API docs. reply banku_brougham 15 hours agorootparentyeah i couldnt get it done in spark api had to combine spark and spark sql bc the window function i needed was (probably) not available in spark. it was inelegant i thought. reply fifilura 13 hours agoparentprevI have not worked with Spark, but I have used Athena/Trino and BigQuery extensively. For me I don't really understand the hype around Polars, other than that it fixes some annoying issues with the Pandas API by sacrificing backwards compatibility. With a single node engine you have a ceiling how good it can get. With Spark/Athena/BigQuery the sky is the limit. It is such a freedom to not be limited by available RAM or CPU. They just scale to what they need. Some queryies squeeze in CPU-days in just a few minutes. reply simicd 10 hours agorootparentI'm using both Spark and polars, to me the appeal of polars is additionally it is also much faster and easier to set up. Spark is great if you have large datasets since you can easily scale as you said. But if the dataset is small-ish (With a single node engine you have a ceiling how good it can get.

Not always, but sometimes. However I imagine that many people love polars/pandas performance for transactional queries (from start to finish get me a result in less than a second (as long as the number of underlying rows is not greater than 20k-ish).

And I say this as someone who makes much of their living from Pandas. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 19 hours agoparentI think pandas is well aware of some of the unfortunate legacy API decisions without Polars. They are trapped by backwards compatibility. Wes’ “Things I Hate About Pandas” post covers the highlights. Most of which boils down to having not put a layer between numpy and pandas. Which is why they were stuck with the unfortunate integer null situation. reply Twirrim 18 hours agorootparentWhich is all stuff they could fix, if they'd be willing to, with a major version bump. They'd need a killer feature to encourage that migration though. reply code_biologist 18 hours agorootparentThe really brutal thing is all of the code using Pandas written by researchers and non-software engineers running quietly in lab environments. Difficult to reproduce environments, small or non-existent test suites, code written by grad students long gone. If the Pandas interface breaks for installs done via `pip install pandas` it will cause a lot of pain. With that acknowledged, it'll make life a lot easier on everyone if the \"fix the API\" Pandas 3 had a different package name. Polars and others seem like exactly that solution, even if not literally Pandas. reply __mharrison__ 15 hours agorootparentprevYes, but the interesting thing is that pandas developers are moving towards adopting polars-like advances now. Which wasn't the case previously. reply akdor1154 19 hours agoprevThe difference is a sanely and presciently designed expression API, which is a bit more verbose in some common cases, but is more predictable and much more expressive in more complex situations like this. On a tangent, i wonder what this op would look like in SQL? Probably would need support for filtering in a window function, which I'm not sure is standardized? reply wenc 18 hours agoparentProps to Ritchie Vink for designing polars. But also props to Wes McKinney for giving us a dataframe library during a time when we had none. Java still doesn’t have a decent dataframe library so we mustn’t take these things for granted. The Pandas API is no longer the way things should be done today nor should it be in new tutorials. Pandas was the jquery of its time —- great but no longer the state of the art. But I have much gratitude for it being around when it was needed. reply nerdponx 13 hours agorootparentI think it's worth giving some credit to prior art here. Polars was heavily inspired by the \"Spark SQL\" API, and Pandas by R data frames. I disagree that Pandas is no longer state of the art: its interface is optimized for a different use case compared to Polars. reply disgruntledphd2 11 hours agorootparentI think a lot of the weirdness in pandas comes from firstly the original focus on time series, and secondly the attempt to make logical indexing work like it did in R.

In the old style: df |> group_by(id) |> filter(sales > mean(sales)) |> summarize(max(views)) In the new style, either: df |> filter(.by=id, sales>mean(sales)) |> summarize(.by=id,max(views)) Or: df |> summarize(.by=id, max(views[sales>mean(sales)])) reply countrymile 8 hours agorootparentI understand that is the new style, but I'm not aware of the rationale of the switch to this method.

There’s this from the author of dplyr: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30067406 And here in the docs: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/dplyr_by.html And maybe also: https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/02/dplyr-1-1-0-per-opera... I guess part of it is that there’s some ‘non-locality’ in the pipeline where the grouping could be relatively distant from the operation acting on the grouped data. Similarly, you get to worry about eg grouping data that is already grouped. I quite like the prql solution which is to have a ‘structured grouping’ where you have to delimit the pipeline that operates on grouped data, but maybe it can still lead to bad edits for complex queries. reply andy81 19 hours agoparentprevHere's an example implementation in MSSQL - https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/edit/1873...

My book, Effective Polars, has a whole chapter devoted to the question of whether porting from pandas makes sense. reply wenc 18 hours agoparentprevI converted to DuckDB and Polars. It’s worth it for the speed improvement. However there are subtle differences between Pandas and Polars behaviors so regression testing is your friend. It’s not 1:1 mapping. reply kzrdude 18 hours agorootparentThere's been so many subtle changes in pandas to pandas upgrades (especially groupby is somehow always hit), so regression tests are always needed... reply willseth 18 hours agorootparentprevWhich things did you decide to move to duckdb? reply wenc 17 hours agorootparentA lot of aggregation, pivot and join logic, like: df = duckdb.query(\"from tbl1 join tbl2 using (id) where id is not null \").pl() The .pl() is a Arrow-based conversation from DuckDB to Polars. It's in-memory and I believe zero-copy, so it happens almost instantaneously. I go back and forth between DuckDB and Polars functions in the same scope because it's so cheap to convert between the two. reply __mharrison__ 15 hours agorootparentI'm genuinely curious, if you are already using (and assuming that you like) dataframe APIs, why you would use SQL? reply wenc 14 hours agorootparentIt's the opposite; I prefer DuckDB and generally work with DuckDB's friendly SQL interface. SQL is declarative and is (for me) more intuitive than method-chaining -- especially for complex analytic operations that happen in one go. (software people might beg to differ about the intuitive bit because they are more used to an imperative style, and to my surprise, even the best software engineers struggle with SQL because it requires one to think in set and relation operations rather than function calls, which many software folks are not used to) I actually don't use the Polars dataframe APIs much except for some operations which are easier to do in dataframe form, like applying a Python function as UDF, or transposing (not pivoting) a dataframe. Also Polars is good for materializing the query into a dataframe rapidly, which can then be passed into methods/functions. It's also a lot easier to unit test dataframes than SQL tables. There's a lot more tooling for that. reply salomonk_mur 12 hours agoparentprevThis is a prime use case for LLMs reply sk11001 9 hours agorootparentIt’s a very bad use case for an LLM because they don’t have as much polars code in their training data and the polars API has changed a lot in the past couple of years. Copilot is still suggesting out of date polars code to me. ChatGPT and Claude regularly suggest operations that are valid in pandas and not in polars. reply sweezyjeezy 8 hours agorootparentCan confirm this, LLMs write almost exclusively in broken polars.

I work on a team that has a lot of data scientists and a few engineers (including myself) and I often see the data scientists using dataframes when simple python classes would be much more appropriate so that you have a better sense of the object you're working with. I'm been having a hard time getting this idea across to people though. reply sanderjd 16 hours agoparentFrankly, the heuristic I've developed over the past few years working on a team that sounds like yours is: The data scientists are probably right. If you're actually operating on an object, ie. the equivalent to a single row in a dataframe, then yeah, it's silly to use a dataframe library. But if you're operating on N value objects ... yeah you probably want a dataframe with N rows and a column for each field in your object. Your mileage may vary I guess, but I resisted this for quite awhile and I now think I was the one who was wrong. reply RadiozRadioz 13 hours agoparentprevPerformance is my heuristic. I can't make it quantitative, because 100M records in 1 minute might be considered fast for some use cases, but slow for others. For me it's the qualitative \"is this thing too slow?\". Personally, I see a dataframe library as a last resort. I prefer to improve the algorithm, or push more things into the database, or even scale up the hardware in some cases. If I've exhausted all other options and it's still too slow, then I use a dataframe library. But then I'm not a data scientist. I've found that data scientists have a hammer that they really really like, so they'll use it everywhere. reply internet101010 16 hours agoparentprevDataFrames are easy to use, everyone knows how to use them, you can move fast, and it's easy to iterate and test differences between things, and reviewing the code is a breeze. That said, my team moved to polars about a year ago and we haven't looked back. reply RadiozRadioz 13 hours agorootparent> reviewing the code is a breeze I have the opposite opinion. In a previous codebase I fought hard to use dataclasses & type hinting where possible over dictionaries, because with dictionaries you'd never know what type anything was, or what keys were present. That worked nicely and it was much easier to understand the codebase. Now I've been put on a Pandas project and it's full of mysterious df = df[df[\"thing\"] == \"value\"] I just feel like we've gone back to the unreadability of dictionaries. Everything's just called \"df\", you never know what type anything is without going in and checking, the structure of the frames is completely opaque, they change the structure of the dataframe halfway through the program. Type hinting these things is much harder than TypedDict/dataclass, at least doing it correctly & unambiguously is. It's practically a requirement to shove this stuff in a debugger/REPL because you'd have no chance otherwise. Sure, the argument is that I'm just in a bad Pandas codebase, and it can be done much better. However what I take issue with is that this seems to be the overwhelming \"culture\" of Pandas. All Pandas code I've ever read is like this. If you look at tutorials, examples online, you see the same stuff. They all call everything the same name and program in the most dynamic & opaque fashion possible. Sure it's quick to write, and if you love Pandas you're used to it, but personally I wince every time I look in a method and see this stuff instead of normal code. Personally I only use Pandas if I absolutely need it for performance, as a last resort. reply halfcat 12 hours agorootparentIs it just the generic, non-descriptive naming, or what do you think is the root of your distaste for pandas? Like if we have a dataclass: obj.thing == value Or SQL: SELECT * FROM table WHERE thing = ‘value’ We don’t know what the types are, either, without looking it up. The fact the dataframe often changes halfway through the program is, I think, more to do with the task at hand, that often pandas is being used to perform data transformation (the T in ETL), where some raw data is read in, and the goal is literally to change the structure to clean it up and normalize it, so the data can be ingested into a SQL table in a consistent form with other data points. But if transformation is not what you are doing, then yes, that might not be the right use of dataframes. reply RadiozRadioz 9 hours agorootparentWith the dataclass I can look at the class definition, with SQL I can look at the database schema in git, or at the very least log in and `DESCRIBE table`. With Pandas I can find where the dataframe is defined, but then I need to walk through any structural transformations made to it and keep track of its structure in my head. Alternatively I can run the Pandas program in a debugger, set a breakpoint and inspect the dataframe. With all you need to do some work, but I find the Pandas one more involved because you don't have an authoritative \"reference\", just an initial state then some transformations. With the Pandas example I have to run the program (in my head or actually). The program might need to pull in test data (hopefully some has been provided). The worst is when the structure of the DF is derived from the source data rather than stated in code (e.g. reading in a CSV). It's much more to do than looking at a class definition or declarative database schema; there's a \"sequence\" to it, there are transformation steps happening to the DF that I need to keep track of. reply RadiozRadioz 9 hours agorootparentprevAs for the transformation thing, I'm totally on board with the need to transform data. What I'm specifically objecting to is the pattern of changing a variable's type during the program, which is extremely common in Pandas code. That is, reassigning the same variable with a value that has a different structure or types. Here's a really common example where we select a subset of fields: df = ... df = df[[\"field1\", \"field2\"]] The DF has been transformed to have fewer columns than it did previously. Representing as types, it went from List[Dict[Literal[\"field1\",\"field2\",\"field3\"], int]] to List[Dict[Literal[\"field1\",\"field2\"], int]]. We can no longer rely on field3 existing in the DF. Because this one variable has two possible types depending on where you are in the program, it's much harder to reason about. This is a totally valid way to transform the data, but the manner in which the transformation is happening, I find, makes the code harder to reason about. And this is the manner of transformation I find most commonplace in Pandas practice. We could instead do the following, but I don't see it much: df = ... df_limited_fieldset = df[[\"field1\", \"field2\"]] And even in this case, to infer the structure of df_limited_fieldset, you need to determine the structure of df and then apply a transformation to it, unless you explicitly document its new structure somehow. With dataclasses, df_limited_fieldset would contain instances of an entirely new dataclass, stating its new type. None of this is to say that abuse of dynamic types doesn't happen in normal Python, it totally does, but I've found these patterns to be so ingrained in Pandas culture / common practice that I'm comfortable characterising them as part of the nature of the tool. reply _boffin_ 16 hours agorootparentprevWhy not sql? reply bmer 16 hours agorootparentEditor completion. Programmability \"out-of-the-box\" (rather than having to generate SQL using another programming language). reply RadiozRadioz 12 hours agorootparentWhy would you generate SQL using another programming language? To me that sounds like something you'd only do if you're deep in an ORM with no escape hatch. For data analysis tasks, that's extremely unergonomic and you should definitely just write normal SQL. Use the ORM for CRUD. I've never seen an ORM that won't let you drop down to regular SQL for ad-hoc queries. Editor completion is an extremely low ranking aspect for choosing technologies for data analysis. If SQL is the better tool but you're not using it because it doesn't have editor completion, then you need a better editor. It pains me when people prioritise \"developer experience in VS Code\" over \"actually the correct technological choice\". reply halfcat 12 hours agorootparentCan I ask what you do for version control of SQL? I ask this sincerely, as I’ve seen many scenarios over the years where a tool like Django is used to manage a Postgres database, solely that the schema migrations are captured in version control. A .sql file can be in version control, but rolling back a git commit is not the same as being able to roll back a schema migration in the actual database. reply RadiozRadioz 10 hours agorootparentSure, happy to go into it. Firstly we need to distinguish between version control of DQL and DDL. In the context of comparing SQL and Pandas, we're mostly talking about DQL, so version control for this is exactly the same as any other query code. For the DDL side that you're asking about, indeed just version controlling SQL files won't work, you need to use a proper migration tool. There are many available that do pure SQL migrations in the same way Django works (a sequence of up/down operations to perform or revert a migration). Personally I use migrate[1]. So you really can achieve the same thing. Personally I like this approach because it can do anything Django can, but it can also do more complicated migrations that can't be expressed by an ORM's DB-agnostic abstract layer. Pure SQL migrations also decouple your database schema from your ORM/framework, which I think is sensible anyway; databases & data tend to be much stickier than apps & frameworks. A downside here is that you need to do some extra work to keep models in sync with the schema. But the point I was making with my original post is that you can totally use ORMs for CRUD and auto-generate away all that boilerplate, _in addition to_ using raw SQL for complicated data analysis. My point is it's not binary, you can mix them, and there's nothing forcing you to generate _all_ your queries if you use an ORM for most of them. Use the ORM to manage schema, then SQL for a one-off query - still works. [1]: https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate reply bcoates 11 hours agorootparentprevYou roll back a schema migration on a dev/test database by nuking it and regenerating it, probably with the same tools you use to manage the rest of your environment. You don't rollback a schema migration to a production database, because that is impossible.

    "originLink": "https://eclecticlight.co/2024/11/14/m4-macs-cant-virtualise-older-macos/",
    "originBody": "hoakley November 14, 2024 Macs, Technology M4 Macs can’t virtualise older macOS If you’ve already got a new M4 Mac and tried to run a macOS virtual machine on it, then you might have been disappointed. It seems that M4 chips can’t virtualise any version of macOS before 13.4 Ventura. So before you trade in or pass on your M1, M2 or M3 Mac, if you need access to older VMs, you might like to check whether this affects you. I’m indebted to Csaba Fitzl for drawing my attention to this problem, and for reporting it to Apple in Feedback FB15774587. It has also been reported as affecting UTM, and I believe affects all other macOS virtualisation software for Apple silicon. The bug Running a macOS VM for any version before 13.4 Ventura on an M4 Mac results in a black screen, and the VM fails to boot. This is true whatever settings are used in the virtualiser, even if it’s set to boot the VM in Recovery mode. It’s also true when that VM has been built on that Mac: although that appears to complete successfully, when first run that VM opens as a black screen and never proceeds with personalisation and setup. Currently the only way to run a VM with macOS prior to 13.4 Ventura is to do so on a host with an M1, M2 or M3 chip. Can this be fixed? Unfortunately, as this bug prevents the VM from booting, there’s no reliable way to access its log to discover what’s going wrong there. There’s no sign of the failure in the host’s log either: the host appears to initialise its Virtio and other support normally, without errors or faults. After those, virtualisation processes on the host fall silent as they wait for the VM to start, which never happens. There is a useful clue in Activity Monitor, though: in its CPU pane, despite being allocated multiple virtual cores, only one is seen to be active on the host. That implies the failure is occurring before the VM kernel boots the other cores, an event that occurs early during the kernel boot phase. Until that point, pre-boot phases and the kernel run on just a single CPU core. macOS 13.4 updated iBoot to version 8422.121.1, so at first sight the VM could be failing when running older firmware. That doesn’t appear likely, as version 8422.121.1 was also installed in the 12.6.6 security update, so 12.7.x shouldn’t suffer this problem, but it does. It thus appears most likely that this bug strikes in the early part of kernel boot, in which case the most feasible solution would be to fix the bug in macOS kernels prior to 13.4, and promulgate new IPSW image files for those. I suspect that’s very unlikely to happen, and as far as I’m aware it would be the first time that Apple has issued revised IPSWs. Which macOS can you virtualise? Support for lightweight virtualisation of macOS on Apple silicon Macs was still in progress in the first version of macOS to run on M1 chips, Big Sur. You therefore cannot create or run Big Sur VMs. The first versions that can run in VMs are macOS 12 Monterey, although prior to 12.4 they can sometimes be a bit fractious. They also have major limitations, such as not supporting shared folders with the host. This is 12.1 with its old System Preferences, running happily on an M3 Pro. macOS Ventura should run well on M1, M2 and M3 hosts, and 13.4 and later on M4 hosts too. macOS Sonoma should run even better on all current Apple silicon Macs, and delivers a much improved display with autoscaling. However, 14.2 and 14.2.1 don’t automatically support shared folders because of a bug that was fixed in 14.3. macOS Sequoia is fully compatible, and adds support for iCloud Drive and some other Apple Account features, although still won’t run App Store apps. It may also fail to install the required extras to support Apple Intelligence. Summary Currently, M4 Macs can only run VMs of macOS Ventura 13.4 and later, 14 Sonoma, and 15 Sequoia. M1, M2 and M3 Macs can run VMs of macOS Monterey 12.0.1 and later. macOS Big Sur 11 can’t be virtualised on Apple silicon. Further information Viable and virtualisation Why macOS 14.2 & 14.2.1 VMs lose shared folders, and how to work around it Postscript I’m grateful for the suggestion that it might be possible to work around this problem by running the older VM on a single core. Although I did manage to do that on an M3 (the first time I have seen recent macOS running on just one core!), that fails just the same on an M4, I’m afraid.

But even a $100 DJ headset from a $200 streamer blows it away. reply christianqchung 2 hours agoparentprevI don't think almost anyone actually want a headphone jack anymore. Just the consumer reality in 2024. I do obviously, but it's clearly too rare for them to bother with. reply plufz 1 hour agorootparentWhy do you want a headphone jack? Not a rhetorical question, just genuine interest. Is it about audio quality, avoiding batteries or something else? I would find it so cumbersome to use a cable on a handheld device nowdays. But different things for different people! :) reply developerDan 1 hour agorootparentNot who you are replying to but my $30 wired Apple earbuds (came with my 6S) have outlived all of my co-workers half dozen $160 AirPods. That’s reason enough for a lot of people. reply mh- 1 hour agorootparentFor $8.99 you can buy a high quality USB-C (or lightning) DAC with a 3.5mm output directly from Apple. It's tiny and lightweight. I keep one in the back of my headphone case. reply plufz 32 minutes agorootparentprevYeah I agree, that is a very valid reason by itself. reply adra 1 hour agorootparentprevI don't daily drive my phone for commuting anymore, but the trade-offs aren't exactly new: - battery frustrations - cost of a dozen cheap but good quality headphones vs a wireless equivalent - easier to lose wireless headsets when you put them down somewhere (wired too, but way cheaper so less big deal) - audio quality? Who knows For people that demand noise cancelling, you need an active power source, but I personally hate noise cancellation and always turn them off. Maybe valuable in a plane with lots of engine noise. reply ericd 1 hour agorootparentprevMy wired Shure in ear monitors have much better sound quality, and battery management on AirPods is pretty annoying. Even when they’re not running out mid-trip, it’s just unnecessary mental overhead to keep another thing charged. reply secondcoming 1 hour agorootparentprevFor me it’s because - I already have high quality earphones, same set for many years - they don’t require charging - audio quality is great - they’ll work on any device with a 3.5mm jack, no proprietary lock-ins - I have never lost a set of earphones and if I did replacement wouldn’t break the bank reply SoftTalker 2 hours agorootparentprevYes people seem happy to buy not only new phones every couple of years but new accessory devices as well. I don't understand it but it's quite apparent. reply plufz 1 hour agorootparentI find it very practical with small Bluetooth earbuds, but I agree on the consumption aspect of it. I really don’t like that I can’t change the batteries in my AirPods. I would even be semi-okay with having to hand in them to a technician for battery exchange, for a reasonable cost. But the current battery exchange for airpods is just another name for buying new earbuds. And the third party solutions that actually change the batteries cost about as much as new buds. reply Hackbraten 2 hours agoparentprevSomeone would have to maintain all the old OS versions that would be required to run those old apps, and keep those OS versions reasonably secure. That sounds like a maintenance nightmare to me. reply exe34 1 hour agorootparentNo, the old versions would not have access to anything else, so the only thing that needs to change is the part running the container. Present one folder as the whole disk drive to the old. Send touch screen input to the old. That's about it really. reply Hackbraten 1 hour agorootparentIf you're trying to play older 32-bit games, chances are you'd like to have sound, too. Who is going to develop the virtual audio device drivers (for each OS) that are required to virtualize sound? Who is going to run all the tests needed to make sure that the guest-side 32-bit iOS 7 (and 8, 9, 10) drivers are going to play well with the host-side driver? Who is going to accept the risk that someone takes over the guest VM after exploiting one of the well-known and unpatched kernel-level vulnerabilities present in iOS 10? What happens if malware finds and exploits a bug in that new audio driver virtualization pipeline so it can escape the VM and then compromise the host iOS? reply exe34 44 minutes agorootparentyeah it's much better to lose access to games you've paid for. this is why I stopped buying apps on Android - if it's not open source, I'm not interested. I also don't buy DRM stuff unless I know I can remove the lock. reply GeekyBear 1 hour agoparentprevIt's probably worth finding out whether this is a bug or an intentional decision before making assumptions. reply moffkalast 48 minutes agorootparentFor Apple Hanlon's razor rarely holds, they're both too competent and anticonsumer for this sort of thing to not be intentional malice in an attempt to sell more stuff. Maybe not, but very unlikely and even if it's a bug they'll probably call it a feature and keep it. reply gjsman-1000 2 hours agoparentprevnext [5 more] [flagged] adamc 1 hour agorootparentThis is one of the things I dislike about hacker news: People responding to what is clearly emotional hyperbole as though it were a literal statement. The OP expresses disappointment with Apple -- exactly what the cause was is unstated. People are allowed to have such feelings. I've had them myself. In recent years, Apple has killed things I liked and pushed a lot of services/login crap I have zero interest in. Other people like the new changes. That's OK too. reply evilduck 40 minutes agorootparentNobody wants to read emotional hyperbole when it's just an excuse to lie or exaggerate instead of being truthful or accurate. It's more common than not to find people expressing disappointment with Apple online who are lying, ignorant to the point that their complaint is just incomprehensible, using long outdated and incorrect information, exaggerating the problem to the point of absurdity, or applying expectations or standards that literally no company or alternative product on Earth meets. A good chunk of the time you can even get people to reply in a way that betray the fact that they never even owned or used the Apple product they're complaining about, they're just seeking upvotes or karma with easy and popular sentiments even if they're factually wrong. Holding Apple accountable and having a negative opinion is fine, but it's a fairly rare thing to find someone online doing it in good faith. reply plufz 1 hour agorootparentprevI agree that feelings are okay. But also the internet and society is so overloaded with emotional hyperboles. I like with HN that a lot of people make the effort to be bit more diplomatic, less aggressive and more based in facts than most online communities. reply JumpCrisscross 1 hour agorootparentprev> OP expresses disappointment with Apple I read it as polarisation against Apple. As in what follows is not to be taken literally, but as a diatribe. The message being, in essence, \"I don't like Apple.\" If that wasn't the intended message, OP is right--the comment is stronger without it. reply wslh 2 hours agoprev [–] So, is it assumed as a bug more than a removed feature? If this is a bug and could be fixed I would treat this different to \"no more support for older macOSes\". reply my123 1 hour agoparent [–] In this case, it's an unintentional bug. reply JadeNB 39 minutes agorootparent [–] > In this case, it's an unintentional bug. How do you know? Maybe it's in the mentioned bug report 15774587; I tried to look at it, and was sure I could log into Radar at some point, but now I can't seem to dig up any valid login. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
