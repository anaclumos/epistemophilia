Heavily restricted and regulated, the official passport photo requirements include that the subject needs to face the camera straight on, needs a clear background without shadow, no glare on glasses and most importantly; no smile. It seems almost impossible for any kind of self-expression. The series tries to challenge these official rules by testing all the things you could be doing while you are taking your official document photo.",

I was given a date and time slot and that was that. reply rconti 20 hours agoprevIt's a lot of \"fun\" trying to get acceptable photos. Last week I went to my local American Automobile Association (AAA) office to get an International Driver's Permit (IDP). It's just a translation of your license, which is valid for 1 year. I had to take 2 passport-sized photos with me, which I did. But I was told they wouldn't be accepted because I had long hair and a beard in them, but short hair and no beard now. That's absurd, because it's the same photo used in both of my passports, and there's no requirement that you don't alter your appearance from your passport photo. Somehow border guards can crack the code. Amusingly, my California driver's license shows short hair and no beard, but the AAA person wasn't even looking at my CA license at the time. What happens if I grow long hair and a beard before I travel? Was he just trying to upsell me on a $9.99 photo? We had a hell of a time getting the UK passport authorities to accept the photos we sent in for her passport; they recommend getting your photos taken at an \"official\" UK location where the digital photos are identified by a code you send in. Well, we happened to be traveling through Australia during this timeframe, so we were able to stop at an Australian Post Office, which supposedly had the same \"digital\" system, but instead of a code to send to the UK authorities, they handed us printed photos and a web link. Thankfully I was able to use the web link to download the photo and upload it to the UK site, where it was approved almost immediately, and the new passport arrived back at our home before we returned from our trip. But there's no user-obvious criteria that was being used to reject the SEVERAL rounds of photos we had sent to the UK earlier. reply ethbr1 19 hours agoparent> But I was told they wouldn't be accepted because I had long hair and a beard in them, but short hair and no beard now. Tell them your religion doesn't permit beardless photos, so you grew one for the photo. When they ask what religion, pick one with beards. It's AAA, not the police -- the person behind the desk will shrug, now with a reason not to care, and create your IDP. reply stavros 17 hours agorootparent> When they ask what religion, pick one with beards. I just love this sentence. reply philsnow 15 minutes agorootparent\"I can't tell you, it's one with beards and also secrets\" reply donw 13 hours agorootparentprevGotta cover all the bases and tell them you're Jewslamic Rastodox Sikhamish. reply bbarnett 13 hours agorootparentprevhttps://nationalpost.com/news/canada/pastafarian-who-fought-... reply thaumasiotes 13 hours agorootparentprevA lot of companies seem to have \"policies\" that are grounded in nothing. Airlines are especially bad about this, thinking they know better than you whether you'll be able to get through immigration at the destination. For whatever reason, airline policies about whether you can get on the plane are completely unrelated to the destination countries' policies about whether you can be allowed in. The most egregious such policy that comes to mind was when Philippine Airlines refused to give me a boarding pass for a flight to China unless I filled out a health declaration form that was guaranteed to expire before my flight arrived. There was of course no obstacle to me filling out (a new copy of) the form on arrival in China. As was necessarily the case, given that the pre-flight declaration expired during the flight. reply foomar 12 hours agorootparentI think the rationale behind this is that many countries will fine the airline around $10,000 for each passenger that doesn't have the right immigration documentation and has to be deported. So there is a reason they err on the side of caution for them at the expense of making your life harder reply Scoundreller 12 hours agorootparentIt’s not the denied entry pipeline that a lot of countries worry about. Those have always been the airline’s problem. It’s the lawful refugee claims they might be forced to consider/accept if a claimant can make landfall. And their dislike of citizens using minimal ID to lawfully gain entry home. So they extort the airlines to fulfill their wishes on foreign soil. reply xattt 7 hours agorootparentprev> A lot of companies seem to have \"policies\" that are grounded in nothing. A lot of this comes down to people not wanting to stick their head out to change process and groupthink. I witnessed an individual in a “worker bee” capacity trying to suggest a small-but-significant change on a client-facing first-contact form. They went through their CoC to get the message out, but got the “that’s nice, dear” treatment. Said “worker bee” moved into a different department some time later, and all of a sudden, it was such a great idea that no one had thought about. reply walthamstow 7 hours agorootparentprevThese kind of policies are usually grounded by the one dickhead who tried to do something completely stupid that they never anticipated, now they have to have a policy for it. reply taneq 6 hours agorootparentEvery dumb rule and warning label has a story attached. reply consf 12 hours agorootparentprevWhy enforce something that’s bound to become irrelevant by the time it’s needed? reply taneq 6 hours agorootparentTo avert liability, usually. reply koliber 11 hours agoparentprevPublic service message: in many countries, the IDP, International Driving Permit, is not needed. Since it is only a translation, it carries no official weight. Many countries that use the Latin alphabet only need a translation of the drivers license (ie IDP) if the alphabet on the driver’s license is not Latin. Check online before you travel. This can save you a trip to the AAA, a few bucks, and an encounter with a clerk who questions the validity of your beard. reply pmontra 2 hours agorootparentAs an example, Australia wants one. I can't remember if Geneva or Vienna type or both. Last time I've been there was 2019 and my country uses the Latin alphabet too (it was invented here.) The official document is the country's of origin driving license but basically owning a valid IDP states that your country and the destination country are signatories of one of those two conventions and agree to let their own citizens drive in both countries with no need of further tests. Some countries recognize some foreign driving licenses, at least for a while, without the need of the IDP. The USA is one of them but it has been a long time since I drove a car there so it could have changed or be regulated state by state and not at federal level. The USA is a signatory of the 1949 Geneva convention. reply chgs 2 hours agorootparentI’ve hired cars in Austrailia without an IDP, just my British driving license. reply bux93 10 hours agorootparentprevTell that to Mr. Prawo Jazdy. https://www.irishtimes.com/news/phantom-pole-haunts-garda-at... reply taneq 5 hours agorootparentAsk them for directions to the Forest of Skund. ;) reply rconti 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah; I'm a USian, and this one is for Japan which \"requires\" it. I also got one for Italy a bunch of years ago, as I was told the car rental agencies would not rent me a car without one. Otherwise I've never bothered, and I've rented cars in a half dozen countries in Europe, Australia, NZ.... reply dwroberts 19 hours agoparentprevThe criteria for UK stuff is normally really clear? https://www.gov.uk/photos-for-passports Can see how it would be annoying if they don't explain which criteria is being violated though reply rconti 19 hours agorootparentYeah, the criteria is clear, but do everything you can to meet it, and the online submission will just say the photo quality is \"poor\" (unlikely to be approved) and not explain what's poor about it. I spent a lot of time juggling aspects of the photo itself as well as of the scan (DPI, compression, etc) and nothing seemed to make a difference. reply Macha 5 minutes agorootparentMy prior passport photo was taken with the Irish Passport office's manual \"send in photos and someone decides if it's good enough\" process they had at the time. As I always wore glasses, I wore them in my photo too, which given they didn't obscure the face, the manual check indicated they were fine. For my latest renewal, they've moved to an app based process which just flat out rejects any with my glasses on because the prescription is so strong it distorts the outline of my face (at least that's my best guess, as the app claims compatibility with glasses. Anyway, since renewing the passport to one without glasses in my passport photo, I've found I much more frequently get rejected at automated passport gates, often needing to take my glasses off so I match the passport photo better. reply IanCal 18 hours agorootparentprevAnecdata from the other side, I've done a few passports for family now and it gives immediate ratings and we've not had any issue at all. reply rjh29 16 hours agorootparentI took a phone selfie against a white wall and it was accepted fine. reply unit149 10 hours agoparentprevGeneva Convention which established IDPs in the post-war period ran parallel to measures implemented under the Marshall Plan.

In my case, whatever detection software they used seemed to think my eyes were closed, which they were not. I just used a normal picture taken on a phone, against a plain white wall, accepted with no issues. reply sokoloff 17 hours agoparentprevI made my passport photos on a phone camera against a white wall, stitched them together with other family members and printed them on a 4x6 photo at CVS. I think it cost something like $0.68 for 2 photos, each of which had all four of our photos plus 2 extra spots. reply YZF 12 hours agoparentprevUnless you are traveling to some weird place almost everywhere will accept a standard driver's license if it has English on it. reply williamdclt 9 hours agorootparentVietnam famously doesn't. You can rent a motorbike without showing any sort of license, but in the most touristic areas (eg Ha Giang loop) the police picks out foreigners to check and get their bribe. And I have a vague remembrance (take with a whole rock of salt) that foreigners from many countries technically _cannot_ legally drive there even with an IDP, because there's 2 competing IDP standards or something like that. But I'd guess you'd be fine reply jhugo 6 hours agorootparentYeah, the actual law is irrelevant most of the time, since it's just a shakedown. I did encounter one cop who knew about the 2 different IDP conventions and was able to extract the coffee money even if you had one. If you don't want to pay, offering to accompany them to the station to pay there (and get a receipt) usually works, especially if you're out in the countryside, since they don't want to give up on the chance to stop a bunch of other people. If you do choose to pay, they'll usually share your license plate on a WhatsApp group with the other local police if you ask them to, so you won't get hassled again for the rest of the day. reply jon-wood 6 hours agorootparentNot sure why but I'm quite tickled by the existence of WhatsApp groups to coordinate who's paid their bribe for the day. I think it's the thought of breaking the law being done in an orderly way. reply Macha 2 minutes agorootparentYou may enjoy the second image in this article, of looters forming an orderly queue and making sure not to obstruct the pavement while doing so: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2023924/London-riot...

I had a similar experience with getting UK photos at a chemist, they said they could do digital photos and didn’t. So I went to the Photo Warehouse and it was smooth sailing. I guess the specialist photo outfits are more likely to know what they’re doing. reply technothrasher 19 hours agoparentprev> But I was told they wouldn't be accepted Huh. Last time I got an IDP from AAA, I don't think the lady behind the desk even really looked at the photo. She just took my $20, copied the info from my app to my permit, stapled one of the photos to the permit, and handed it to me. It was like less than three minutes total. reply avgDev 17 hours agoparentprevThe IDP feels like such a scam. I have to get it every year and it is so annoying. reply jhugo 6 hours agorootparentThere are some websites that will issue a translation of your license that looks very similar to the \"official\" IDP. Depending on where you're going it might be sufficient. (Generally works fine for avoiding police \"coffee money\" shakedowns in Southeast Asia, for example.) reply csomar 16 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn’t feel like a scam. It IS a scam. You were able to get a 3 year valid one but now they reduced it to 1 year. If my permit is valid for 10 years, so should the IDP. But then it’d cost x10 if they were to keep the same profit. So suddenly asking for close to $200 will feel outrageous. Just shows how corruption can be worse than a monetary loss. reply YZF 12 hours agorootparentYou don't even need it most of the time. Almost every country will just accept a driver's license from most other countries as long as it's fairly standard and has a section in English. I've driven in dozens of countries with my local driver's license. reply jhugo 6 hours agorootparentYeah, I don't bother any more, but it has happened a couple of times to me in Europe that a rental car company asked for it and then refused to rent without it. In both cases I just walked over to a different company's desk and they didn't ask. reply avgDev 1 hour agorootparentI've had several companies refuse rental and ask for IDP. $20 to avoid hassles is worth it for me. reply consf 12 hours agoparentprevIt seems absurd that the requirements can vary so much and yet remain so vague reply dylan604 20 hours agoparentprev> But I was told they wouldn't be accepted because yeah, and I would have expected nothing less. from my personal experience, the photos were required to be recent. just based on your having visited a barber would signal to me that the photos were not recent. even if you visited the barber while you waited for the 1-Hour Photo guy to finish, a logical person would realize this was not going to work out well reply rconti 19 hours agorootparentThe criteria says \"Two original passport pictures\" ; it does not say \"recent\". Regardless, the photos are recent ( It's unclear to me why you have gone out of your way to misunderstand or misinterpret the situation It's the internet. Even HN isn't immune to the Eternal September. I still think Reddit is useful, sometimes, and I've got karma to burn for years, so I find it hilarious when my comments get downvoted into hell over some trivial issues. Since I don't care about imaginary internet points except to make sure that people can read what I post (I don't want to fall into the well of negativity on that), I don't delete the ones that get buried. That poster you replied to is doing the kind of crap you see on the Reddit front page subs. They're almost all trash. You get upvoted for hivemind, you get downvoted for going against the grain. Regardless of the merit of the comment. Hell, I've been downvoted here for my very milquetoast comment that maybe the clerk was trying to help you keep out of trouble in a country where you really need an IDP (different alphabet, e.g.). You can't downvote before you have a bunch of points here, and I almost never do - if you're wrong I'll try to help you fix it, and if it's just a disagreement then... that's life? You pretty much have to explicitly be an unprovoked major asshole or advocate straight-up genocide to make me downvote you. reply brianleb 19 hours agorootparentprevSo I actually shave my beard every time I get a haircut (so, let's say every 8 weeks). What does 'recent' mean, since you have already acknowledged that temporal recency is irrelevant? When am I traveling? What's accurate to my current appearance? What if I started a cancer treatment that renders me unable to grow a beard? Your flippant reply ignores reality, and these aren't even edge cases. reply dylan604 19 hours agorootparentIf you are applying for a new passport where you are needing these photos, the common sense logic from the person accepting/rejecting them would be do the photos look like the person in front of them. No? Reject. Yes? Accept. The flow chart is pretty simple. The frequency of your grooming habits AFTER receiving a passport are irrelevant to the actual approval of a passport. This doesn't need to be hard. reply oneeyedpigeon 9 hours agorootparent> do the photos look like the person in front of them To what ridiculous extent do you take that, though? You must be wearing the same clothes? You must be made-up in the exact same way? I think it's pretty clear that the test should be \"is it obvious that the person in the photo is the same as the person in front of you\" and somebody with a beard does look like themself, even when they shave that beard.

I copied them down, and in the barbershop, I proudly showed them to the barber, who nodded and invited me to the chair. The guy was stellar, but halfway through the cutting it dawned on me something is wrong. Turns out, what I thought was \"cm\" was actually spelling \"mm\"! He would've likely double-checked with me if I tried to spell this out at the shop[1], but apparently I came across as someone who really knew what they want, coming in confidently with the order already precisely written in Chinese and all. Lesson learned. I still think the idea was good, and I'd still go for giving explicit length (it's a natural fit, as it translates to cutting head numbers for the electric hair cutters). I'd just triple-check it next time, and not act like I have it all figured out. -- [0] - Or thereabouts; I'm sure about the unit, but the exact number might've been something else between 2 and 6. [1] - The barber didn't know English, but knew the metric system and arabic numerals, so we've confirmed the misunderstanding with pen and paper. reply stavros 17 hours agorootparentprevI just gesticulated wildly towards my head while making the \"scissors\" hand sign and loudly and slowly saying \"HAIRCUT\".

On the original pic you could somehow see that it was a towel and not a white wall but some photoshopping took care of that. Why a shirt while in underwear? A shirt looks \"serious\".

What the EU has done is far from perfect but it bans the worst practices. The Chinese can buy all of the information they want on Americans and Canadians from ad brokers, who will happily sell them everything they need to track individuals' locations.

TikTok is rife with this. i believe the rising antisemitism today owes to the proliferation of such content on TikTok where young people consume it on a daily basis. there is no denying an extremely disproportionate amount of misinformation is coming from the pro-Palestinian movement, backed by Iran and Qatar-based Al Jazeera. there is no denying an extremely disproportionate amount of hate speech is directed towards the Israelis and the Jewish people, not the Palestinians. just scroll TikTok or Twitter. for one mild post against a Palestinian, you will find ten extremely antisemitic content directed towards an Israeli who has nothing to do with the conflict. reply ImPostingOnHN 41 minutes agorootparent> there is no genocide of Palestinians in Gaza Sure, just like there is no terrorism in the middle east.

There is simply no denying an extremely disproportionate amount of hate speech and misinformation coming from the pro-Israel movement, backed by Israel and Israeli media, and directed towards Palestinians and those who oppose the genocide of them. I say this as a jewish person. I'm just suggesting we remove the noise surrounding the conflict, by curbing the systemic spread of non-truths and hate speech by Israeli-backed disinformation campaigns.

Do you remember the joyous declarations from 1990s that meatspace state borders do not apply to cyberspace? That was not entirely wishful thinking. The same properties that allow information from \"free world\" to make way into the \"world of oppression\" work for different definitions of \"free\" (democratic, communist, fundamentalist, etc) and \"oppressed\" (communist brainwashed, capitalist exploitative, sinful and godless, etc).

I suppose this would be easier to rationalize if domestic interests were democratically controllable.... but they're not. And they certainly aren't by canadians, which makes this action doubly confusing. reply prawn 14 hours agorootparentPeople throughout this thread seem to disagree with your first point. reply PittleyDunkin 13 hours agorootparentHence the \"(theoretically)\" hedge. The theory for how control is maintained has been well-established for at least three decades: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent Nonetheless, this underlines the hypocrisy of punishing TikTok but not western corporations. By any standard (except for foreign control, which is of dubious merit when domestic control is equally harmful) Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc are equally of deserving of restriction as TikTok is. reply IG_Semmelweiss 15 hours agorootparentprevThis sounds reasonable but I feel just like OP, its still missing the forest from the trees Its not about who has the data, although that is important. Its not about subversion of a population by a foreign state, although that is important too. The crux of the issue is reciprocity. China does not let any CAN or US companies into China markets, without first demanding local factories, forcing local production, requiring equity control and even IP. And if you dont share it, bohoo they will steal it anyway. And, there's no recourse. The chinese govt has abused free trade for so long. Its time to demand fairness. They dont give us access into their markets? OK! We close our markets to their corporations. Its as simple as that. The golden rule. reply shubb 3 hours agorootparentprevOne of the big controversies is that Chinese \"tiktok\" runs a much less socially disruptive algorithm. You know, China hit a lot of these problems before we did and the ir platforms are \"nicer\" because they are more regulated. Rather than ban tiktok and suffer the same problems with meta's Reels, what if we borrowed some of thier regulation? reply mountainb 17 hours agorootparentprevThe difficulty here is that it has long been US policy to promote the exports of its intellectual property (such as its movies) and communications networks (such as the internet). Trade policy is almost always a two way street, particularly in the modern era in which arrangements like the \"unequal treaties\" that choked the Qing dynasty are highly unusual. So banning Tiktok necessarily results in reciprocal bans. Canada does not have similar concerns as the US does because it is our little gas station whose pretensions to independence we humor and they do not export IP or communications technologies at the same scale as we do. reply imgabe 17 hours agorootparentAmerican social networks are already banned in China and have been for a long time. Even TikTok doesn't operate in China because they have a different message they want for their own citizens. Douyin - the Chinese version of Tiktok - promotes learning about science and technology, shuts down at night, and limits how much children are allowed to use it. reply gs17 2 hours agorootparentMaybe there's child accounts that has those limits, but normal accounts don't match that description. I've watched my girlfriend use Douyin and the content was lower brow than what e.g. Instagram shows her. It was mostly dumb skits and people doing silly dances. Due to time zones, I have no clue if it shut down at night, but it never seemed to be an issue. We get a lot of propaganda about Chinese social media apps that's just wrong. I was told Xiaohongshu is a propaganda app that sends quotes from Mao's little red book, and it's Chinese Instagram. reply xarope 15 hours agorootparentprevThat first part about Douyin, sounds exactly like what the internet should be, a public resource for learning about hard things.

You'll find that elected officials generally reflect the opinions of those that voted for them. They likely disagree with your opinions and think Israel is right to use force to defend itself against the aggression of its enemies. That said these sorts of issues were way down the list in these elections and people have to compromise on some issues and vote on the aggregate. I do think that it's pretty clear the Republicans were and are a lot more understanding and publicly supportive of Israel vs. the Democrats. They didn't try to do a \"both sides here\" but clearly communicated who they consider to be the aggressor and who they consider to be defending themselves. That doesn't mean that every single republican voter feels that way but a lot of them do. The US also supported and brokered quite a few peace initiatives in the middle east. It's not fair to say it only acts to support wars. reply monocasa 16 hours agorootparent> You'll find that elected officials generally reflect the opinions of those that voted for them.

Just because elected officials hold similar opinions doesn't mean economic interests can't impact their policy decisions. Also in terms of methodology, skimming through the paper, the author uses \"national survey of the general public\" but my claim is whether a given official reflects the will of their voters - which is not the same thing. He does also look at what \"affluent\" people think as some sort of proxy for the power of money. Maybe there's something there. I think it's an interesting area of research. However on many fundamental issues, let's say illegal immigration, foreign policy, or abortions, it's not immediately obvious that business interests hold power most of the time. If that was true then it really wouldn't matter if you have democrats or republicans in power but you see definite shift in policy when that happens. reply faizmokh 16 hours agorootparentprevIt only serves to support wars, and most of the American public has historically been fine with it as long as the conflicts aren't on their own soil.

You guess it, they don't to look only at dance videos. Social media had become a huge source of information for a big chunk of the population. On TT, and on most social media (SM), what you watch is mainly determined by the recommendation algorithm. This algo can hide subjects the SM can't put ad on but also subjects the they don't like and boost the one they do (shadow ban). That how you politicize SM. That about, the first thing Musk did with Twitter (after firing people). When it's a state controlled SM, it's more like foreign interference. There is a lot of books about that.

That's their right reply _ache_ 9 hours agorootparentIt could have been if ByteDance wasn't totally state controlled. Also, since TikTok is banned on China, it's not like it exists in China as a media (the Chinese version is called Douyin and basically it's the same as TikTok but with contents from within China only, to not interfere with the Great Firewall). Also, the concept of \"choose to consume\" is blurring with algorithm recommendation and optimizing dopamine reward to maximize screen time. The CCP didn't control of ByteDance to interference with other countries but to be able to control what happens inside China. But now, it's different. reply aprilthird2021 5 hours agorootparentBut none of that changes the fact that Americans have the right to consume foreign controlled media. Totally state controlled media is legal to consume and spread and even become super popular in the US.

And yet..nobody cares..even though we know for a fact it happens, we don't care let alone call the US an enemy. So, what is the difference? The media and politicians calling 24/7 China your enemy (something nobody would've done before 2018/2017), but ignoring or pretending that the real spy of all spies which hacks and spies on all of its allies, even the personal phone of the German chancellor is cool.

I'm not so sure that many of these current squabbles over what constitutes \"consensus reality\" aren't religious in nature. Social media already seems to be pushing the limits of human nature in some destructive directions such that politics now is like holy war. I think we need to focus more on the \"consensus\" part (including peacemaking and bridge building) instead of the \"battle\" part. I'm not seeing a lot of that happening. That requires a lot of humility as in we're all like blind people groping our way to figure out reality and none of us has the complete picture.

(Proving that he's not really an anarchist.) Of course, he couched it terms of plausible deniability but anybody with the ability to read between the lines knew exactly what he was saying. This was during the environment in which small and family-owned businesses were being destroyed (yes, in America) and people were losing their jobs as well. It happened to a number of personal friends. There were far worse excesses in other Western nations too, not just in China. The only reason things didn't go further in the US here is because Americans have fewer vulnerabilities than citizens in other countries do in the face of this sort of oppression. And it was all cheered on by those who believed themselves to be on the right side of the establishment at that time. It was a regular thing to see and hear people fantasizing about the idea of forced injections, online and in real life. And we learned about all this on, yes, social media (which was heavily censored at the time too). The legacy media outlets were not telling the truth. All this was only three years ago. Things are a little different now, I'm sure you will find in many cases that forgiveness is possible in light of true apologies, but there will not be a forgetting.

The few of us 'counterflow' cannot win against the tides as long as we remain part of the larger society. At best we eke out livings generally disadvantaged compared to our brethren with social media presences and all the drama that goes with it. A few of us may get opportunities from those rare outliers in positions to make a call or introduce you to a friend of a friend. But make of the rest of us simply become one of the unspoken masses, just like say the people in Slab City, or those old rock hounds who used to live in Quartzite, AZ (now some weird mass of RV park and bedroom community for Phoenix, as I understand it.) My point, winding as it may seem, is that this generations kids are bound to their social mediums just like the radio and then television generations were to theirs, for mainstream culture, and like the Beatniks, Hippies, Progressives(I'm not sure of the proper term here, but the non-internet groups of the 80s-00s, LGBTQA movement, the BDSM movement, etc) for the outliers. There are plenty of other subcultures out there that have waxed and waned as well, some of them crossing other boundaries, like the religious or politcal gaps in this country. But for many of us that leaves us as the odd person out. Not being into the right hobbies or social activities or just having the wrong values and you soon find yourself distanced from those around you. The internet can give that back to you or help take it away, but in the long term the dossiers on each of us that being online produce is far less damaging than the lack of in-person connections many of us(not I) gain from social networks even as we give up our privacy and our opportunities for future dissent against the status quo, something that Eastern and Western societies alike are rapidly barreling towards an ultimatum on.

Why you'd make him President, of course! There was certainly a fad when social media was new to get all worked up about finding out about something someone did in the past, where people were even losing their shit over something that would normally be innocuous like a photo of a teacher enjoying a beer at a party.

ByteDance will keep no data in Canada, will not employ any Canadians, will not report any information to Canadian authorities, and will have no reason to comply with Canadian warrants or court orders. (Or even judgments.) At the same time, all Canadians can continue to use the app. On balance, this seems bad for Canada and great for ByteDance. reply dmix 19 hours agorootparent> On balance, this seems bad for Canada and great for ByteDance. It's hard to balance anything until they explain why they did it. So far they claim they aren't at liberty to share but claim it was bad enough to make a very unprecedented move like this. reply markus_zhang 19 hours agorootparentprevThe only reason I think they would do this is because of espionage, so you want to remove the offices but keep the app. But there is no proof provided within the article. reply A_D_E_P_T 18 hours agorootparentPresumably the only espionage asset ByteDance has is the data it keeps on Canadian users. (Which probably includes information on arctic military installations, etc.) TikTok is still going to collect that data, and it will be kept in China, far beyond Canada's reach. To remove concern over the data, I reckon you'd go about it backwards: Get rid of the app, which is up to no good. Keep the offices, so that they can be spied on or forced into transparency via the courts. reply pnw 18 hours agorootparentprevIntelligence agencies aren't known for their history of providing proof to the public.

In theory I'd have to self-assess PST maybe but I order stuff (both physical and digital) from foreign companies with no Canadian presence on a pretty regular basis. reply csomar 15 hours agorootparentSmall credit cards transactions fly under the radar. But a big business with a big budget won't be able to advertise on Tiktok. That's why companies establish these offices. They are essentially import/export offices that allow the flow of money out of said country. reply grugagag 18 hours agorootparentprevThat means that users can’t be advertised to? reply seanmcdirmid 18 hours agorootparentIt means Canadian companies can't buy ads from ByteDance. Canadian content creators can't receive money from ByteDance.

It's not like they're embassies filled with spies. reply llm_nerd 16 hours agorootparentWhy couldn't it be? Canada has an extremely generous, massively exploited foreign worker program (it is actually one of the reasons this government is profoundly unpopular). ByteDance, like every other company, can unilaterally declare that they need to bring in an entirely foreign staff and get it rubber stamped. Given the company's alleged closeness with the party, using it as an easy vehicle to drop loads of intelligence workers of various sorts in Canada would be logical. Similarly China has a thing with running intimidation tactics against Chinese ex-pats living in Western countries. reply gruez 16 hours agorootparentIt's not impossible, but you'd think they come up with a better front company than bytedance, of all companies. It's like China accusing that McDonalds is a spy front. reply llm_nerd 16 hours agorootparentPerhaps, but China really doesn't have a lot of companies with offices in the West. When China tries to buy Western countries they are often blocked for the same national security reasons, as has happened several times in Canada. reply gruez 15 hours agorootparentA nondescript consumer appliance or clothing \"sales office\" is infinitely better than bytedance, a company that has received significant flak in the media. The Biden administration's policy of \"small yard, high fence\" means that unless you're trying to import chips, AI tech, drones, or battery tech, you're probably fine. Nobody is going to blink an eye at some Chinese company trying to sell rice cookers. reply parl_match 19 hours agorootparentprevIt goes both ways. ... and Bytedance will not have any recourse if Canada bans the app. reply hluska 18 hours agorootparentprevAs far as I can find, Bytedance is one of only three companies ordered to shutter their Canadian operations. The other two are both involved in the drone detection space. This makes the most sense if Canada expects (or has) Canadian troops secretly deployed somewhere.

Why banning them from having one? reply ttul 16 hours agoprevI believe there is a legal concept at play here. If a company has an office - a physical presence - within the country, then it has what is called “mind and management” in the country. The mind and management doctrine gives the company certain rights within Canada that presumably the security folks don’t want them to have. The public will probably never find out the scope of ByteDance’s operations in Canada for the Chinese government, but if it follows the same arc as other Chinese operations in Canada, I expect it is far more pervasive and frightening than one might expect.

It seems there’s little interest globally. With my direct and indirect experiences of social media; I strongly support this. That said; how does a young individual get updates to public transport outages that are only available via twitter/x, or read the menu of the local cafe that is only posted on Facebook? I do worry about the implementation, especially if government owned. The government has, in the past, said one thing and executed another. (DNS metadata collection for ISP’s, for example) Whilst I have nothing to hide, and am happy to be entirely transparent with them; I can appreciate, respect, and understand the hesitation. And, if government owned; how long until it’s “privatised”. Will be interesting to see how this plays out. reply quitit 7 hours agoparentThere is zero willingness by Meta and others to even follow through on their own guidelines or government requirements. I think it's time a hard decision was made about the harms spread by these networks. I am definitely not alone in submitting a report about a fake profile only for the system to nearly automatically deny it. Even when the real person being impersonated is literally sitting next to me asking me to help them submit the report. Even illegal drug dealers operate in the open on Meta properties with no recourse whatsoever. The process of eliminating a huge swath of fake and harmful content could be implemented trivially, we have so many ways of muting or limiting the spread of information which is unvetted, dubious origin, has outlier qualities and so on - yet nothing of the type is engaged by these networks to obvious harmful consequences. reply gU9x3u8XmQNG 6 minutes agorootparentThanks for your reply. On a similar note; a family member was being exposed to intense and violent content over Facebook. There was no block, ignore, or report feature on the content exposed. The only option we could find, after researching it; was a “show less of this content” setting buried deep in the Facebook web app (not even available on the standalone app). Honestly; if the account owner has little option to manage the content they are exposed to.. ugh! reply y1426i 57 minutes agoparentprevI don't think this is a practical solution. And it does not solve the underlying issue, which is the attention economy. Here's a better solution option that is easier to implement; even adults can benefit, and I think it solves some of the problems: 1. Have an easy option to turn off feeds and enforce for non-adults. This would apply not just to meta, twitter, but also to Youtube, LinkedIn, etc. 2. Disable like display. The like counts are what hooks people and gives the dopamine kick. Add the ability to hide it and not show for under 18 easily. 3. Social and news sites should not be allowed to send notifications, period. Not on phones or browsers, at least not for those under 18. Something along these lines would improve social media for everyone, not just kids. Parents' mental health affects kids the same. So blocking it just for kids only goes so far. reply gU9x3u8XmQNG 17 minutes agorootparentThanks for your reply.

I don’t see any alternative. reply mcdeltat 7 hours agoparentprev> Given the lack of interest in the industry “self” regulating, and/or taking responsibility of, the content; what other option is there This is surely an important point. People often make the argument of individual freedom. But at the same time, evidently we are excellent at using those freedoms to screw ourselves over. Globally, we've been speedrunning fucking up society in critical areas for decades now. Could the solution be less freedom?

Social media has also been enormously beneficial in terms of crippling the propaganda power of centralized, commercial media. It would be very bad to simply return to the authority of editorial boards. What we actually need is to grapple with the social responsibility that comes with this power, which could take decades or even centuries of living with the internet to wrangle. Especially now that we know how little of the world traditional newsrooms are even willing to cover, let alone fund coverage of. Besides, the cat is out of the bag. reply dsvnasd 1 hour agorootparent> Besides, the cat is out of the bag. That's what I was thinking too. I am not sure what the value is in severely regulating half a dozen or so companies when work arounds are so easily to implement. Maybe as a stop gap solution while we figure out long term solutions (which the government has a horrible track record on). But for any long term solution we would first have to define what social media even is, and in a way that's testable in court. Don't run away from the hard things, but wow, that's hard. reply doodaddy 2 hours agorootparentprevThere is some truth to this crippling power and I don’t doubt that there are examples of it. But social media has been the vector for massive amounts of propaganda. Sorry to say I’d rather just have the commercialized editorial boards. At least that’s a single problem that can be reigned in. Instead we have the worst of both worlds - commercialized media plus a million-headed hydra spewing falsehoods and nonsense. reply broken-kebab 12 minutes agorootparent>Sorry to say I’d rather just have the commercialized editorial boards Not me. Having a solid experience living in some far-from-democracy countries, I can state with all certainty that social platforms opened at least a crack to alternative opinions for a lot of people. Yes, they are full of propaganda, but I think they still provide more pluralistic picture compared to the world where old media ruled supreme. The real problem with those platforms is not \"misinformation\" (which will be everywhere anyway), buy addictiveness, and the fact they incentivize aggressive tribalism reply PittleyDunkin 2 hours agorootparentprev> At least that’s a single problem that can be reigned in. I don't understand what you're referring to. How do you recommend reigning in a newsroom? Especially one beholden to owners and advertisers with interests directly opposed to those of readers? How do you as a consumer opt out of the financial barriers to quality reporting? The only answer is the peer to peer nature of social media and the internet. Perhaps what you're missing is that traditional media has zero incentive to highlight the positives of direct communication between disparate populations, creating farcically-negative hysteria about the dangers of worldviews not beholden to giant interests (yes, including domestic and foreign state powers, but also individual entities with massive capital to throw around). reply _Algernon_ 4 hours agorootparentprev>Social media has also been enormously beneficial in terms of crippling the propaganda power of centralized, commercial media This is just plain wrong.

That is not an improvement. reply PittleyDunkin 4 hours agorootparent> Social media has moved the propaganda power to foreign hostile nations on a golden platter. I mean it's not like the power of domestic propaganda has waned, it's just in a war for the attention of the ignorant with other interests (most of which aren't foreign powers, by the way, but simply capital). Social media that enabled independent coverage and discussion is still there for the adults in the room and it would be a true loss for any society to sweep the rug out from under the people who care to look beyond the for-profit newsroom (i.e., almost all media that's readily accessible at least to americans). reply bigfudge 4 hours agorootparent> Social media that enabled independent coverage and discussion is still there for the adults in the room I'm not actually sure that's true. The only reliable sources on social media (in the sense of 'usually not horribly wrong') are actually traditional media companies like bbc, guardian. Perhaps I'm holding it wrong, but finding other trustworthy sources is actually really hard... reply alxlaz 3 hours agorootparentThis is especially untrue today, when reaching a wide, relevant audience requires significant resources, including financial -- either outright paying for sponsored places at the top of people's timelines, or paying for the expertise that delivers the right content to the right people in the right formulation. There's obviously still room for exceptions (especially in small niches, where individual content creators can still make a dent) but this isn't 2006 anymore. The vast majority of the content that covers social, political or economic issues on social media platforms is paid for and pushed by directly interested parties (political parties, companies etc.) with ample funding and is often part of campaigns that span both social media and traditional media. The \"indie\" outlook is part of the packaging. The terms of the \"paid by\" disclaimers are sufficiently generous that they're all but useless once you get past things like goodie bags for influencers or regulated campaign ads. reply PittleyDunkin 4 hours agorootparentprev> Perhaps I'm holding it wrong, but finding other trustworthy sources is actually really hard... Yes, it is hard, but there's no such thing as easy trust, and you should always be questioning whether such trust is actually earned or just comforting. I don't think the \"bbc\" or \"the guardian\" are very trustworthy, either (at least by themselves)—both have obvious polemics and blind spots. They also only cover a very narrow, western-centric view of the world, leaving you with piss-poor understanding of world politics. I'm not saying you should ignore them but they're still propaganda. Substack is invaluable; blogs are invaluable; twitter, as miserable as it is, is invaluable (for direct access to reporters sans newsrooms, if nothing else). reply EraYaN 3 hours agorootparentThey are not propaganda in the classic sense since that requires intent and a goal. reply PittleyDunkin 2 hours agorootparentSorry, why do you believe these entities have no intent nor goals? That's a very odd assumption to make. As always, I highly recommend Manufacturing Consent, which well illustrates how to examine financial interests to determine the above. Propaganda does not require conspiracy nor explicit instructions on what messages to convey; it only requires a class of people produced from the same environment, aiming to reproduce that same environment. reply johnisgood 6 hours agorootparentprevHistory should have taught us that the answer is no, the solution is not less freedom.

Do you spend much time on college campuses or around military bases? If so, you know that credit card companies and shady car dealerships loooove the newly 18 year old adults. I think that introducing people to social media right when they'll be on the hook for all their bad decisions during the exploratory period is going to result in a lot of 18-20 year olds in a ton of debt + them being even more hooked on social media than kids are now because they'll also be away from adult supervision. Imagine the sports betting ads for the newly 18. The influencers puffing up the newly 18 about how adult and mature they are and all adults buy product X, etc. They'll have no way of knowing what's normal to share and will probably overshare, but unlike minors, they'll be legally able to torpedo the rest of their lives. Etc. Making it 18 puts a target on their back for the ad and social media companies: Fresh meat that aren't entitled to any protection. That seems like a bad combination to me. reply dataflow 2 hours agoparentprev18 seems terrible.

The fact that you never grew up in the social media world highlights exactly why you don't understand the problem despite thinking you do. Your good old \"social circles being hard\" issue is not the problem here. Please understand that there are plenty of situations where someone gets invited to something if and only they are visible to others and easy to invite. i.e. there exist plenty of situations where being on the platform is the sole determining factor. And that being off the platform that the majority use puts a very significant, ongoing, and asymmetric burden on the host (or invitor, if it's a different person) to keep them posted on all the details that did not exist otherwise, and this fundamentally makes one less likely to be included, in an entirely natural and unavoidable fashion that is no fault of anyone involved, and has nothing to do with \"social circles being hard\". You have to recognize when the system is making a problem worse than it naturally is. reply dsvnasd 30 minutes agorootparent> You have to recognize when the system is making a problem worse than it naturally is. The irony. How can you be certain that it's not social media making \"problem worse than it naturally is\"? Many people believe that social media is. As someone who was not particularly visible, and was not invited to every party, I am very aware that \"there are plenty of situations where someone gets invited to something if and only they are visible to others and easy to invite\". Is \"not being on social media\" really all that different than \"not being on theteam\"? The same arguments apply. Easier to see and invite teammates, more social cache, etc. In any case, if all teens were off social media then it would not be a determining factor, and I'm sure alternative systems would emerge for inviting people to places. reply dataflow 28 minutes agorootparent> The irony.

It's crazy that all the things we considered the worst of dystopia in the 80's, thinking nobody would be stupid enough to do, and that those societies in SF books were only distant fictions, are things we are actively seeking now. Things like \"Find my\" and \"air tags\" are already beloved my millions, people use it to track loved ones and they swear by it. Even very intelligent, educated people. There is such a cognitive dissonance between people swearing the last election meant a likely dictatorship and the same people setting up a tech rope around their necks in case a dictatorship does happen. My now-dead Jewish grandfather met my grandmother during the French occupation because she was making fake papers. He would be horrified if he knew what we are doing right now with our data.

Not reliably so, and not people who are deliberately trying to fake the system. Looking at the ads FB are showing me, they are not well targetted at all. I can see an add about AI in education that seems to be aimed at teachers (not a teacher), one from a charity aimed at people with spare rooms that could be used to accommodate human trafficking survivors (I do not have a spare room), a summer school for kids who might do a history related subject at university (that one is well targetted), one advertising admin jobs at British intelligence agencies (I only just meet security requirements and I do not have relevant experience).

Saying that though, it does seem like as soon as I click one advert (either out of curiosity, or to waste obvious scam advertisers budget), I'm suddenly inundated with similar adverts.

No, but the ease of breaking the law does need to be weighed against the costs it imposes on everyone else. Carrying a driver's license is almost a non-cost, and is really only necessary til people hit 28 or so and cashiers largely stop checking. Needing to verify age online could place very real costs on people. Enabling surveillance is an issue. The chilling effect of knowing that database leaks are going to tie your real identity to your online one is an issue (think the Ashley Madison leaks, but for your old angsty teenager Reddit account). There are a lot of small groups who don't want their membership revealed, like LGBT people in countries with laws against it, domestic abuse victims, support groups for people with trauma, etc, etc. I don't think I've seen a system that doesn't involve those issues. I'm sure one is hypothetically possible, but that never seems to be a goal of these laws. So the question is whether restricting social media use by age is worth those drawbacks. My personal values say it's not, but I do recognize that's a value call to some degree and views will differ. reply xnorswap 3 hours agorootparentThose are very valid but separate concerns. You can make social media illegal for under 16s without requiring online age validation. After all, a form of this already exists with the US COPPA [1] law, and the presence of that law hasn't forced age validation on everyone. If the US can make it de-facto illegal for companies to let under 13s use social media, and has been the case for over 20 years, then it shouldn't be a sudden privacy-ending problem for Australia to make it illegal for under 16s to use social media.

The \"white stolen generations\" Did you know that in Australia there is another stolen generation, one which shares the pain and consequences? It's called the \"white stolen generation\" to distinguish it from the Aboriginal stolen generation. In the five decades up to 1982, the newborn babies of young, single women were forcibly removed from them for adoption, a practice sometimes called 'baby farming'. Mothers were drugged, tethered to beds, not allowed to see their babies, told they were dead. [54] Many of these adoptions occurred after the mothers were sent away by their families due to the stigma associated with being pregnant and unmarried. More than 250,000 white mothers lost their babies to forcible removal at birth by these past illegal adoption practices. Groups such as Adoption Loss Adult Support and Apology Alliance offer help and support. Between 2010 and 2012 apologies were offered by Western Australia, South Australia, ACT, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. Prime Minister Julia Gillard offered a national apology to those affected by forced adoptions in 2013.

If you make carriers mark all underage customers and then have the SIM forward that boolean value to the phone and nothing more, could you in theory still implement something like this without any further breach of privacy?

But at least where I'm from, you already have plans that are geared at kids, e.g. they have limits on how big their bill can be so they don't blow it up, certain services are turned off for them such as pay-per-minute calls, and so forth. Perhaps to put a different way, the carriers might not have this info right now, but it would be straightforward to implement this limit this way. Any other approach that I can think of would be both more technical work and also a bigger breach of privacy. reply michaelt 5 hours agorootparentprev> couldn't this, at least in theory, also be implemented in a way that's not so dystopian? It depends on the assumptions you're willing to make. Imagine if Australia introduces a block that works really well, and preserves privacy, but you can bypass it by using a VPN, or by rooting your phone. Would that be good enough, because only 1% of kids will figure out those bypasses? Or will the knowledge spread like wildfire until 90% of kids are using VPNs or rooting their phones?

What you can do is to construct a zero-knowledge proof of the age of the smartphone user. You can do this based on the certificate that is provisioned in modern electronic passports. The proof construction can choose to ignore expiry date, so the government can offer to issue expired passports with blank photos for the instances of people who should not have functioning passports. Then you need the social media sites to agree on a common auth mechanism that uses the zero-knowledge proof, and if the same proof gets used on multiple devices, you log out the previously used device. So even if a parent lets their kid use the parent's passport to generate the proof on the kids phone, every time the kid uses this proof, the parent gets logged out of Facebook and all other social media apps. Then no parents are going to let the kids use their ID, because of the negative impact to themselves. And you have no more means of tracking than already exists today. This also offers interesting possibilities for a startup! In the EU today, there are essentially zero legal ways for a 12-year-old to have a group chat with their friends, apart from RCS and iMessage, which then divides the friend group into two halves. Imagine then a chat app aimed specifically at group conversations for teens, where every user has a verified age. This type of app is something parents will pay good money for. reply LegionMammal978 4 hours agorootparent> Then you need the social media sites to agree on a common auth mechanism that uses the zero-knowledge proof, and if the same proof gets used on multiple devices, you log out the previously used device. > So even if a parent lets their kid use the parent's passport to generate the proof on the kids phone, every time the kid uses this proof, the parent gets logged out of Facebook and all other social media apps. Doesn't this automatically give the \"common auth mechanism\" perfect knowledge of all the parent's social media accounts, whether under a real name or a pseudonym? That sounds like an additional means of tracking. Also, what if the parent legitimately has multiple devices that they use for social media (e.g., a phone and a laptop)?

Because they weren't all that dystopian? Maybe people had the good sense of being able to see the amazing aspects of those future technologies even when the authors tried to paint them darkly? Or maybe we rightly all realized - even if just at subconscious, emotional level - that those fictional dystopias are thin, simplistic narrative devices, and \"no one would be stupid enough to\" actually implement them? What we didn't predict was adtech. For all the anti-corporate fiction that was part of, or adjacent to, science fiction of that era, the western culture is still obsessed with self-made people, glorifying entrepreneurship, making money. Well, turns out there's hardly a difference between small businesses and large corporations. The incentives are the same regardless of size; sole proprietorships and multinationals aren't some sworn enemies, they're just different size of the same thing. What we didn't realize - and many still don't - is that, while no one may be stupid enough to implement the techno-dystopia outright, many will happily do whatever it takes, no matter how unscrupulous and underhanded, to secure their income. We didn't realize that glorifying \"business sharks\" means creating an entrepreneurship culture where customers are resources to be exploited, not human beings. Iterate on it enough, and we get to techno-dystopia indirectly, with no stupid steps made on the way - just plenty of exploitative ones. Perhaps the memory of the first 3/4 of the 20th century has us put too much focus on the governments, and blind to private interests. A particular pet peeve of mine, for example: > My German ex was born in East Germany, 11 years before the fall of the Berlin Wall. She thinks people are mad to believe that tracking is not going to be abused. Yes, and at least some people who think alike also like to bring up Nazis pulling census records to make their purges more efficient. But frankly, I don't think this is a good argument against censuses, or contact tracing. It's not the census that put minorities in concentration camps, it's the Nazis. They wouldn't have stopped if that data didn't exist, they'd find some other proxy or just do it systematically, like they did elsewhere. A better argument is to perhaps not collect data you don't need. A census without religious affiliation would be less useful to Nazis and the like, and it's questionable how useful having this information was for the purposes it was collected. But my ultimate point is, when your government turns evil, you're screwed anyway. We need to try and prevent it from going bad in the first place. It may indeed involve fighting against badly justified surveillance overreach, but trying to take away tools that an okay-ish government uses for good, only because they'll be used for bad things when the government turns evil, is just self-destructive behavior. I mean, you could argue that teaching a person how to grow strength and keep a healthy body, how to read, write, plan, think, negotiate, convince, are all bad because what if that person becomes a criminal or a dictator? Yes, it would be much better if murderers and tyrants didn't know how to use a knife or a gun, or how to talk people into helping them. But we consider that risk to be worth it because of all the good it brings to everyone else, continuously. And yeah, we're all so focused on the idea of governments going full-Nazi again, that we've ignored the gradual overreach of private interests, which at this point not only actively screws with our everyday lives all the time (hello advertising industry), but also undermines our governments too. Even worse, all the \"dual-use\" tech and data private interests have, that okay-ish governments would love to access but have good sense to refrain themselves, sits there gift-wrapped for any evil government willing to reach for it. We ended up choosing the worst option of all: all the downsides of tech being abused by private interests now and evil governments in the future, with none of the upsides of okay governments using it for good today. So perhaps we should concentrate less on things like AirTags being potentially deadly in hands of the next Stalin, and focus more on fighting private and public attempts at abusing them early, while maximizing the benefits society can get from such technologies. Or, in short, let's pay less attention to how some tech could be abused in principle, and more attention to people who are trying to abuse others. reply jappgar 6 hours agoprevFunny how so many middle-aged tech workers, who were almost certainly using some primitive social media themselves as teenagers, are now in support of a full ban.

It might not even be the desired outcome to have identification, the better outcome could be to have feature Z stripped for all users (for example video feeds based on past watching behavior). reply brtkdotse 7 hours agoparentprevThere’s a near-zero chance of getting caught driving without a license.

Everybody knows the law, and a lot of people choose to break it. We can't check everybody's speed all the time, so instead we selectively enforce. The real change though comes from parent's perceptions. Right now there's age limits of 14-years-old on most social media platforms, however most parents just see this as a ToS thing, and nobody cares about actually violating it. Once it becomes law, the parents are suddenly responsible (and liable) for ensuring their children are not breaking the law by accessing social media. It's not going to stop everybody, but it'll certainly move the needle on a lot of people who are currently apathetic to the ToS of social media platforms. reply Affric 13 hours agorootparentNot true.

What's far more useful is to propose effective incentives and disincentives, and let the participants work this out for themselves. There are some useful principles and examples which come to mind: - Business is profit-oriented. Attack the basis of profits, in a readily-identifiable and enforceable way, and activity which pursues those markets will tend to dry up. - Business is profoundly risk-averse. Raise the risks of an activity, or remove protections or limitations on threads (e.g., Section 230 of the CDA in the US), and incentives to participate in that activity will be greatly reduced. Penetrating corporate and third-party veils would be particularly useful, in this case, of service providers (aiding and abetting in a proscripted commerce) and advertisers (profiting by same). Lifting any limitations on harms which might occur (bullying, induced suicides, addiction, or others) would similarly be crippling. As to how age might be ascertained: - Self-reporting. Not terribly reliable, but a decent first cut. - Profiling. There are exceedingly strong indicia of age which can be made, including based on a particular account's social graph, interests, online activity, location data (is the profile spending ~6h daily at an elementary school, and not lunching in the teacher's lounge?), etc. One strong distinction is between legislation and regulation, where the latter is imposed (usually with rulemaking process) through the executive branch (SCOTUS's Loper v. Raimondo being a phenomenally stupid rejection of that principle). Such regulation could then on a more flexible basis identify specific technical means to be imposed, reviewed, and updated on a regular schedule. - Access providers. Most people now access the Internet through either fixed-location (home, work, institutional) providers, or their own mobile access provider. Such accounts could well carry age (and other attestation) flags which online service providers could be obliged to respect as regards regulation. Jumping in before a few obvious objections: no, these mechanisms are not perfect but I'll assert they can be practically effective; and yes, there are risks for authoritarian regimes to abuse such measures, but then, those are already abusing present mechanisms. I'd include extensive AdTech-based surveillance in that, which is itself ripe for abuse and has demonstrated much of this already. (That said, I'd welcome rational \"what could possibly go wrong\" discussion.) reply Hilift 8 hours agoparentprevRemember the Silicon Valley episode where they would have been fined $21 billion for not verifying the age of PiperChat users?

Looks really bad for you if it makes the newspaper.

    "originBody": "Are you helping a loved one with daily tasks, medical care, or emotional support? If so, you’re a caregiver…and you’re not alone. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 1 in 5 adults in the United States are now caregivers, and the number is growing as the population ages. Caregiving can be an extremely rewarding experience, but it can also be physically and emotionally draining. Whether you’re supporting an aging parent, a spouse with a chronic illness, or a friend recovering from surgery, it’s easy to be so focused on their needs that you forget about your own. But here’s the thing: if you’re exhausted, easily agitated, feeling disconnected from others, or unable to take care of your own needs—if you don’t “fill your own cup”—you can’t give your loved one your best care. Your health matters Caregivers often put their own health on the back burner. Research shows that caregivers are at a greater risk for chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and depression. That’s why it’s so important to pay attention to your own health needs. It’s not always easy to recognize when you’re pushing yourself too hard, so keep an eye out for these signs: Do you feel constantly tired or overwhelmed? Are you getting irritated easily? Are you having trouble sleeping? Have you lost interest in activities you used to enjoy? Are you experiencing frequent headaches or other physical problems? If any of this sounds familiar, it might be time to focus on self-care. Preventing and managing caregiver stress Many caregivers struggle with guilt around taking time for themselves. But remember, taking care of yourself isn’t selfish; it’s necessary for your health and well-being, which directly benefits the person you’re caring for. Here are some tips from the National Institute on Aging and the National Cancer Institute to help you take care of your own physical and mental health while being there for someone else: 1. Let others lend a hand As a caregiver, you might feel like you have to do it all. But you’re not in this alone. Reach out to friends and family for help, and don't be afraid to say yes when someone offers support. Be specific about what you need. Maybe a friend could pick up groceries or a family member could sit with your loved one for an hour while you take a break. Many people want to help—they just might not know how. 2. Take time to recharge Try to do something for yourself every day. You could read a chapter of a book you enjoy, practice deep breathing or meditation, or meet up with a friend. Even if it’s just a short walk or a few minutes of quiet time, stepping away from caregiving responsibilities can help recharge your batteries. 3. Prioritize your own health One of the most important parts of self-care is taking care of your own health. This includes being active, eating a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and getting enough sleep. It’s also important to keep up with your own medical appointments and screenings. Make sure your doctor knows about your caregiving role and tell them how you’ve been feeling (both physically and mentally). 4. Be gentle with yourself It’s common to experience a wide range of emotions as a caregiver. You might feel frustrated, sad, resentful, joyful—all in the same day or even in the same hour! These feelings are a normal part of the caregiving experience, and it’s okay to express them. 5. Recognize when it’s time for a break If you’re feeling overwhelmed, consider speaking with a counselor or your doctor. They can offer resources and support to help you manage these feelings. Respite care, which offers short-term relief for primary caregivers, may also be an option. Services can range from a few hours of in-home help to a short stay with your loved one at their care facility. Respite care gives caregivers time to rest, travel, or spend time with other family and friends. 6. Connect with other caregivers Caregiver support groups can be a great way to talk about your experience with people who understand what you’re going through. Your health care provider or local senior center may be able to recommend a group in your area. Self-care might seem overwhelming right now, and that’s okay. You don’t have to tackle everything at once. Even small steps can make an enormous difference in your well-being…and your ability to care for others.

I've been taking care of my father for years. He has dementia, COPD, and a bunch of other issues. In a lot of ways it's like the pandemic never ended for us. I barely leave the house other than for trips to the grocery store and doctor's visits. It's brutal. Sadly, I'm also recognizing that as a man pushing 50, I'm not very good at asking for help. I don't. I'm also not good at maintaining strong social ties. Both of these are things I hope to get better at. It sounds so easy, but I struggle with both. Especially while managing the ups and downs of my mental health and taking care of my father. That said, I'm very grateful that none of this triggered a relapse of my drinking. That would not be good. For the most part, I use meditation and exercise to hold myself together. Sharing this doesn't excite me, but maybe there are other caregivers out there that feel the same way. And for those of you with children, please plan for how you're going to handle your late life care. reply fatnoah 20 hours agoparentFellow man pushing 50 here. I'm caring for my mom who has COPD and is starting to show signs of dementia. She lives a couple hours away and I just started a job that's 3-4 hours in the opposite direction, so I'm balancing a long-distance weekly commute along with weekly trips to cook, clean, do shopping, etc. Due to how this eats up most of my free time, it's actually made me better at squeezing \"self care\" into my schedule since it's become clear that it's not something I can defer to later, since \"later\" may not come for several years. It's not at the same level as your dealing with, so I'm writing this mostly to offer support and to be glad that you've found some activities to help center you. I do encourage you to try to find some help, even if it's just for some small part of the care, like cleaning, shopping, bathing, whatever. reply haliskerbas 20 hours agoparentprevSame here, I'm quite a bit younger but my living situation and finances are also determined by taking care of my elderly parents. It's a lot different culturally than my surrounding peers who either don't have parents as old or don't bother to care for them in the same way. It changes who I can spend time with and what I can do, and required me to grow up a lot faster than it seems like those around me. I didn't have the same amount inviting random people over, hosting house parties, or going out for drinks the same way, which I sometimes wish I got to do more of.

I’m 35 now and keep wondering how future is gonna be as I have no kids and no desire in having them (also not wishing them a life where they would have to care for me) I’m trying to keep my health up now and dedicating more time for it so I can hopefully hold the fort.

Give them space to talk, without any resistance at all from you; wrap your arms around them, physically or emotionally, and let them be and talk. Leave yourself and your ideas out of it, way out of it. As a crass comparison, it's a bit like looking at a painting or reading a book that you love - you dive into it, you leave yourself behind, you want to know more about the author, the characters, what they mean, what they are thinking ... they have nothing to do with you. Problem solving is a much different mode - those are your ideas. That has always been my instinct and I've had to learn to leave that behind. Unless someone makes clear they want it, just listen. Your S.O. doesn't need to be right or wrong - it doesn't matter. They are just very, very lonely with their condition. Imagine you have a problem that is not only awful, overwhelming and terrifying, but others condemn you for it (even though there's little you can do), ostracize you for it.

In The Myth of Normal, Gabor Maté argues that suppressing emotions, particularly anger, can weaken the immune system and lead to chronic illness, including conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS). Maté explains that repressing anger -- e.g. due to societal or familial pressure to avoid conflict or \"be nice\" -- creates internal stress, which over time harms the body’s immune response. This chronic stress actually triggers autoimmune disorders, as the immune system starts to attack the body itself. reply theGnuMe 21 hours agoparentDr K covers this as well.

I think of it as my \"second career\" and am now looking at what to do for the rest of my life as a \"third career\". As Humans with strong bonds to others it must be thought of as \"Our Duty to Do\" and in particular; Filial Duty is paramount (assuming \"normal\" Parents). Lessons learned and Advice; 1) It will be very difficult and exhausting both Mentally and Physically (we are designed to be selfish and altruism is hard). But you will have to develop \"mental attitudes and physical behaviours\" to cope with all circumstances and build up fortitude. 2) Techniques from Philosophy and Science should be employed to develop proper attitudes and behaviours. For example from Tibetan Buddhist \"Mind Training\" practices (Lojong - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojong and Tonglen - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonglen) one can train in compassion and willingness to suffer for others so that we can always maintain a positive outlook (this is key). See the book Essential Mind Training: Tibetan Wisdom for Daily Life by Thupten Jinpa for some of the original Tibetan texts. You should also read the works of Stoics Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Seneca and Cicero for developing mental strength. 3) On the physical side, set up your daily schedule around the patient's and do things together as much as possible eg. eating breakfast/etc. together, watching movies/just talking/going out/etc. together so that they never get a sense of being \"alone and abandoned\". Make sure to have a proper nutritious diet and take frequent naps/entertainment during downtime. You are not giving up \"your wants\" but merely re-scheduling it around \"somebody else's needs\". Do/Maintain proper Exercise (light and not too heavy) so that you are in good health and do not have to worry about yourself (this is key). 4) Time is finite and in order to do the above you will have to give up somethings you love and like to do. Be strict with yourself and give up all \"your wants\" which will hinder your duty and only add them in if you can make time for it without hurting the \"patient's needs\". Be clear in communicating your duties to others(friends etc.) so that they understand your situation and can maybe help as needed. You have to establish a new equilibrium with your environment. 5) Periodically you will fail in your caregiving and blame them/others (we are selfish animals after all) but that is ok as long as it does not become frequent and a pattern/habit. Catch yourself slipping on \"your duty\" and get back on track and show you mean it with extra care talk/action. Finally; always remember that nothing can overwhelm you unless and until you allow it to. Everything can be managed with knowledge, action and discipline. reply Baeocystin 13 hours agoparentSeconding the Stoic recommendation. Meditations got me through a lot of rough patches.

A lot of this money will land in the laps of the usual regional monopolies. But a lot of it is going to wind up in the hands of local community-owned networks, which is a dramatic policy shift from years past. Give $10M to a city clerk and tell them “that’s network infrastructure money. Make good use of it.” You think they’ll go “I know what to do: I’ll organize a community owned broadband service and manage its cashflow and operations in addition to my normal job duties, and be responsible that this new shop doesn’t go belly-up”? Of course not. They’ll contact the experts responsible for the current broadband provisions, namely the incumbents, and tell them to make good use of the money and provide proof good enough for the already bribed Congress members in charge that they will not feel forced to ask questions.

It was just people had set up their own hubs and switches in their appartment buildings and strung cables between buildings. This blew my mind. They just ran themselves ethernet and everyone got a drop from a switch in their building. It wasn't clear how it got from a neighborgood level upstream. But just the idea that they could all just decide to give themselves internet, and ethernet no less, string ethernet outside the walls of their own appartments to other appartments, and outside the building from one building to another? Unimaginable in the US. I was boggled and jealous. reply swatcoder 1 hour agoparent> Unimaginable in the US. Not at all. Even in the US, rural folk have been beaming directional wifi to each other for a couple decades now (at least), and sharing utilities by personally running electrical, coax, telephone, or ethernet throughout a shared building or across houses stretches back for as long as those services have been available. Sharing (\"stealing\") Cable TV by just running coax around was huge before those systems transitioned from simply using sometimes-encrypted broadcasts to a more authenticated/addressable scheme. For decades, party lines (for the telphone) were both official installations from the telephone company and de facto local networks run by one's handy neighbors. Countless people punched ethernet between walls in apartment units just the way you describe to share upstream connections. Same goes for power in squatted urban units or among trailers/shacks where they would be clustered tightly. What made it unfamiliar to you (and perhaps many here) was probably just the class and finances of your family and the people they mingled with. reply iforgot22 6 minutes agorootparentI've seen this in remote areas in the US too. There's a broadband ISP, but they only connect to one house for some reason, even though others would be willing to pay.

As soon our telecom started providing DSL - we (neighbourhood kids) got a commercial DSL into my apartment and shared it between 2 five story apartment buildings. Our set up was tiny and not very reliable. Some local networks like this grew and became almost proper internet providers. But they continued this gray practice of pulling cables in the air, between buildings. They'd also do other sketchy stuff like installing hubs/switches into electrical boxes and tapping supply from the building.

But the complexity is an effect, not a cause or really the problem. The problem is that they are going to make sure that a particular unsafe product or unsafe use of a product, that is known to be unsafe in other jurisdictions and banned, will not be stopped if subverting the legislation costs less than doing the unsafe thing will benefit. I think specifically for Grenfell that the fact that the material was banned for that usage elsewhere created the pressure to lobby to maintain that unsafe usage in Britain. If they hadn't been able to sell it as cladding, they probably would have had to shut down production of it altogether. And iirc it still would probably have been safe enough if it hadn't had a horrible corner cut installation that resulted in leaving flammable trash behind the cladding, and gaps. This was not a design failure for difficult to devise regulation, this was a government failure, fueled by multiple layers of corruption. Putting it on the wording of the regulations, and implying that the problem is that regulations are inherently hard to write is just an apology for the guilty. If anything, the difficulty of writing a lot of legislation is the difficulty of making it ineffective for the thing that it is purporting to regulate, but can't, because you've been bribed in some way. It's like the difficulty of writing RFPs that will only apply to a particular company that you've already agreed to award a contract to. It leads to complexity. There's a reason why political jobs where you get to award contracts or write legislation cost more to get than they pay. > Same with VW and dieselgate.

Around here we have had THREE separate companies drop fiber in the last year (technically not to everyone's house as they only do that last connection when you subscribe) - so my yard now has five fiber lines through it.

It's a perfect alignment of incentives and a huge win for customers, so naturally ISPs fiercely oppose it and look to immediately crush any move in that direction whenever they can. reply nickff 1 hour agorootparentIt's not a perfect alignment because it gives the government monopoly power, to raise the price, decrease the service level, and reduce consumer surplus. That said, you can also make the case that governments (in most places) already have that power because of their permitting powers, and ownership of many poles or conduits. reply eqvinox 1 hour agorootparentThe term \"monopoly\" doesn't really make sense for a government, they don't operate in a commercial/economic space where 2 governments could compete with each other. Also luckily a lot of us live in democracies where you have at least some degree of control over what the government does. (Edit: eh, I'm too tired, I guess you're arguing there is a monopoly on last-mile infrastructure then, which theoretically doesn't need to be a monopoly. Okay. In most cases it's a monopoly anyway because \"over-building\" existing last-mile connectivity won't be used by everyone and is thus less profitable.) reply nickff 41 minutes agorootparentYour edit caught my meaning; I should have been more clear. There's always less profit potential where there is more competition, which is one reason why people suggest that monopolies are capable of providing higher-quality products (and services). Interestingly, some local governments are known (or at least have historically) to use their permitting powers to extract significant amounts of money from telecoms and others. I am not really sure what to do about this, but in the early days of power poles, few/no permits were required to use them, and there were many power providers sharing the same poles; it was messy, and contributed to unreliability, but it worked and allowed for competition. reply bwanab 45 minutes agoprevI really hate to make a political connection here, but it's hard not to notice that of those states exactly one didn't vote for the current President-elect. reply ensignavenger 3 hours agoprevMissouri's law was \"reinterpreted\" to allow broadband networks.

When people debate this, they often are thinking of the first class of protective regulations that are too onerous on companies, but I think most people like clean drinking water and rivers that no longer catch fire. Whereas the second class of protection is really harmful to the consumer, and the powers-that-be have effectively been given a monopoly, and with that the money and power to protect their place in the market through continued influence on elections and other things to maintain these rent seeking businesses.

But installing and maintaining a wire to everyone's house is also very expensive. IMHO, it's a question of capacity and acceptable service levels. Starlink monthly pricing is higher than my DSL and nearby cable as well as my local muni fiber. But it's not so much higher as to rule it out. And the install fee is a lot lower than muni fiber. It's going to take a long time to get ROI on my installation cost for the muni fiber if I compare monthly cost to Starlink.

I can’t fathom how many satellites it would take to support all the internet users as a monopoly. reply toast0 50 minutes agorootparentFair enough; I didn't read your comment very closely, I guess. Terrestrial radio seems a lot less expensive in areas with population. When you get out beyond rural and more into wilderness, satellite is likely cost competitive, because having a LEO constellation cover the wilderness comes at no additional cost, and having radio coverage in the wilderness involves setting up base stations with low usage --- you can do some things with longer range / larger cells, but it depends on terrain and maybe protocol limits?

Putting that on a single fiber wavelength is mature enough to be firmly in SOHO/homelab territory these days (e.g. QNAP and Mikrotik both have 25Gbps switches that are about $1000). It looks like commodity CWDM mux/demux boxes can cram 16 of those into a single fiber. It's safe to assume that the big guys like Comcast and CenturyLink/Lumen can get equipment capable of far more than that. reply YetAnotherNick 4 hours agorootparentprevThe bigger concern is the latency. Even if some technical progress increases the bandwidth, latency is bounded by speed of light and couldn't be as low as cable. reply larkost 45 minutes agorootparentThe low-earth orbit generally means that this is not as big of an issue as in older satellite technologies. Currently if you are in an area where the satellite does not need to bounce your data through one or more other satellites before hitting a ground station they are in the tens of milliseconds of latency (20-60). Comcast is generally in the 20-30 neighborhood, unless you are using their gigabit service, then it is more like 10-15 milliseconds. So it is higher, but not debilitatingly so (unless your application is very sensitive to latency). I would imagine there is a lot more jitter in Starlink, but that is more a feel than real numbers. Mainly on a terrestrial system you wind up bouncing through more substations on the way to the general Internet, whereas with Starlink you are generally bouncing straight from your dish to the satellite to the base station. So less bounces, but farther to go. The physics favors the wire, but not as much as it used to. reply badgersnake 4 hours agorootparentprevPretty obviously not, theoretically you could have tens of terrabits per fibre core.

Do you have any resources on getting started with Dreamcast game reverse engineering? I've been wanting to do some things with Skies of Arcadia, and I've been hoping there exist techniques more systematic than \"see what values change between memory snapshots\". reply coldpie 2 hours agoparent> I've been hoping there exist techniques more systematic than \"see what values change between memory snapshots\". FWIW this is pretty much the standard method for locating value locations in RAM. It actually works pretty well. Some emulators have tools built in for that, like Dolphin for example. Even old game hacking tools like the Gameshark for N64 used the technique, with an on-console UI. I don't know if any Dreamcast emulators have tools for it or not. I wrote about the technique in Dolphin here (and the followup article is also about console game hacking with Ghidra): https://www.smokingonabike.com/2021/01/17/hacking-super-monk... reply AdmiralAsshat 1 hour agorootparent> Some emulators have tools built in for that, like Dolphin for example. This was an advertised feature of some DS flashcarts back in the day, too. I can't remember if it was the R4, the DSTwo, or what...but I recall an example video for their \"Make your own cheats!\" feature, which involved playing something like Super Mario Bros, turning on the \"Cheats Finder\" feature, then grabbing a coin, and maybe doing it a few times. The manager would then figure out the value that's changing in memory (presumably the sector that stores your coin amount), create the \"cheat\", and then you would enable it and watch your coin value go up. reply bbayles 2 hours agoparentprevI've poked around a bit with that game! The main trick is to import the memory snapshot (various ways of dumping it to a file; people like Cheat Engine for this) into Ghidra. Ghidra can analyze the SuperH processor machine code natively, so the auto analysis will turn up lots of functions. reply fanoto 1 hour agoprevNice! Interesting how similar games seem to do this, checksumming to fixed integers. Pitfall: The Lost Expedition did something very similar by converting button presses into ASCII-represented strings of the input buttons that were then CRC-ed. The approach was similar to just brute-force in Python and compare to the extracted cheat hashes. I even spy your CRC32 table hidden in the `decrypted_ints` . The pre-generated tables are so easily searchable. It leaves me curious why they are so often found obfuscated in attempt to make it more difficult compared to generating a new one with your own polynomial. reply mytaterskin 1 hour agoprevI've taken to older games a lot more in recent years, they feel like they have a lot more soul if that makes any sense.

For anyone that beat the games. You go from swimming in an ocean to flying with aliens. It's bizarre. Some people classify it as a horror game. reply deemster 2 hours agoparentThe name of the game probably comes from dolphins echolocation ability. Another explanation I like to entertain is that the name is a reference to John C Lilly. He was a scientist who believed in an alien organization called the Earth Coincidence Control Office or E.C.C.O. He also studied dolphin intelligence and communication. He gave dolphins LSD in an effort to communicate with them. John C Lilly is an interesting rabbit hole to go down. reply nelup20 2 hours agoparentprevMy favorite aspect is the music, I regularly listen to the OST while working: https://youtu.be/tqMuvFEKCOk I've played a decent amount (never finished it), but I never understood why people say it's a horror game? reply bbayles 2 hours agorootparentA friend of mine explained that there are overlapping phobias of water and deep dark spaces that this game triggers; he said it's unbearable to play the later levels. reply Spoom 1 hour agorootparentI'd imagine anyone with claustrophobia would struggle with the last couple levels as well since they're essentially a battle against the screen crushing you. reply nelup20 2 hours agorootparentprevI just checked what the final boss looks like, combined with the phobias... glad I didn't finish the game as a kid. Thanks for the article, great read! reply bbayles 2 hours agoparentprevIt really is a game with a strange mix of aesthetics. Blue skies and bright colors in the early levels; suspense and dread and supernatural stuff in the later levels.

I wonder if those devs had source access. reply j0hnyl 2 hours agoprevI wish there was more detail on \"how\" this was done as opposed to just the \"what\" reply nostoc 2 hours agoparentIt's very much the \"how\", what were you looking for that's not explained in the blog post? reply j0hnyl 1 hour agorootparent--- By analyzing a memory snapshot from the flycast emulator, I found that the buffer at 8cfffb34 holds the visible portion of the initials you type in. But if you keep typing, the characters you put in before get pushed into the buffer at 8c3abf18. After loading the memory snapshot into Ghidra, I found that the function at 8c0334d8 reads this buffer. It performs a transformation on the buffer and then checks whether the transformed value is a list of six special ones. --- How? reply frakt0x90 1 hour agorootparentI don't know exactly how flycast works but I've done similar things with other emulators and you take an action in the game (take damage, type something), then search memory for that value. In this case the ascii code for the letter typed. Keep doing this until you've narrowed down a single block of memory that holds everything you've done reply bt1a 3 hours agoprevim curious about the process to find that initial buffer address - does that involve entering a few different strings and searching the memory snapshot for those byte patterns ? reply bbayles 3 hours agoparentYeah, exactly! I took a couple memory snapshots of the name \"AAA\" and then threw out all of the addresses that had values that didn't match the first snapshot. Then I changed it to \"BBB\" and threw out all the addresses that did match. There's a program called Cheat Engine that can make this a point and click thing; that's usually how people find GameShark-style codes. reply 29athrowaway 1 hour agoprevIs not this against the Ghidra EULA? reply yjftsjthsd-h 1 hour agoparentWhat EULA?

By Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. Nov 6, 2024, 7:29 PM UTC Share this story Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge Microsoft is adding AI-powered text editing to Notepad, the stripped-down text editor originally introduced in 1983. The feature, called Rewrite, is rolling out in preview to Windows Insiders and will let you use AI to “rephrase sentences, adjust tone, and modify the length of your content,” according to the Windows Insider Blog. If you’re a Windows Insider with early access to the feature, you can try it by highlighting the text you want to adjust in Notepad, right-clicking it, and choosing Rewrite. Notepad will then display a dialogue box where you can decide how they want to change their text — for example, if it needs to be longer or shorter. Rewrite will then offer three rewritten versions that you can replace your work with. You can try out Rewrite by highlighting and right-clicking the text you want to change in Notepad. Image: Microsoft It’s worth noting that you’ll have to sign in to your Microsoft account to use Rewrite, as it’s “powered by a cloud-based service that requires authentication and authorization.” Microsoft is launching this feature in preview on Windows 11 in the US, France, UK, Canada, Italy, and Germany. In July, Microsoft finally upgraded Notepad with spell check and autocorrect. Paint’s Generative Fill feature can insert an image based on a prompt. GIF: Microsoft Along with bringing Rewrite to Notepad, Microsoft will let Insiders start testing the new AI image editing tools in Paint previewed last month. The Generative Fill feature allows you to make additions to an image based on a prompt, while the Generative Erase can remove part of an image and blend in the empty space left behind. Generative Fill will “initially” roll out to testers with Copilot Plus PCs, but Generative Erase will be available to all Insiders on Windows 11.

It depends on the company. If you work for a hyper-scale tech company that only cares about money money money, then yeah -- nobody's getting promoted for improving core functionality.

That's probably a reason why competitors like onX have sprung up recently. (Although I haven't used onX so I don't know if it's actually better or not.) Also with Gaia it feels like very single year they just have to tweak and change the interface to the point where nothing is easy or intuitive anymore.

This is true for all complex software, though. People who have never used Apple's software also struggle with it until they become more familiar. reply dmurray 30 minutes agorootparentIs VLC really \"complex software\" if you just want to use it as a media player? Double click your media file, it plays. Play, pause, volume controls are where you'd guess they are. There's plenty of complexity underneath, but the happy path is simple. By contrast, \"open this image and draw a single red circle in it\" in GIMP is as challenging to a newbie as quitting vi. Even for an intermediate user - I use GIMP a handful of times per year and I absolutely could not tell you from memory how to do that. reply noch 2 minutes agorootparent> Is VLC really \"complex software\" The moment you criticize an app, someone on the Internet will jump in to tut-tut and insist to you that it's \"complex software\" and you can't possibly understand how complex it is. Case in point: Just a few years ago the Windows Terminal team chastised[^1] users by claiming that fast font rendering would literally require several PhDs of research and can't be solved otherwise[^0].

The problem is that this can make it ambiguous whether edits have been saved to the file or not and even someone reopening the file to verify that they remembered to save the information will be fooled into thinking its there. reply sfjailbird 10 minutes agorootparentSounds like a potential compliance issue too, if you work with sensitive data. reply JohnFen 38 minutes agorootparentprevI absolutely hate this feature.

Ask the AI for an example of a linked list, and it will give you one, but the sample items in the list will be Coca-Cola, Lexus, the name of the closest marijuana dispensary, etc. If anyone wonders why Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and other tech companies who make gobs of money from advertising are so interested in AI, this is why. The ads will appear so \"naturally\" inside content that it will be impossible for a program (e.g. adblocker) to tell the difference between the content and the ad.

There has, for a number of years, been a move away from Windows to macOS and Linux for devs. I suspect this will start to accelerate because people don't want tools that are obnoxiously omnipresent.

These are people who are missing valuable business insights or who are working on novel solutions and include many developers. Those are the ones who will struggle with relevance going forward. Equally, large corporations are at significant risk if the productivity of a single person increases further.

Being jaded and cynical about it doesn't change that reality. Obviously there will be winners and losers and it will shake out -- personally I can't imagine using notepad for more than pasting arbitrary text and it seems like the least features is the best -- but bonafide text tools without AI in 2024 are crippling. reply croes 57 minutes agorootparentIf AI is so powerful why don’t we see a massive productivity spike around the globe? It may be convenient but more than once just replaced the time I needed to write my code by time fine tuning the prompt because the AI didn’t quite got what I wanted. On top of that I must review foreign code. That’s harder than code I already know. And on top of that the end result lacks the feeling of accomplishment in solving a problem because it wasn’t me who wrote it. I‘m degraded to some kind customer of the AI.

We overestimate the short term effects and underestimate the long term effects. We're currently in the trough of disillusionment where people are running around saying that AI failed, was overblown, etc, while people like me are working with corporations to completely change how they operate, to an outrageous efficiency boost. Our world is going to look very different in a decade. >It may be convenient but more than once just replaced the time I needed to write my code by time fine tuning the prompt because the AI didn’t quite got what I wanted Most software developers spend very little of their time actually \"coding\", and most of their time investigating, understanding, comparing, and so on. I have never used AI for \"production\" code -- I never copy/paste something into my code -- but dozens of times a day I do use it to get rough outlines, investigate libraries and their use, and most importantly to get heuristics on paths to take in the code I do write.

I've done embedded development, did interactive web applications before almost anyone, have published papers and magazine articles, and have an extremely rich resume across many languages and platforms, with a long history of wins. Yeah, I'm pretty good at this stuff. And I find \"AI\" extremely useful to my life. I have subscriptions across multiple products, and at this moment am building a Jina v3 embedding system for an insurance company.

Those are not new or unusual features for a text editor. reply horsawlarway 3 hours agorootparentOn the one hand - sure. On the other - the whole appeal of notepad was that it was a barebones text editor with none of that fluff (aka - it's a text editor, not a word processor or IDE). MS has a large number of alternatives for the folks who wanted them. When I opened Notepad - it's explicitly because I don't want the machine trying to tell me what I entered is wrong, or fix it. I just want a big dumb textbox for my file. --- Basically - If you wanted those features you're looking for MS Word or Wordpad. But MS discontinued Wordpad, and now they seem intent on trying to turn Notepad into Wordpad 2.0. My prediction is this will not work well, since it directly competes with Office, and is not what the legacy users of notepad want.

It was supposedly worth all the power expenditure, because changing the world needed energy. Now we see where we are. I'm inside this \"newfangled AI thing\". There are groups which create value, but they create value for everybody. The humans and the nature in general, and they use AI for scientific ends. Medical image processing, ecosystem monitoring, etc. etc. Letting bots loose on the internet, letting them consume what they say and making them answer \"Sauce is a food taste enhancer, and dressing is used to keep wounds clean while allowing them to heal. A standard serving of a dressing is two spoons\". reply msabalau 3 hours agorootparentIn terms of generative AI, for general use cases, Open AI reported having 11 million paid subscribers last quarter. People clearing paying for Adobe Firefly and Midjourney access. That's already a ton more people finding it useful in day to day life than Crypto ever had. It is certainly reasonable to suspect that the scale of investments (in trillions of dollars) don't match the scale of the opportunity. But it's a bit silly to pretend that no one is getting any value out of this. At the end of the day, data centers are 2% of energy use, according to the IEA. That's trending up, but even in couple of years, data center stuff is mostly going to be typical cloud stuff, then crypto, and then a fraction for AI. reply devjab 4 hours agorootparentprevI never heard of any reasonable uses for Crypto or Blockchain in general. A lot of people tried to sell us various things at the time but it was very obvious that it had no real value. AI is already implemented into businesses in various ways. Even if it’s not done so official you still have loads of employees pouring company secrets into chatGPT and Claude because they work. reply turtles3 9 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair, newer research is demonstrating that smaller more power efficient models with the same performance are possible, so the hope is that these giant LLMs are just a stepping stone to a less energy hungry place. In contrast, proof of work fundamentally needs more energy then bigger the network gets. It's no guarantee but we can at least see some hope that as energy impact drops and increasing value is found that 'AI' will cross the threshold of being worth the energy. Edit: although yes I do agree that the 'value' part is tricky. If internet spam can generate more 'value' for some people than doing science, then when intelligence is cheap we are in for a rough time. reply bayindirh 9 hours agorootparentTo be clear, I'm not against AI or LLM as a technology in general. What I'm against is the unethical way how these LLMs trained and how people are dismissive of the damage they're doing and saying \"we're doing something amazing, we need no permission\". Also, I'm very aware that there are many smaller models in production which can run real-time with negligible power and memory requirements (i.e. see human/animal detection models in mirrorless cameras, esp. Sony and Fuji). However, to be honest I didn't see the same research on LLMs yet. Can you share if you have any, because I'd be glad to read them. Lastly, I'm aware that AI is not something only covers object detection, NLP, etc. You can create very useful and light AI systems for many problems, but how LLMs pumped with that unstopping hype machine bothers me a lot. reply maccard 9 hours agorootparentprevI disagree. Crypto people kept suggesting that crypto was a solution to an X problem while ignoring that a database was a better solution the problem. I’ve yet to hear any good use cases for crypto, and I’ve been asking for years on here. Meanwhile there are a bunch of AI tools out there that are working and helping. reply bayindirh 9 hours agorootparentAI is a gigantic landscape with tons of different applications to different problems, and there are many solutions which work for a given problem. However, if we narrow what AI is to LLMs, we have a stochastic parrot which needs to be fed the world literally to enable it to create semi-coherent sentences about something being asked. More importantly, what that parrot says doesn't have to be true, it can't be guaranteed to be true, and can't be verified about its accuracy about its slop. And you spend gigawatts of power just to train this thing which selects and prints words based on probability and some randomness. That doesn't solve any problems. reply lukeschlather 4 hours agorootparentI think it's premature to be integrating LLMs into operating systems. That said I think they're very valuable, and the training is fundamental research. I feel like complaining about the resources used to train new models is a bit like complaining about the resources used to build experimental fusion reactors or particle accelerators. The fact that we're seeing direct applications is a bonus, but it's still more like fundamental research than anything. People are spending all that money training because they are trying to fix the problems you're complaining about, and this includes fixing the power consumption problem. If we can create 3B parameter models that have capabilities on par with today's 405B parameter models, that's worth spending a lot of energy training. But nobody knows what is possible, so they have to try. I feel like you're basically arguing nobody should try because you don't believe they will ever improve, but that seems contradicted by the general trajectory of how things have been working the past decade. More resources spent on training means more efficient and useful models. reply maccard 7 hours agorootparentprevYou've moved the goalposts from AI to LLM's. Fair enough, we've been doing AI since the 50's, and this is the second AI boom in a decade. Those \"stochastic parrots\" have still proven that they are immensely useful. You might not personally find value out of coding assistants, but many many people do (as an example). People are (allegedly) turning to LLM's rather than StackOverflow for help [0]. They work well for boilerplate where you're an SME and able to validate the output - I can review 10x the amount of code I can write for example. They work (remarkably) well for summarising input text. An example - I semi occasionally (3-4x per year) have to deal with a few hundred GB of audio files that need cleanup. The cleanup tasks are \"run FFMPEG with parameters\", except I can not ever remember the parameters (they're different for different things). I can: read https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html or I can ask ChatGPT to write a script to clip the silence and add a 0.5 second intro fade to every file in a specified folder, and the entire task is done before I've even thought about it. I get to focus on what I want to, rather than munging data around. If you expand your definition from LLMs to Transformers, then you get Whisper as a stand out example of something awesome. There's definitely negatives, but things like Diffusion are being used outside of image generation for drug discovery. We're not going to yolo AI generated drugs into human testing, but we can save an awful lot of screwing around to find something viable. > And you spend gigawatts of power just to train this thing which selects and prints words based on probability and some randomness. > That doesn't solve any problems.

Rather than going out and doing market research you just throw things against the wall, measure and see if people are using it at any significant rate. The difference between Google and Microsoft is that Google have no problems just killing of things that doesn't perform to their standard (which is bad in it's own way). With Microsoft backwards compatibility is everything, so once something is in Windows, it says around for a very, very, long time. AI assistance in writing isn't a bad idea, but maybe not in Notepad. I know that this isn't they way modern Microsoft wants to do things, but exposing an API that would allow 3rd. party vendors to AI support in Windows seems like a more sensible approach.

    "originLink": "https://xy2i.blogspot.com/2024/11/using-imhexs-pattern-language-to-parse.html",
    "originBody": "xy2's blog Wednesday, November 6, 2024 Visualizing binary files with ImHex's DSL, the \"pattern language\" Viewing my binary file with ImHex. The pattern language pane, on the right, provides the highlighting and data on the left. I've got a binary file with a custom made binary format, and a spec for that binary format. How do I go into the binary quickly and see the data I want ? This is a problem I ran into while writing some software that operates on this data. Before, my approach would have probably been to write some Python code to parse the format, following the spec carefully and see where it diverges. Recently though, I heard about ImHex, an hex editor with advanced features, and decided to give it a go. The feature I used the most in ImHex for my case was the integrated DSL, the \"pattern language\". It lets you define structures that ImHex will match on, and decode the data. The syntax is a mix of C++ and Rust, but with unique semantics and a lot of nice affordances. Many examples that follow will be my real code for parsing the SWF file format. An overview of the pattern language Here's a pattern which parses a char, followed by the \"WS\" string in memory, an unsigned byte, and a four byte number after: import type.magic; struct Header { char compressionSignature; type::Magic signature; u8 swfVersion; u32 bytesSize; }; Header h @ 0x0; In ImHex, there are two steps to patterns: first, you define the variable that you want to place, with a type. This can be one of the many primitive types, like u8, char, an array, or a compound type, like a struct or a bitfield. then, you can place that variable somewhere in memory, using the @ address syntax. Placing the pattern at 0x0 in memory. ImHex fills out the data in the Pattern Data pane, and shows the value in the types you chose. Patterns can be made more complex, nesting structs, or if you don't have a spec of your data and are reverse engineering, you can progressively place things, until you make more sense of it. Logic in patterns A value may exist or not based on a previous value, or even be sized differently based on a prior value that tells you the size. When parsing SWFs, I encountered this case with a bitfield, where the first field decides the size of the remaining fields. These cases are easy to write, since in the pattern language, you can reuse previous values, even if it's declared in the same structure: bitfield Rect { // First field has a size of 5 bits nSize : 5; // The remaining fields have a size of nSize bits, // based on the value of nSize. signed xMin : nSize; signed xMax : nSize; signed yMin : nSize; signed yMax : nSize; }; You can even put conditionals and other logic constructs inside. Here there are two fields indicating the length of a structure, of different size, and the second one exists only if the first has some magic value: bitfield RecordHeaderShort { Length: 6; Tag Tag: 10; }; struct RecordHeader { // Including a structure inside another one RecordHeaderShort short; // Defines a variable, that does not show up in the view, // but can be accessed like a field Tag Tag = short.Tag; u32 len = short.Length; if (short.Length == 0x3f) { u32 LongLength; len = LongLength; } }; I defined a variable len that's present on this structure, but doesn't show up in the ImHex view. It is accesible however if RecordHeader is nested in another struct, so it's useful for getting the real length, without duplicating the logic each time. Match statements This feature is neat. First let's define a enum: enum Tag: u8 { End = 0, ShowFrame = 1, SetBackgroundColor = 9, DoAction = 12, FileAttributes = 69, Metadata = 77, }; Now I can use a Rust like match statement to match on the values extensively, defining values in the struct based on the matched value: struct TagRecord { RecordHeader RecordHeader; // see above match (RecordHeader.Tag) { // To define a field, you can also just declare its type, // there is no need to name it. This declares a field // of type `SetBackgroundColor`. (Tag::SetBackgroundColor): SetBackgroundColor; (Tag::DoAction): DoAction; (Tag::FileAttributes): FileAttributes; (Tag::Metadata): Metadata; // The `padding` keyword is treated specially by the language: // Creates a padding, with its length set to // a field of the RecordHeader structure. This will not show up in // the pattern view, because it's declared as padding. (_): padding[RecordHeader.len]; } // An attribute. In the data pane, this structure's name will be // the enum's name. } [[name(RecordHeader.Tag)]]; In the data view, each tag shows up with the enum's name. Array stop conditions An issue I encountered was that my file format is just an array of TagRecords, until the end of the file. This means there is no length: and using a null terminated array doesn't work, since there are tags with null values. Thankfully, the pattern language has support for custom stop conditions, using a \"loop sized array\": struct File { Header; // This function returns true when // the end of the file has been reached TagRecord Tags[while(!std::mem::eof())]; }; ImHex also has a special $ (dollar) operator, which always points to the current offset in the file. This variable is even modifiable inside your pattern to change the position. One good use for this is a loop sized array like this one, that will stop on a 0xFF value: u8 string[while(std::mem::read_unsigned($, 1) != 0xFF)]; Decompressing files inside ImHex directly Most SWF files in the wild come compressed, with a non trivial decompression procedure, which means my pattern can't be applied directly: I need a decompression step first. In the past I would have reached for a Python script to decompress the file with the custom logic needed. But the pattern language also supports this case, and has built-in decompression functions, as well as a virtual file system to store the output file: struct Compressed { // Create a section in memory for the decompressed contents. Only contents // starting from a certain offset are compressed UncompressedHeader h; std::mem::Section decompressed = std::mem::create_section(\"Zlib decompressed\"); u8 compressedContents[std::mem::size() - 8] @ 0x8; // Do the actual decompression. hex::dec::zlib_decompress(compressedContents, decompressed, 15); // Combine both the uncompressed header and decompressed part to recreated // the full decompressed file. std::mem::Section full = std::mem::create_section(\"Full decompressed SWF\"); std::mem::copy_value_to_section(h, full, 0x0); std::mem::copy_section_to_section(decompressed, 0x0, full, 0x8, h.decompressedSize - 8); // Write decompressed flag, so next time we open the pattern knows it's decompressed std::mem::copy_value_to_section(\"Z\", full, 0x0); // Write this file to the virtual file system. u8 d[h.bytesSize] @ 0x00 in full; builtin::hex::core::add_virtual_file(std::format(\"dec-{}\", hex::prv::get_information(\"file_name\")), d); std::warning(\"This SWF is ZLib-compressed, grab the decompressed save fromthe Virtual Filesystem tab and use this pattern on it.\"); }; struct Main { char compressed @ 0x0; match (compressed) { ('C'): Compressed; ('Z'): File; } }; By running this pattern once, the resulting file ends up in a new tab, in ImHex's \"virtual filesystem\". The decompressed file in the virtual file system Conclusion Overall I was very impressed by the pattern language. Not only does it make my task much simpler, it also is well thought out for the tasks it sets out to do,, both in its design and in its day to day conveniences. However, currently the language doesn't have a lot of documentation or tutorials to get started. Thankfully it was easy to get started with some help, the developers on discord are very nice (and thanks again to paxcut for helping debug some issues!) Hopefully this post was interesting even if you've never had this problem before :) You can find my full code here, if you're curious of what it looks like all put together.

It wasn't the AFL status screen, it was (may have been a) third party app, and it would color code parts of the input files based on the outputs or whatever from afl's processing. For example, there was a color key that explained that say, purple meant \"magic bytes\", like \"0x4a46494600\" for JFIF0, and if any part of the input file caused errors it meant it was probably a checksum and needed to be \"fixed\" so afl could properly fuzz all the functions in the source code. I'm not super in to fuzzing or that realm anymore, so i doubt i could describe it better than i did, here. I clicked through to see if someone have leveraged the AFL stuff for use in another tool, which would be cool. edit: i think it was afl-analyze - i had a go at the source code for aflplusplus: > A nifty utility that grabs an input file and takes a stab at explaining its structure by observing how changes to it affect the execution path. > Another tool in AFL++ is the afl-analyze tool. It takes an input file, attempts to sequentially flip bytes and observes the behavior of the tested program. It then color-codes the input based on which sections appear to be critical and which are not; while not bulletproof, it can often offer quick insights into complex file formats. reply dloss 13 hours agoprevOther tools for parsing and analyzing binary data are listed here: https://github.com/dloss/binary-parsing reply rixtox 13 hours agoprevKind of related, a tool that allows you to hand write ASCII-art-annotated hex dump files, while also able to generate the original binary file from such text file: https://github.com/netspooky/xx/blob/main/examples/elf.xx reply jcul 18 hours agoprevGreat write up! I looked at ImHex a good while back and I think I had some runtime issues or maybe even compilation issues and didn't dig deeper. Even though the definition language piqued my curiosity. These days I tend to just use xxd, bless, ghex, or seldom wxHexEditor, depending on what I need. But ImHex looks really powerful, like it could replace all the GUI ones. I'm looking forward to giving it another go tomorrow. Though these days I spend most of my time in wireshark, which is kind of a hex viewer in a way. How does it manage with huge files? Does it try to load the entire thing into memory. I remember wxHexEditor being good for that, and even being able to open block devices directly and process memory IIRC. Might be getting mixed up with HxD. The decompression and combining compressed with decompressed sections looks very cool. Is the decompression in memory or written to disk? // TagRecord Tags[while(!std::mem::eof())]; This loop based length stuff is very cool too, though for large files I'd imagine it could be slow as it will need to iterate through all records to determine the offset for records at the end of the file. To be fair, wireshark / pcap files have this problem too. reply viraptor 16 hours agoparent> though for large files I'd imagine it could be slow as it will need to iterate through all records to determine the offset for records at the end of the file.

    "commentBody": "The English Paradox: Four decades of life and language in Japan (tokyodev.com)149 points by pwim 16 hours agohidepastfavorite149 comments ekusiadadus 9 hours agoI'm Japanese. Speaking English in Japan is very challenging. All my friends and family speak Japanese, and everything from social media to news is completely accessible in Japanese. I'm an entrepreneur, and I use English when talking with international clients and overseas VCs. However, I lack confidence, and the communication tends to remain superficial, making it difficult to effectively do business internationally. In this environment, it's hard to feel a real necessity to communicate in English. Since elementary school, we've been told that being able to speak English is extremely important, and I studied hard. Yet in this environment, there are rarely opportunities to actually use English. When foreigners tell us about the importance of English, they may not fully understand that it doesn't really matter much to most Japanese people. Japanese people might start speaking English when they truly need it. Rather than that, I'd be happier if AI could provide real-time translation for everything. reply germandiago 9 hours agoparentI have been a couple of times in Japan, have some Japanese friends here in Vietnam, where I live. I am spanish. In my humble opinion, japanese society is very kind and well-behaved, but, if you cannot speak japanese and you live in one more-or-less big city, according to all the feedback I got, then, you are basically out. And anyway, you will never be a japanese. I mean, there is much less difference between foreigners entering Spain, in general terms, and foreigners entering in Japan. I love Japan, but I am not sure it would be a particularly comfortable place to live since Japanese have a very traditional culture and habits, so being part of the group is not an easy task. In fact, I think you will never be a part of the group as I would understand it in spanish terms, when, for example, an argentinian or a romanian becomes in Spain over time. The japanese culture is one one of the cultures I admire the most in many aspects: disciplined, orderly... but one thing is that and a very different thing is living there and becoming fully integrated. I think that's tough. reply famahar 2 hours agorootparentThis strong need to be accepted by a whole country is something I see mentioned a lot by a particular group of people that have never really been \"othered\" in their life. Coming to Japan is quite a shock for them because they experience being a minority for the first time in their lives. I was born in Canada and have dealt with micro-aggresions and blatant racism my whole life there. Living in Japan I can say I feel no strong desire or care to be accepted. I'm not here to win over the acceptance of a country. I live my own life quietly with the small group of strong friends and community that do accept me. I'm perfectly happy and would definitely be much less happy if my goal was to be seen as Japanese (with all the rules that this also entails). Integration to me is simply respecting everyone. There really is no big song and dance needed to be seen as the \"accepted foreigner\". Just live your life. reply expatjapan121 8 hours agorootparentprev> if you cannot speak japanese and you live in one more-or-less big city, according to all the feedback I got, then, you are basically out. > And anyway, you will never be a japanese. I think you answered yourself that if you _can_ speak Japanese, things are different. The reality is that if you can speak Japanese, it's quite easy to be well integrated with the people. In your example, I don't know if the Romanian learned Spanish or everyone is speaking English but there is likely a common language. Making the reason \"traditional culture and habits\" and just not a lack of a shared language seems wrong to me, at least I feel quite integrated. Please stop telling people \"they will never be Japanese\" since it's blatantly wrong. reply helboi4 4 hours agorootparentIf you speak Japanese you will have a waaaaaay better time in Japan.

I've lived in Japan for many years and speak Japanese alright (disclaimer, that was a long time ago though, in the 90s) and now live in Germany. I travel a lot. I think what you're saying is directionally correct, but really more of a difference in degree. For example, I've often seen Asian-Germans being addressed in broken English by older Germans, even though German is their strongest language. Or being complimented on their fluent German. That's got to feel pretty \"othering\". And don't tell me the country that just elected mister Trump is as open to the world as is often claimed. This may all feel completely different if you're around the right group of people, and I imagine that's similar in Japan today, though I haven't been back in a long time. reply germandiago 7 hours agorootparentprevI am not saying your experience must be the same. According to the three japanese people in my group here and some other feedback from people living there before, same as you I guess, and they speak japanese quite ok, our conclusion is that being one more is not as easy as in other countries. I say this from the strictest respect to japanese. I like them, I like their culture. If you live there you must know perfectly that just bc they act politely does not mean they are thinking you do not bother them. A japanese would rarely tell you that. And if someone did, it is likely to do it in an indirect way, as most asians do. Japanese are in the extreme of that polite behavior. reply expatjapan121 6 hours agorootparent> If you live there you must know perfectly that just bc they act politely does not mean they are thinking you do not bother them.

You are wrong here. You will indeed never be Japanese if you haven't both 2 ethnic Japanese parents and raised in Japanese (second-generation raised abroad, for instance in South American are out). You can't rewrite all your DNA and go back in time to have a Japanese education in Japan. The real issue is why caring so much about \"becoming\" Japanese? You can integrate in Japanese society as a foreigner, and being treated as an outsider also has its perks. Typically you are not expected to follow some of the rules, and thus has less bullshit to deal with. Just be careful of not becoming too good in Japanese (or at least pretend not to be), so you can maximize the benefits of speaking Japanese while minimizing the expectations. reply Aeolun 7 hours agorootparentprevI think the OP is correct, though probably not in the way they mean. I love living in Japan, but I’ll never be able to adopt that mindset, or be able to eat all those disgusting fishes they love. That’s fine. A lot of Japanese people think it’s valuable to have different perspectives too, even if they could never convince themselves that it’s ok to just walk up to someone and ask them what their problem is. reply expatjapan121 7 hours agorootparentIIUC you are saying OP is correct in that culture exists in the world. And you are affirming that Japanese people believe this too and are fine with people that don't eat \"disgusting fishes\", like me (cooked I can't do, sashimi I'm fine). So the sentiment that somehow Japanese are incompatible for culture reasons, which is the message I got from the thread I replied to, is not correct in your opinion too, right? reply numpad0 2 hours agorootparentI kind of suspect it might be worth clarifying what a language is and how it's differentiated from culture. I've heard that honorifics works differently in Korean language e.g. for a supervisor in work situation where one is not expected to use one for his own supervisor in Japanese, while one absolutely is in Korean, and I feel that's more towards culture while also possible to include in grammatical ruleset. > cooked I can't do, sashimi I'm fine btw completely understand this. My technical brain says just pure NaCl and pure heat for a whole fish as caught with absolutely no herbs allowed is technically crazy. I hated the brown chiai regions in buri slices growing up. It's crazy that yaki-zakana, literally \"roast fish\" is one of characteristic dish of the country. reply germandiago 6 hours agorootparentprevI think you got wrong what I said. I said that becoming part of a group of japanese people where japanese people accept you is more difficult than in other countries. That is different from going around and just interacting with them, which I found smooth and polite. If you think that interacting eith japanese at work or shops or restaurants is the same as becoming part of them, well, that is ok, you seem to live there. I think it is more difficult than in other countrues and by this I am not meaning they are bad. For example, far fewer japanese speak english than other developed countries, which is a trait of ehat they care about. Also, when working or interacting with japanese myself, I found they follow rules really strictly compared to the \"flexibility mindset\" that westerners tend to have when solving problems. They will not go and correct their bosses if they see mistakes because \"they will notice themselves\". So there is a lot of room to make innocent mistakes when interacting with them and many, face it, are not even that interested beyond a trivial and polite conversation and I am not meaning bad. Every culture has their priorities and taste. reply expatjapan121 5 hours agorootparent> For example, far fewer japanese speak english than other developed countries My point was specifically about decoupling culture from language. And notably you didn't clarify about the Romanian who I guess must have spoke Spanish. Sorry but there are many eastern countries that are considered \"developed\" while the English speaking population is nothing compared to Western countries like in the Europe. Of course I wish they taught if better to open global opportunities but that doesn't mean anything in terms of culture. It's a language issue and luckily AI is much better at dealing with them than culture. reply ghc 25 minutes agoparentprevAs a seed-stage VC who has had the chance to interact with a number of Japanese entrepreneurs spinning businesses out of research at Harvard or MIT, I haven't found the conversations more superficial than with American entrepreneurs. Maybe there's large sums of money at stake, polite and superficial conversation is a way of mitigating risk? I won't pretend to know the answer, but as a deep technologist I find the fundraising conversations with entrepreneurs deeply dissatisfying on average. And as a multi-time entrepreneur myself, I have definitely felt the same way sitting on the other side of the table. reply FredPret 1 hour agoparentprevIf your spoken English is 10% as good as your comment, you're way ahead of the average English speaker.

This article largely reinforces that theory. If people do not have a need to learn another language, it becomes an uphill battle. People in Finland report higher levels of English competency than people in France (despite French being much closer to English than Finnish is) because there are so many fewer Finnish speakers. Finns wanting to experience warm beaches or global cities need to communicate when traveling to those places outside of Finland. France meanwhile has mountains, beaches, a big domestic market, ample media, and international reach. Japan is much more like France than Finland - the geographic diversity allows one to ski or sunbathe within the same country. The domestic market for goods and services is huge. Japan creates and exports so much culture that English speakers wish to learn Japanese to consume more of it. When there is little \"need\" to learn another language, it is not only less enticing but actually harder to do so. This culminates in anglophones being at a disadvantage in acquiring a L2 compared to nearly anyone else. A lot of people worldwide do want to practice their English with a native speaker. Many international institutions use English as the lingua franca. Even during a layover in Montreal, my (then) girlfriend ordered a smoothie in French and was replied to in English (this could be a commentary on Canadian bilingualism, but I'll leave that for another day) - it's hard for an anglophone to practice and perfect another language when the world around them already speaks better English than their L2. So considering Japan's strong domestic market, culture, and the stark differences between the languages, it was never a shock to me that their English proficiency isn't where one would immediately expect it. Thank you for sharing your thoughts and the deep experience behind them. reply hiAndrewQuinn 9 hours agoparentSuomi mainittu. As an English speaker who moved to Finland and has been steadily learning Finnish over the last few years, I definitely have to agree: My progress would probably be faster (and more painful) if I actually had any immediate need to speak Finnish. Don't twist my words here, I am still extremely grateful that Finns speak such excellent English. It's the only reason I felt like I could make it finding a job here after moving right after completing college. And it's definitely a cornerstone of Finnish success in international markets. I would very, very gladly take this tradeoff again. But, yes, trial by fire usually sets learning alight. reply TimK65 9 hours agoparentprevI have a somewhat related theory about English in Europe: The smaller countries are better at English partly because they subtitle rather than dubbing. That means that when they see English-language movies or watch English-language television, they're hearing English rather than their native language. I think this helps people maintain some level of English proficiency years after they leave school. (I'm American, living in Stockholm, by the way.) reply rjsw 1 hour agorootparentI felt this from working in the Netherlands. One thing that may change it in larger countries is digital TV, the broadcast can have both original and dubbed soundtracks available. reply TulliusCicero 10 hours agoparentprevThat's probably most of it, but the way Japan typically teaches English is sort of notoriously bad. That probably doesn't help either. > If people do not have a need to learn another language, it becomes an uphill battle. You do see some Japanese companies talking up the need for English competency; I suppose if more and more companies there use English competency as one thing they're looking for in job applicants, that might cause a shift elsewhere, as suddenly there's a 'need' (and thus a motivation). reply MichaelZuo 3 hours agorootparentThere are Japanese diplomats with nearly flawless English skills though… reply macintux 1 hour agorootparentI would wager that most diplomats come from a very privileged upbringing.

I'd like to share a few of my thoughts and experiences too. English is often put on a very high pedestal. Speaking fluent English is associated with being \"elite\". A tech company in my city is slowly moving to doing all development work in English. I went to a casual tech talk event they held. Every talk was given in Japanese and most of them started with a joke along the lines of \"[In English] Hello everyone, good evening! [In Japanese] Hahah, of course I'm not going to give the whole talk in English\" It makes sense to give all the talks in Japanese to a Japanese speaking audience, but the whole vibe was that English was so impossible that the idea of giving a talk in English was absurd. Some of my friends have kids with mixed-roots. They have grown up speaking English and Japanese. They sometimes modify their English pronunciation to sound \"more Japanese\" when they start English classes in school. They don't want to stand out amongst their peers. I remember one kid, who was tri-lingual. He told a story about being called upon in English class to translate the Japanese word for \"great-grandfather\". He translated it correctly but his teacher said \"No, it's grand-grandfather\". They teacher and the class laughed at him. Of course, there are bad teachers everywhere but one wonders if the teacher would have tried to take him down a peg so much if he fit in a bit better. He ended up moving to Germany with his family. It makes me feel quite sad that a kid born and raised here can end up feeling more at home in a place he has no connection to. reply Cthulhu_ 8 hours agoparentThat sounds like a universal experience to be honest; a lot of English teachers (that aren't native English themselves) often over-estimate their own abilities. reply partdavid 18 minutes agorootparentAnd not just restricted to English; it's a very common experience in the U.S. for native speakers of, e.g. Spanish, to end up in Spanish-language courses with non-native Spanish teachers, with modest Spanish skills.

It's a trait of hierarchical societies. Questioning your superior is a bigger threat to the society than saying things that are objectively wrong. While it's a fair argument that English became the lingua franca and if you don't speak it, you will be left behind, I feel like most Americans are completely oblivious to the idea that other cultures might exist.

I don't really disagree with this. However, it's only axiomatically true if you hold teaching skill constant. I once learned far more on Tuesdays and Thursdays from a brilliant teacher who spoke no English than I did on Mondays and Wednesdays from a perfectly bi-lingual instructor who was only meh. When I taught ESL I held onto English-only except in extremis. Knowing (though only a bit of, in my case) the other language, could otherwise become unproductive. As the teacher, it was on me to find the four or five (or however many were necessary!) ways to get to the concept in English.

The government has been making efforts, such as trying to improve the training and certification of Japanese language teachers, making Japanese language ability a condition (or at least an advantage) for getting certain types of visas, and offering language support to immigrant children in public schools.

The fact that much of the conversation consisted of the customers asking me personal questions—“Where are you from?” “Why did you come to Japan?” “Do you like Japanese women?”—made me suspicious, too. In retrospect, the place was almost certainly not a front for anything sinister but just a way for the owner to try to make some money from the shortage of opportunities to speak English in Japan.

Where I lived, this was one of the few places to interact with a foreigner and practice English (often before going on an overseas holiday or work contract). Even better, it was a safe and controlled environment. One of the crucial hurdles for Japanese people learning English has always been a lack of confidence and fear of looking foolish in public. It didn't do much for English ability, because how could it when the class is only one hour a week? Many of the schools were get-rich-quick schemes, as you say, but that doesn't mean they didn't provide a valuable function, even if they didn't contribute directly to English ability. reply lmm 14 hours agoparentprevThere is a very strong economic incentive to do well on university entrance exams - they pretty much determine the course of a Japanese person's life - and thus both schools and outside tutoring focus on teaching students to score well on the English section of those exams, to the exclusion of learning to understand or speak English.

One other interesting part of the uniformity is that perhaps because of the English focus, there's no real exposure to other foreign languages in public schools before the high school level (and sometimes not even then).

I still remember my English teacher in the university, who was from South Africa, complained about that he was always assumed to be American. * I find it interesting that, your article doesn't mention on the Japan's political dependence and subordination to the United States. The people who study at Tokyo Univ. are not commoners at all. They're the political and economic ruling class elites, and don't give a shit to the median Japanes people. They don't have to learn English because...why do they have to? * English is basically for the elites. As Tatsuru Uchida pointed out, most of LDP elites have learned in American universities. [0] They're literally colonial elites. > 逆に、植民地的言語教育では、原住民の子どもたちにはテクストを読む力はできるだけ付けさせないようにする。うっかり読む力が身に着くと、植民地の賢い子どもたちは、宗主国の植民地官僚が読まないような古典を読み、彼らが理解できないような知識や教養を身に付ける「リスク」があるからです。植民地の子どもが無教養な宗主国の大人に向かってすらすらとシェークスピアを引用したりして、宗主国民の知的優越性を脅かすということは何があっても避けなければならない。だから、読む力はつねに話す力よりも劣位に置かれる。「難しい英語の本なんか読めても仕方がない。それより日常会話だ」というようなことを平然と言い放つ人がいますけれど、これは骨の髄まで「植民地人根性」がしみこんだ人間の言い草です。[1] So, that's the reason why they focus on the conversational English instead of reading/writing. Seriously, \"you can teach tourists how to get to the station\" as a motivation to learn the language is insane. And that's the elites want us Japanese commoners to learn in English education. * My university English teacher (not the guy I mentioned earlier), who was a former bureaucrat who worked for the Ministry of Economy IIRC, told us that the Japan is a unique nation state, unlike the Western countries, that have kept single people and single language through the history. This is the Japanese ruling class. It was the most disgusting time I ever had in the univ, and that may be the reason I still feel very uncomfortable with English education. * Although I'm very against the current English education, I genuinely believe learning English have improved my life. I can watch 3Blue1Brown on YouTube, I can read the books from Slavoj Zizek not translated in Japanese, and of course, I can post on HN! * It's important that, the means to fight against colonialism is not blindly praising the native culture (see how Japanese have internalized \"Japan is unique! Japan is cool!\" bullshit), but to understand the relativism of the history and cultural development, and take universal values like democracy and human rights seriously - more seriously than their inventors. While American politics is becoming a kind of tragic farce, I hope Japan will present itself as a true representative of those values. It's unlikely to happen, but I hope so.

Certainly cultural exports play a role just like they do with any country. Lots of folks are obsessed with the USA and New York City because of USA cultural exports. Anime plays a big role in this, but it's not the only major export. Cars, video game consoles, video games, cameras, movies, music, art, food. Food!

There's a lot that's come out of Japan that has captured a lot of peoples interest and imagination as a result. reply kredd 11 hours agoparentprevYou’re thinking about power and money, but also should consider culture exports. I’d say it’s a combination of being a friendly nation to the west, being different, actively promoting culture internationally through media and, you know, still 3rd/4th largest economy. An extreme amount of recent travel in Japan also shows people some unique perspectives that people haven’t seen in their home countries (cleanliness, public infrastructure and etc.). I understand you can experience some of it in China as well, but there’s a massive difference between visiting Tokyo and Shanghai/Hong Kong. Also add millions of people who grew up with anime in 1990s/2000s who are professional adults now.

The first thing to point out is that this goes both ways which goes a long way to explain why Japan is more accessible. As someone who is German, the amount of anime that features vaguely German settings and names (sometimes extremely grammatically broken) for no good reason has always been funny to me. Influential popular media figures like Kojima are obsessed with Western pop culture in their own right, etc. Even the more literary or nationalistic Japanese cultural figures are often steeped in European culture, see Yukio Mishima. You can recognize Kafka in Kobo Abe's books, so as a Western reader it's both different and familiar.

    "originBody": "Google Banned Me From Google Voice November 7, 2024 · 2,562 words · ~13 minutes to read After 15 years, Google banned me from Google Voice. This post is a summary of what happened, with the hope that it might help someone in the future who runs into the same situation. At the end, I have some thoughts about the latent danger of being banned from Google at any time with no notice. Background I got my first cell phone in high school and immediately signed up for Google Voice simply because I wanted to be able to send and receive texts from my computer. So my Google Voice number is the only one I’ve ever given out to friends, and I use it as my phone number whenever I can. The only time I use my “real” Verizon phone number is when I can’t receive verification codes because some services block VoIP numbers. That was a minor annoyance, and I’ve loved being able to text and even call from any device, even if my phone was off or not in service (e.g. traveling internationally). So I stuck with it for 15 years. My only worry has been that it seems like another product that Google could easily decide to kill off and send to the Google graveyard at any moment. But that turned out to be the wrong worry for me. Getting Banned My problems started on October 4, 2024. I got a notification on my phone saying I had been logged out of my Google account. This had never happened to me before, and I thought someone might be trying to hack into my account. I was concerned but not terribly worried because I had two-factor authentication turned on. On my personal laptop, I saw a notification that I had been logged out of Google Drive. I logged back in on my phone and laptop, going through two-factor authentication both times. Then I checked the security log for my Google account. I saw that my account had been disabled at 12:55 pm, but the log didn’t have any details about why. Logging back in had restored my account at 2:38 pm. The log didn’t have any other security activity, like login attempts. I even reviewed my full Google activity but didn’t see anything that I didn’t recognize. Everything seemed back to normal, so I went back to work. A few hours later, I tried sending some pictures in a group text in Google Voice. The first picture went through fine. But when I tried to send a second one, I received an error message that said something like “Sorry, there was an error. Please try again later.” I retried a few times. Then I tried sending a plain text message to my wife and got the same error. I was worried that it was related to my account being deactivated, but the optimist in me thought that maybe Google Voice was having an outage. Until I got home and went on my laptop to check Google Voice in my browser. It redirected me to this Google support page with this message: Unable to access a Google product If you’ve been redirected to this page from a particular product, it means that your access to this product has been suspended. Read on for more information. Your access to this Google product has been suspended because of a perceived violation of either the Google Terms of Service or product-specific Terms of Service. For specific product guidelines, please visit the homepage of each Google product you’re interested in for a link to its Terms of Service. Google reserves the right to: Disable an account for investigation. Suspend a Google Account user from accessing a particular product or the entire Google Accounts system, if the Terms of Service or product-specific policies are violated. Terminate an account at any time, for any reason, with or without notice. Next steps for suspended accounts: If you believe your access to this product was suspended in error, contact us. Tip: If you are not redirected to this page from a product, review your service restrictions to file an appeal. My heart sank. Getting banned by Google’s automated systems is a situation that I have read plenty of stories about, and I had an idea of what was next: a Kafkaesque situation in which I would probably never talk to an actual human being, I’d never get any useful details, and I would likely be forced to accept losing my phone number. I tried making an outbound call. It didn’t work. I asked my wife to call me. That didn’t work either. I asked my wife to text me. From her perspective, it looked like it worked, but I never received it. That was even worse because it meant that anyone who texted me wouldn’t get any indication that anything was wrong. First Appeal The Google support page advised me to submit a form appealing the suspension. I did so immediately, explaining that I was suspended right after sending a picture and noting that I had been logged out of my Google account earlier in the day. I received an automated email: Thank you for contacting us about restoring access to your Google Account. Google will review your appeal as soon as possible. Most requests take 2 business days to review, but some might take longer. You may be able to download your data from some Google services. To get started, sign in to your account. If your account is eligible, you’ll see a link to download your data. Thanks for your patience. I did try to use Google Takeout to export my data, but Google Voice no longer shows up in the list of products, even though I’m sure it did in the past because I have exported my Google Voice data before. So the suspension presumably affected that as well. I subscribe to a Google One plan. I knew that one of the more understated benefits is the ability to get live support from an actual person, something that is generally impossible with Google. I had nothing to lose, so I started a chat. It ended up being a waste of time because the person I talked to was fixated on me mentioning getting logged out of my account. So they started recommending ways to protect my account. When I brought the conversation back to the Google Voice suspension, they were unable to access the ticket that was created when I submitted my appeal. So I ended the conversation. On October 6 (two days later), I heard back about my appeal: Hello, We have reviewed your request and cannot reinstate your Google Voice service. Your Google Voice service has been suspended for violations of our Google Voice Policies. If you have any further questions, please consult the Google Voice Help Center. Thanks, Google Voice Support Team Second Appeal On October 7, I submitted a second appeal. I explained that I reviewed the Google Voice policies and did not believe I violated any of them. I never sent large quantities of texts, I never sent commercial texts, I only texted friends and family, and there was nothing remotely inappropriate about the picture I sent right before I was suspended. The picture was of four adults around a baby in a stroller on a sidewalk. The baby is dressed and even has a blanket on him. I added that that was the only text I sent on the day I was suspended, and I didn’t make any calls that day. On October 8, I received the same reply that I got for the first appeal. I considered writing this blog post immediately, posting it to Hacker News, and hopefully getting enough traction that someone at Google would see it and do something about it. But I didn’t bother because even on the off chance that it worked, I wouldn’t be able to trust Google Voice again and would still want to port my phone number out. Reclaiming My Number At this point, porting my number out was my only priority. I didn’t want to tell all my friends and family to use a new number. And I didn’t want to deal with trying to update my number for a countless number of services, especially since I’m sure it’d be a hassle for many of them without access to the old number. I did some searching and learned that the Google Voice subreddit has an entire document on suspensions. People apparently post about suspensions often enough that the subreddit disallows threads on suspensions since there’s nothing they can do about them. I found one wonderfully detailed post (“Account Suspended - Reclaiming your Number and your Dignity; a How-To Guide”) that has been removed because of the subreddit’s rule. But that post, as well as another one that is still up, said the posters were able to get their numbers out by filing complaints with the FCC. So I planned to do that, expecting the whole process to take a couple of months. On October 9, I added a new line to my Verizon plan as a target for my Google Voice number. A silver lining is that with the new line, I was able to get a new iPhone 15 for almost free after bill credits. I initiated a port in request for my Google Voice number. I expected the port to fail, since I was unable to access my Google Voice account to unlock the number. Then I would submit the FCC complaint. But to my pleasant surprise, the port went through in a couple of days! I activated service on the new iPhone with my old Google Voice number. I did have an issue where I could make calls and send and receive texts, but I couldn’t receive calls. I called the Verizon port center (1-888-844-7095), and the person who helped me did something on their end to truly finish off the port. After that, I could receive calls as well. So I never needed to use the FCC’s muscle. Then I did a number swap between my Verizon lines so that I can use my former Google Voice number on my Android phone instead of the iPhone. After a couple of days, I looked up the number on FreeCarrierLookup, and it showed up as a wireless Verizon number. Previously, it showed up as a landline, and the carrier was Bandwidth, which is apparently what powers Google Voice SMS in the backend. On October 23, I received an email from Google Voice saying that my number was ported away: Hello Danny Guo, This email is to confirm that your Google Voice number (xxx-xxx-xxxx) has been ported away from Google Voice. Calls made to that number will no longer ring your forwarding phones and new voicemails won’t appear in your Google Voice inbox. Your Google Voice account has been downgraded accordingly, but your existing voicemails and text messages remain available in your inbox. You can also continue placing calls from Gmail. You can upgrade your account at any time by getting a new Google Voice number. Thanks The Google Voice team Now when I open Google Voice on my phone, it asks me to pick a new number as if I’m starting from scratch. But on web, it still redirects me to the suspension page. Retrospective I have conflicted thoughts about what happened. I’ve used Google services for the majority of my life. In college, I remember playing would you rather at lunch, and a friend asked if I’d rather lose access to everything Google or lose a physical sense. I really had to think about it. I’ve only ever used Android smartphones and smartwatches, despite being virtually the only one among my friends and family to not have switched to iPhone. Which makes me the person who tends to get grief for ruining group chats by turning them into green bubbles. And I directly pay Google by subscribing to Google One, YouTube Premium, and Google Workspace (just for my custom domain email). One major reason I’ve stuck with Google for so long is that I value using services that are multiplatform. I may have an Android phone and watch, but I also have a MacBook and an iPad. And I still think Google Search can be pretty magical. Despite its decline and the fact that LLMs are just better for certain searches. Fear But relying on Google worries me because of all the stories I’ve read about people being banned. Sure, some of those cases might be lacking some details that would justify the bans, but I was convinced enough to put a lot of effort into migrating away from Gmail several years ago. Consider how important your email account is to your digital life and how awful it would be to suddenly lose access to your email with no warning. By now, everything important uses my custom domain email address. I do use Google Workspace for it, so i’m technically still using Gmail. But the point is that I control the address. If Google bans me one day, all I have to do is update my DNS records to switch to something like Fastmail. The possibility of a Google ban is also one small reason I haven’t gotten into Android development. I could accidentally violate their terms and get banned from publishing apps in an instant. And I deliberately do not take any pictures of my infant son nude on the off chance it gets flagged as child sexual abuse material after being uploaded into Google Photos, and my entire Google account is banned. With my recent situation, I consider myself lucky that I was at least only banned from Google Voice. It says something that my biggest issue with Google isn’t that their services aren’t good anymore or that they kill things off all the time. It’s that I’m afraid they will just ban me with no recourse. It finally happened, and it wasn’t even for a service that I was worried about. Caveats I work in software and in fintech. I can understand that Google operates at such a massive scale that many things have to be automated, and even if there are some false positives, that could be a worthy tradeoff to Google to not have to put humans into the loop. I also understand the logic of not telling people what rules they broke because you don’t want bad actors to get a better understanding of the system because that would allow them to fine tune their attacks accordingly. Curiosity But I’m still frustrated about temporarily losing my phone number. Sure I never paid for Google Voice, but Google never gave me an option to pay for it. In this case, I would have happily paid $100 just to find out why exactly I was banned. What rule or model decided I needed to be banned? Part of it is curiosity. Was the last picture I sent the issue? Getting logged out of my phone earlier in the day suggests it wasn’t. But I didn’t do anything else on Google Voice that day, and I barely sent any texts or made any calls in the days before. I’m confident that if a real person looked at my account, they’d agree something in the automation went wrong. You may have some skepticism. Unfortunately, I can’t provide my activity, since I can’t see it anymore after the app recognized that my number was ported out. But I’m not the only one dealing with this kind of a situation. I wonder if I should be more upset. Maybe I should actually try to vote with my wallet and switch to that iPhone, move my files from Google Drive to iCloud or Dropbox, and migrate to Fastmail. But I know Google can afford to simply not care.",

It’s ludicrous that Google can simply kill your phone number and nobody bats an eye. It’s such a fundamental part of life at this point. At the minimum, users should get a “We are no longer willing to provide you service. You have two weeks before service will end. Please switch your number to another provider if you want to keep it.” Other than non-payment, are there other phone companies that simply disable your account without warning and without giving any reason? I can imagine something like, \"You are required to live in this geographic range, but the majority of the time you are outside of it.” Or “You are too expensive to continue to support” or any number of other things. But man, no warning, no reason, no recourse, disappear your phone access? That’s just plain bad. reply causal 1 hour agoparentYup - the cost of the service does not matter, the dependency the service creates is what matters. Making someone dependent on a service is especially easy when it's free, and the incentives to do so are usually to create dependencies for the sake of data collection or upselling some other service. If anything it is a paid service that can at least justify shutting down by no longer taking your money. reply JumpCrisscross 1 hour agoparentprev> ludicrous that Google can simply kill your phone number and nobody bats an eye A free phone number. That comes from a company notorious for no customer service. It’s not at all justified behaviour.

Tons of stuff relies on it, and providers can shut it off at will. Which is why I use my own domain - at least I can move it to another provider if I get shut down.

People today laugh at \"Ma Bell,\" but at least you could go to a local office and sit at a desk in front of someone who could actually fix your problem, no matter how ludicrous it was. I once lived in a four-story apartment building. When I moved from the second floor to the fourth floor, I called to have my phone transferred. The person on the phone said there is no fourth floor in my building. This wasn't a new-build. It was over 100 years old, and was converted into apartments decades earlier. But the woman on the phone couldn't do anything because the computer said there were only two floors. I walked down to my local Bell office, and sat down at one of those battleship green desk with a woman and told her my story. She said, \"Oh, yeah! I know that building. I drive by it every day. Is it nice inside?\" Then she pushed some buttons on the computer, and the next day a guy with a gold-and-blue striped hardhat showed up and rewired the punchboard.

What is ludicrous is not having a federal US identity verification API such that phone numbers are not the end all be all. Or that if the US government wants to use phone numbers for identity verification, they enact legislation to provide legal protections from losing it. But I think leaders like the extrajudicial ability to nuke someone’s life if they need to. Same with bank accounts and know your customer laws that can lock you out for unknown reasons.

Edited to add: Also, it’s not true that phone numbers are only so important because of identity verification. That is one reason, but solving that doesn’t let my children’s school call me if Google shuts my number down, just to give one example.

Very unclear to me whether it says what you think it says. The emphasis seems to be on Google Voice service, not the number itself. I would expect the FCC complaint asking for number porting to go nowhere if Google didn’t believe they were required to release the number for porting. reply runjake 54 minutes agorootparentYeah, like I said, I'm not a lawyer, but I zeroed in on \"you have no explicit nor implied rights to the indefinite use of Google Voice telephone numbers\" in particular, for intent.

Or at least not immediately released back to the pool of available numbers. It is a free service, so I expected to not have any right to it. I also feel like my only use for phone numbers for many years has been identity verification. If I lost access to it, I could be reached via multiple other communications avenues, but I can only get 2FA SMS sent to my phone number for many services, including government websites. reply jtbayly 1 hour agorootparentThat’s certainly a wise expectation, but that doesn’t make it right that the company can do that, whether you pay them or not. The fact that the FCC recognizes your right to the phone number you’ve been using (regardless of payment) is instructive. Edited to add: from other comments, the FCC requiring them to release the number might actually be wrong. It’s possible that it is just Google being wise themselves to avoid trouble. reply lotsofpulp 1 hour agorootparent> but that doesn’t make it right that the company can do that, whether you pay them or not. Yes, I just wanted to highlight that the focus on fixing this vulnerability should not have anything to do with Google, but rather elected leaders doing their job to protect everyone in society. Similar to blaming banks for closing accounts for seemingly no reason. reply Jerrrrrrry 1 hour agorootparentprevThe incentives align for everyone to play dumb, as incompetence at this scale can dissolve responsibility/accountability via complexity/laundering that can systematically benefit a select few. reply transcriptase 1 hour agoprevI’m getting sick of the “take no responsibility for human or computer mistakes by creating automated processes where fixing the mistake manually can’t be done or hurts a KPI”. FedEx lost my package. Apparently there’s no process to flag it missing without being able to physically scan the missing item (???). It’s permanently marked as “out for delivery”, so all of their systems tell you everything is fine and actively work against you ever reaching a human. Meanwhile the sender has an automated system that checks the FedEx tracking number, sees “out for delivery”, and does the same thing. Even when I do reach humans at both FedEx and the sender it’s obvious they can’t do anything except sympathize with the situation. I feel like I’m part of some sort of psychological experiment at this point. reply freedomben 1 hour agoparentYeah, this is especially maddening because drivers are just people, and people can easily make mistakes (or in some cases, straight up steal the package). And even if it does eventually get straightened out, it will be weeks and weeks until you get the replacement (or original).

Years ago I lost an entire Yahoo! account with paid hosting for my side gig at the time along with years emails because I apparently broke their ToS by asking a question deemed inappropriate on Yahoo! Answers. reply gpspake 1 hour agoprevLife pro tip (I believe that everyone should do this): - Buy a domain and set up a custom email that represents you like firstname@firstlast.com - you own this domain and email address and no company, with the exception of your registrar maybe, has any control over it or authority to take it from you. - Set up a dummy gmail/proton/whatever acct with a random address - this address will never be used or exposed publicly but it will represent your online email hosting acct. - Forward your custom email address to the email provider address and configure the web client to send from your custom address. - set your provider email account up in a local client like outlook that allows you to create a local backup. - continue watching your previous account and updating your accounts to your new lifetime address. At some point, you should be getting minimal emails to the old account, then you can forward it to your new one. The idea here is that you've decoupled your identity (your email address) from your webmail provider (gmail) So google inexplicably cuts your access. Now what? No problem. You have a local backup of all your emails in outlook. You repeat the process with a different service like proton (or a new gmail acct) with a new dummy email. Then you set the new acct up in outlook and drag all of the emails from your old acct in to the new one you haven't missed a beat. You're still sending and receiving emails to/from the same address and you can access all your historical emails in the new hosting acct because you migrated/synced them all over locally in outlook. Losing access to your email identity is arguably one of the most catastrophic scenarios you can think of in terms of being online. This guards against that about as much as possible. It doesn't cover other services like voice and stuff but you can follow similar strategies for things like documents and files. reply elmerfud 1 hour agoprevWhile people like to scream and lose their mind about who the president is and what they're blathering on about today it's this situation that I never see any politician talk about in a meaningful way and I never see get attention. This situation impacts the average person and has the potential to impact the average person more than who the president is at any given time. Because at least with governmental politics there is actual recourse. Until we demand that our government begin to prioritize consumer rights against these modern-day robber barons this kind of stuff will continue to happen. Unfortunately until it happens to you nobody seems to care. Often times the person that happens to gets blamed because their actions definitely must have caused this. This would actually be a fairly simple thing for the FTC to correct if they wanted to. They're already empowered to do this kind of stuff and wouldn't need any new powers granted to them. They could simply say when an account is suspended or disabled or you are banned including a shadow ban that you must provide the specific details of what caused the ban and what specific provisions were violated in the terms of service. Because when you're the size of Google you effectively are a monopolistic common carrier. So being able to say something like we can do this at any time for any reason is not appropriate at that scale. Because denying you access to phone service is denying you access to a basic utility. It would actually be interesting to see state boards of utilities begin to pull things like this under their control. This would give enormous consumer rights to people. Because while your landline carrier can deny you service and remove your service they must have very strict documented reasons for that and there is an actual transparent appeal process as part of it. Filing an appeal and not being able to be part of the appealed discussion is not an appeal at all. reply Mistletoe 1 hour agoparentActually who you vote for determines this a great deal.

I think you're misunderstanding why this happens. Banning without a clear explanation or shadow banning users is a feature, not a bug. It grants platforms the ability to arbitrarily make decisions about who can use their platform without having to apply a consistent standard that would be questioned and challenged. Governments don't want to change this because it benefits them. It means when they're able to tell a platform to ban a user and that user can be banned for \"violating the ToS\", instead of telling the truth and saying the user was \"banned on order of the government\". The reason why governments don't care about this issue is because no one with power would benefit from this transparency. reply reaperducer 1 hour agoparentprevUntil we demand that our government begin to prioritize consumer rights against these modern-day robber barons this kind of stuff will continue to happen.

Also considering that 80% of the government is reelected at the federal level every two years. If the people cared it would change. Politicians primary goal is to continue to remain in power the problem is that the people are not unified enough in having their expectations conveyed and then sticking to them. Even outside of that the FTC is fully empowered to implement the protections that are needed right now without congresses involvement or the president. It's certainly not as strong as passing a law but they have the authority to regulate this stuff. As do state level utility boards. I don't know how to make people care until it happens to them. Maybe someone on the inside who feels like we do that there should be better consumer protections around this will start banning some very popular politicians or other very famous people who can bring wide scale attention to this problem. I fear without the attention of someone famous getting knocked off and having to fight to get it back there will never be a change. reply sbuttgereit 1 hour agoprevNot to address the author of the article specifically, but only all readers generally.... I would suggest that the moment you chose to have a critical dependency on someone else's services, it becomes incumbent on you to have a disaster recovery plan should that service suddenly become unavailable to you. How formal or intense such a plan is may depend on if you're an individual or a small/mid-sized business that's too small to command the respect of your vendor in the event of a problem (real or imagined on the part of the vendor). You have to take a defensive approach to these relationships even if part of the reason you buy these services is not to worry about such issues: you may have moved and transformed what you have to worry about, but you have not freed yourself from any worry. We can hand-wave that away muttering about, \"most people won't understand\"... but at the end of the day it's the modern, connected world we live in and failing to be properly educated about that world is fraught with peril.

Instead we set up systems of regulation and production to ensure we can Instead focus on our own specialization. reply mitthrowaway2 1 hour agoparentprevI understand the philosophy of where you're coming from, but I think it is blind to an important dynamic. This isn't just a matter of freely choosing to depend on someone else's service, take-it-or-leave-it. We live in a world of two-sided markets, where the mere existence of a popular service starts to reshape the world, altering the choices available to you. In 1999, you could freely choose not to have a cellphone, because payphones were abundant. As cellphones became more popular, payphones disappeared; meanwhile, other services such as banks began to require you to have a number that could receive SMS messages. As smartphones reached mass adoption, it became a safe assumption that most people could access an android or iphone app, and support for other paths (such as a web browser) began to decrease, even for essential services. I can freely choose to watch videos on YouTube or not, and freely refuse to do so if I don't like it. But I also realize that by YouTube merely existing and being popular, it creates a gravity well. Creators stay on YouTube because their audiences are there, and viewers stay there because the channels they follow are there. By merely existing, the oxygen available to other potential services that I could freely choose is reduced. I can choose not to drive a car, but the choice of many other people to drive cars results in roads, services, and cities designed to meet their needs, rather than mine. This reduces my freedom to opt out of car ownership. And if McDonalds didn't offer a car-only 24-hour drive-thru, there would be unmet demand by hungry people late at night that might provide enough business for another company to open a 24-hour cafe. As it is, McDonalds services enough of that demand, and if the non-drivers have no midnight food options, it's their fault for being too small of a market to be worthwhile. The dynamics of these gravity wells is important to acknowledge, and I think it does create a responsibility on the operators of these services to their customers beyond that of someone freely using their service by uncompelled choice. Because they are, to some degree compelled, and the compulsion comes from the existence of that service removing oxygen from the competitors that would have otherwise appeared to meet those needs. The model of \"I'm voluntarily offering you a service that you otherwise wouldn't have had; it's my right to simply choose to stop offering it to you\" is too simple. (Edit: But practically speaking, I do think what you say is good advice and I don't disagree with it. I'm only objecting to the moral philosophy behind it. Kind of like I agree that pedestrians should wear bright clothing and reflective stripes to avoid getting hit by cars at night, even though it's the drivers' moral responsibility to not hit those pedestrians). reply lazyeye 1 hour agoparentprevGoogle is unique in how badly they treat their customers.
