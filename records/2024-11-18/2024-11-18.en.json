    "originBody": "Reverse Engineering iOS 18 Inactivity Reboot November 17, 2024 Reverse Engineering iOS 18 Inactivity Reboot iOS 18 introduced a new inactivity reboot security feature. What does it protect from and how does it work? This blog post covers all the details down to a kernel extension and the Secure Enclave Processor. Security Before First Unlock / After First Unlock Did you know that entering your passcode for the first time after your phone starts is something very different then entering it later on to unlock your phone? When initially entering your passcode, this unlocks a key store in the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP) that encrypts your data on an iPhone. The state before entering your passcode for the first time is also called Before First Unlock (BFU). Due to the encrypted user data, your iPhone behaves slightly differently to later unlocks. You'll see that Face ID and Touch ID won't work and that the passcode is required. But there's more subtle things you might notice: Since Wi-Fi passwords are encrypted, your iPhone won't connect to Wi-Fi networks. If your SIM is not PIN-protected, your iPhone will still connect to cellular networks. That means, technically, you can still receive phone calls. Yet, if you receive a call, even if that number is in your contacts, the contact name won't be shown, as the contacts haven't been decrypted yet. Similarly, when you receive notifications about new messages, you'll see that you got messages, but you won't see any message previews. You can easily try this yourself! In the After First Unlock (AFU) state, user data is decrypted. You can imagine this like a key safe that is kept open while iOS is running. Even when you see a lock screen, certain keys remain available to the operating system. This way, you stay connected to Wi-Fi networks and receive message notification previews, even when your iPhone is locked. While it's more convenient, the AFU state is more susceptible to attacks. An attacker who can somehow bypass the lock screen can get access to decrypted data on the iPhone. To bypass the lock screen, an attacker does not necessarily need to know the passcode. Security vulnerabilities within iOS can allow attackers to get code execution and extract from an iPhone, even while it appears to be \"locked\". Attackers with physical access to an iPhone have more security vulnerabilities to choose from. The attack surface is larger, as such attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the USB stack or within wireless protocols, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular, or even more invasive hardware attacks that involve opening the device. This larger attack surface tends to make exploits for these vulnerabilities cheaper on the gray market, as there's potentially more supply. Another factor that makes attacks cheaper is time – vulnerabilities that are publicly known by the vendor and patched in more recent software versions won't unlock new iPhones, but can unlock iPhones that were kept in AFU state for a long time that didn't get any software updates. Rumors about Rebooting iPhones In law enforcement scenarios, a lot of the forensically relevant data is available in the AFU state. Law enforcement takes advantage of this and often keeps seized iPhones powered on, but isolated from the Internet, until they can extract data. This time might be necessary to wait for an exploit to be available or for legal reasons, such as getting a warrant. However, thieves and other criminals are also interested in getting this kind of access after stealing a device. It gives them access to bank accounts and other valuable information, by far exceeding what the iPhone itself would be worth, or which might be used for blackmail. People reuse their passwords often, and getting access to the iCloud account may allow a thief to reset activation lock for the device, increasing the resale value. A recent news article by 404 media (while paywalled, the most important information is also contained in the related Tweet) reported on a law enforcement document about suspicious iPhone reboots. This document makes two interesting claims: iPhones on iOS 18 will reboot, even when completely isolated from wireless networks. iPhones on iOS 18 will tell other iPhones on lower iOS versions to reboot – wirelessly! Especially the second claim would be huge if true. If anyone figured out how this works, they could build a large TV-Be-Gone for iPhones, forcing reboots over the air on hundreds of iPhones simultaneously. Would Apple really build such a feature into an iPhone? Knowing a thing or two about the Apple wireless ecosystem, my interest was piqued, and I had to go down the rabbit hole! Discovery of Inactivity Reboot When Apple adds new features, they usually don't hide this very well. Apple software contains a lot of debug strings, which hint at new functionality. Blacktop maintains a git repository of strings found in iOS, which keeps a nice version history. I decided to do the most low-effort thing I could think of: just search for \"reboot\". Bingo, that third hit looks good: \"inactivity_reboot\". The fact that it's in keybagd is interesting: this daemon is related to the key store that is unlocked on the first unlock. A second search for only inactivity reboot shows the string starts occurring in iOS 18.1 and iOS 18.2. In iOS 18.2, the string changed from \"inactivity_reboot\" to \"inactivity_reboot_enabled\", hinting towards more potential changes in the latest iOS 18.2 betas. Something that was still unclear to me at that point is: How long does it take for inactivity reboot to be triggered? A new article by 404 media claimed that it was 3-4 days. So I updated my SRD to the latest beta and made a time lapse. Turns out, the inactivity reboot triggers exactly after 3 days (72 hours). The iPhone would do so despite being connected to Wi-Fi. This confirms my suspicion that this feature had nothing to do with wireless connectivity. Reverse Engineering Inactivity Reboot Let's reverse engineer what's changed! Which security guarantees does it provide? Here is a high-level overview of what I found: The Secure Enclave Processor (SEP) keeps track on when your phone was last unlocked. If that last unlock time exceeds 3 days, the SEP tells the AppleSEPKeyStore kernel module that the time was exceeded. The AppleSEPKeyStore kernel module informs user space to initiate a reboot. SpringBoard will then gracefully terminate all user-space processes. This prevents potential data loss upon reboot. If the AppleSEPKeyStore kernel module finds the iPhone to still be powered on after it should have rebooted, the kernel will panic. This case should never happen, unless someone tries to tamper with inactivity reboot. The AppleSEPKeyStore kernel module writes an NVRAM variable aks-inactivity. After the iPhone rebooted, keybagd reads this variable and, if set, sends an analytics event to Apple including how long the iPhone was not unlocked. The remainder of this post shows how I figured this out and what security implications the underlying design has. Indicators in Sysdiagnose From my search in ipsw-diffs, I knew there were some log messages that are printed on reboot. At the same time as I started looking them statically, I knew I had to see them actually logged for myself. After my phone rebooted after three days, I took a sysdiagnose and searched for these messages. When doing this yourself, make sure that you unlocked the device before making the sysdiagnose. Otherwise, events from before the reboot will be missing. In the AppleSEPKeyStore messages, there are the following entries around the inactivity reboot: default 2024-11-17 01:35:14.341697 +0100 kernel \"AppleSEPKeyStore\":3846:0: notifying user space of inactivity reboot default 2024-11-17 01:35:14.341766 +0100 kernel \"AppleSEPKeyStore\":12598:31: operation failed (sel: 35 ret: e00002f0) default 2024-11-17 01:35:14.342053 +0100 kernel \"AppleSEPKeyStore\":12598:31: operation failed (sel: 35 ret: e00002f0) default 2024-11-17 01:35:34.958218 [reboot occurs] +0100 kernel \"AppleSEPKeyStore\":331:0: starting (BUILT: Oct 26 2024 08:16:35) (\"normal\" variant 🌽 , 1827.60.43) default 2024-11-17 01:35:34.958381 +0100 kernel \"AppleSEPKeyStore\":476:0: _sep_enabled = 1 For more context, these are the unfiltered log messages before the reboot is initiated: Reverse Engineering the SEPKeyStore Kernel Extension The latest iOS kernel can be downloaded using the following ipsw command: ipsw download appledb --device iPhone17,3 --os iOS --version '18.2 beta 2' --kernel This will download and decompress the kernel. For further analysis, I loaded the whole kernel cache into Binary Ninja. ipsw also supports splitting the kernel into its modules (called \"extensions\" on iOS). The latest version of Ghidra also has decent support for the iOS kernel. So there's a lot of tools to choose from for this analysis. I also downloaded an older kernel where Apple accidentally included symbols and manually diffed these versions with a focus on the code related to inactivity reboot. The kernel has three strings relating to the feature: \"notifying user space of inactivity reboot\" is the string we already know from the sysdiagnose. It belongs to the function AppleKeyStore::handle_events, which polls for SEP events in the background. The following screenshot shows it in more context after reverse engineering and some renaming of functions. The first string, \"max inactivity window expired, failed to reboot the device\", is the kernel panic in case that the iPhone failed to reboot. For more context, the panic is called by the function AppleKeyStore::handle_device_state_return. There are multiple paths that invoke this handler through many layers of abstraction, which have to do with the UserClient but also SEP states. With the calltree plugin, we can see all the incoming calls to this function. Now to the last string, \"aks-inactivity\". We can see that this is a property that is set in the IORegistry. Its counterpart is in keybagd in user space. When keybagd is initialized, it checks for this variable, issues an analytics event, and then deletes it. This analytics event probably helps Apple optimize the time window, but we can ignore it for the core functionality. Something that I couldn't find in the kernel, even with the knowledge that it was 72 hours, was this particular time window. I couldn't find any numbers that matched 72 hours. So how does the phone know when to reboot? While there are some references to time-related functionality in the SEPKeyStore kernel extension, none of these compare a value to 72 hours. These references were quite simple to find and did not differ much from the older kernel version without inactivity reboot, so it doesn't seem like the functionality was added here. However, the SEPKeyStore communicates with the SEP co-processor. In the functions I identified, reboots are related to some SEP states. Could it be the SEP itself that checks the time? Reverse Engineering the Secure Enclave Processor The SEP is one of Apple's most protected secrets. In contrast to most other firmware on the iPhone, the firmware for the SEP is encrypted. Luckily for us, @nyan_satan recently leaked SEP firmware encryption keys for iOS 18.1 beta 6, just eta wen Apple introduced inactivity reboot. (Thank you!! 🎉 And Apple, if you're reading this, why not ship the SEP unencrypted?) Using ipsw, we can download the SEP firmware as follows: ipsw download appledb --device iPhone16,1 --os iOS --version '18.1 beta 6' --pattern \"sep-firmware.d83.RELEASE.im4p\" With the leaked keys, we can decrypt the firmware: pyimg4 im4p extract --iv 6705fb216080e19667dbcf71f532ae73 --key 4ea9db4c2e63a316a6854c83e2f5c81fd102ad40160b8998b5f9b16838b7116e -i sep-firmware.d83.RELEASE.im4p -o sep-firmware.d83.RELEASE.im4p.e Loading this into Binary Ninja is a bit tricky. We can guess that the architecture is 64-bit ARM little endian. But there's no metadata where the firmware has to be loaded to. Being lazy and not wanting to spend time on writing a firmware loader, I used Binary Ninja's Triage feature to auto-detect the most likely address. Note that the firmware seems to have multiple fragments and there's multiple potential load addresses. I picked 0x80090000ffc80000, which worked well for me. There's only little known about the SEP. The best information I could come up with is a presentation dating back to 2016 – but that's better than nothing! What's good to know is that the SEP firmware is structured into apps, so I'm guessing the other base addresses the triage found may correspond to the other apps' address spaces. The app that communicates with the SEPKeyStore is called sks (see slide 86 of the presentation). Not a lot of information, but enough to start reverse engineering! Looking at strings, it looks like the architecture of apps running inside the SEP hasn't changed much since 2016. The SEPKeyStore-related app is still called sks: The SEP has almost no debug strings, making it tougher to reverse engineer. Here is what the initialization function for the SEPKeyStore looks like after some manual annotations (\"sth\" stands for \"something\" – I didn't go too deep into understanding the specifics here): Within its main function, we can find multiple other functions executed before a service workloop starts. However, there's plenty of code. How do we focus on things that are related to the inactivity reboot? Let's recall that we're looking for something that resembles 72 hours. In the kernel, times are usually measured in seconds or in microseconds. For example 72 hours are 259200 seconds (0x3f480). But looking for this value (or for 259200000000, in microseconds, or any other sensible units) in the binary won't return any matches. Using the compiler explorer, we can see why: Optimizations... Rather than looking the full time in bytes in reverse byte order, we're looking for assembly instructions that load parts of the timespan into a register. Binary Ninja knows how to reverse this optimization, and allows us to search in its intermediate representations, instead of looking for raw bytes. In our case, we know that we're looking for a constant. We find only two matches: And here it is – a function that compares various times, including 3 days, which is related to the sks application's main function. The result of this time comparison is used to create a message, which is likely sent to the SEPKeyStore kernel extension. Creating a new enum makes it more readable: enum times : uint32_t { _3_days = 0x3f480, _2_days = 0x2a301, _1_days = 0x15181, `_2.5h` = 0xe11 }; This function is used in a context to initialize a struct, which is likely a message being sent from the SEP to the kernel extension. I didn't end up reverse engineering much more of the SEP, but this seems to confirm that it's really the SEP that keeps track of how long the phone hasn't been unlocked. This design makes sense to me, since the SEP is involved in every unlock, and is also hardened against tampering, even if an exploit against the main kernel is used, so it's a good place to anchor a mitigation like this. A Mitigation Only Against Cops? While the media coverage so far framed this mitigation as primarily targeting law enforcement, it also a huge security improvement against theft. Outdated law enforcement equipment often finds its way to eBay and other similar platforms for rather cheap price tags. However, thieves won't have the financial and legal means to obtain up-to-date exploits to unlock iPhones within 3 days of getting them. That's another reason why it's important to keep your device updated! On the other hand, law enforcement can and will have to adjust their process, and act faster than before. The first forensic tooling companies already announced that they're able to coordinate these steps within 24 hours! (Note that this also indicates that they only have exploits for AFU state... 🤡) Key Takeaways This feature is not at all related to wireless activity. The law enforcement document's conclusion that the reboot is due to phones wirelessly communicating with each other is implausible. The older iPhones before iOS 18 likely rebooted due to another reason, such as a software bug. The time measurement and triggering of the reboot is in the SEP, which communicates with the SEPKeyStore kernel extension to perform the reboot. It is likely that using an external time source provided over the Internet or cellular networks to tamper with timekeeping will not influence the 3-day timer. Security-wise, this is a very powerful mitigation. An attacker must have kernel code execution to prevent an inactivity reboot. This means that a forensic analyst might be able to delay the reboot for the actual data extraction, but the initial exploit must be run within the first three days. Inactivity reboot will change the threat landscape for both thieves and forensic analysts, but asymmetrically so: while law enforcement is under more time pressure, it likely completely locks out criminals from accessing your data to get into your bank accounts and other valuable information stored on your iPhone.

Wouldn’t it rely on app-level memory scrubbing and page clearing and such as well, if you wanted to truly make sure it’s unavailable? Do Apple offer APIs to assist there? reply axoltl 1 hour agorootparentThere's a decent amount of data protected by Class A keys (which are only available when a device is 'actively unlocked') and some amount of data protected by Class B keys (which are asymmetric keys to allow data to be encrypted while the device is locked but only decrypted when the device is unlocked by way of a private key encrypted with a Class A key). The security guide[0] isn't super obvious about what data is protected with what keys: > The Mail app database (including attachments), managed books, Safari bookmarks, app launch images, and location data are also stored through encryption, with keys protected by the user’s passcode on their device. > Calendar (excluding attachments), Contacts, Reminders, Notes, Messages, and Photos implement the Data Protection entitlement Protected Until First User Authentication. I can confirm that when they say \"keys protected by the user's passcode\" they mean \"protected with class A or B\". The most shameful omissions there in my opinion are Messages and Photos, but location data is (from a law enforcement perspective) obviously a big one. 0: https://help.apple.com/pdf/security/en_US/apple-platform-sec...

Shortly after the user locks a device (10 seconds, if the Require Password setting is Immediately), the decrypted class key is discarded, rendering all data in this class inaccessible until the user enters the passcode again or unlocks (logs in to) the device using Face ID or Touch ID. reply happytoexplain 4 hours agorootparentThis means it can't be read from storage, but AFAIK anything you've read into your app's memory sandbox is still sitting there decrypted until your app releases it or is closed or has its memory wiped by system housekeeping. reply happytoexplain 5 hours agorootparentprevIt's a good point - I am not an expert, but I think this feature just doesn't protect memory (tying one of the keys to rebooting helps, but the Data Protection feature itself doesn't seem to protect memory). However, that doesn't moot in-storage protection. There are other features protecting memory (and other features protecting data in storage - there are tons of security features). I am not aware of APIs for securely clearing your app's memory (aside from lower level, more manual APIs). This may be one of those cases that relies mostly on sandboxing for protection. I also imagine it's hard to circumvent sandboxing without rebooting. But I'm making a lot of guesses here. reply mjlee 6 hours agoprevI had to look up what SRD meant. It's a Security Research Device - \"a specially fused iPhone that allows you to perform iOS security research without having to bypass its security features.\" https://security.apple.com/research-device/ reply Shank 9 hours agoprevTo me the biggest takeaway is that Apple is sufficiently paranoid to add this feature. Some people (like John Gruber) advocate for activating bio lockout at the border by squeezing the volume and power buttons. I would say if you’re the type of person who would do this, you should go one step further and power off. Similarly, if you’re in a situation where you cannot guarantee your phone’s security because it’s leaving your possession, and you’re sufficiently worried, again, power off fully. reply phinnaeus 8 hours agoparentWhat do you do if you’re at the border and they demand both the physical device and the password?

In a border interrogation scenario, isn't that just likely to get you arrested for destroying evidence? reply verandaguy 5 hours agorootparentDepends on the border. In most democracies, and at most borders, and in most LE cases, there is a line between “destruction of my own property/data” and “destruction of evidence,” where the latter usually needs a court document notifying the subject of the potential charge of their requirement to preserve evidence (for example, a subpoena, or in some cases, a direct request to avoid spoliation). reply myflash13 2 hours agorootparentTheory. This is not how things work in practice, even in \"democracies\". Speaking as a person who has been harassed at the US border from Canada many times, I've learned it depends more on how the border agent \"feels\" about you. These people are often uneducated bullies who don't know or don't care about the law anyway. And if you start objecting on some legal basis, they can legally make things a LOT harder for you, including simply denying entry for no reason (yes, they have such a right). Better to cooperate rather than give the appearance of \"destroying evidence\" (even if completely legal) or you're in for a world of hurt if you got the wrong guy. reply darkwater 1 hour agorootparentWella, if you are a \"normal person\" with actually nothing to hide, yes, cooperating as much as you can is probably the best thing to do.

No, but the border agents also aren't required to let you into the country. (Generally unless you are a citizen.) So border agents are very different than general laws of the country because while there may be legal protections about what they may be able to force you to do there are much less protections about when you have the right to pass the border (other than entering countries where you are a citizen). reply wutwutwat 33 minutes agorootparentI never said anything about crossing a border.

I believe in most countries, customs can inspect your luggage. They can’t force you to reveal information that they’re not even certain you have. Under your situation, the best idea is to simply have a wiped device.

That is, I should be able to backup my phone to my home computer (or cloud I guess) and then wipe my phone or selectively delete contents.

You only store what you absolutely need to store on there, if anything, and basically assume it’s compromised the second it leaves your sight. The advantage of a burner phone is that it can’t contain anything important, because you’ve never put anything important on it, or connected it to any system that contains important data.

Why can't it just go into this state without rebooting? I think the reason is to make sure anything from RAM is wiped completely clean. Things like the password should be stored in the Secure Enclave (which encryption keys stored in RAM are derived from) but a reboot would wipe that too + any other sensitive data that might be still in memory. As an extra bonus, I suppose iOS does integrity checks on boot too, so could be a way to trigger that also. Seems to me like a reboot is a \"better safe than sorry\" approach which isn't that bad approach. reply gizmo686 12 hours agorootparentReboots don't typically wipe RAM. Although wiping ram is relatively easy if you are early enough in the boot process (or late enough in the shutdown process). reply johncolanduoni 8 hours agorootparentI'd expect that the RAM encryption key is regenerated each boot, so the RAM should be effectively wiped when the key from the previous boot is deleted from the memory controller. reply bayindirh 8 hours agorootparentprevWith ASLR and tons of activity happening during the boot process, it's almost guaranteed that you'll damage the keys you need. Plus, we don't know how shutdown processes are done. It might be wiping the keys clean before resetting the processor. reply diggan 3 hours agorootparentprev> Reboots don't typically wipe RAM. Typically yeah, I think you're right. But I seem to recall reading that iOS does some special stuff when shutting down/booting related to RAM but of course now I cannot find any source backing this up :/ reply spijdar 16 hours agoparentprevThe short answer to your last two questions is that “before first unlock” is a different state from requiring the PIN/passcode. On boot, the decryption keys for user profile data are not in memory, and aren’t available until they’re accessed from the security coprocessor via user input. The specifics depend on the device, but for Pixel devices running GrapheneOS you can get the gist of it here: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption The important distinction is that, before you unlock your phone for the first time, there are no processes with access to your data. Afterwards, there are, even if you’re prompted for the full credentials to unlock, so an exploit could still shell the OS and, with privilege escalation, access your data. Before first unlock, even a full device compromise does nothing, since all the keys are on theand inaccessible without the PIN. reply dwaite 16 hours agoparentprev> Why can't it just go into this state without rebooting? Because the state of the phone isn't clean - there is information in RAM, including executing programs that will be sad if the disk volume their open files are stored on goes away. If your goal is to get to the same secure state the phone is in when it first starts, why not just soft reboot? reply TimeBearingDown 14 hours agorootparentthis also clears out deeper OS rootkits if they could not achieve reboot persistence, which is not uncommon. reply bonyt 17 hours agoparentprev> 1. surely unconditionally rebooting locked iPhones every 3 days would cause issues in certain legit use cases?

Why can't it just go into this state without rebooting? 1. Getting there reliably can be hard (see the age-old discussions about zero-downtime OS updates vs rebooting), even more so if you must assume malware may be present on the system (how can you know that all that’s running is what you want to be running if you cannot trust the OS to tell you what processes are running?) 2.

The big issue with most platforms out there (x86, multi-vendor, IBVs etc.) is you can't actually trust what your partners deliver. So the guarantee or delta between what's in your TEE/SGX is a lot messier than when you're apple and you have the SoC, SEP, iBoot stages and kernel all measured and assured to levels only a vertical manufacturer could know. Most devices/companies/bundles just assume it kinda sucks and give up (TCG Optal, TPM, BitLocker: looking at you!) and make most actual secure methods optional so the bottom line doesn't get hit. That means (for Android phones) your baseband and application processor, boot rom and boot loader might all be from different vendors with different levels of quality and maturity, and for most product lifecycles and brand reputation/trust/confidence, it mostly just needs to not get breached in the first year it's on the market and look somewhat good on the surface for the remaining 1 to 2 years while it's supported. Google is of course trying hard to make the ecosystem hardened, secure and maintainable (it has been feasible to get a lot of patches in without having to wait for manufacturers or telcos for extended periods of time), including some standards for FDE and in-AOSP security options, but in almost all retail cases it is ultimately an individual manufacturer of the SoC and of the integrated device to make it actually secure, and most don't since there is not a lot of ROI for them. Even Intel's SGX is somewhat of a clown show... Samsung does try to implement their own for example, I think KNOX is both the brand name for the software side as well as the hardware side, but I don't remember if that was strictly Exynos-only. The supply chain for UEFI Secure Boot has similar problems, especially with the PKI and rather large supply chain attack surface. But even if that wasn't such an issue, we still get \"TEST BIOS DO NOT USE\" firmware on production mainboards in retail. Security (and cryptography) is hard. As for what the difference is in BFU/AFU etc. imagine it like: essentially some cryptographic material is no longer available to the live OS. Instead of hoping it gets cleared from all memory, it is a lot safer to assume it might be messed with by an attacker and drop all keys and reboot the device to a known disabled state. That way, without a user present, the SEP will not decrypt anything (and it would take a SEPROM exploit to start breaking in to the thing - nothing the OS could do about it, nor someone attacking the OS). There is a compartmentalisation where some keys and keybags are dropped when locked, hard locked and BFU locked, the main differences between all of them is the amount of stuff that is still operational. It would suck if your phone would stop working as soon as you lock it (no more notifications, background tasks like email, messaging, no more music etc). On the other hand, it might fine if everything that was running at the time of the lock-to-lockscreen keeps running, but no new crypto is allowed during the locked period. That means everything keeps working, but if an attacker were to try to access the container of an app that isn't open it wouldn't work, not because of some permissions, but because the keys aren't available and the means to get the keys is cryptographically locked. That is where the main difference lies with more modern security, keys (or mostly, KEKs - key encryption keys) are a pretty strong guarantee that someone can only perform some action if they have the keys to do it. There are no permissions to bypass, no logic bugs to exploit, no 'service mode' that bypasses security. The bugs that remain would all be HSM-type bugs, but SEP edition (if that makes sense). Apple has some sort of flowchart to see what possible states a device and the cryptographic systems can be in, and how the assurance for those states work. I don't have it bookmarked but IIRC it was presented at Black Hat a year or so ago, and it is published in the platform security guide. reply pnw 18 hours agoprevGreat writeup!

Clearly it’s not critical to their security model so maybe just for IP protection? reply jonpalmisc 17 hours agoparentThey have a long history of encrypting firmware. iBoot just stopped being decrypted recently with the launch of PCC, and prior to iOS 10 the kernel was encrypted too.

For people who don’t leave the house that often and have other Apple devices, this suddenly becomes much more frequent. reply saagarjha 10 hours agoparentprevBecause it harms the user experience. reply Wowfunhappy 7 hours agorootparentI'm sure this is why but I had the same thought as GP. Under what circumstances would 24 hours be disruptive, but three days would be okay? If you're using the iPhone as some type of IoT appliance, either time limit would be disruptive. But if you e.g. enable Guided Access, the phone will stay unlocked and so shouldn't reboot. If you're using the iPhone as a phone, who the heck doesn't touch their phone in 24 hours? Maybe if you're on some phone-free camping trip and you just need the iPhone with you as an emergency backup—but in that case, I don't think Inactivity Reboot would be particularly disruptive. Maybe Apple will lower the window over time? reply jjallen 10 hours agorootparentprevHow though? Users haven't used their phone in a day or more?

The law enforcement document's conclusion that the reboot is due to phones wirelessly communicating with each other is implausible. The older iPhones before iOS 18 likely rebooted due to another reason, such as a software bug. reply zarzavat 7 hours agorootparentIf you think about it, if the attacker is sophisticated enough to break the phone within a 72 hour window, then they are definitely sophisticated enough to use a faraday container. So communication between phones wouldn't help very much. Moreover, you'd have to have some inhibitory signal to prevent everybody's phones restarting in a crowded environment, but any such signal could be spoofed. reply threeseed 19 hours agoprevI suspected this was being managed in the Secure Enclave. That means it's going to be extremely difficult to disable this even if iOS is fully compromised. reply karlgkk 18 hours agoparentIf I’m reading this right: Reboot is not enforced by the SEP, though, only requested. It’s a kernel module, which means if a kernel exploit is found, this could be stopped. However, considering Apple’s excellent track record on these kind of security measures, I would not at all be surprised to find out that a next generation iPhone would involve the SEP forcing a reboot without the kernels involvement. what this does is that it reduces the window (to three days) of time between when an iOS device is captured, and a usable* kernel exploit is developed. * there is almost certainly a known kernel exploit out in the wild, but the agencies that have it generally reserve using them until they really need to - or they’re patched. If you have a captured phone used in a, for example, low stakes insurance fraud case, it’s not at all worth revealing your ownership of a kernel exploit. Once an exploit is “burned”, they distribute them out to agencies and all affected devices are unlocked at once. This now means that kernel exploits must be deployed within three days, and it’s going to preserve the privacy of a lot of people. reply toomuchtodo 18 hours agorootparentWould be nice if Apple would expose an option to set the timer to a shorter window, but still great work. reply alwayslikethis 18 hours agorootparentIn GrapheneOS, you can set it to as little as 10 minutes, with the default being 18 hours.

Change shutdown to \"restart\". reply KennyBlanken 17 hours agorootparentYou clearly haven't tried it or even googled it - because it's impossible to do it unattended. A dialog pops up (and only when unlocked) asking you to confirm the reboot. It's probably because they were worried users might end up in a constant reboot/shutdown cycle, though presumably they could just implement a \"if rebooted in the last hour by a script, don't allow it again\" rule. reply jojobas 18 hours agorootparentprevOr to disable it entirely. Someone could set up and ipad to do something always plugged in, would be bloody annoying to have it locked cold every three days. reply stephen_g 17 hours agorootparentI’m not sure, but I wouldn’t expect the inactivity timeout to trigger if the device was already in an unlocked state (if I understand the feature correctly) so in kiosk mode or with the auto screen lock turned off and an app open I wouldn’t expect it to happen. reply jojobas 17 hours agorootparentMaybe you want it locked and only showing notification headers. reply stephen_g 16 hours agorootparentHaving to put your passcode in every three days is not the end of the world.

Why would you even need to disable the reboot timer in this case? reply karlgkk 15 hours agorootparentHypotdthically, I suppose there's value in disabling the timer if you're, for example, waiting for a SEP exploit that only works if in an AFU state? But, I don't know where the idea of disabling a reboot timer came in? I'm only simply saying that now, you have to have a kernel exploit on hand, or expect to have one within three days - a very tall order indeed. reply KennyBlanken 17 hours agorootparentprev> * there is almost certainly a known kernel exploit out in the wild, but the agencies that have it generally reserve using them until they really need to - or they’re patched. There's literally emails from police investigators spreading word about the reboots, which state that the device goes from them being able to extract data while in AFU, to them not being able to get anything out of the device in BFU state. It's a bit pointless, IMHO. All cops will do is make sure they have a search warrant lined up to start AFU extraction right away, or submit warrant requests with urgent/emergency status. reply karlgkk 17 hours agorootparentI sort addressed this in my original comment but local police likely do not have access to an AFU vuln, and generally get it after it’s been patched. Then, they go on an unlocking spree. This prevents that reply grahamj 18 hours agorootparentprev> Reboot is not enforced by the SEP, though, only requested. It’s a kernel module, which means if a kernel exploit is found, this could be stopped. True. I wonder if they've considered the SEP taking a more active role in filesystem decryption. If the kernel had to be reauthenticated periodically (think oauth's refresh token) maybe SEP could stop data exfiltration after the expiry even without a reboot. Maybe it would be too much of a bottleneck; interesting to think about though. reply karlgkk 15 hours agorootparent> If the kernel had to be reauthenticated periodically (think oauth's refresh token) If the kernel is compromised, this is pointless I think. You could just \"fake it\". SEP is already very active in filesystem encryption. The real important thing is evicting all sensitive information from memory. Reboot is the simplest and most effective, and the end result is the same. reply dmitrygr 18 hours agorootparentprev> Reboot is not enforced by the SEP, though, only requested We (the public) do not know if SEP can control nRST of the main cores, but there is no reason to suspect that it cannot. reply karlgkk 15 hours agorootparentWe actually do know, it cannot directly*. What it could do is functionally disable RAM, but that would basically cause the phone to hard lock and even cause data corruption in some limited cases. This is still being actively researched.

If you were to allow a user to change it, you'd have to safeguard the channel by which the users' desired delay gets pushed into the SE against malicious use, which is inherently hard because that channel must be writable by the user. Therefore it opens up another attack surface by which the inactivity reboot feature itself might be attacked: if the thief could use an AFU exploit to tell the SE to only trigger the reboot after 300 days, the entire feature becomes useless. It's not impossible to secure this - after all, changing the login credentials is such a critical channel as well - but it increases the cost to implement this feature significantly, and I can totally see the discussions around this feature coming to the conclusion that a sane, unchangeable default would be the better trade-off here. reply axxto 3 hours agorootparent> if the thief could use an AFU exploit to tell the SE to only trigger the reboot after 300 days, the entire feature becomes useless Then why not simply hardcode some fixed modes of operation?

Why Ondsel is closing down From the beginning, we knew competing with commercial CAD would be tough. Closed-source CAD is taught in schools and is deeply entrenched in established industry use. We knew that to be successful, we would have to find a way to provide real value and coexist in environments where other tools are already used. While seeking a scalable and repeatable business model, we conducted numerous surveys and interviewed nearly a hundred mechanical engineers, service engineers, tinkerers, inventors, workshop owners, and other users. While we found support among independent and hobbyist users who genuinely wanted us to succeed, we failed to find commercial adoption to justify a venture-capitalized startup. Ultimately, we could not find a product-market fit and ran out of runway to continue the search. Things we are proud of While we have failed to build a sustainable commercial business around FreeCAD, we have accomplished many things. A better FreeCAD application We contributed a new integrated assembly workbench that was sorely missing in the program and a 3D constraints solver on which the workbench relies. We also contributed significant improvements to the usability of Sketcher and TechDraw. We introduced VarSets — a brand-new custom properties system. We introduced new features to TechDraw and CAM workbenches. Beyond FreeCAD itself, we contributed to third-party addons like SheetMetal. Lens as a service for connected CAD We demonstrated what a connected CAD experience could look like with open source at its core. We built a service that enabled teams to organize iterated development of hardware products. We built a simple way to share your models publicly or privately, including PIN protection for share links. We made it possible to publish parametric models online that you can modify and download. Between our May release (2024.2) and today alone, 145 pull requests by the Ondsel team have been merged into the upstream codebase, making FreeCAD 1.0 a more featureful and polished release than we all hoped it would be. Our relationship with the FreeCAD community Having a commercial partner working on FreeCAD also meant that the project had to adapt. Our presence and cooperation affected how the FreeCAD project operates. Our blog brought attention to missing features and helped the project establish priorities. Working with the core maintainers, we improved the contribution process, sped up the merge process, and helped form the Design Working Group and the new CAD Advisory Group. These are significant advances that will benefit the community for a long time. Most of all, we showed that a commercial partner can be an asset to the project. We hope many more entrepreneurs will build around FreeCAD in the spirit of cooperation to establish a robust ecosystem that benefits the world and is profitable. What happens to Ondsel ES OES was designed to be our flavor of FreeCAD with more pleasing UX/UI, frequent releases, and added value. Part of the better UX/UI was our improvements to Sketcher and TechDraw—all users of FreeCAD 1.0 will enjoy those. We owe much of the praise for the UI to Joe Sardos, who designed OpenTheme. We didn’t fund that project, but we pushed it on our users, and they loved it. So we think Joe did a spectacular job, and we cannot thank him enough for that. The added value we shipped as part of OES is all available as free and open-source code, and most of it will be part of FreeCAD. As such, there is no point in releasing v2024.3. However, we are not abandoning the FreeCAD community. Brad will continue hacking in the CAM workbench, Pierre will likely continue working on Assembly and Sketcher, and Pieter will keep working on varsets and variant parts thanks to grants issued by the FreeCAD Project Association. All future contributions to FreeCAD by our former team members will now go directly to the upstream project. We have yet to submit a few improvements to FreeCAD, namely the reloadable objects feature, which we strongly believe should be a core feature. We will submit this as a PR to upstream. What happens to the user base We will notify customers and users of the shutdown. The server will continue running for a reasonable period to give users time to download their data. If you have any projects on Lens that you haven’t backed up anywhere else, please download them as soon as possible. Paying customers will be reimbursed for any remaining time on their subscription.

And you left FreeCAD much better off than when you found it. For that reason, Ondsel may be shutting down, but it is anything but a failure. reply loufe 7 hours agoprevEvery time I have a personal project and want to make a simple CAD drawing of a building or a simple model, as I would using AutoCAD at work, I go through the same song and dance. I look around at the options online, my jaw hangs open at the cost of any commercial CAD subscription/licence, then I get frustrated by a glaring lack of functionality or useability while trying some free/open source solution, and resort to a 30 day trial or MSPaint/paper. Some of the comments already mention how blender's existence is predicated upon it filling a niche in certain senses, instead of trying to achieve feature parity with an entrenched giant. That makes sense, and it's unfortunate, as this space could use an open source option with Blender's polish. In my own industry, mining, I am certain some commercial interests would happily make their product an extension/plugin for a polished FreeCAD (or other), were it at that point. reply jitl 5 hours agoparentHave you tried OnShape? It’s not open source but it is totally free for hobby use. reply encom 3 hours agorootparentI hate it because it's a website. I want actual software.

I want to draw out diagrams for each of the circuits in my house and none of the free options are good enough. reply snake42 3 hours agorootparentWhat did you end up using? I wanted to make diagrams for an embedded system circuit I made and ended up using PowerPoint. All of the free options seem to be focused exclusively on PCB design and not making nice graphics. Fritzing which is what a lot of people recommend is now a paid for application. reply etimberg 3 hours agorootparentI haven't found anything ideal that's opensource. draw.io + some custom images for the electrical symbols lets me get good enough though reply ics 3 hours agorootparentI posted and then deleted a comment as I was going to ask if you'd tried draw.io. Even when I worked in electrical design (infra+industrial), it was my go-to sketching tool to have open next to -CAD. What would you do to improve it for your use case, or are you lamenting that it isn't open source either? reply etimberg 3 hours agorootparentIt would be perfect if the symbols I wanted were already built in. There are some electrical symbols but they're very much circuit design focused whereas I'm looking for symbols such as these https://www.edrawmax.com/templates/1011842/ Additionally, https://github.com/jgraph/drawio/issues/1660 would be a nice to have. reply ics 2 hours agorootparentDefinitely having built-in symbols for it would be nice. Regarding a titleblock, I found that custom data attributes on symbols and page backgrounds can accomplish as much as I would even need. Create a page in your document called \"Titleblock\", format it and place dummy content if desired. For each \"sheet\", just select it from Page Background (you can set an image, URL, or another page in the diagram). For filling out information which varies, just have one titleblock symbol and add Placeholders for the custom data attributes which you add to it as well. (See: https://www.drawio.com/blog/placeholders) This is a common workflow in CAD as well just with different terms; i.e. a linked titleblock layout used for all sheets and a block inserted into the actual drawing with the attributes filled out. reply HeyLaughingBoy 54 minutes agorootparentprevOh god, please don't use Fritzing. I absolutely despise those useless diagrams. Actually, less than useless because they're often outright misleading. Learn to draw actual electronic schematics. It's a bit of a learning curve, but not very steep. Use KiCad for schematics; you don't have to use the PCB design tool. reply WillAdams 3 hours agoparentprevWhy not just us a vector drawing program such as Inkscape?

Not OSS but its a one time $200 purchase - sorta surprising you can still buy software these days :-P Alibre is more of a professional tool like Fusion 360, so there is some learning curve. 1. https://www.alibre.com/ reply hahamrfunnyguy 1 hour agorootparentI second Alibre, I am using the pro version. I bought it in 2012, and I can't remember if I've paid for upgrades to keep it current since then. I used it to design an injection mold and I am still using it for 3d printing projects. It's a capable program and on-par with SolidWorks or Inventor for basic modeling. I haven't tried OnShape yet, but if I didn't have Alibre I'd probably look into that or another web-based program for new hobby projects. I like the idea of perpetual licenses but it's only perpetual for as long as it runs on your operating system. reply mech422 1 hour agorootparentI just can't get into the web based ones...I don't know why but they all seem slow and clunky to me. One thing I didn't like about alibre is the lack of Linux (or Mac) version, as I plan on ditching MS once my win10 box is unusable - I have no interest in that new AI crap MS is adding. reply WillAdams 3 hours agorootparentprevTheir Workshop CAM module is a re-badged MeshCAM v9 as of current versions. There is also a higher-end option I believe, but it's way out of my price range. reply mech422 2 hours agorootparentI did the free trial and it seemed ok - but I had too many bad habits from fusion...one thing that always tripped me up was the limit of 1 sketch per 'part'(?). It seemed to enforce 'best practices' much more then Fusion does, and I just tinker with hobby projects. They were very attentive though, and even called a few times to see how I was doing... Also, I really liked the 1 time purchase vs. subscription reply criddell 5 hours agorootparentprevThere's also Fusion 360 that's free for personal use. SolidWorks is better and worth $50 / year if you use it a few times, but for a one-off project, Fusion 360 is pretty good. reply rounce 4 hours agorootparentThe issue I found with Fusion360 is that I don’t own my files. You used to be able to export locally but last I used it (a few years ago now) I was unable to export a file in a native fusion format with saving to the Autodesk cloud being my only option. This is hazardous as not only am I now at the mercy of Autodesk but they also expire files after just under a year so in need to ensure I’m logging into my account regularly just to keep some things that could happily live on a local disk. reply criddell 3 hours agorootparentThey are on your disk somewhere. Search for files with an f3d extension and you will should be able to find them. You should also be able to export an f3d archive as long as it’s a standalone design (ie not linked to other designs). reply joombaga 3 hours agorootparentprevYou can export locally. I'm pretty sure you could a few years ago too. They really push you to the cloud, but I use Fusion360 completely locally. Really wish there was a non-subscription Solidworks though. reply KeplerBoy 5 hours agorootparentprevSure, I'm just slightly biased against Fusion since I was trained using Solidworks in high school and it became second nature for a while. Give me a copy of SW 2012 and I can model anything technical I can imagine. reply rleigh 1 hour agorootparentprevAnd Siemens SolidEdge is totally free for hobbyist use. reply paulddraper 4 hours agorootparentprevNote: This is a bit of a \"secret menu item\" (not really but not well advertised). It's available to people making less than $2k/yr from projects. If you make more than $2k/yr, you need to pay standard prices, which start at $2.8k/yr. reply pc86 4 hours agorootparent\"If you make $1,999 you owe us $50, if you make $2,001 you owe us $2,800\" seems so obviously ridiculous it has to be wrong. Right? reply KeplerBoy 4 hours agorootparentWell, it's a non-commercial license. The $2000 limit is already kind of generous, especially since it's a profit limit and not a revenue limit. Without having read the fineprint you could make a lot of revenue as long as you keep reinvesting the money into stuff related to your solidworks side-hustle (buying 3D printers, material, CNC machines, workstations, whatever). reply paulddraper 1 hour agorootparentprevIt would seem so, but no, that is \"correct.\" reply dani__german 2 hours agoparentprevWhile I would never suggest it, in case of emergency, most professional CAD programs can be found online on torrent websites. reply DanTheManPR 2 hours agorootparentI've had multiples of my students get into legal trouble over the years from using these. Just understand that almost all of these professional level software packages phone home even after being cracked, so you basically have to airgap your computer if you use them. It's a major reason why I steer them towards open source CAD packages, and towards the pro level CAD packages with usable free hobby licensing. reply raxxorraxor 2 hours agorootparentThe real functionality of a software firewall is to stop your own software from phoning home. It is sad, that this has become a normal occurrence. Sometimes they phone home for good reasons, very often they do not. Although I doubt it can get you into legal trouble if you use cracked software. You can get into trouble if you have been found torrenting them however. reply edm0nd 2 hours agorootparentprevYou are basically also pushing people into malware/malicious files with such a statement. reply schaefer 11 hours agoprevTruly bummed about this one. I’d been learning CAD with Ondsel, and have printed off half-a-dozen of my models to help around the house. If this comment finds its way to the team, I just want to say thanks. The topo naming fix and the assembly workbench were enormous contributions to the community that will be with us always. But I really believed in Ondsel’s vision for an online repo for 3d models. reply WillAdams 4 hours agoprevFor a long while, I was trying to track CAD applications for a wiki for a then opensource CNC: https://web.archive.org/web/20211126210706/https://wiki.shap... (trying to get that back into shape at: https://old.reddit.com/r/shapeoko/wiki/cad ob. discl., I work for Carbide 3D) and FreeCAD seemed simultaneously the most ambitious, and the most promising --- hopefully v1.0 will pay off on that, and result in a tool which can be used widely --- but it will eventually need some sort of commercial support. Ondsel seemed a good fit for that, and it's unfortunate that they didn't make it. Notable other options include: - Solvespace --- a venerable and simple tool, it is barebones to the extent that many folks won't be able to accept it - Dune 3D --- this is an incredibly elegant and usable tool, which I hope FreeCAD will look to in terms of UI, previously discussed here previously: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37979758 and https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40228068 - BRL-CAD --- _the_ venerable choice, but the interface is so old school and programming-like, most folks won't even consider it - OpenSCAD --- 3D modeling for programmers --- the great thing about it is, anything which one can describe mathematically can be modeled --- the awful thing about it is, what one can model is limited by one's mathematical knowledge. A further concern is that DXFs from it are just polylines, no arcs --- I've been working to address that using OpenPythonSCAD at: https://github.com/WillAdams/gcodepreview LibreCAD is workable for 2D, though I only use it for file conversion. The other notable options are OnShape (free for public designs), Alibre (quite affordable), Solidworks for Makers (for values which include non-commercial usage watermarking). reply pbronez 4 hours agoparentOpenSCAD is my go-to. It's self-contained and AI coding tools know the syntax well enough to help you move fast. Unfortunately I keep hitting a complexity ceiling. If it doesn't like how I'm describing something, it crashes. I have to load an older version of my .scad and try a new approach. This usually happens 70% of the way into a complex project, which is quite discouraging. The Python ecosystem has CadQuery[0] and a few other tools built around the Open Cascade kernel[1] which is quite good in my limited experience. CadQuery is positioned as an OpenSCAD alternative [2], and I really want it to be. Unfortunately the user experience isn't there yet. Making an object with CadQuery is writing a Python program. Which means you need a Python environment and dev setup. CQ-editor [3] is nice, but needs a Python environment first. I think CadQuery would be much more viable OpenSCAD alternative if it was packaged into a standalone CQ-editor application and published via homebrew, etc. I'm also interest in Zoo [4](fka KittyCAD). They're trying to create a modelling tool that combines model-by-code and model-by-mouse. With some AI layered on top. They have an interesting architecture where they stream geometry to your local device from the cloud. Should be great for performance, but ties you to the cloud.

The KittyCAD stuff seems almost perfect --- will definitely be looking more closely at it reply elashri 11 hours agoprevSometimes I envy that although I am not a SWE. I work in a field that is so close with the open source and tech scene that we don't have to rely on commercial products like some other fields. It is hard to compete or gain enough interest in some fields of engineering to any open or free solutions. reply kiba 10 hours agoparentPerhaps you mean proprietary. Ondsel is after all a commercial project. The fact remains that proprietary software seem to be a license to print money, and with the ability to print money is the ability to entrench said software, such as heavy investment in software development. This is a uphill battle for open source software, but it seems that open source software tend to keep improving in the long run. reply shiroiushi 10 hours agorootparent>with the ability to print money is the ability to entrench said software, such as heavy investment in software development. It seems like proprietary software has a big advantage when there's still lots of room for improvement, so that investment in further development pays off. However, in some cases, there's little room for real improvement, and the thing becomes a \"solved problem\" for the most part. At this point, the proprietary companies then start enshittifying the software (look at Photoshop, now a cloud-based program) to try to extract more money from users, and to keep users on the upgrade treadmill. Part of this is probably from the way corporate politics work: when you're a manager with a team in place, you need something to keep that team busy, to justify your team's continued employment to upper management, so when you run out of useful improvements to make, you invent less-than-useful \"improvements\" (e.g., ugly new UIs). This is where FOSS seems to be able to do well: it doesn't need to waste resources on useless improvements (we'll ignore GNOME for a moment as an exception), and can just focus on delivering the necessary functionality. Once that's done, it can just go into maintenance mode and people can move on to other projects. Until then, it can continue to improve and attract users to switch from the enshittifying proprietary stuff. reply pjmlp 10 hours agorootparentGNOME, several reboots of the audio stack, XWindows versus Wayland,... FOSS only does well when it isn't the main source of income for contributors. reply shiroiushi 9 hours agorootparentWayland has its issues to be sure, but the X Window System was no longer suitable for modern systems; the justification for replacing it was quite sound. GNOME I'll heartily agree on. But I've never liked GNOME myself (v1 seemed OK though) and have always criticized that project. I've always been a KDE fan, though admittedly they've had some similar problems and have handled some major changes rather poorly (esp. 4.0). Really, the desktop environments are one place where FOSS hasn't really done that well, frequently re-inventing the wheel for questionable reasons, or adopting questionable new design philosophies. At least there's a fair amount of competition in the space, so if one project rubs you the wrong way, you can try another; this proliferation of competitors also shows just how much disagreement there is in the community on this particular matter. I really don't know enough about the audio stack changes; I can only guess that they found big problems with older solutions there which required major architectural changes, esp. for certain high-performance applications. reply pmontra 9 hours agorootparent> this proliferation of competitors also shows just how much disagreement there is in the community on this particular matter It is to be expected that there is a proliferation of different UIs if there is the possibility of making different UIs run on the same OS. The reason is that everybody has a different workflow, different aesthetic preferences, different ways of doing things (e.g.: leaning more toward keyboard, mouse, touchpad, touchscreen). The best thing I remember in this space were the dozen or so X11 windows managers of the 90s. The worst one is the single UIs for Windows and Macs. There are some ways to customize them but not as heavily as it is possible with Linux. Wayland seems to restrict what's possible to customize but I might be wrong because I have no direct experience. I'm still of X11 because of an old NVIDIA card and frankly I could stay on X11 forever. I know that I'll have to switch sooner or later because of software compatibility. I'd hate to have to buy a new laptop only to be able to run Wayland. It's still good enough to work with me for my customers. reply pjmlp 9 hours agorootparent> The worst one is the single UIs for Windows and Macs. There are some ways to customize them but not as heavily as it is possible with Linux. Which is why Windows and Mac still get native UIs for many desktop products, while Linux if a product actually targets it, gets Electron. reply vetinari 3 hours agorootparentDo they? There's no lack of Electron UIs on Mac and Windows. What's even a native widget library on Mac and Windows today? Do Swift-UI and WinUI (v3 nowadays) count? It's not as clear cut as it was in 2000s. reply pjmlp 3 hours agorootparentYes they do, that is why I clearly mentioned \"still\". Native widget libraries is whatever the OS vendor puts on the SDK, and ships on the installers for their compilers. The large majority of Electron apps that happen to land on Mac and Windows land, usually come from GNU/Linux shops, that also feel like targeting other operating systems, and since that is the solution for GNU/Linux, they dump it into everyone else. In the process they help Google take over the browser ecosystem, and then talk about how M$ used to be all over the place with IE. reply vetinari 3 hours agorootparentNative widgets libraries were historically those, who were only one that knew, how to talk to the display server. So if you wanted to write another widget library, you had to link to them anyway, to use them as a proxy. That's how Qt, for example, runs on Windows or Mac, using the old win32 api or Cocoa. But meanwhile, the OS vendors got creative and pumped out a bunch of new, _more modern_ libraries, which have abilities that the old, \"system\" ones do not have. You want Acrylic design on Windows? Better be satisfied with WinUI -- which, in v3 is the recommended way to write native applications by the platform owner, and which is decoupled from system releases and from Windows SDK. Electron apps are coming from any shop, that want to throw together some installable, locally running app and figured out, that paying HTML+CSS devs is cheaper, than paying C++ (or ObjC) ones. Having shorter development time is also something positive. It has nothing to do with Linux shops; there are Electron apps, that could be running on Linux if there was a will, but aren't (Whatsapp), or almost-electron-but-edge_webview-instead (Teams). reply pjmlp 2 hours agorootparentIn 2024, the recomend ways to write GUIs in Windows are Win32 (your native widgets library), exposed by WinForms. WPF has parity with WinUI 3, in recomended way by the platform owner, officially communicated at BUILD 2024. Doubled down at .NET Conf 2024 during the last week. Regardless of the GUI framework from Apple, and Microsoft, those are managed bindings to the underlying native APIS (Win32 and Cocoa), which is why they also expose handles to do lowlevel stuff if one so desires, coding like 2000. Webviews are a different matter, as they don't require shipping Chrome with the application. It definelty has a lot to do with Linux shops, as they can't be bothered to support GNOME, KDE, Sway, XFCE, or whatever everyone else uses, so Electron it is. And then they want Mac OS and Windows customers as well. reply kombine 9 hours agorootparentprevRollout of Wayland has not been the smoothest and I think among its major issues is the slow pace of development - it took it 10+ years to become default and certain features present in X11 are still missing. Having said that, after I switched to KDE Plasma 6 with Wayland (on Intel and AMD graphics), I've noted a significant improvement in responsiveness and snappiness of the desktop. I know nothing of how Wayland works, but I assume this is the reason the replacement was needed in the first place. I had to replace my GPU from NVIDIA to AMD, but I don't regret it (all my deep learning compute is on the HPC cluster anyway). reply kenniskrag 6 hours agorootparentOne reason was, that the security model wasn't enough anymore. E.g. every application was trusted and can listen to key inputs e.g. steal passwords and credit card infos. Btw there was an issue that screenshotting in wayland was not possible. But easy in X11 because everything was visible. Don't know much about the architecture about wayland but I think grahic driver handling changed in wayland too. reply mavhc 9 hours agorootparentprevDesktop managers have never decided if they want to copy Windows or MacOS, both of which are terrible GUIs that we're now stuck with, using paradigms from 1983/1984 reply shiroiushi 11 hours agoparentprevUnfortunately, I've noticed that non-SW engineers frequently turn their noses up at open-source solutions, and really the entire concept of open-source software, and seem to prefer proprietary solutions, the more expensive the better. I've seen this in the software world too, with embedded systems engineers, though Linux, gcc, etc. has made huge inroads here, though it took decades, and mainly came from the Linux adherents pushing downwards into the embedded space from the desktop space, not from any interest by the existing engineers in the embedded space. Just look, for instance, at FPGAs: almost all the tooling is proprietary, very expensive, and very buggy too. Or look at PCB design: Altium seems to be the standard here still, despite Kicad having made huge advances and by most accounts being as good or even better. It took decades (Kicad started in 1992) for the FOSS alternatives here to really catch on much, and only really because PCBs became cheap enough for hobbyists to design and construct their own (mainly because of Chinese PCB companies), and because CERN contributed some resources. I'm not sure what the deal is with engineers hating collaboratively-developed and freely-available software, but it's a real thing in my experience. It's like someone told them that FOSS is \"socialism\" and they just reflexively dismiss or hate it. reply Vespasian 11 hours agorootparentI wonder whether it is a about quality control and completeness. Pure Software has a lot slack when it comes to delivering incomplete or (in the FOSS world ) even partially incorrect releases. Many issues can be fixed after the fact (even in production) and you can inch closer to a better version as time come goes on. Mechanical engineering oftentimes can't work that way. An \"80% solution machine\" usually doesn't work at all and iteration costs (outside of 3d prototyping) can be staggeringly high. Example: My company produces heavy \"things\" (20tons+) that have tight tolerances in some places. If the design is off by 2mm because of a CAD bug or unexpected/unknown UI the part could be scrap or require an expensive (read manual) rework. There go all your software savings. So why management would love to reduce the staggeringly high costs it's not worth the risk until an alternative is very proven. In many projects customers contractually require is to use a specific solution. reply SirHumphrey 10 hours agorootparentAnd even if the software doesn’t cost you in failed projects it can cost you in other ways. The old meme from 10 years ago about: “Linux being free if your time is free” is largely false for personal usage, but in the corporate environment somebody will have to provide support and with the open source software this is going to be you. People selling B2B software know that so they will usually price things in a way that it is just a bit cheaper to pay them rather then support and retrain staff. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 10 hours agorootparentprevI’m a software guy. I love FOSS. Much of the tooling that I use is FOSS, and oftentimes the software is as good if not better than the proprietary equivalent. Until very recently, this was not the case in hardware world. In many cases it’s still not the case. You will meet all sorts of purists here that will tell you FreeCAD is good enough, for instance. Well, I tried using FreeCAD to build a hardware product. And eventually switched to proprietary software because FreeCAD could not satisfy my use case. I made a genuine effort to use the FOSS variant, but it was not usable for me. I’m more inclined to listen in hardware when someone says the FOSS tools are not good enough after that experience. reply Vespasian 8 hours agorootparentFreeCAD moved from \"barely usable for hobby projects\" to \"yeah maybe if I'm really inclined to try it on a very a simple professional project\". At least that's what my engineering colleague told me recently. Which is a massive improvement and the result of many hours of fixing \"boring\" bugs, improving UX and all the other chores nobody wants to do. But for most commercial work it's not yet there. reply rleigh 10 hours agorootparentprevIt's because these tools are used to deliver high quality physical products on time and on budget with no scope or interest in messing around with software defects. These tools are treated like physical tools. It's worth paying for a high quality one which won't cause unexpected grief, by people who will provide immediate support because we pay them. I think if there were good quality open source equivalents they would be considered, but they pose a huge risk, possibly even an existential risk, if they derail our development plans unexpectedly. Paying a lot of money for seriously good quality tools reduces that risk dramatically. I've had a brief look at FreeCAD, and it's got a lot of potential. But when you compare it with SolidWorks, OnShape or SolidEdge, there's clearly a huge gap in usability and capability which needs closing before a lot of people will be able to consider it seriously. I'm sure it will eventually get there, like KiCAD did, but it will take many years and a lot of investment to get the usability, polish and featureset up to parity. It looks like Ondsel did a really good job to make some progress along that path. reply supermatt 9 hours agorootparent> when you compare it with SolidWorks, OnShape or SolidEdge, there's clearly a huge gap in usability and capability All 3 of these are using the same geometry kernel - siemens parasolid. Most open source CAD software is using OCCT (cascade). It’s the kernel that brings a lot of the capability. Check out “plasticity” (https://www.plasticity.xyz/ ) for an example of a single developers implementation of the parasolid kernel reply jpm_sd 6 hours agorootparentI tried plasticity and found it unusable. I couldn't fathom how to design anything without dimensioning! reply eschneider 8 hours agorootparentprevIt's not even a question of 'good' so much as 'the same as everyone else'. CAD drawing pass through a huge number of hands/companies in the process of getting physical goods made, and any slight compatibility problems can turn into huge costs and lots of blame to go around. It's very much the case that everyone in the supply chain switches over, or nobody does. reply xyzzy123 9 hours agorootparentprevI agree although I feel like one could easily make the exact same comments regarding compilers. I can't quite pin down why there would be many free (for various values of free) industry standard compilers but not cad programs. reply pjmlp 3 hours agorootparentBecause those compilers are mostly sponsored by OS companies to outsource their software development costs in part. Also notice that all compilers for scenarios where liability is actually imposed, like in physical goods, most compilers are closed source, proprietary, and certified. reply whyever 6 hours agorootparentprevOpen Source works best for building blocks of software, not for end products. Companies have incentives to share their libraries and tooling, not so much for the final product like a CAD program. reply robertlagrant 2 hours agorootparentprevSoftware engineers find compilers interesting and useful. reply linsomniac 7 hours agorootparentprevI'm a hobbyist and over the last month have been improving my 3D modeling chops. Because it's a hobby, the cost of the tools hasn't been an issue. I started with Ondsel, and it looks like a really good tool. I went through a couple of hours of a tutorial, and it looked pretty good. But then a friend reminded me of the Fusion 360 hobbyist plans, and I decided to give it a try, just to see. It blew my socks off! It's just a lot more refined. The first 12 minute tutorial took me further than I'd gone in the ~2 hours I did with Ondsel. FreeCAD is an amazing piece of software to be available for free. But in the end Fusion just operated a little more smoothly in lots of little ways. I have really limited time to do 3D modeling, so it's pretty valuable to me to get more done quickly. One temporary thing that's making FreeCAD a bit hard to get started with is that there's not much content out there for learning 1.0, and sifting through out of date content to find it took some work. That'll improve as time goes on. reply leoedin 11 hours agorootparentprevI don't think it's simply \"engineers hate open source\". Most of the open source tools in the embedded space are just a bit crap. The reality is that good software needs many thousands of hours of development time. The embedded space is actually pretty small in development budget terms - so fewer engineers who might devote time - and also there's less overlap in skillset - electronic design engineers rarely have the software skills required to develop EDA software. Most of the incredibly well used robust open source packages are sponsored by large tech companies. The embedded space just hasn't had that kind of sponsorship. reply regularfry 10 hours agorootparentI suspect it's the ways in which they are a bit crap. All software is a bit crap one way or another. FreeCAD's UI is \"a bit crap\". The \"workbench\" metaphor is fine as a metaphor, but the specific way the workbenches are put together in FreeCAD is oriented more towards the way the functionality is implemented than what the user wants to do with it. You have no choice but to understand technical implementation details. That's just one example, but that attitude to UI in FreeCAD is absolutely pervasive. I think that's a general problem in the space. The user interfaces in general aren't designed, they're an outgrowth of the direct implementation of the underlying functionality. reply chefandy 10 hours agorootparentYes. You’ll have a hard time finding a full-time professional photographer that hasn’t tried Gimp, and an even harder time finding one that still uses it. That’s not even getting into graphic designers— Gimp’s typography tools are awful. Open source software that’s useable— more recent blender versions, Inkscape, Firefox, Signal— is the only stuff that’s caught on in large part because they deliberately enfranchise designers. As an experienced, art school trained designer with far more than enough full-time coding experience to implement my own designs, I still exclusively contribute code to FOSS projects as a developer. I’ve seen both sides of this and am perpetually dispirited by the dismissive, haughty, and frankly ignorant attitudes towards designers among many developers. FOSS interfaces are put together by and for people who a) have a working mental model of software functioning, so they reason about interfaces differently, b) know more about the code than the problem domain, c) are used to and pride themselves on learning complex systems based on a set of complex docs. Until changes, user-facing FOSS applications will be used by developers no matter how useful they would be to others. reply robinsonb5 8 hours agorootparentThe sad thing is that the current car-crash state of GIMP's UI is what, 15 years after they received the input of a professional HCI designer? In some ways it's improved a great deal in that timespan, and in others it got significantly worse. To this day it lectures you like some bratty kid playing Simon Says if you try to use File -> Save to save a TIFF image. (Complying with my instruction and then telling me why Export would have been better is fine. Recognising and understanding the instruction but refusing to comply with it is not fine.) > a) have a working mental model of software functioning, so they reason about interfaces differently You're 100% correct, they do reason about interfaces differently, and thus have wants and needs which are different from those of non-technical users. Those wants and needs are not met by mainstream software, but are met in some OSS software, so it should come as no surprise that such types want to defend that software against the incursion of those who want to make it just like the mainstream offerings! Like you I have a slightly different perspective here, having been a hobbyist software developer for some years, but having worked in print and design as a day job. But I still bemoan such things as the awful keyboard handling of the current GTK file dialog, when compared with the old GTK1.2 file dialog. The old one was truly hideous to look at, but handled filtering files by keystroke far better than any current file dialog. reply chefandy 1 hour agorootparent> But I still bemoan such things as the awful keyboard handling of the current GTK file dialog, when compared with the old GTK1.2 file dialog. The old one was truly hideous to look at, but handled filtering files by keystroke far better than any current file dialog. Yeah and I think most UX designers would consider that a bad design though-- developers are users and if it's tough for developers to use, then it needs to be optimized. As someone who's created a few APIs, I know that developing friendly interfaces for developers-- APIs are interfaces that humans need to understand and use-- involves the same blind spots as developing for end users. At first, Microsoft concentrated on developer experience a lot, but I think Apple is probably doing a better job of it now. Their programming environments are products they sell to developers, so they concentrate on making their interfaces smooth(ish) for developers. Additionally, in the discipline of interface design, the visual polish should be a secondary or tertiary concern. Things like gestalt, implied lines, negative space, and type hierarchy are obviously core tools to orient users, especially in very complex interfaces, but the higher-level look-and-feel stuff is often not even handled by the same people in larger design organizations. Even things those higher-level designers might be concerned with-- interaction designers using the subtlest animations to indicate action or intent, for example-- still meaningfully affect software usability, though. It's unfortunate that FOSS projects generally just aren't set up to accept design contributions, but it's not anyone's fault, per se. It just isn't the way the standard FOSS organizational structure evolved-- it was basically like a commercial software dev organization but the lead developer was also the product manager. Without a product manager to balance the design and development needs, design will obviously fall to the wayside. Unfortunately, that's left a pretty hostile environment for designers in FOSS. A lot of FOSS developers get defensively arrogant or combative when I even bring it up, but at this point, I'd rather set my beard on fire standing next to a gas pump than go deep into a usability analysis for a great FOSS tool, all of which I'm willing to implement myself, only to have a defensive dunning-kreuger echo chamber of design \"expertise\" tear my work to shreds without even considering that they might be conflating what they're used to with what's actually good, and they'd almost certainly benefit from change. I get why that happens-- it's just standard social cohesiveness, ego etc. and is not unique to software dev, and it's not their fault that dev culture developed that way. But even though it's not FOSS maintainers fault, if they want non-technical users to use their software, it's certainly not anybody else's responsibility to enfranchise UI designers into their projects if they care about non-technical user adoption. reply shiroiushi 10 hours agorootparentprev> electronic design engineers rarely have the software skills required to develop EDA software. You could say that about many other fields too, but then why do we have great tools like Blender, Krita, Audacity, etc.? Artists and musicians have great software skills, but electronics engineers don't? There's always been a huge overlap between EE and CS degrees, with \"computer engineering\" degrees coming about as a merger of the two fields decades ago, so I find this statement hard to believe. reply ajb 8 hours agorootparentJust a guess, but it could be because the size of EE employers is bimodal.

I'm an EE. I can code. I think I'm pretty good at it. But there's a reason I didn't major in CS, I don't enjoy it all that much and I don't do it as a hobby either. If you believe that those who contribute to FOSS is a small percentage, then I think for non-SW folks you're looking at a small percentage of a small percentage, which means sparingly few contributors which means sparingly few FOSS EDA tools. reply TylerE 10 hours agorootparentprevWell, Blender, at least started as commercial software. It was only open sourced after the foundation was put together to hit the source code out of the bankruptcy. reply kilpikaarna 10 hours agorootparentYes, but Blender at that point was very primitive, both from a features and usability standpoint. What really drove Blender forward in its earlier years were the open movie projects, both as a way of raising funds for development and as a way of putting the software through its paces to find spots that need improvement. Ton Roosendal has been a superbly skillful project leader in other ways too, like finding the right technical areas and features to focus on, putting the needs of the artists/users first, knowing when to set aside his own vision in favor of what the community wants and not undertaking major rewrites until there is enough momentum behind the project to see them through. reply regularfry 10 hours agorootparentprevThat's a long way in the past though, and one of the fascinating things about the Blender project is the way that they have been able to break with their legacy in a way that other projects seem incapable of.

I couldn't even use German Photoshop because some shortcuts are different. Some other tools were barely usable for what I tried to do, so I think it's unfair to single out GIMP, although the old multi-windowed interface was just something else.

Just completely different from anything else. reply regularfry 7 hours agorootparent\"Hard\" is subjective, and part of good UI design is reusing visual cues and affordances that the user has already learned elsewhere. A good UI should be discoverable. Emacs is not that. Nor, for that matter, is FreeCAD. reply chefandy 3 hours agorootparentDiscoverability is a huge problem in lots of FOSS interfaces. Most end users will read exactly zero lines of dedicated software documentation in their entire lives because they don’t have to, and that is a good thing for end users. I find most developers don’t even notice the great interfaces in their lives. Compare how clunky online shopping was in the 90s with a modern food ordering terminal. How many people learn to use Slack without consulting the manual? Now how about IRC? Keep in mind that slack is vastly more complex, and for many things, uses the same command technique and notation as IRC... slash commands, hash tag channels, etc. The designers knew that was a brilliant part of IRC so they embraced it knowing advanced users would be right at home, and new users had alternatives, but would probably come around to the advanced way of doing things eventually. One of the reasons chefs rarely have anything to do with cookbooks they write past the initial set of recipes is because it’s really hard to see things from an inexpert perspective. People ask us things like “how long do I cook [something] and we often have no idea how to answer that question. Knowing how much that can change depending on the heat source, initial ingredient temperature, how long it’s been unrefrigerated, the water content of the pieces you’ve got, the shape of the pieces, etc etc etc, we just say “uh, until it’s done?” But it takes a lot of skill and experience to realize when most things you need to cook are done, so recipe developers and cookbook writers do a ton of testing to figure out about how long it takes to get you 80% of the way there and then give some simple ways to approximately gauge doneness in that context. If they’d learn a few simple things that “aren’t that hard”, they’d have precise, bang-on results like I do, every time. But unless you cook the same things so the time, you’d need to repeat that across all of the different cooking scenarios that require specialized knowledge. Chefs run into that because people want us to tell them how to cook things all the time, so the skill gap is apparent, and we see the value in someone who knows how to address that. It was never really shown to me like that as a developer, so I see why so many get stuck in the “come on, it’s not that hard” mindset, generally. Interface design is conceptually harder, because you need to really consider many skill levels that have different needs. The answer isn’t developers reading some article to “make nicer looking interfaces” or “dumb things down”— which we’ll just piss people off in the end and many of them will be developers assuming it’s an interface designer’s fault. The answer is to deliberately enfranchise designers into the FOSS process to figure out who would benefit from the software, and make an interface that can serve everyone’s needs: inexpert and advanced users alike, if that make sense. You do not have remove advanced functionality to make it useful to non-developer users. So the first step is to put aside the dev nerd machismo for a minute and recognize that designers serve a crucial purpose that isn’t “dumbing things down” or “making things look nice” and that most developers have no idea how to do it themselves. Once that’s a thing, figuring out how to enfranchise designers into FOSS will be the next step. reply KETHERCORTEX 2 hours agorootparent> People ask us things like “how long do I cook [something] and we often have no idea how to answer that question. Yes. Answers like \"until it sounds differently\" just cause more questions while being the actual answers. How the hell am I supposed to explain \"that different sound\". After some time you just start to feel it. reply chefandy 1 hour agorootparentYeah-- it's genuinely hard. I went to culinary school where we discussed this topic at length and one of my classmates (who already had an English degree) is now the managing editor for a household name recipe website, I worked professionally as a chef, I write professionally now, and aced a college food writing course taught by a long-time head restaurant reviewer for the Boston Globe, and I still have a really hard time writing recipes for people that don't have my knowledge. At first blush, it feels like a trivial task-- just like making interfaces did before I went back to school to study design-- but it requires a lot of specialized knowledge and experience that I don't have. I get why developers are perplexed by everyone's insistence that designers take the lead in creating interfaces, but leaving Gimp aside to look at another problematic FOSS UX, consider Mastodon: folks around these parts were proudly and rightfully touting Mastodon as an interface for Activity Pub as an amazing piece of software and technological achievement, but incorrectly claiming its UX was polished enough to replace Twitter. When I'd bring up the near impossibility of non-technical users being willing to figure out how federation worked when there are free options, the dismissals were fast and furious \"I explained federation to my [toddler/grandmother/nontechnical coworker, etc]: it's not that complicated\", \"there's a (ten million word) beginner friendly onboarding doc that explains it all.\" \"Users don't even need to know how federation works if they just pick an instance and sign up.\" I'll bet a lot of friends of developers did a lot of polite smiling and nodding in those weeks, and Opera's Tweets(!) about not being able to find any of her friends on Mastodon was all the evidence you need to prove that most people's most basic use cases-- connecting with and keeping up with friends over the internet-- aren't easily satisfied by Mastodon's UX. If my Grandparents decided they were going to branch out from \"the Face Book\" to try that hot new Mastodon a few years ago during the spike, the likelihood of their progressing through the \"beginner friendly\" wall of text on their onboarding website is about zero. If they did, the first time some mind-bending hentai popped up on their screen, they'd have taken their computer outside and burned it. They would not have taken it as an opportunity to get the prerequisite knowledge they needed to even understand what instance shopping was. My parents would have gotten further, but given how frustrated my engineer father gets with much less confusing ideas because he's used to a whole different sort of technology, I say they'd last about 5 days. You don't get a much simpler task than making a classical French omelet. It's got three ingredients. I can do it in my sleep now-- it all seems very simple. But it was YEARS after culinary school before I got my success rate past like 70%. Being blind to our existing knowledge is natural. That's a good thing when we're working by ourselves, but it's murder when you're figuring out how someone without it approaches the same problem. reply robertlagrant 2 hours agorootparentprevI really think these rants (and italics) are totally unnecessary. Most people see beautiful software every day of the week, and value it. Having said that, no one owes anyone anything. If Emacs wants to be a power tool, let it. I don't expect a construction crane to be safe and easy for me to operate. reply chefandy 58 minutes agorootparentI'm curious: what about the italics, specifically, bothers you? Those are important points or modifiers and italics are a way I draw attention to them. Everyone takes many of the interfaces they use for granted. I certainly do-- I regularly take my phone's simple, clean mail client for granted despite my first mail client being mutt, but it's really, really clean and gives far more features than mutt ever could. (And a phone is one of the few places I would not prefer using vim style editing.) Having had hundreds of discussions with dozens of developers about interface design, I can assure you that they are no different. It's just that developers often have competing needs in software projects, so it turns into a point of contention. In a regular development organization, the product manager or whoever has the final say. In FOSS projects, the maintainers do. If they're not keenly aware of how much more valuable a good, expertly defined interface brings to a piece of software, they're going to make a worse piece of software, unnecessarily. I've served in both roles professionally and have seen these issues from both sides, many times. An organization controlled by designers would probably be even worse. So with the amount of shit I've had slung at me when acting as a software designer, I think what I wrote is a pretty measured addition to a conversation that is very important to me. I see most end-user-facing FOSS software getting absolutely no adoption among non-technical users because it sucks for them to use, and I see a lot of developers not entirely sure why that is and coming up with a bunch of folk explanations like \"commercial software has advertising\" or \"their version is dumbed down and looks pretty and end users are dumb and refuse to read docs.\" I've got important insight into the real reasons why, and as someone that's probably contributed 10k hours of my time to writing FOSS code (admittedly, some of it was paid,) I think I'm entirely justified in sharing it. If you disagree, I'd be interested to hear why, but even if you're not interested in explaining why, I respect your stance on the matter. I apologize if I bothered you with my wording or even just the what I was expressing (seriously), generally, but I failed to bring attention to these ideas presenting them meekly. The Mastodon situation is exactly the sort of thing I was trying to prevent. Not only did Mastodon repel a giant influx of users with it's usability problems-- big and small-- it gave many, if not most of those users the impression that FOSS software is weird, confusing, and exclusively for nerds, and that's the sort of thing that's going to keep open source alternatives alternative instead of having commercial alternatives to the default, free option. reply chefandy 16 minutes agorootparentAdditionally: > Everyone takes many of the interfaces they use for granted. For example, I've seen many people in the HN comments over the years cite the HN interface as evidence that interfaces are better without designers involved, or something similar. In reality, HN has some of the best interface design out there. It does exactly what it needs to do, simply and intuitively, is much easier to visually orient yourself and navigate than a paged forum discussion, despite being compact it's completely obvious where individual elements begin and end using implied lines, type hierarchy, and gestalt rather than adding a bunch of boxes and lines, works great on multiple screen sizes, needs nearly no documentation beyond policy docs... it's a brilliant, clean, polished interface. It even keenly takes its audience into account-- many end users would be fatigued by the loooong lines of text when you fully expand the window and generally prefer a limited width for text blocks, but users that look at a computer text all day long prefer the flexibility of stretching out the lines horizontally to reduce the vertical footprint and get more on their screen at once. That doesn't just happen-- it was deliberately designed that way. Good interface design is very different from good branding and identity design, or similar-- it should be invisible. The choices should seem natural, or even obvious... but how many sites were set up like HN before HN did it? Compare it to Slashdot, the gold standard when HN got up-and-running. Incomparably cleaner and more focused on its core use case, even though it has fewer features and visible controls, which is usually what developers lament the lack of. HN is a great mix between newsgroup/email chain type visuals worked into a forum format, and I hadn't seen anyone else doing that. Many of the interfaces we use that look obviously designed and function poorly were either made by purely visual designers, or developers trying to make something look \"designed\" and using inspo from dribbbbble or whatever. Beautiful looking is quite distinct from optimally usable, and interface designers generally concentrate almost entirely on the latter.

Yes, FPGA tools are a very different matter. I do wonder if this is really lock-in from vendors more than any preference by users, but still, sufficiently motivated users could reverse-engineer things to try to make a single open-source toolset that works with all vendors' FPGAs.

What matters is the features and utility they have. Open-source FPGA design is still extremely, extremely far behind the proprietary alternatives in many dimensions (power support, integration tools, many aspects of simulation and test, general tools like floorplanners, and so on.) That isn't because people aren't trying either. It's just really hard and has limited talent pool. I've spent a lot of time at this point with both toolkits. I use the open source tooling extensively for my own designs. But you tell some grizzled RTL person there's no power analyzer or native SDC support or that UTM was only recently supported in some simulator, and they're going to laugh at you. They've been doing that stuff for 20 years. I know this because I've done it several times (though other people find particular things, like free RTL verification tools, much appreciated.) I think FOSS/software people paint some very rose-tinted picture in their mind where the mere availability of something for $0 would make it an obvious choice, even at only 10% of the functionality. But that's not how people see it in reality. Many people, including engineers, think of it the other way: if it's so good, why is it $0 and how do I know it will keep being developed? They've made their peace with the fact that the $5000 tool will exist practically for as long as they need, get the job done, and be supported. reply hn492912 10 hours agorootparentprevFor non-SW engineers, like myself, software is a means, not an end, and FOSS or not FOSS is irrelevant. To get a EDA tool to a useable condition, and debugged to the point where it is reliable enough to actually use, is just a ton of work. As someone who wants to design circuits, why should I do that work? How will it help me design more circuits? I understand why beginners and casual users don't like them because the EDA tools do have a huge learning curve, but once you're there, they are very productive. For professional engineers the software license is not really a significant barrier. Compared to the cost of labor, materials and equipment it's basically a noop. reply goku12 8 hours agorootparentNone of the points you make is universally true. FOSS means that there is less of a chance of the rug being pulled from under you in the form of subscription services nobody asked for. This has been a repeated annoyance with one certain company which did that recently for an ECAD tool and an MCAD tool. And, there are enough motivated people who do a ton of work to make FOSS software reliable enough. In fact, MCAD is an exception in that area. We have world class FOSS operating systems, 3D animations systems and development tools in an endless list. Even Blender, which was not very popular a decade ago, suddenly gained recognition. FOSS ECAD is on the way and it will happen some day for FOSS MCAD too. Finally the license cost. The cost of proprietary software - especially engineering and scientific software is exorbitant in countries with better purchase power parity. Much less would happen in those sectors in such places if it weren't for the large repository of FOSS software available to them. reply criddell 5 hours agorootparent> rug being pulled from under you in the form of subscription services nobody asked for Businesses like subscription services. It's all about the cash flow. reply moooo99 9 hours agorootparentprev> and FOSS or not FOSS is irrelevant. I don’t think this is universally applicable. I think you can differentiate software by how important it is. Some software is at the very core of your business. A CAD, a ECAD, some lab software or a video editing program. Realistically, if you cannot justify the expensive of that software for your business, you probably don’t have a business. Many of those apps require substantial R&D to get right, something you can only afford if you make real money by building it. But there are other supporting applications that are not as close to your value add as your core apps, but they can still sleep you over real bad if the vendor goes bust or raises prices into the sky. That may be a teams chat app, a mail client, a wiki software. Most of those apps are essentially the infrastructure of any business nowadays and are relatively solved problems. In this area OSS really shines and reduces a lot of the vendor risk. reply wink 5 hours agorootparentprevI get that point, and it's the same in some forms of software development. Take IntelliJ IDEA, it's been around for ages, it's commercial, and it mostly works and thus it's been the default choice for many orgs. But you can't patch it yourself. If anything breaks at your org, you just use another IDE for a week. No big deal. But that's the thing about open source software you run in production - you don't need one of a dozen enlightened people on the planet who understand it, most often, you will find one on your team who is competent enough to backport a fix, or come up with a fix after debugging it. I see it as more of a safety access hatch. reply 20after4 11 hours agorootparentprevThis doesn't really explain any hostility towards open tools but it does explain much of the preference for certain well established commercial packages: The commercial software vendors do a great job of marketing to engineering schools and students. Once you learn some software it's a lot of work to relearn. So if you get people accustomed to your proprietary ecosystem early in their schooling and during the start of the career, you have pretty much hooked them for life. reply WJW 7 hours agorootparentIf that were the case, most of the (academic) software world would still run on Matlab and Borland. Instead, Python has completely taken over that space even without salespeople to push it. Most of the open source CAD stuff is just Not That Good. reply typewithrhythm 10 hours agorootparentprevIf I have two solutions I don't expect to easily work, one is free and one comes with an expensive support contact, then I will weigh the cost of the support against the value of the whole project. Often the support is worth it, because I can have a conversation with someone early in the process. If I commit to open source then I either need to hire an expert (this does not get the same guarantee as a support contract) or live with much more uncertainty. reply Xelbair 10 hours agorootparentprev>I've noticed that non-SW engineers frequently turn their noses up at open-source solutions The problem is that usually open source solutions are really, really rough around the edges from UX perspective - and it could be minor edge cases for programmer! - but for engineer they are a dealbreakers. Look at it from the engineer PoV - they could learn industry standard CAD solution that works, has relatively good(depending who you ask and which version they started with) UI/UX .. and it's something they employer pays for. I worked with civil engineers that tried multiple different 2D CAD software packages and frankly, all of them hate Autodesk as a company, but they still did pick AutoCAD. They did have different preferences for specific AutoCAD version though. Honestly the core problem is that there's no pressure from clients on open source software to have a good UX, because there are no clients - just users and developers. reply robinsonb5 8 hours agorootparentThe other problem is that sometimes from the perspective of an experienced user, \"good UX\" means \"works exactly like the piece of software I've been using on a daily basis for the last 15 years.\" Even if a brand new UI is objectively better, to someone who's invested thousands of hours in becoming fluent, fast and efficient with an existing UI (however quirky or obtuse it might be) the new UI will be an impediment to productivity. reply Xelbair 1 hour agorootparentSure, but that's not unique to open source software. it is a form of soft vendor lock in. reply consp 11 hours agorootparentprevWith respect to cad suites it's push from the top. That starts at education where sweet deals are made to force students to use one specific suite while it should not matter what you use. reply mschuster91 10 hours agorootparentprev> Unfortunately, I've noticed that non-SW engineers frequently turn their noses up at open-source solutions, and really the entire concept of open-source software, and seem to prefer proprietary solutions, the more expensive the better. Well if you're dealing with projects worth 7 figures (or more), it absolutely makes sense to go for a commercial project with SLAs on support. Last thing you want is to hit some showstopper bug, holding up people who earn 4-digit daily compensation, and been told to \"figure stuff out yourself\". If you as the author of a FOSS project that isn't a household name already for historical reasons (like, say, OpenSSL or cURL) and you want it being used by anyone else than hobbyists and universities, you won't get around establishing some sort of corporate infrastructure to sell support contracts. reply bowsamic 10 hours agorootparentprev> Unfortunately, I've noticed that non-SW engineers frequently turn their noses up at open-source solutions, and really the entire concept of open-source software, and seem to prefer proprietary solutions, the more expensive the better. Probably because if you complain about bugs or problems in open-source software, a legion of trolls comes to tell you \"erm, it's open source, you can just implement it yourself\" no matter how skilled the user is at programming. Like, for example, the lead dev of Inkscape, who used to (not sure if he still does) go around on twitter looking up complaints about how slow Inkscape is on macOS and then complain about them being entitled. No wonder they don't want to use it, then, if it's considered rude to even expect the software to work. reply regularfry 10 hours agorootparentYeah, this is a non-trivial effect. It affects FreeCAD too. Mostly contained to the forums, but if you ask a question it's wise to give people who actually know what they're talking about a couple of days to show up. reply bowsamic 8 hours agorootparentI think part of it is also the user knowing that they have no right to express frustration when the product is free. That's actually a mental burden. In a sense, people buy software partly so they feel they have the right to complain when it has issues. And honestly I think that's pretty reasonable reply regularfry 7 hours agorootparentNo, they do have the right to express frustration. What they don't have is the right to demand work from anyone else, but what tends to happen is that communities are on such a hair trigger for the latter that they reject the former even when the frustration is directly caused by a solvable problem. reply bowsamic 3 hours agorootparentWell the thing is, if you buy a product you do have the right to demand work from someone else, and that's why people buy products reply regularfry 26 minutes agorootparentThe important thing for me is for communities not to throw away valuable feedback. That's orthogonal. We can have both. reply mft_ 6 hours agorootparentprevI think you've got the wrong end of the stick. I'd frame it as: people who want to get stuff done and who can't or don't want to have to fight or troubleshoot their software or the system it runs on will often have to choose non-open-source options. Some examples, from my perspective of being an enthusiastic and reasonably tech-savvy hobbyist: * Linux is almost always a huge pain to get running well. In contrast, MacOS almost always just works, and while Windows can be a bit more janky, it very rarely needs countless hours spent on e.g. Ubuntu forums or Stackoverflow trying random fixes until one does (or doesn't) work. Of course there are reasons for this, but it is true. (Will next year be the year of Linux on the desktop?) * Python is something I fundamentally love and use frequently, but I'm not the first to notice the terrible UX when it comes to managing different versions of Python itself, and its packages. Note that virtually every Python-based project on Gibhub (which is lots, thanks to ML) comes with a different set of instructions to get it running, usually based on a different distribution or package manager, thanks to an n+1 problem-solving approach [0] from the Python community. You can often run into huge issues simply installing a single popular package (looking at you, OpenCV). * FreeCAD... I'm an enthusiastic mid-level CADder, and have used several different commercial packages without a problem. FreeCAD is just awful currently - fundamental issues/incompatibilities betewen the different modules within the base system, a terrible ugly UI, an unncecssarily steep learning curve (even for someone well-versed in CAD). And of course the answers to (some of) these problems are suited to the limux hacker - \"oh just install so-and-so's fork instead\". Really? And you're surprised it doesn't take off with the hobbyist community? * Dearpygui.. a lovely, performant GUI for Python, but with such terrible documentation that for anything beyond the (sparse) examples, you have to resort to asking questions on Discord. (They are reponsive and friendly, though.) * GIMP - powerful... and just crappy to use. My basic premise is that most open-source products are designed and coded by hardcore programmers/Linux experts, who are great coders but either don't care about or don't have skills in optimising UI/UX/usability. Maybe it's the much-derided product managers (i.e. not hardcore programmers/Linux experts) who bring usability to a project. Maybe open source needs to work on attracting non-coders to its projects, and be open to listening to their criticism?

Not to mention proprietary graphics drivers (CUDA), CAD tools (Solidworks, Solidedge), mechanical or e&m simulation (comsol, Ansys, xfdtd, wipl-d, etc). A fair number of people use IDL or Matlab too and mathematica is pervasive among theorists. Probably nobody uses Origin anymore. We've gone backwards on documents since everybody is using overleaf now. It's true most of the software we develop, if made public, is open source. reply elashri 1 hour agorootparentYes there are still pockets of proprietary tools but is of limited usage. Most of people in the field is not going to use them (because they don't work on these things). And most of these tools are tied to the hardware and there is increasing adoption like you said for kicad and FreeCAD. There are two exceptions which are theorists love for Mathematica and CUDA for GPU programming on NVIDIA GPUs. For CUDA, it is not bad as you don't pay per usage or don't have contacts, you do this because you purchased NVIDIA GPUs. Which is the best in the world for the use case we have in particle physics experiments. I have never seen someone in the HEP community or Astrophysics using Matlab. Regarding overleaf, it is open source and you can self-host the community edition for free or self-host professional instance and pay subscription. reply winux-arch 3 hours agorootparentprevMost of math also (with the exception if you Matlab for compatibility reason) reply lazulicurio 5 hours agoprevThis is a huge shame.

Other than that, very different. OpenSCAD has limited ambitions; Zoo wants to kill Autodesk. Zoo is building a commercial grade product suite from first principles. They're writing a new geometry kernel and optimizing it for GPUs. They wrote a new domain specific language for CAD [0]. They're running the kernel on the cloud behind an API, streaming video to the client and billing by the server-minute. Ideally that will deliver great performance and keep the tool accessible to casual users. The really exciting thing, for me anyway, is they want to unify design-by-code, design-by-mouse, and design-by-ai. Start with a plain language description of what you want. Get a fully parametric object on your screen. Click around making adjustments. Pull up the code and make precise changes. Keep a complete changelog in git.

The commercial market for CAD cares about CAD that actually works, not free software ideals. FreeCAD is simply not in the same league as commercial CAD like Solidworks, NX, Creo, etc. IMO it's not even in the same league as SolveSpace, at least last time I used it (which was admittedly some years ago). reply LordHeini 9 hours agoparentIt was absolutely worth a try. Blender suffered the same sort of issues as FreeCAD does, but managed to get out of the slump. It is often important to have a main player enforcing proper, unified UI/UX and fix the many small problems and bugs which drive users away. Sadly it is usually an issue with long running and highly complex open source software that it gets really fragmented. You see that in every function having its own button or workspace, inconsistent naming, functions which do the same but slightly different and things working differently depending on some context where they really should not. Thanks to the people from Ondsel it felt like FreeCad would be on a similar route to Blender. It was way more user friendly thankfully there has been major back porting. So there has been a lot of progress especially with the upcoming 1.0. You should give one of the Release Candidates a try. I use it for my 3D printing projects and it works pretty well. reply phoronixrly 9 hours agoparentprevThe parent comment rephrased: 'oh it was a useless effort like any other effort to push open source in CAD'.

Should we just give up instead? reply Double_a_92 7 hours agorootparentI think the main sentiment was more about FreeCAD being extremely bad to use, and not against Ondsel's efforts to make it better.

It doesn't feel like that's happening or if it is, I guess I must be drifting out of touch with what's considered intuitive in user interfaces. It's not just MS either, I feel like the ability to discover what you can do in an app/site any more is hidden by aesthetic choices over functional ones.

If you are handling a stupendous number of small files (say doing an npm build) then metadata operations are terribly expensive on Windows because it is expensive to look up security credentials. Maven is not too different from npm in how it works except instead of installing 70,000 small files it installs 70 moderate sized JAR files that are really ZIP files that encase the little files. It works better in Windows than npm. Npm got popular and they had to face down the problem that people would try building the Linux kernel under WSL and get awful times.

Yes it needed DOS because pre-3.11 Windows versions actually used the DOS kernel for all file access. When 32-bit file access was introduced in WfW 3.11, that was no longer true-but it was an optional feature you could turn off. In all pre-NT Windows versions, Windows is deeply integrated with DOS, even though in 9x/Me that integration is largely for backward compatibility and mostly unused when running 32-bit apps - but still so deeply ingrained into the system that it can’t work without it. IIRC, Microsoft tried to sell the same stripped down single-app-only Windows version to other vendors, but found few takers.

Nobody used that feature, because the result was an overpriced PDP-11. So it seemed reasonable to think that, once the 386 was out, everybody would run 32-bit software on new hardware.

And a fresh SSD that you can set up with a traditional MBR layout instead of GPT layout. Since GPT doesn't work with BIOS, GPT requires UEFI to boot which is prohibitive for DOS. You install DOS on your first partition after formatting it FAT32. Just the same as getting ready to install W9x next. The DOS from W98 is ideal for partitions up to 32GB. After you install W9x next, it's easy to drop back to a DOS console within Windows, or reboot to clean DOS on bare metal, which is what people would often do to run older DOS games. DOS is still fully intact on the FAT32 volume which it shares with W9x as designed. It's basically a factory-multiboot arrangement from the beginning The only problem is, W98 won't install easily if there is more than 2GB of memory. DOS can handle huge memory though (by just neglecting it) so might as well skip W98 unless you have the proper hardware. Very few people would put any form of Windows NT on a FAT32 volume, and IIRC W2k doesn't handle it, but XP performs much better on FAT32 than NTFS, if you can live without the permissions and stuff. Do it anyway, when you install XP intentionally to that spacious (pre-formatted, fully operational) FAT32 volume which already contains DOS, the NT5 Setup routine makes a copy of your DOS/W9x bootsector and autosaves it in the root of your C: volume in a file known not surprisingly as bootsect.dos. And then it replaces the DOS boot routine with a working NT bootsector and uses NTLDR to boot going forward. Most people who migrated from DOS/W9x to WXP started out with XP on NTFS, so users lost FAT32 overnight, and the idea was for DOS, W9x and FAT32 to be taken away from consumers forever. None of the NT stuff would directly boot from DOS bootsectors any more, you ended up with an NT bootsector and NTLDR instead. DOS and W9x don't recognize NTFS anyway, they were supposed to be toast. So if you install both DOS & WXP side-by-side on the same FAT32 partition like this, you can still dual-boot back to DOS any time you want using the built-in NT multiboot menu (which never appears unless there is more than one option to display) where the DOS/W9x bootentry simply points to bootsect.dos and then DOS carries on like normal after that since it's the same FAT32 volume it was before, other than it's new NT bootsector. Too bad there aren't any graphics drivers that XP can use on recent motherboards, so what, say hello to generic low-resolution. I realize nobody ever wanted to skip Windows Vista, sorry to disappoint. Next comes W7. But you would be expected to install from DVD and there's not really drivers for recent PC's. What you would do is boot to the W7 Setup DVD, NOT to upgrade your XP, instead to create a second 32GB partition, format that second partition as NTFS and install W7 to there. The NT6 Setup routine will replace the NT5 bootsector on the FAT32 volume with an NT6 bootsector, and add a new BOOT folder right there beside the NTLDR files on the FAT32 volume. The built in NT6 multiboot menu may not appear unless you manually add a bootentry for NTLDR (which is easy to do), then you would be able to multiboot the factory way to any of the previous OS's since they were still there. W10 is the better choice for a recent PC, do it by booting to the W10 Setup USB. In this case the very first NTFS experience for this lucky SSD is going to be W10, quick while it's not yet obsolete ;) I know people didn't want to skip W8 either :) But if you had W7 or something on your second partition already, you would make a third partition for W10 and it would install like it does for W7. Except there would already be an NT6 BOOT folder in your FAT32 volume, with its associated bootmgr files. You would choose the third partition to format as NTFS and direct the W10 install to No.3. The NT6 Setup routine will end up automatically adding a bootentry for the new W10 into the same NT6 BOOT folder that was there from W7. So you can choose either of the NT6 versions which exist in their own separate partitions, from the factory multiboot menu if you want anything other than the OS that you have chosen as default at the time. As well as the OS's still existing on the FAT32 volume. Oh yeah, once the NT6 BOOT folder is present, you can manually add a bootentry for the DOS you have residing on your FAT32 volume, then you can boot directly to DOS from the NT6 bootmenu without having to drop back to the (previous if present) NTLDR way to boot DOS. Using the same old bootsect.dos file which NT5 had in mind the entire time Now this is vaguely reminiscent of how UEFI boots a GPT-layout SSD from its required FAT32 ESP volume. However UEFI uses only an EFI folder and (unlike Linux) doesn't pay any attention to a BOOT folder if there is one present. But if there is an EFI folder present on an accessible FAT32 volume, UEFI is supposed to go forward using it even if the SSD is MBR-layout and not GPT. You would have to carefully craft an EFI folder for this, but then the same SSD would be capable of booting to NT6 whether you had a CSM enabled or were booting through UEFI. Using the specific appropriate boot folder, either BOOT or EFI depending on motherboard settings. DOS would only be bootable when you have a working CSM option, not depending solely on crummy bare-bones UEFI. You just can't boot to an MBR SSD with SecureBoot enabled. You may even have an extra 64GB of space left over for W11, unfortunately the W11 Setup routine is the one that finally chokes on an MBR SSD. You would have to do W11 some other way, and add it to your NT6 boot menu manually. For extra credit. reply bsaul 9 hours agoprevThere's really something missing today as opposed to the 80s and 90s : back in the days, you had new computer brands coming out every year, with they own OSs and hardware...

Microsoft absolutely played their cards expertly well in the nascent days of the microcomputer, all the way through to the new millennium. They also adopted bully tactics to prevent upstarts (like Be for example) from upsetting the apple cart and had ironclad contracts with OEMs when distributing Microsoft Windows. It also helps that the IBM PC became such a pervasive standard. The competition, such as Commodore, Atari, Acorn, you name it, couldn’t help but find ways to blow their own feet off any time they had an opportunity to make an impact. Heck… even Apple came very close to self destruction in the late 90s, with Steve Jobs and NeXT being their Hail Mary pass. In short, now that we’ve had personal computers for decades, it’s very difficult to break into this market with a unique offering due to this inertia. You have to go outside normal form factors and such to find any interesting players anymore, such as the Raspberry Pi and GNU/Linux. As an aside, I kinda wish Atari Corporation was run by less unscrupulous folks like the Tramiels.

During boot, for example, even modern Windows boxes [correction: pre-EFI only] show a BIOS screen followed by a brief blinking cursor before the Windows graphics mode takes over. It was much worse in earlier versions. The Macintosh screen never dropped you into a text-mode console, no matter what. Everything on the screen was graphics-mode, always -- and there weren't glaring design changes between system versions like in Windows (except at the Mac OS X introduction, which was entirely new). Installing Macintosh system software onto a HDD was literally as easy as copying the System Folder.

The other 2 was MS-DOS and Windows 95. reply ndiddy 19 hours agoparentWindows 3.1 is basically 95% of an OS. When you're booted into Windows 3.1, MS-DOS is only used to run MS-DOS software and to handle filesystem access. Windows 3.1 controls the processes, memory, video card, system timer, keyboard, mouse, printer, etc. (pretty much every system resource besides disk I/O) while it's running. reply rusk 21 hours agoparentprevAgree, the terminology in those days was “shell”. Though Windows 95 was arguably similar running atop “DOS 7” it actually imposes its own 32-bit environment with its own “protected mode” drivers once booted. Dropping to DOS reverted to “real mode”. reply tzs 18 hours agorootparentI don't think it actually reverted to real mode. I believe Win 95 continued with what they had done in Windows for Workgroups 3.11, which was the first Windows that required an 80386. What that did is use DOS as a first stage boot loader, then switched into protected mode and created a v86 task which took over the state of DOS. The protected mode code than finished booting. v86 mode was a mode for creating a virtual machine that looked like it was running on a real mode 8086 but was actually running in a virtual address space using the 80386 paging VM system. When you ran DOS programs they ran in v86 mode. If a DOS program tried to make a BIOS call it was trapped and handled by the 32-bit protected mode code. v86 mode tasks could be given the ability to directly issue I/O instructions to designated devices, so if you had a device that didn't have a 32-bit protected mode driver a DOS driver in a v86 task could be used. For devices that did have a 32-bit protected mode they would not give v86 mode direct access. Instead they would trap on direct access attempts and handle those in 32-bit protected mode code. I wish Linux had adopted a similar use of v86 mode. I spent a while on some Linux development mailing list trying to convince them to add a simplified version of that. Just virtualize the BIOS in a v86 task, and if you've got a disk that you don't have a native driver use that v86 virtualized BIOS to access the disk. Eventually someone (I think it may have been Linus himself) told me to shut up and write the code if I wanted it. My answer was I couldn't do that because none of my PCs could run Linux because there were no Linux drivers for my SCSI host adaptors. I wanted the feature so that I could run Linux in order to write drivers for my host adaptors. OS/2 did the v86 virtualized BIOS thing, and that was how I was able to write OS/2 drivers for my SCSI host adaptors. reply Hilift 20 hours agorootparentprevAnother competitor shell at the time was \"WordPerfect Office for DOS\". Which I witnessed some people launch from Windows 3.11. I believe it had WordPerfect and what preceded GroupWise for email. https://mendelson.org/wpdos/shell.html reply tliltocatl 21 hours agorootparentprevSo did the lastest Win3.1 for workgroups, just MS spared all the fanfare for Win95. Not sure if the 3.1 version in the installers does. reply rusk 21 hours agorootparentWindows 3.1 was just a graphical shell. All the drivers and stuff were still managed by DOS. You still needed to configure your system with config.sys EDIT it’s coming back to me. Windows 3.1 did have a a subsystem for running 32 bit apps called Win32 I think that’s what you mean. This was very much in the application space though. It still used cooperative multitasking and Win 95 introduced preemptive. reply DHowett 21 hours agorootparentBryan Lunduke has an article about this myth, actually! https://lunduke.locals.com/post/4037306/myth-windows-3-1-was... It’s backed up by another Old New Thing article at https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100517-00/?p=14... The TL;DR is that Windows 3.1 effectively replaced DOS and acted as a hypervisor for it, while drivers could be written for Windows (and many were) or DOS (and presumably many more of those were actually distributed). The latter category was run in hypervised DOS and the results bridged to Windows callers. (Edited after submission for accuracy and to add the Old New Thing link.) reply phire 19 hours agorootparentOne of the major motivations for windows, is that the driver situation for DOS really sucked. Every single office suite had to talk directly to printers. Text mode was reasonably uniform, but printing graphics required the application to know about the printer. And games needed to talk directly to the video card and sound card if you wanted anything more than PC speaker beeps and non-scrolling screens on one of the default BIOS graphics modes. One of the major selling points of Windows 1.0 was a unified 2D graphics API, for both screen and printing. The graphics vendor would supply a driver and any windows application could use its full resolution and color capabilities needing to be explicitly coded for that graphics card. This rendering API also supported 2D accelerators, so expensive graphics card could accelerate rendering. 2D accelerators were often known as Windows accelerators. Windows 3.1 still relied on DOS for disk and file IO, but everything was can be done by VXD drivers, and should never need to call back to DOS or the BIOS (which was slow, especially on a 286) With Windows 95, Disk/File IO were moved into VXD drivers, and it was finally possible to do everything without ever leaving protected mode (though, DOS drivers were still supported). Read more about the history of Device drivers here: http://www.summitsoftconsulting.com/WinDDHistory.htm And I really enjoyed this documentary about the development of Windows 1.0: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqt94b8bNVc reply rusk 18 hours agorootparentprevThanks for that it’s very interesting. I had no idea the virtual machine system was so advanced. Device drivers and such were all still real mode but yes I can see how this would make DOS a component of Windows rather than the other way round. All for nothing if the apps aren’t bought in though! reply YakBizzarro 21 hours agorootparentprevIt was Win32s https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win32s reply rusk 21 hours agorootparentThanks ”Win32s lacked a number of Windows NT functions, including multi-threading, asynchronous I/O, newer serial port functions and many GDI extensions. This generally limited it to \"Win32s applications\" which were specifically designed for the Win32s platform,[4] although some standard Win32 programs would work correctly” reply kjellsbells 20 hours agorootparentIt was a strange time back then for anyone who wanted to get online. Win3.1 had no TCP/IP stack so many folks used a third party download called Trumpet Winsock. IIRC you might have needed win32s in order to use it. Looking back, Microsoft were clearly in an incredibly complicated transitioning phase, with very little margin for error (no patching over the Internet!) reply phire 19 hours agorootparentTrumpet Winsock works on a 286, but apparently NCSA Mosaic version 2.0 needed Win32s. So I guess there would have been a time in 1994 where many people were forced to retire their 286es. Though Mosaic was quickly replaced by Netscape Navigator in late 1994 which worked on Win16. And then Windows 95 came along, and it really needed a 486 with 4MB of ram, ideally 8MB. reply dboreham 11 hours agorootparent1994 wasn't a time where everyone was using a web browser. reply rbanffy 20 hours agorootparentprevI think it’d be fair to call it more than a shell. It was also a set of libraries that implemented the common user interface elements of Windows apps, similar to the Macintosh Toolbox but not in ROM. reply rusk 18 hours agorootparentNot sufficient on its own to qualify it as an OS though. The VM subsystem described in sibling comment makes a big difference though! reply rbanffy 7 hours agorootparentThe line is blurry though. reply rusk 6 hours agorootparentMore akin to Window Manager to me. But yes more than a mere “shell” and through my error I have learned oh so much. reply nkrisc 21 hours agorootparentprevI was only 5 or 6 maybe when I used Windows 3.1 so I may be misremembering, but didn’t it have an X on the desktop to close the GUI and return to the DOS prompt? reply LocalH 7 hours agorootparentWindows 3.1 didn't have any \"X\" buttons. It had the system menu (the one shaped like a spacebar, since the hotkey was Alt-Space). If you quit Program Manager, it would end the Windows session (since Program Manager was your shell). If you had a replacement shell (as some did back then, Norton Desktop etc), then quitting that would exit Windows and return to a pure DOS prompt. reply mixmastamyk 20 hours agorootparentprevMy memory is that closing Program Manager exited windows. reply rusk 18 hours agorootparentprevThere was a way to “drop to DOS” alright, which is what you would have had to do for games and the like. Can’t remember the exact mechanism but it could have been the x on the “program manager” window. The raise Windows you’d type “win” and if you wanted to “boot to windows” you would call “win” from your autoexec.bat reply nkrisc 16 hours agorootparentThat sounds about right.

Get one here! Get an awesome price on domains! Also known as: why you shouldn’t trust a company who makes their product intensionally inaccessible with allowing you an accessibility workaround Update: I’ve been informed that hCaptcha now has a text captcha option. The bulk of this blog post still stands. Thanks to D Hamlin for the correction. Also thanks to T Spivey for pointing out my capitalization error causing eloquence users to just hear captcha. This has also been fixed. It’s been a while, hasn’t it? Well I’m back again with a long overdue blog post. Once again, it’s a warning of something crazy. Seems I’m good at coming up with blog posts for those lol. Anyway, let’s get on with it I’m sure you’ve seen the hCaptcha captcha service, where you check a box and then need to select all images of a house or whatever. If you’re not aware, they intensionally do not provide an audio captcha version for the blind since they say this would make it easier for bots to get through. Instead, they provide a special account for blind people that allows them to get a cookie which lets them get past the captcha without a challenge… This should be warning sign umber one. If they’re intensionally making their captcha inaccessible, then why should you trust them with an accessibility workaround. What happens when they decide that the accessibility workaround is causing too much of a headache? What happens when bots start using it to get past the captcha for free? We’ll be partially discussing that today, though in a slightly different context. Anyway, I mainly use brave browser for my browsing needs, and for about a year, my accessibility account just wouldn’t set the cookie on brave. I followed all the steps, third party cookies were allowed, etc, but the cookie just would not set. It worked great on firefox, chromium, and everything else I tried. The message just said that if this keeps occurring that I should email support. So finally I did email support. They walked me through basic troubleshooting steps, most of which I had already tried, and in an attempt to isolate the problem and help out their technical staff, I mentioned that the call to their set cookie endpoint seemed to be returning a 401 unauthorized code in brave, looking at the javascript console. This, I think, made them a little suspicious, even though I was only trying to help them out. So imagine my surprise, when out of nowhere in the middle of my conversation with a support rep named Gemma, another rep named Mel sends a reply and says Hello, This is not a supported use, and you are not being credited for accessibility passes. All accounts being used in this way will be deleted from hCaptcha, and the users banned if they attempt to sign up again for accessibility. Thanks, hCaptcha Support I was obviously very confused, as I wasn’t doing anything they didn’t allow, I was just trying to get it working under brave. So I emailed back, and they clarified that since I wasn’t blind, I shouldn’t be using the accessibility account. Excuse me? I’m not blind? Are you serious? I have no idea what got that idea through their heads, but I verified that my account had indeed been banned. I emailed back a day or so later, requesting an unban because, y’know, I *actually* am blind, but they gave a pretty canned response of no, your account is remaining banned. So the end result is that, irony of all ironies, if I want to get past hCaptcha, I have to break their terms of service and use an automated solving program to solve the captcha, all because they decided, randomly, that I wasn’t blind, so can’t use their accessibility account. Consider this a warning that, if you rely on a workaround to an intensionally inaccessible system to make it useable, you’re just waiting for something to go wrong. I can’t stress this enough. Don’t trust a company that makes their product intensionally inaccessible to provide an accessibility work around. That’s like a zebra trusting a lion who eats zebras to not eat them out of the kindness of their heart. It’s a ticking timebomb. Please share this post with your friends, and if you know any webmasters who use hCaptcha, consider forwarding this to them. It’s not ok what they’re doing, and it’s affecting real people. I was going to reach out to Cloudflare to share my experience in an attempt to get them to drop hCaptcha, but apparently they’re using an in house system now anyway. Good riddance, I say. Anyway, consider this a warning, and maybe I won’t wait 5 years before my next blog post! Lol. Michael. You Might Also Like Beware of Godaddy Premium Renewal Fees on Non-premium Domains!

It's a horrendous UX, especially when using different devices and browsers. I imagine others just give up instead of dealing with the crap. They shouldn't use the word accessibility when their whole service is the exact opposite.

Google captcha intentionally fails you a couple times if they don't have enough tracking info to determine that you're legit. So you solve the captcha correctly but are still lied to that \"you've failed to solve the captcha, try again\". That and the \"fading images slowly to pretend like you have bad internet\" thing. Disgusting behaviour reply oniony 2 hours agorootparentMaybe they purposely load the images slowly to make it more expensive for the bot owners. reply lesuorac 13 minutes agorootparentI kinda don't understand why we still have captchas. We've solved the asymmetric problem with proof-of-work; just make somebody solve something trivial so they spend more resources than you do.

Almost all turnkey CAPTCHA services can be solved for pennies. Solving the problems of SPAM and malicious traffic will be challenging... I am worried it will come down to three possible things: - Anonymity of users: validating someone's real-life identity sufficiently would make it possible to permanently ban malicious individuals and filter out bots with good effectiveness, but it will destroy anonymity online. In my opinion, literally untenable. - Closing the platform: approaches like Web Environment Integrity and Private Access Tokens pave the way for how the web platform could be closed down. The vast majority of web users use Google Chrome or Safari on a device with Secure Boot, so the entire boot chain can be attested. The number of users that can viably do this will only increase over time. In this future, the web ceases to meaningfully be open: alternatives to this approach will continue to become less and less useful (e.g. machine learning may not achieve AGI but it's going to kick the ass of every CAPTCHA in sight) so it will become increasingly unlikely you'll be able to get into websites without it. - Accountability of network operators: Love it or hate it, the Internet benefits a lot from gray-area operators that operate with little oversight or transparency. However, another approach to getting rid of malicious traffic is to push more accountability to network operators, severing non-compliant providers off of the Internet. This would probably also suck, and would incentivize abusing this power. It's tricky, though. What else can you do? You can try to reduce the incentives to have malicious traffic, but it's hard to do this without decreasing the value that things offer. You can make malicious traffic harder by obfuscation, but it's hard to stop motivated parties. Either way, it feels like the era of the open web is basically over. The open web may continue to exist, but it will probably be overshadowed by a new and much more closed off web. reply SirMaster 2 hours agoparentCAPTCHA definitely works in some cases.

It is a costly signal that this is a real person, or at least is more than 1/10^9th of a real person (you're not running a fully automated spam system). The postal service also has costs - everybody that wants to move something through the postal service needs to buy a stamp. Transport fees are a 'natural' way to moderate traffic and deter spam. Various combinations of network architecture and cryptocoinage permit you to invoke transport fees per attempted transmission/login. Sensible ones, if every spam email or login guess costs even 1 penny it becomes prohibitive for most fully automated spam applications. The cryptocoin aspect is specifically about preserving anonymity of private wallet access while permitting the cash-like transactions that stamps enable. reply jchw 2 hours agorootparentCryptocurrency micropayments have been proposed and even attempted as a solution to various problems. Hell, there's also Hashcash, an early proposed anti-SPAM measure for e-mail using just proof-of-work. (Since this is just burning CPU though, it probably isn't effective in the modern world of most people using low-power mobile computers and many SPAMers having access to cheap very high power computers. Might serve as a good hurdle for people trying to implement malicious bots, but it will eventually become useless if it is shown to be effective IMO.) I'm skeptical though. It puts a literal price on abusing a service, but how do you set that price? Is there a guarantee that there's a value high enough to meaningfully disincentivize SPAM but low enough that users, especially users in areas that may have an economic disadvantage, are able to pay it? That's on top of the other practical problems, such as actually implementing it. I mean, if someone implements it and tries to solve the usability issues involved I would be open to this future, but as it is now, cryptocurrency has disappointed me. In a world with increasing scrutiny towards credit card processors, I was hoping that the silver lining would be that cryptocurrency could at least help mitigate some of the concerns, but there are just too many hurdles right now. (Some of them may be caused by regulation, but to be fair, I think at this point it's hard to blame governments for trying to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges.

Start with a nominal one and increase it until the spam problem goes away. Create escape hatches for people who can't afford it, e.g. you can either pay/mine a couple dollars worth of cryptocurrency, or you can have someone who paid vouch for you (but then if either of you spam you both get banned), or you can do some rigorous identity verification which is inconvenient and compromises privacy but doesn't cost money, or (for smaller communities) you ask the admins to comp you and if you're known in the community from other sites then they do it etc. > I mean, if someone implements it and tries to solve the usability issues involved I would be open to this future, but as it is now, cryptocurrency has disappointed me. This doesn't seem like an insurmountable problem to solve. To give someone some cryptocurrency you can either send it directly (useful option for advanced or privacy-conscious users) or use a service and then it should be no different than using Paypal et al. The real problem is the regulations are currently designed to make using it an unreasonable amount of paperwork: > Some of them may be caused by regulation, but to be fair, I think at this point it's hard to blame governments for trying to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges. There's a difference between regulating exchanges and regulating users. If you're holding millions of dollars in cryptocurrency then the government is reasonably going to expect you to file paperwork and pay taxes on gains etc. If you're only holding three and four digit dollar amounts worth then they should leave you alone and you shouldn't have to do anything. In theory you can strike a reasonable balance here where the crypto scammers go to jail but Joe Average doesn't have to file any more tax paperwork to use Bitcoin Cash to buy a pack of gum than to pay in physical cash. We'll see what the new administration does with it. reply jchw 5 minutes agorootparentWell, for solving both the UX and regulatory issues with cryptocurrencies... I'm not optimistic, but I am open to being pleasantly surprised. On the UX side, I think a huge problem is making it possible for users to participate using a non-custodial wallet with as little risk of data loss or compromised credentials as possible. So it needs to be hardened against ignorance, stupidity, house fires, malware, and social engineering. That is hard. Irreversible transactions greatly up the stakes while increasing the incentive to attack. Do you ever feel a bit nervous about the send address being wrong when you use cryptocurrency? A thing I didn't mention but is equally important to solve is developer experience. I wish there was a turnkey SDK that took care of most of the technical stuff and just let you use cryptocurrency like it's PayPal. If we had on-chain subscriptions (I think Ethereum can do this?) it could be even more powerful. The technologies offer a ton of possibilities but taking advantage of it correctly and securely feels like a tall order. Dealing with cryptocurrencies feels more serious than dealing with traditional payment processors: you can't undo when you fuck up. Some of this can be resolved. On the user side, users can keep less value stored in wallets long term... Though this is more cumbersome and less usable. On the developer side, developers can make nodes that can verify transactions but not spend currency... But this can be challenging (I think it's weird to do with Monero for example?) and it closes off some use cases (\"escrow\" style transactions; Skeb-style commissions would be a good use case.) If it gets solved I will celebrate as it seems like it would have a lot of positive upsides, but I think you might need to pardon my skepticism: it's been a lot of years and it hasn't gotten that much better.

Also, the cost of using a postal service nominally covers its operating costs. The cost of actually transferring a spammy HTTP request over the internet is negligible, but the costs imposed on its receiver are less so (i.e. the cost of responding to it (cpu/ram/disk/bandwidth), second-order costs of lowering the quality of the service for everyone else, etc.). reply Y_Y 47 minutes agorootparent> until we solve unequal wealth distribution globally Is this a joke? reply throwaway2037 2 hours agorootparentprevThis sounds like the same argument that was made for about 10 years (2000 to 2010) that micropayments would save traditional (print) media in a digital world.

It's an entirely different sort of system, and it would require a cordoned off section of the Internet to implement it top-down, but it's technically viable. The defining insight here is how many orders of magnitude difference there is between the \"That price is negligible\" threshold for a human being, and the \"That price is negligible\" threshold for an automated system. Sure there are adoption issues, but for all applications where there are several orders of magnitude difference, such a system makes some degree of sense. reply theamk 2 hours agorootparentDon't think it's going to work, except in the smallest forums?

The best solution is probably some kind of \"pay something in money/cryptocurrency/proof of work to create an account\" because normal users need a small number accounts kept for long periods of time but spammers need a large number of accounts that get banned almost immediately, which is exactly the sort of asymmetric cost structure that results in a functioning system. reply Telemakhos 3 hours agoparentprevThis doesn’t feel so much like the end of the “open web” as it does a rehash of USENET and email spam issues.

It's possible but quite hard to run your own e-mail server; if you're not on a major provider, the possibility is high that a major provider will at some point have deliverability issues to or from you due to automated anti-SPAM measures. The degree of difficulty with participating in the network does somewhat degrade its openness in my opinion. If anything works in the favor of email it is that email is not published. It is not necessary very private inherently, but it is at least not a system where things get broadcasted publicly. IMO this limits the value of spamming people over e-mail: you have to send a very high volume of e-mail to SPAM effectively over e-mail, and this high volume use pattern is not something that ordinary users will ever engage in, so it's easy to at least separate out \"possible SPAM operation\" versus \"guy sending email to a friend\". (I'm not saying that systems are necessarily perfect at distinguishing one from the other, but at the very least it would be hard to mistake the average Gmail account for being part of a massive SPAM operation.

Smaller operators had an advantage in being lower volume; I think that gives you a higher likelihood of delivery. That said, their emails are also more likely to get caught up in SPAM filters without remediation. Something has changed recently, though. I have found it increasingly hard to even get an IP that is not blocked anymore. I recently migrated a VPS that was almost 10 years old that was running its own e-mail services, and after a lot of struggling... I gave up. It now has to go through an SMTP proxy to send e-mail. This bums me out, but after multiple attempts to get an IP that worked, I gave up. The provider did tell me that I was grandfathered in to have outgoing SMTP enabled on my servers (something that new users do not have by default, by the way) but recommended I stop using it.

I think it may be also possible to extend it so that the government attests that you have only one account on the service but without being able to find which account is yours. reply throwaway2037 2 hours agoparentprev> Anonymity of users: validating someone's real-life identity sufficiently would make it possible to permanently ban malicious individuals and filter out bots with good effectiveness, but it will destroy anonymity online. In my opinion, literally untenable. I see this point constantly made on the echo chamber that is known as HackerNews. The average normie user does not care about anonymity, nor privacy, on the Internet. They want a smooth, fun experience. The solution is secure boot plus attestation via some browser JavaScript API. If you want even less friction, users are required to register their devices with a gov't agency, then their attestation will carry more value. Really, why don't we see HN crying about the need to show a national ID (and register) when buying a mobile phone? I never once saw anyone complaining about it here. Are there any highly developed nations that allow complete strangers with any nationality to buy and use a mobile phone without showing a national ID? I don't know any, or they will all soon be gone. It only takes a few more terrorist assholes to close that door permanently. reply tredre3 1 hour agorootparent> Are there any highly developed nations that allow complete strangers with any nationality to buy and use a mobile phone without showing a national ID? I don't know any, or they will all soon be gone. I regularly (1-2x per year) buy prepaid SIMs in Canada, USA, and Japan. None of them require an ID and I often even pay cash. I'm sure you are right that they'll eventually be requiring ID, but you are wrong to imply that these countries aren't highly developed. reply faeranne 40 minutes agorootparentprev> why don't we see HN crying about the need to show a national ID ... when buying a mobile phone? Mmm, very possibly because there are at least a few ways to get a phone without using any ID. I picked up a used phone about a year ago, and use Tello. Tello had 0 info on me for years, only an old UPS box that I got the card delivered to. I eventually gave them my first name so Caller ID was correct, but short of that or putting in a correct address if you want 911 support, there's no reason to need any valid info with them. They don't do credit checks, just prepay. > The solution is secure boot plus attestation That's the second option they presented \"Closing the platform\". The issue with all these options is that it consolidates power, and thanks to already partially consolidated power, any option selected will, by necessity, obligate everyone to partake, whether or not they are ok with it. > The average normie user does not care about anonymity, nor privacy, on the Internet. It's true that often \"normies\" don't care (or at least think they don't care, but that's a completely different point I don't feel like trying to make), and it's also true that often \"normies\" don't want the status quo changed. But often \"normies\" also ignore when people are kidnapped due to their heritage being revealed. Is it acceptable to actively create a hostile environment for people already disadvantaged? Do we gain something worth their safety? Who gains from this higher level of scrutiny? If we look at the smaller web, most sites never get enough traffic to be under active threat, and passive threat is easy enough to quell using honeypot forms and questions. Maybe the \"normie\" internet is the problem. Passive people passively consuming. \"Normies\" love watching stolen content, and praise thieves for harassing anyone who points out that what their doing is wrong. \"Normies\" enjoy watching someone livestream themselves flying down a highway at 100 mph over the speed limit. I think maybe we should acknowledge that what we're defending with things like hCaptcha is not actually worth defending. Maybe the \"normal\" internet does need to be deprecated over \"small\" internet? We did pretty good before with things like Wikipedia. The \"small\" internet from before had a lot of chaff, but good things have grown from it, and a lot of it still exists as a \"small\" internet. Maybe it's ok that we have a lot of \"crap content\", so long as the internet can keep changing? reply graypegg 2 hours agorootparentprev> Are there any highly developed nations that allow complete strangers with any nationality to buy and use a mobile phone without showing a national ID? Canada maybe? [I'm 80% sure that] Public Mobile will sell you a prepaid sim card at the counter. You could pay cash, and set your caller ID to a fake name. If we're talking about mobility plans, the identity requirement is more about the credit check they might want to do than anything else. reply mindslight 3 hours agoparentprevmeh, continuing the pearl clutching and asserting there has to be some general \"solution\" is itself part of the problem. The sheer majority of captchas I come across are while browsing essentially static content. If simple source IP based rate limiting can't keep the server load at something manageable, then the real problem is with how the site is built. And adding even more bloat to address another managerial bullet point is exactly how it got that way. reply jchw 2 hours agorootparentTwo things: - I don't believe there is a general solution to this problem, but that won't stop people with lots of money and influence from trying to find a general solution. Especially one that is cheap. I still hope for the least user- and ecosystem-hostile approach among the flawed approaches to win. (I guess of the ones I listed, the one that bothers me the least is having more policing of the service providers.) - CAPTCHAs from static content are almost assuredly for anti-scraping measures. I think anti-scraping measures are mostly pointless and antithetical to an open web in the first place, but, an effective anti-scraping measure kind of has to work off of reputation, because getting access to a very large number of IP addresses isn't free, but it doesn't cost that much (especially if IPv6 is on the table.) I personally doubt it has much to do with server load in most cases, but maybe I am wrong. reply hyperman1 2 hours agoprevI think, unfortunately, most accessibility options are not intended to actually be used. If you are a governement or bigco, accessibility is part of your baseline requirements. You must be able to say: Yes, we are accessible. Otherwise, the public will cause a stink. So you take your list of vendors, and remove any that don't say they enable accessibility. Vendors know this and make sure they say they are. Meanwhile, it is a hard to get right feature, only applicable to a small part of your userbase. Multiple disabilities require different affordances. No developer on the team really understands the actual requirement. The people requiring accessibility will go somewhere else, or grumble and make do. Neither will be detected on any metrics board. This combination promotes shelfware: Things you buy and put on a shelf somewhere but never really use. reply blindgeek 8 hours agoprevThe author was essentially too smart to be blind. reply jesterswilde 4 hours agoparentGwahahha, succinct.

Being in places or doing things I (blind guy) \"shouldn't be\", thus, am not blind. reply yorwba 8 hours agoparentprevI wonder whether talking about \"looking at the javascript console\" somehow made them think that this person cannot possibly be blind, since how could a blind person \"see\" the JavaScript console? (But \"having my screen reader read the content of the JavaScript console to me\" is a bit of a mouthful.) reply blindgeek 7 hours agorootparentYou know, that's a good point, and it hadn't occurred to me. For the overwhelming majority of blind people, language like \"looked at\" is just metaphorical. I mean, all language is symbolic anyway. The map is not the territory and the menu is not the dinner. Some of us are taught very young to use common terms like look in that kind of a metaphorical way. Partially so that we fit in and are comfortable with the rest of sighted culture. And then once in a great while, we get condescended to for it. There's a really good example of this in the second season episode of DS9, The Alternate. ``` ODO It was a dilemma for me. I'd never seen anything like these creatures either. MORA \"Seen\" isn't really an appropriate description. He had no eyes per se... ODO I was only trying to describe it in simple terms... MORA (ignoring that) He had never perceived anything like us before... go on... ``` I can pretty much guarantee that every blind person has had a condescending, patronizing douche canoe like Mora in their life at least once. reply Lerc 3 hours agorootparentThis is how use of language concealed aphantasia for so long. When you use a word in a context similar to how another used it in that context there seems to be a presumption that the subjective experience is the same in that context. Given how we learn languages and words based upon encountering them in contexts, it makes sense that terms that we use in outwardly similar contexts reflect the subjective experience that each of us relate to those terms. We don't have access to another's subjective experience so I can see how it would encourage the assumption that we all perceive things the same way. There might be many undetected variances in perception akin to aphantasia lurking in us waiting to be discovered. reply blindgeek 2 hours agorootparentHere's the thing. We're talking about people who are the accessibility team for hCaptcha. They should at least have a figleaf of an understanding of life for blind people. The other problem we have is that online companies tend to be accountable to no one. Short of law suits, my friend who got banned from hCaptcha for \"not being blind\" has no recourse, because nobody is accountable. reply rascul 3 minutes agorootparentLawsuits are how that's solved in the physical world also. bluGill 4 hours agorootparentprevEven as a sighted person, \"look at\" is often metamorphic - you can interview an expert over the phone and say you looked into the subject even though the only looking was around the phone number. reply lagadu 2 hours agorootparentWhen someone recommends me an album or artist I \"take a look\" at it: I listen to it. Though now that I think about it, I wouldn't say that in my other languages. reply pbronez 3 hours agorootparentprevI suppose one could say \"observed\" as a sense-neutral alternative to see / hear. Might be a worthwhile language shift, similar to using \"they\" as a gender-neutral alternative to \"he\" and \"her\". We usually talk about the inclusion benefits of neutral language. It can also be valuable by making specific terms more meaningful when used appropriately. If I know you usually say \"they\", then when you choose to say \"he\" I get more information -- there's a clear gender expression. Similarly, if you usually say \"observe\", then when you say \"see\" I know we're specifically talking about vision. Of course, it's an awkward transition. It's hard to get used to \"they/them\" and saying \"I observed a delicious aroma\" sounds like a robot impersonating a person. reply blindgeek 3 hours agorootparentIt's notable that the majority of the people who would be \"included\" by the change to \"more inclusive\" language aren't offended in the first place. The sentence \"I am watching TV\" literally offended no blind person, evah. It is only sighted do-gooders who have the spoons to be offended by nothingburgers on our behalf. We're too busy dealing with stuff like, ... I dunno, landlords who refuse to rent to us because all they have is second story units and we might fall down the stairs. Yes this actually happened to me in 2000 or so, and I don't have enough faith in human intelligence to believe that it isn't happening today. We're too busy being oppressed by captchas and websites made by frontend devs who seem to care more about chasing JavaScript framework du jour than they care about accessibility. We're busy struggling against a built physical environment which has been designed for cars and not people. The supposedly non-inclusive language of \"I watched TV\" or \"I looked at my browser's JS console\" aren't even on our radar. I coined the term \"Sapir-Whorf Stalinists\" a few weeks ago to describe the sort of people who think that monkeying with language will magically make things better for marginalized groups. Here's Lee Atwater talking about the Southern Strategy: > You start out in 1954 by saying, “Nigger, nigger, > nigger.” By 1968 you can’t say “nigger”—that hurts you, backfires. > So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, > and you’re getting so abstract.

Not to mention the privacy perk of not exposing your visitors to some captcha service with a dozen or more data subprocessors. reply stanmancan 3 hours agoparentI had to add a captcha to a registration page a couple years ago.

Our email provider suspended our account for high spam reports. reply reginald78 1 hour agorootparentWhat's is the play by the spammers here?

It’s a small side project so it wasn’t worth investing. reply Spivak 3 hours agorootparentprevI hope the other lesson was the good email verification hygiene of making the user take an affirmative action and click a \"verify email\" button rather then send it unsolicited. You essentially had an open public unauthed form that would send an email to any address you typed in it. Surely that alone raises some eyebrows. reply stanmancan 7 minutes agorootparentHow would adding an extra button change anything? Right now when they register we send a “verify email address” email.

An unsophisticated spambot won't probably care enough to click through that. reply binarycoffee 3 hours agorootparentprevNot a solution.

Especially fingerprinting invisible captchas. Try having a login form without a captcha and you'll realize you are capturing 100s of users every day that require you to send out a \"please confirm your email address\" email for each of them for no good reason. > They still have to respect the system they're logging in. Your trust in people is admirable, but in my experience running anything on the internet you'll realize that intentionally or not people will bombard your system until it falls over. reply isodev 3 hours agorootparentI think folks forget that we can add many of the safeguards a captchas provide as part of whatever \"form serving app\" is needed without torturing our visitors to prove they can count bicycles. reply dewey 3 hours agorootparentI think the times of the \"count bicycles\" type of captcha are already counted just because of the bad user experience. Now everything is about fingerprinting, as paying to get captchas solved by humans or AI is already used everywhere if it's worth it. reply nraynaud 3 hours agorootparentprevthey don't work, robots have a higher speed and success rate than humans. reply dewey 3 hours agorootparentNot everything is black and white. If it's cutting down 50% of the spam that does not have captcha solving robots because the effort is not worth it, that's already something.

Because it works, to some degree. It keeps away the annoying cheap bots and stupid kids. Smarter or more dedicated actors can still circumvent it, but even they are least slowed down to some degree.

And every stupid bot avoiding it will get banned. reply isodev 3 hours agorootparentIndeed… and if it's really problematic, a client-side script can run some expensive calculations as well (the same way captchas do it), to make it extra uninteresting to target unless someone is really motivated and has the budget for it. reply blindgeek 2 hours agorootparentYes, hashcash. reply bongodongobob 3 hours agoparentprevIf you have any input forms they will be overrun by bots immediately.

The real thing is the gating of every kind of information exchange and treatment in the hands of a few entities, that get the power to say who will participate on those activities and doing exactly what. That is, the complete elimination of the freedom of association and initiative from our society. At least around any one of those that involve computers. The lost of privacy is a rounding error. reply slooonz 3 hours agorootparentprevHow does that works for, say, Chromium or Firefox on Linux ? reply rvnx 3 hours agorootparentI believe the plan was to ask the TPM of the computer. From what I understood, each TPM has a unique private/public key pair (Endorsement Key (EK)), and then this key is certified by the manufacturer of the TPM. From there, you can generate a Attestation Keys, and these keys are signed by the EK. https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/235148/whats-th... So essentially, at the end of the day, Chromium would ask the TPM for attestation, and it would act as a unique Device ID. Then they can allow only a selected list of TPM manufacturers certificates, to prevent emulators for example. TL;DR: Chromium on Linux would ask the TPM chip for a signature, and each TPM chip has a different signature from the moment it is out of the factory. reply exe34 4 hours agoparentprevAI are already much better at them than I am. reply jeroenhd 4 hours agoparentprevAI stuff is why CAPTCHAs exist.

    "originBody": "← Max Bo Published May 6, 2024 Modified September 9, 2024 Reactive HTML notebooks Before I start, why am I doing this? I don't think HTML is being used enough as a platform for scientific publishing. Instead, people will: Use an interactive notebook like Jupyter, RStudio, Pluto.jl or Observable to do data exploration, analysis and visualisation, Move to a publishing platform like Typst, Overleaf, pure LaTeX, or a WYSIWYG editor to typeset their work, Export to .pdf for distribution. I think a HTML file can be used for all 3 of these stages, and prevent a lot of faffing around with manual processes, CLI tooling, CI steps and 3rd-party platforms. HTML's typesetting capabilities are well documented, but its capabilities as a platform for data exploration, analysis and visualisation are not. This article takes heavy inspiration from Anton Zhiyanov's In-browser code playgrounds, Cristóbal Sciutto's Self-modifying HTML notes, Quarto, and Observable Framework I'll try and demonstrate these capabilities, literate programming style. Cells First, we'll steal a trick from This page is a truly naked, brutalist html quine, and create a CSS class called echo that will display/reflect style and script elements inline. Add in a font with built-in syntax highlighting and a contenteditable attribute and we have a basic code editor! I stress that this style element is styling itself to be visible. Try changing .echo's background-color! @font-face { font-family: 'FontWithASyntaxHighlighter'; src: url('fonts/FontWithASyntaxHighlighter-Regular.woff2') format('woff2') ; } .echo { display: block; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 0.2rem; padding: 0.5rem 1rem 1rem 1rem; overflow: auto; font-family: \"FontWithASyntaxHighlighter\", monospace; white-space: pre; font-feature-settings: \"colr\", \"calt\"; font-size: 0.9rem; color: ivory; background-color: rgb(49, 49, 49); /* change me! */ } script.echo::before { content: \"\"; } script.echo::after { content: \"\"; } style.echo::before { content: \"\"; } style.echo::after { content: \"\"; } [contenteditable] { border: 3px inset; } We also want contenteditable scripts to be re-evaluated on blur by building a clone of the script and then removing the original. function reevaluate(event) { const old = event.target; const neww = document.createElement('script'); neww.textContent = old.textContent; for (let i = 0; i{ script.addEventListener('blur', reevaluate); }); Now we'll import the Observable standard library and the Observable runtime, and bind them to window. We'll export only 2 symbols to window, library and cell. import * as stdlib from 'https://esm.run/@observablehq/stdlib@5.8.8' import { Runtime, Inspector } from \"https://esm.run/@observablehq/runtime@5.9.9\"; const library = new stdlib.Library(); const runtime = new Runtime(); const module = runtime.module(); function cell(name, inputs, definition, observerVisibility = \"visible\") { // should we show the variable state above the cell? const observer = observerVisibility === \"visible\" ? makeInspector(name) : undefined; // if the variable already is in scope, get it, otherwise create a fresh one. // (this is why re-evaluated contenteditable propogate new definitions) const variable = module._scope.get(name) || module.variable(observer); variable.define(name, inputs, definition); } // use the Observable inspector to display the cell's output above the script block function makeInspector(name) { const div = document.createElement(\"div\"); // can't use document.currentScript as it's null in module scripts const currentScript = document.getElementById(name); currentScript.parentNode.insertBefore(div, currentScript); return new Inspector(div); } window.library = library; window.cell = cell; Now we'll declare a cell called counter that emits a number every second. The script's id attribute is the same as the name parameter passed to cell. Try changing the initial counter value i above to a much bigger number, and then defocus the script. cell(\"counter\", [], async function* () { let i = 0; while (true) { await library.Promises.delay(1000); yield i++; } }); Now that we've created a our counter cell, we can create other cells that depend on it. We'll import Hypertext Literal and use it to format the counter value. htl implements a full-blown HTML5 parser that performs automatic escaping and interpolation of non-serializable values, such as event listeners, style objects, and other DOM nodes. import * as htl from 'https://esm.run/htl@0.3.1'; window.htl = htl; cell(\"fizzbuzz\", [\"counter\"], (counter) => { if (counter % 3 === 0 && counter % 5 === 0) { return htl.html`FizzBuzz`; } else if (counter % 3 === 0) { return htl.html`Fizz`; } else if (counter % 5 === 0) { return htl.html`Buzz`; } else { return htl.html`${counter}`; } }); We can still observe the output of a cell without needing to show its definition. Just don't add the echo class. This makes them useful as a rendering primitive. (There's a hidden cell above ^) Alternatively, we can create a cell type that doesn't display its output at all. We can use these cells to store intermediate values or datastructures. function silent(name, inputs, definition) { cell(name, inputs, definition, \"hidden\"); } window.silent = silent; Also note that cells can be declared out of order. cell(\"reallyNegative\", [\"negative\"], (n) => { return n * 10 }); silent(\"negative\", [\"counter\"], (n) => { return -n; }); We can use cell values in more complex outputs. We'll import Observable Plot and use the counter value in a plot. import * as Plot from 'https://esm.run/@observablehq/plot@0.6.16'; window.Plot = Plot; const numbers = [ 170.16, 172.53, 172.54, 173.44, 174.35, 174.55, 173.16, 174.59, 176.18, 177.90, 176.15, 179.37, 178.61, 177.30, 177.30, 177.25, 174.51, 172.00, 170.16, 165.53, 166.87, 167.17, 166.00, 159.10, 154.83, 163.09, 160.29, 157.07, 158.50, 161.95, 163.04, 169.79, 172.36, 172.05, 172.83, 171.80, 173.67, 176.35, 179.10, 179.26 ]; cell(\"plot\", [\"counter\"], (counter) => { return Plot.plot({ marks: [ Plot.lineY(numbers, { x: (d, i) => i, y: d => d }), Plot.ruleX([counter % 40]) ] }); }); TeX, Markdown, Graphviz We can return any type of DOM element from a cell. In this case, the tex, md, and dot cells return span, table and svg elements respectively. Try editing any of the following cells. cell(\"tex\", [], async () => { const tex = await library.tex() return tex` \\def\\f#1#2{#1f(#2)} \\f\\relax{x} = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\f\\hat\\xi\\,e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} \\,d\\xi` }); cell(\"markdown\", [], async () => { const elements = [ { \"symbol\": \"Co\", \"name\": \"Cobalt\", \"number\": 27 }, { \"symbol\": \"Cu\", \"name\": \"Copper\", \"number\": 29 }, { \"symbol\": \"Sn\", \"name\": \"Tin\", \"number\": 50 }, { \"symbol\": \"Pb\", \"name\": \"Lead\", \"number\": 82 } ]; const md = await library.md(); return md`NameSymbolAtomic number|-----------|-------------|---------------|${elements.map(e => `${e.name}${e.symbol}${e.number} |`)} `; }); cell(\"dot\", [], async () => { const dot = await library.dot(); return dot` digraph G { rankdir = LR a -> b -> c }`; }); Cell status We can also return a Promise, or throw an Error, from a cell. Observable's Inspector will apply an observablehq--running or observablehq--error class to the cell's outer div element respectively. We'll style them appropriately: @keyframes blink { 67% { opacity: 0; } } .observablehq { margin-top: 1rem; } .observablehq--running::before { content: 'LOADING'; animation: blink 1s step-end infinite; } .observablehq--error { color: #d00; } cell(\"running\", [], () => { // this cell will run forever return new Promise(() => { }); }); cell(\"error\", [], () => { throw new Error(\"This cell has thrown an error\"); }); SQLite I've hosted the Chinook sample database on my website at https://maxbo.me/chinook.db. Now we'll use a WASM-backed SQLite client to query it. Try adding WHERE Milliseconds{ const url = \"https://maxbo.me/chinook.db\"; const db = await library.SQLiteDatabaseClient().open(url); const tracks = await db.query(\"SELECT * FROM tracks\"); return Plot.plot({ title: htl.html`Track length distribution`, marks: [ Plot.rectY( tracks, Plot.binX({ y: \"count\" }, { x: \"Milliseconds\", tip: true }) ), Plot.ruleY([0]) ] }); }); Python The Pyodide CPython WASM distribution includes NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and Scipy. We'll rebuild the plot seen above, but using Matplotlib and Python's sqlite3 module instead. Try editing one of the plot labels! import { loadPyodide } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.25.1/full/pyodide.mjs' cell(\"python\", [], async () => { const pyodide = await loadPyodide(); const response = await fetch('https://maxbo.me/chinook.db'); pyodide.FS.writeFile('/chinook.db', new Uint8Array(await response.arrayBuffer())); await pyodide.loadPackage(['sqlite3', 'matplotlib', 'pandas']); const code = ` import sqlite3 import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt with sqlite3.connect(\"/chinook.db\") as conn: tracks_df = pd.read_sql_query(\"SELECT * FROM tracks\", conn) plt.title('Track length distribution') plt.hist(tracks_df['Milliseconds'], bins='auto') plt.xlabel('Milliseconds') plt.ylabel('Frequency') import io, base64 buf = io.BytesIO() plt.savefig(buf, format='png') buf.seek(0) 'data:image/png;base64,' + base64.b64encode(buf.read()).decode() `; const imageDataUrl = await pyodide.runPythonAsync(code); const imageElement = document.createElement('img'); imageElement.src = imageDataUrl; return imageElement; }); R You know the drill. It's R, using WebR. I didn't figure out how to get ggplot2 rendering working, but I assume it's possible. I must disclose that this cell seems to be a bit flaky on iOS. I have not had a chance to investigate further, nor will I. import { WebR } from 'https://webr.r-wasm.org/latest/webr.mjs'; cell(\"r\", [], async () => { const webR = new WebR(); await webR.init(); const response = await fetch('https://maxbo.me/chinook.db'); webR.FS.writeFile('/chinook.db', new Uint8Array(await response.arrayBuffer())); await webR.installPackages(['RSQLite']) const shelter = await new webR.Shelter(); const code = ` library(RSQLite) conn{ const canvas = document.createElement(\"canvas\"); canvas.width = img.width; canvas.height = img.height; const ctx = canvas.getContext(\"2d\"); ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0, img.width, img.height); output.appendChild(canvas); }); shelter.purge(); return output; }); Inputs We'll create a new cell type viewof that works specifically with Observable Inputs. It declares 2 reactive cells: NAME and viewof NAME - one for the value, and one for the DOM element itself. import * as Inputs from 'https://esm.run/@observablehq/inputs@0.12.0' window.Inputs = Inputs function viewof(name, inputs, definition) { cell(`viewof ${name}`, inputs, definition); cell(name, [`viewof ${name}`], (inpt) => library.Generators.input(inpt), \"hidden\"); } window.viewof = viewof; To display the input above the cell, we set the cell id to viewof NAME. Wiggle the range input and see another dependent cell update. viewof(\"range\", [], () => { return Inputs.range([0, 100], { step: 1 }); }); cell(\"rangePlot\", [\"range\"], (range) => { return Plot.tickX([range]).plot({ x: { domain: [0, 100] } }); }); NB: The way Observable Inputs work is a bit arcane. This demo of Synchronized Inputs may shed some light. Mutability Purely functional dataflow is great, but sometimes you just need to mutate state. We'll create a new helper function mutable. It registers a Mutable - an object that yields new Generator values when the value is mutated - in the runtime. /** Hijacked from https://github.com/observablehq/stdlib/blob/main/src/mutable.js */ function Mutable(value) { let change; return Object.defineProperty( library.Generators.observe((_) => { change = _; if (value !== undefined) change(value); }), \"value\", { get: () => value, set: (x) => void change((value = x)) } ); } function mutable(name, value) { const m = Mutable(value); cell(name, [], m); return m; } window.mutable = mutable; Try editing the initial state of the mutable. window.ref = mutable(\"ref\", 3) Try editing the button labels. viewof(\"increment\", [], () => { const increment = () => ++ref.value; const reset = () => ref.value = 0; return Inputs.button([[\"Increment\", increment], [\"Reset\", reset]]); }); cell(\"sword\", [\"ref\"], (ref) => { return htl.html`↜(╰ •ω•)╯ |${'═'.repeat(ref)}═ﺤ` }); What's next? I will try and cram all of this into a library with some proper documentation. I initially thought it should be called incel (short for inline cell), but I'll probably call it celine instead. I've released a library! It's called @celine/celine! Slide infrastructure I demo'd this article at SydJS. This is the code I used to turn the article into a slideshow. Shift + N - Start slideshow / next slide Shift + B - Previous slide Shift + E - End slideshow .slide { scroll-margin-top: 3rem; } let slide = -1; window.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => { if (event.shiftKey && event.key === 'N') { slide++; paint(); } if (event.shiftKey && event.key === 'B') { slide--; paint(); } if (event.shiftKey && event.key === 'E') { slide = -1; paint(); } }); function paint() { for (const s of document.querySelectorAll('.slide')) { s.style.border = 'none'; s.style.opacity = 1; } if (slide >= 0) { const elem = document.querySelectorAll('.slide')[slide]; elem.style.border = '1px dotted grey'; elem.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' }); for (const s of document.querySelectorAll('.slide')) { if (s !== elem) { s.style.opacity = 0.4; } } } } source code (you've pretty much seen all of it already) © 2024",

    "commentBody": "Reactive HTML Notebooks (maxbo.me)227 points by california-og 10 hours agohidepastfavorite36 comments spankalee 1 hour agoI strongly agree with the premise of the article - HTML could be a fabulous substrate for computational notebooks! But I didn't love the choices for how to implement it here. Dynamic, reactive HTML can be a lot more declarative than this, and Observable is cool, but strays from standard JS. I started to build a reactive HTML system called Heximal that eventually will have notebook support, but it's declarative, based on HTML templates and custom elements with a expression / reactivity system (based on the TC39 Signals proposal) on top. https://github.com/elematic/heximal It's a bit like a mashup of HTMX, Tangle, Curvenote, and Polymer. Or like HTML if were natively reactive. I think it will lend it self to graphical editing and notebook user cases quite well. reply simpaticoder 46 minutes agoprevReally cool! I particularly liked your Python and SQLite demos. I find it interesting that you started with a through-the-web (TTW) editing loop, calling it a quine. While valid, the key weakness is persistance: TidlyWiki does basically the same thing, but saving your work is a headache because basically you need another headless server process to persist anything. Personally, when wanting to do something similar[0], started with persistance, and of course this means files. Plain text files I can edit with my programmer's editor store and distribute using the file-system. This avoids the problem of having to recapitulate a programmers editor in the browser, which is non-trivial. In turn you have the problem of writing a fast server, but that is a rather fun problem to solve [1]. You side-stepped the problem by using basic content-editable sections, but it is a huge problem, second only to persistence. One thing I see you face which I also faced is the fact you cannot export things from inside embedded scripts! This would be a nice feature to avoid mangling the global window object. (It would also, in my use case, make code generation easier.) 0 - Literate Markdown: https://simpatico.io/lit.md 1 - Reflector, what I call the small node server that transforms, zips and caches your markdown, with a filewatcher invalidator: https://simpatico.io/reflector reply doug_durham 3 hours agoprevWith all due respect to the considerable thought and effort you put into this, the ergonomics of this approach are hideous. Why would I ever care about the styling elements when I'm just trying to do some exploratory data analysis. This is exactly why things like Jupyter notebooks excel. Regardless kudos to your curiosity and implementing alternate ideas. reply mbo 2 hours agoparentAuthor: The ergonomics of this _are_ hideous, to my dismay, which was a lot of the motivation behind @celine/celine (https://maxbo.me/celine, aka me packaging the article up into a library). It's still not quite there as a platform for exploratory data analysis - you don't have the instant reactivity of either a fully-fledged web code editor from Observable Notebooks or the hot-reloading file-watching Observable Framework. And the new Jupyter Kernel for Deno + VSCode is a pretty smooth experience too. So while I agree that the ergonomics for exploratory analysis is uhhhh bad, I don't think the _publishing_ ergonomics is that bad. In fact, they're good. It's just a single file! I don't need to maintain some massive toolchain or pay some 3rd party service to just send someone a graph and some data munging - I just lob a HTML file at someone over Slack or host it somewhere. And the flexibility to style the analysis means that you can publish in environments where styling is important (blogs, or as a research paper). reply clcaev 1 hour agorootparentPluto has a way to publish as HTML, even with some interactivity, via SliderServer.

The intro demo looks scheme/smalltalk like in that you are creating the structure and primitives as you go (as demonstrated by changing 'ivory' to 'red' and watching the syntax highlighting change in realtime). I understand how we got here, but it's a shame that javascript frameworks and libraries aren't easier to just play with in the browser. It's just JS, you should be able to play with it quickly in a lightweight environment. This approach excels at that. This approach brings back the whimisical possibilities of HTML/JS.

What does this added complexity solve? If anything, it slows the process and remove much needed features like auto-completions, snippets, and extensions. Also, it makes collaboration harder, since, most likely, others aren't familiar with your setup. You only need to setup one environment once and use it forever with minor incremental improvements as tech evolves. If you are a n/vim user, you can accomplish this by: 1- Data exploration: text -> jupyter notebook via https://github.com/untitled-ai/jupyter_ascending that uses jupytext. This way, you can efficiently edit and run code from your text editor. 2- Writing: you can use https://github.com/lervag/vimtex for LaTeX On top of these, you can use tmux with tmuxp to open projects instantly.

I had thought about doing this with a lisp interpreter. I had identified a few key advantages: - homogenous allocation means no alignment gaps - linear access win in garbage collection - indices smaller than pointers - type discriminated index can save some size I haven’t verified whether those actually work out in the details. I’ll read your blog article. Don’t bother with these comments immediately comparing it to V8 (a multi billion dollar venture). I don’t know how many creative projects they’ve done before. You may be be interested in looking at Fabrice Bellard’s JS engine for ideas. reply aapoalas 3 hours agoparentThank you for the encouragement! Avoiding alignment gaps is indeed pretty great: I have a vision of packing Arrays into 9 bytes split over two or three cache lines. On typed indexes: If we accept only about 2^24 possible index values then we could use a 32 bit integer for our Values, or at least for Objects (if we want to keep 7 bytes worth of stack data, which is pretty hard to pass on).

Join us in finding out (...) reply aapoalas 8 hours agorootparentThe impetus for the engine design is indeed, as you say, \"someone decided to will it into existence.\" A friend of mine who works in the gaming industry told me about the Entity Component System architecture and I thought: Hey, wouldn't that work for a JavaScript engine? So I decided to find out. Nova itself has already been created at that point and I was part of the project, but it was little more than a README. I then started to push it towards my vision, and the rest is not-quite-history. reply kitd 7 hours agorootparentA friend of mine who works in the gaming industry told me about the Entity Component System architecture and I thought: Hey, wouldn't that work for a JavaScript engine? That was the first thing I thought of when I saw your description. But the reason ECS works well is cache coherence. (Why) would a general-purpose runtime environment like a JS engine benefit from ECS? Or alternatively, have you seen performance improvements as a result? reply aapoalas 6 hours agorootparentI guess the opposite could also be asked: Why would a game benefit from ECS? A player in the game can do basically anything, there's no guarantee that things are always perfectly accessed in a linear order. It comes down to statistics: Large data sets in a general-purpose runtime environment are still created through parsing or looping, and they are consumed by looping. A human can manually create small data sets of entirely heterogenous data, but anything more than a 100 items is already unlikely. Finally, the garbage collector is a kind of \"System\" in the ECS sense. So even if the JavaScript code has managed to create very nonlinear data sets, the garbage collector will still enjoy benefits. (Tracing the data is still \"pointer chasing\" but when tracing we don't need to trace in the data order but can instead gather a collection of heap references we've seen, sort them in order and then trace them.) reply kaoD 5 hours agorootparent> Why would a game benefit from ECS? A player in the game can do basically anything, there's no guarantee that things are always perfectly accessed in a linear order. There's actually a guarantee that things are mostly going to be accessed in a linear order because player actions don't matter to the execution of the simulation. The whole simulation is run at 1/FPS intervals across the whole set of entities, regardless of player input (or lack thereof). In an ECS the whole World is run by Systems, which operate on Components. This is why cache locality works there: when the Movement System is acting, it's operating on the Position Component for all (or at least many) Entities, so linear array access pattern is very favorable. Any other component in your cache is going to be unused until the next system runs (and then the Position Component will become the useless data in cache). That's why you'd rather have an array of Components in cache instead of an array of Entities. This access pattern is very suitable for games because the simulation is running continuously in an infinite loop (the game loop) consisting of even more loops (the Systems running), but not so much for general purpose computation where access patterns are mostly random. (EDIT: or rather, local to each \"entity\".) reply aapoalas 5 hours agorootparentIt is very true that a general purpose computation can theoretically do anything and mess linearity of access patterns entirely up. But in practice programs do most of their work in very linear fashion. It's not by chance that eg. V8 will try to write objects parsed from a JSON array of objects one right after the other. So in a sense we can say that the JavaScript program itself becomes the System with a capital S. That is not to say that Nova's heap vectors will necessarily make sense: The two big possible stumbling blocks are 1) growing of heap vectors possibly taking too long, and 2) compacting of heap vectors during GC taking too long. The first point basically comes down to the fact that, at present, each heap vector is truly a single Rust Vec. When it can no longer fit all the heap data into it, it needs to reallocate. Imagine you have 2 billion ordinary objects, and suddenly the ordinary objects vector needs to reallocate: This will cause horrible stalls in the VM. This can be mitigated at the cost of splitting each heap vector into chunks, but this of course comes at the cost of an extra indirection and some lack of linearity in the memory layout. The second point is more or less a repeat of the first: Imagine you have 2 billion ordinary objects, and suddenly a single one at the beginning of the vector is removed by GC: The GC has to now move every object remaining in the vector down a step to make the vector dense again. This is something that I cannot really do anything about: I can make this less frequent by introducing a \"minor GC\" but eventually a \"major GC\" must happen and something like this can then be experienced. I can only hope that this sort of things are rare. The alternative would be to do a \"swap to tail\", so the last item in the vector is moved to take the removed item's place. But that then means that linear access is no longer guaranteed. It also plays havoc on how our GC is implemented but that's kind of a side point. Software engineering is architecture is full of trade-offs :) I'm just hoping that the ones we've made will prove to make sense. reply kaoD 5 hours agorootparent> It's not by chance that eg. V8 will try to write objects parsed from a JSON array of objects one right after the other. Yes, but note this is still a different pattern of access (array of \"entities\"). V8 does this because it assumes that e.g. `foo.name` is very likely going to be accessed along with `foo.lastName` (which is likely the 99% case for general computing) whereas ECS assumes `foo.name` is very likely going to be accessed along with `foo2.name`, `foo3.name`, ..., `fooN.name` (which is the 99% case for videogame timestep loops). > Software engineering is architecture is full of trade-offs :) I'm just hoping that the ones we've made will prove to make sense. To clarify: my comment is not a criticism of Nova's design decisions. I was only trying to clarify the answer to \"Why would a game benefit from ECS?\" for those foreign to ECS's existential motive. I'm sure Nova's tradeoffs make sense for some workloads and I wish you the best! reply aapoalas 4 hours agorootparentThank you very much for your well-wishesYes, but note this is still a different pattern of access (array of \"entities\"). I was referring to the `[foo, foo2, foo3]` objects themselves; V8 does use an \"cache local\" placement for those so you'll find them laid out in memory as: > [foo_proto, foo_elems, foo_props, foo_name, foo_lastName, foo2_proto, foo2_elems, foo2_props, foo2_name, foo2_lastName, ...] For what it's worth, I am interested in laying object properties out in an ECS like manner in Nova, so the properties would be laid out as `[foo.name, foo2.name, foo3.name, ...]`, but currently the properties are laid out similarly to V8, `[foo.name, foo.lastName]`. The only difference is that we do not have \"in object properties\". That being said: I am obviously biased, but I do wonder if an ECS-like layout wouldn't be nearly universally beneficial. Thinking of the `foo.name` and `foo.lastName` access: If those are on the same cache line then accessing the two only reads one cache line. This is nice. But if there are more properties in the objects (and there often are), then those will pollute the cache. If you do this access once, it doesn't matter. If you do this a million times, now the cache pollution becomes a real issue: In Node.js even the optimal case would be that you read read 625,000 cache lines worth of data, only to discard 250,000 cache lines of it. If instead we use an ECS-like layout, then accessing these two properties reads two 10100cache lines: That's bad, but on the other hand if this happens once then it won't even make a blip on the screen. If a million of these accesses are done, you could think that we'd suddenly be slow as molasses but now the ECS-like layout is probably going to help you: You're more likely reading the next `name` and `lastName` property values on each access. If you have it bad and only half of the property data you read is actually the `name` and `lastName` properties you want, then you read 750,000 cache lines and lose out to the traditional engine by 100,000 cache lines. If you get 67% \"hit rate\" then you break even. And that's comparing to the case where the objects only contain `name` and `lastName` and nothing more. It of course all comes down to statistics but... I'm very interested in the potential benefits here :) Again, thank you for your comments, I've enjoyed discussing and pondering thisThe GC has to now move every object remaining in the vector down a step to make the vector dense again Is there something which forces you to compact everything here? Or could you do what most GCs do and track that free entry in a free list? reply aapoalas 2 hours agorootparentI would have to keep a free list per vector, and there's a lot of those, and it would defeat the point of keeping data packed and temporally colocated: I want to ensure that data was created together stays together and only ever gets more compact as it grows older. Filling in empty slots would mean that likely unrelated data comes and pollutes the cache for the old data :( reply lucms_ 52 minutes agorootparentprevIsn't data-oriented design about organizing the data in a way that reflects the most common access patterns of the program? The approach of placing all numbers in a big number vector, all Arrays into a big Array vector, and so on, would be \"data-oriented design\" if it actually reflects the most common access patterns. So, is it the case that when you read a number you also want all those other numbers that come together with it in the cache line? Is that the case for Arrays? For DataViews? In other words, does this approach to allocating memory reflect the most common data access patterns in JavaScript programs? I'm not saying it's a bad approach, and I'm not even trying to imply that it's not DOD, I'm genuinely asking. Edit: maybe a better question is: does it reflect the most common data access patterns of a JavaScript Engine? reply aapoalas 16 minutes agorootparentExcellent question: In a theoretical sense the answer would be that we cannot know since it depends on the JavaScript being run. But: In practice I think that is indeed the case. Especially for the more common an object is, the likelier it is that it is used in conjunction with others around it. At the same time, the more important their memory placement becomes. eg. Say you have a JS programs that has about a 100 DataViews: I'd say it's unlikely these are used in conjunction with others very often, but they're also only a small part of the program, so their placement is mostly whatever. Now what if that number is a million instead? Now I'm betting they're mostly all created together, used together, and that their placement is critical to the program's performance. So, I'm betting that making random memory access performance worse while guaranteeing that data created together stays together and improving linear memory performance will be an overall win. Whether this is true data-oriented design is then in the eye of the beholder: Maybe someone will think I'm wrong, my assumptions are wrong, and I'm thus not doing things in a data-oriented way. reply andai 7 hours agorootparentprevThis is cool, but I'm wondering (1) Why doesn't V8, whose whole point is performance, lay out memory in an optimal way? (2) Will Nova need to also implement all of V8's other optimizations, to see if Nova's layout makes any significant difference? reply aapoalas 7 hours agorootparentV8 could probably implement the backing object \"trick\" with some trouble. I'm half-hoping that Nova will show it to be worth their while and that they will eventually do it. It will be a major refactoring of the engine, however. The heap vector \"trick\" is basically impossible, I believe. It wouldn't be a refactoring so much as it would be a complete rewrite of the engine. The entirety of V8 assumes it deals in pointers, and all of that would need to change to using indexes instead. I will eat my hat if they do it. Without heap vectors they can still split object data apart using pointer-keyed hash maps, so maybe they could take advantage of some of the ideas still. V8 does offer ways to run code without optimisations, which we can use for a more apples-to-apples comparison. The most important optimisation that Nova really needs before any big performance comparisons become meaningful is property access inline caching, which requires implementing object shapes. I'd say that once object shapes are done, then limited performance comparisons can probably be made, especially if V8's JIT is disabled. reply Leszek 6 hours agorootparentTo be fair, pointer compression is morally and memory-wise similar to indexing a vector. reply aapoalas 6 hours agorootparentYup, and to a degree the whole \"heap references as indexes\" idea was inspired by pointer compression. Not in a direct sense of \"hey, look at that, what if I took it a step further?\" but as I was thinking of the indexes I realised that it looks a lot like pointer compression, and that made me think it is a viable idea. reply reverius42 7 hours agorootparentprevSo is the whole point of this project to convince V8 to adopt a particular optimization? reply aapoalas 7 hours agorootparentNot really: In my daydreams Nova becomes the premier JS engine in the world and takes the crown from V8. If V8 went all in and basically just copied all of Nova... I'd probably still develop Nova, as I don't want to work with C++ that much. If V8 copied all of Nova AND adopted Rust, I might consider laying Nova to rest and going into V8 development. But I'd probably also be really angry at V8 just taking all of Nova's good ideas and peddling them off as their own without crediting Nova. So probably I'd still keep developing Nova while stewing in my anger and inability to do anything about it :) I hope Nova can be a spark that ignites the JavaScript world into a bit of a renaissance with some of its ideas, but the point is not to burn bright and burn out. The point is to burn bright and stay lit. reply rob74 7 hours agorootparent> But I'd probably also be really angry at V8 just taking all of Nova's good ideas and peddling them off as their own without crediting Nova.

It would be a hard decision for me then :) reply liontwist 3 hours agorootparentprev1 it takes time and effort to make major architectural changes. Certain design choices made for other reasons may conflict. reply aapoalas 8 hours agoparentprevThat's a good point. The \"Internals of Nova\" blog posts do a bit more explicit comparisons to V8. In V8, and other production engines AFAIK, objects are variable-sized monoliths: All of their statically known data is contained in one slab. This means that for example in Node.js an empty ArrayBuffer is 96 bytes in size (IIRC). Basically, they implement the ECMASCript specification defined inheritance chain using object-oriented class inheritance. reply fastball 6 hours agoparentprevhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5olgPdqKZ84 reply aapoalas 8 hours agoprevA short comparison to how V8 does these things: 1. All data in V8 is allocated into one of many heap parts: Usually new data goes into a nursery space, and if it does not get GC'd it moves to the old space. Relative position of data isn't really guaranteed at this point. 2. All heap references in V8 are true pointers or, if pointer compression is used, offsets from the heap base. 3. All objects in V8 include all the data needed for them to act as objects, and all of their data is stored in a single allocation (with the exception of properties, with some exceptions). The more specialised an object is, say an ArrayBuffer, Uint8Array, or a DataView, the bigger it has to be as the specialisation requires more data to be stored. reply aag 2 hours agoprevI recommend reading /Don’t Stop the BIBOP: Flexible and Efficient Storage Management for Dynamically Typed Languages/ (1994)[1]. \"BIBOP\" stands for \"Big Bag of Pages.\" 1. https://legacy.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/pubs/bibop.pdf reply aapoalas 2 hours agoparentThank you, I'll put it on the reading list! reply lionkor 7 hours agoprevIsn't data oriented design driven by knowing what your data accesses look like? In your engine, you're building as if you're assuming that common data access will be linear access over objects of the same type. Why? reply aapoalas 7 hours agoparentYeah, know your data and how it is used. I assume that data access is mostly linear because of a few reasons: 1. All performance issues arise in loops: I at least have never seen a performance problem that could be explained by a single thing happening once. It is always a particular thing happening over and over again. 2. All loops deal with collections of data, and the collections are usually created either created manually by a human being, or are created through parsing or looping many at a time. 3. A human being can manually create a collection of maybe a hundred items manually before they get bored and stop. A collection created this way may contain data from all over the place, with data access over it being nonlinear. 4. A collection created through parsing or looping will create its data in a mostly linear fashion. Accessing the data will then also be linear. There are definitely cases where nonlinear collections exist, but these are usually either small or are created from smaller sets of linear data. eg. Think of dragging 10 lists of 1000 items to form a list of 10000 items. The entire 10000 items aren't going to be located linearly, but every 1000 items will be. So in effect, I'm betting that most hot loops do deal with linear access over objects and that loops that work over nonlinear access are not particularly hot. reply lionkor 20 minutes agorootparentMakes sense when you put it like that, thanks very much for explaining your thought process. reply skybrian 1 hour agoprevI’m wondering how this interacts with the “young objects mostly die” assumption of a generational garbage collector. It seems like using an arena for the young generation might work better for some programs, while an ECS-like scheme works better for other programs. reply aapoalas 1 minute agoparentThank you for asking! I've not implemented and thus haven't proved this in action yet, but my thinking is that this interacts very well indeed: Each heap vector can designate an index that marks the beginning of the young generation. We don't need separate old and new spaces, instead promotion is just the act of moving the young generation beginning index up. Side note: I have a corollary on the \"most objects die young\" that is very much at the heart of Nova: Most objects live together. If they are created at the same time, then they're likely also used together. Hence why I don't swap items around in the heap vectors, or use a free list for allocation: It would mess up the temporal order of items in the vectors, leading to less chances at useful cache line sharing. reply ajith-joseph 3 hours agoprevThis is fascinating! The data-oriented approach with type-specific vectors is quite a departure from traditional architectures like V8. I'm curious about two aspects: 1) Performance in Real-World Scenarios: Have you benchmarked Nova against established engines like V8 or SpiderMonkey in scenarios involving complex, non-linear data access patterns? How does it perform under typical workloads like DOM manipulation or complex async operations? 2) Trade-offs in Garbage Collection: You mentioned the potential pitfalls with vector growth and compaction during GC. Could this design lead to significant memory fragmentation or performance bottlenecks in long-running applications? Are there scenarios where this approach shines or struggles compared to more traditional heap designs? Looking forward to seeing how Nova evolves and the kind of applications it thrives in! reply aapoalas 3 hours agoparentThank you for your interest and fascination! To answer in brief: 1. We have async support but are still lacking some important parts (mainly interleaved GC) before complex, long-running performance benchmarks can be performed. I expect the performance to initially be relatively bad as we're missing important optimisations like shapes and inline caching. 2. The vector compacting is done so as to ensure that the heap allocated data does not fragment in memory. That being said, it's definitely possible that the heap vectors themselves slowly fragment to span disjoint memory areas instead of being all right next to each other. I don't think this will be a big problem though, as the vectors are still themselves densely packed. I expect the heap design will definitely suffer some penalties in cases where old data is slowly trickling out from underneath a mass of newer but still live data: During a major GC in these circumstances, the majority of data gets copied to densely pack the vector again. That being said, this isn't too different from a half-space copying garbage collector, and I don't think those are particularly terrible. reply whizzter 3 hours agorootparentI've built some prototypes and is there any particular reason you didn't go for NaN-tagged indexes instead unless it's for 32bit? Numeric cases would've had less loads since it's a number directly and indexes in the mantissa should be enough for at least about 48bit of ref space. I did consider a similar system ages ages ago for more easily embedding a JS engine into a C/C++ codebase, type-shapes would be allocated on a per page-basis so the runtime/GC wouldn't need any V-table pointers,etc on top of regular plain C object shapes to locate the type info but instead rely on an indirection per-page for those types shared with the C world. Ultimately felt a bit too complicated for something meant for embedding. reply aapoalas 2 hours agorootparentI didn't really consider NaN tagged indexes: Rust made using an enum basically a given. That being said, I probably wouldn't change even if could now. A NaN tagging scheme blocks out at least 11 bits out of your from your useful payload, leaving you with at most 46 bits to split between your discriminant and payload, while giving you freedom to express arbitrary doubles on the stack. A tagged index gives you 7 bytes to use for payload: This for instance gives us the possibility of representing all but the most decimal heavy doubles on the stack (we drop the bottom byte from a double if it is all zeroes, and save the remaining data on the stack), but also allowing up to 7 byte strings on the stack! And all safe integers! And up to 56 bits worth of Bigints! So, a tagged enum is pretty powerful :) reply kccqzy 2 hours agoprevWhat exactly is meant by the word \"kind\" here when you say kind-specific vectors? If I have `function X(a) { this.a = a; }` and then `function Y(b) { this.b = b; }` does that mean `new X(1)` and `new Y(2)` are considered objects of different kinds? And what about creating objects with literals: are `{a: 1}` and `{b: 2}` considered objects of different kinds? reply aapoalas 2 hours agoparentThey're specification wise, statically separate kind of objects: A class constructor is special and requires more \"internal slots\" so they live in their own vector, as do ArrayBuffers, TypedArrays, Arrays, DataViews, Maps, Sets, ... But objects that have different shapes do not end up in their own vectors, since the shape is a dynamic property. reply gardaani 7 hours agoprevIs this an experimental only JS engine or do you aim to implement the entire ECMAscript specification? I have been following the Rust Boa project, but I think that it isn't production ready, yet. https://github.com/boa-dev/boa reply aapoalas 7 hours agoparentThe aim is absolutely to implement the entire ECMAScript specification. Progress has slowed down recently, as I've been both busy with other things and tied up in making the engine work with interleaved GC. A secondary aim is to have a bunch of feature flags that allows the engine to drop out support for specification parts that a particular embedder doesn't care about. That obviously fights with the \"implement the entire ECMAScript specification\" goal, but I just hate indexed property getters and setters with a passion and want to see them gone wherever I go. Boa is a great project and I believe it is being used in some production systems. I've met and exchanged some ideas with the main developer, Jason Williams, and even received the greatest praise that I could imagine: Boa will (or did?) take some inspiration from Nova on its GC refactoring. Nova has also copied (with proper attribution of course) a few minor parts from Boa, like whitespace skipping code for some spec abstract operations. I highly recommend keeping an eye out and using Boa if you have the chance. reply pavlov 7 hours agoprevDo you have some specific application profile in mind? Sounds like this approach could be useful for games that embed a scripting engine. In that context it might be interesting to eventually see some benchmarks against usual suspects of game scripting like Lua. reply aapoalas 7 hours agoparentThe plan is to eventually get to full ECMAScript specification compatibility, and who knows if that would then bring us to eg. the Servo browser or Deno JS runtime. In the short term, I am interested in one-shot script running scenarios where only very limited JavaScript type are needed. The engine already has a bunch of feature flags that can be turned off to disable things like ArrayBuffers and other \"complex\" features. I have a work-related system in mind where only JSON based types are needed, and garbage collection isn't really necessary: The code could be run once and afterwards the system could be wiped down to the initial state and re-run. I also have half-a-mind to try running Nova on an STM32 board. But that could be called a hobby project within a hobby project :) reply pansa2 6 hours agoprevDoes Nova include a JIT compiler? Or just an interpreter? reply aapoalas 6 hours agoparentNova only has a bytecode compiler and interpreter. I do not plan on trying my hand at JIT compiling any time in the future. In this I am a follower of Ladybird's Andreas Kling and hope that JIT will not become necessary. reply mightyham 6 hours agorootparentI'm curious why you think JIT will not become necessary. My impression was that optimizing JIT compilers will basically always be multiple times faster than an interpreter. reply aapoalas 6 hours agorootparentI'm mostly just hoping it won't become necessary, though that is perhaps a vain hope. The reasoning is that, according to my interpretation of talking with some folks working on JSC and SM, property lookup inline caching is the most important performance optimisation bar none. JIT compiling is an improvement on top, definitely, but it is not an massive step change. Safari browser has a no-JIT mode that is fairly widely in use, and it is apparently fast enough that you don't really notice the change. Ladybird browser's LibJS has no JIT compiler, yet LibJS isn't really unbearably slow: The browser's biggest performance woes come from the browser around it and especially from having the simplest possible drawing algorithm possible. From a \"personal\" experience, while the test262 compliance test set is no performance benchmark, Nova is for some reason consistently at the very top of the runtime list over at https://test262.fyi/#. This is of course partially just because we're really quick to do a controlled panic if an unsupported code path is called, and the remaining part is because the code is run so little that JIT doesn't get to kick in. Still, this meaningless number gives me some measure of hope: We're consistently 3 times as fast as V8 after all :) reply ad-astra 4 hours agoprevWild, interested to see how Nova would perform on a benchmark suite. reply aapoalas 4 hours agoparentAt the moment: Poorly! :D The biggest obstacle right now is that for any reasonably big benchmark, Nova will never finish as the GC cannot be run while JavaScript is running and in a big benchmark JS is always running. I've started a large-scale work to make the engine safe for interleaved garbage collection, but it's a ton of work and will take some time unfortunately. Once it is done, I will start doing benchmarks and seeing what takes time and where. From small-scale benchmarks I already know that our JS Value comparisons take too much time, our object property lookups are really expensive on larger objects (as it's a simple linear search), and our String interning is very slow (as it too is a dumb-as-rocks linear search). reply PeterWhittaker 5 hours agoprevDo you plan on supporting TCO?

Shouldn't be too hard from what I can remember when I last looked over those parts of the code. reply ianbicking 2 hours agoprevI'm coming at this with no real JavaScript implementation knowledge, so these comments might not even make sense... The data sorting seems quite cleanly at first, but as I think more about it I don't quite get it. I guess you are saving a bit of space by segmenting by type... in another approach you might have the type on the pointer, and the pointer can point to anything, and so it's potentially a bit longer than having a type and pointer(/index) that points into a smaller portion of memory specific to that type. But enough to matter? \"No, pointers we do not want and cannot have, so the only real option is to use indexes. Indexes have a lot of benefits: They are small, work exceedingly well together with our heap vectors, enable using the same value to index into multiple heap vectors (or slices of the same heap vector), perform a form of pointer compression automatically, and offer great protection from safety vulnerabilities as reinterpreting an index as a different type changes both the type and the memory it indexes into.\" That all just sounds like a pointer to me? The last case also seems like a security hole, not protection. \"Not all objects are the same: They differ in their usage and their capabilities. An object-oriented reading of JavaScript objects' capabilities and the ECMAScript specification would give you a clear and simple inheritance graph where the ordinary object is the base object class, and Arrays, DataViews, Maps, and others inherit from that. Not all objects are the same: They differ in their usage and their capabilities. An object-oriented reading of JavaScript objects' capabilities and the ECMAScript specification would give you a clear and simple inheritance graph where the ordinary object is the base object class, and Arrays, DataViews, Maps, and others inherit from that.\" It seems like you are special-casing a specific set of object types (like Array), which is very justifiable. So sure. \"This is somewhat more of an aim for the future instead of current reality, but allow me to give some easy examples: The ArrayBuffer object in ECMAScript supports allocating up to 2^53 bytes of data. Most engines only allow a tad bit over 2^32 bytes but nevertheless, the fact of the matter is that you need more than 4 bytes to store that byte value. As a result, ArrayBuffer itself but also DataView and all the various TypedArray variants like Uint8Array must carry within them 8 byte data fields for byte offset, byte length, and even array length. Now ask yourself, how often do you deal with ArrayBuffers larger than 4 GiB? Not very often, obviously.\" I'm guessing this is leading to a decision many languages have made about numbers and strings, where there's special types for small numbers and short strings (exposed only in the implementation). Or even more special types, where the pointers become values. Also I can see a benefit to keeping track of \"normal\" Arrays and whatnot, so some of JavaScripts weird-but-not-usually-used behavior can be isolated, and normal behavior fast-tracked. \"In Nova we aim to split objects into parts to ensure that computationally unconnected parts are also stored separately in memory\" But this I don't get. If you are splitting things by type, how can you cluster them by how they are related? An object like {a: 1, b: 2} is an object with two strings and two numbers, presumably spread out over three different type-specific heaps? reply aapoalas 55 minutes agoparentHey, thank you for the comment! I'll try to answer as best I can. A pointer is 64 bits, though carrying much less useful payload than that. A JavaScript engine only rarely deals with more than 4 GiB of memory, so a 32 bit integer would be enough to index the entire memory needed. If you turn that though into indexes, a 32 bit index can speak of 4 billion separate items: Most programs never have that many distinct heap items alive at the same time. Note that this index doesn't now really correspond to indexable memory so we're no longer bound by the 4 GiB limit. We actually do keep the 64 bit Value though! We just use the massive amounts of data to store a lot of data on the stack, avoiding heap allocations altogether. > That just sounds like a pointer. A pointer points to one place and one place only: An index can points to as many places as there are \"parallel vectors\" associated with it. eg. Think of a table: A row index refers to as many cells as there are columns, whereas a cell pointer only identifies one cell. > The last case also seems like a security hole, not protection. Usually JS engines don't consider the JS-accessible contents of the JS heap itself part of the threat model: Any object in the heap is liable to be leaked by the JS code running in the engine anyway. eg. V8's object placement is fairly static and easy to exploit. The important thing for safety is to avoid type confusion which can be used to create read/write primitives to punch out of the sandbox. So; an attacker can freely read through the heap data by creating heap indexes out of thin air but they cannot use that to reinterpret one type of data as another type and then feed that back to the engine to cause it to misbehave. > But this I don't get. If you are splitting things by type, how can you cluster them by how they are related? An object like {a: 1, b: 2} is an object with two strings and two numbers, presumably spread out over three different type-specific heaps? Yes, this would split into the ordinary object vector, and the object property vector. If the keys were longer they'd end up in the strings vector and if the values were heap allocated doubles then they'd end up in yet another vector. Looking at it one thing at a time, it is split here and there. That being said, this doesn't really much change from how traditional engines do it: Strings are not going to be near the objects that use them as keys, nor are heap numbers, and (added) properties also go into a separate backing store which is likely not next to the object. Worst of all, even if all of these were next to the object, they'd span multiple cache lines and wouldn't really benefit from being close to each other as they're pointer chased and thus wouldn't get much guarantees of prefetching. When you look at multiple objects, however, then you'll see that Nova's object data is still found in those 4 vectors, whereas the traditional engine design... It may have tried it's best to keep the data together but it's probably still spread out here and there. And you're loading all unnecessary stuff like the elements pointer (for indexed properties) and any other inline properties etc. together with the properties that you actually wanted to read.

Say, for instance, array indexes being individually definable and the existence of holes? That whole can of worms makes JS Arrays a pain to implement in a performant fashion. Worse yet, it's a feature that is basically never used: No one wants holes in their Array and no one wants getters or setters in them either. So, say you have a nice flag to turn the feature off: You turn it off and test your code; nothing breaks and the engine thanks you by running faster. Nice! So you leave it off. A few years down the line you start to wonder: Why didn't we do this from the get go? And maybe, just maybe, this will push the ecosystem and the language itself towards sanity. We cannot break the Internet, but we sure as hell can break a bunch of old NPM libraries that no one uses anymore. Be the change you want to see, and all that.

    "originBody": "Gall's Law A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked John Gall This post walks you through the step-by-step discovery of state-of-the-art positional encoding in transformer models. We will achieve this by iteratively improving our approach to encoding position, arriving at Rotary Postional Encoding (RoPE) used in the latest LLama 3.2 release and most modern transformers. This post intends to limit the mathematical knowledge required to follow along, but some basic linear algebra, trigonometry and understanding of self attention is expected. Problem Statement You shall know a word by the company it keeps John Rupert Firth As with all problems, it is best to first start with understanding exactly what we are trying to achieve. The self attention mechanism in transformers is utilized to understand relationships between tokens in a sequence. Self attention is a set operation, which means it is permutation invariant (order does not matter). If we do not enrich self attention with positional information, many important relationships are incapable of being determined. This is best demonstrated by example. Motivating Example Consider this sentence with the same word in different positions: The dog chased another dog The dog chased another dog Intuitively, \"dog\" refers to two different entities. Let's see what happens if we first tokenize them, map to the real token embeddings of Llama 3.2 1B and pass them through torch.nn.MultiheadAttention. import torch import torch.nn as nn from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel model_id = \"meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B\" tok = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id) model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_id) text = \"The dog chased another dog\" tokens = tok(text, return_tensors=\"pt\")[\"input_ids\"] embeddings = model.embed_tokens(tokens) hdim = embeddings.shape[-1] W_q = nn.Linear(hdim, hdim, bias=False) W_k = nn.Linear(hdim, hdim, bias=False) W_v = nn.Linear(hdim, hdim, bias=False) mha = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim=hdim, num_heads=4, batch_first=True) with torch.no_grad(): for param in mha.parameters(): nn.init.normal_(param, std=0.1) # Initialize weights to be non-negligible output, _ = mha(W_q(embeddings), W_k(embeddings), W_v(embeddings)) dog1_out = output[0, 2] dog2_out = output[0, 5] print(f\"Dog output identical?: {torch.allclose(dog1_out, dog2_out, atol=1e-6)}\") #True As we can see, without any positional information, the output of a (multi headed) self attention operation is identical for the same token in different positions, despite the tokens clearly representing distinct entities. Let's begin designing a method of enhancing self attention with positional information, such that it can determine relationships between words encoded by their positions. To understand and design an optimal encoding scheme, let's explore some desirable properties such a scheme should have. Desirable Properties Let's try and define some desirable properties that will make the optimization process as easy as possible. Property 1 - Unique encoding for each position (across sequences) Each position needs a unique encoding that remains consistent regardless of sequence length - a token at position 5 should have the same encoding whether the current sequence is of length 10 or 10,000. Property 2 - Linear relation between two encoded positions The relationship between positions should be mathematically simple. If we know the encoding for position 𝑝 p, it should be straightforward to compute the encoding for position 𝑝 + 𝑘 p+k, making it easier for the model to learn positional patterns. If you think about how we represent numbers on a number line, it's easy to understand that 5 is 2 steps away from 3, or that 10 is 5 steps from 15. The same intuitive relationship should exist in our encodings. Property 3 - Generalizes to longer sequences than those encountered in training To increase our models' utility in the real world, they should generalize outside their training distribution. Therefore, our encoding scheme needs to be adaptable enough to handle unexpected input lengths, without violating any of our other desirable properties. Property 4 - Generated by a deterministic process the model can learn It would be ideal if our positional encodings could be drawn from a deterministic process. This should allow the model to learn the mechanism behind our encoding scheme efficiently. Property 5 - Extensible to multiple dimensions With multimodal models becoming the norm, it is crucial that our positional encoding scheme can naturally extend from 1 𝐷 1D to 𝑛 𝐷 nD. This will allow models to consume data like images or brain scans, which are 2 𝐷 2D and 4 𝐷 4D respectively. Now we know the ideal properties (henceforth referred to as 𝑃 𝑟 𝑛 Prn), let's start designing and iterating on our encoding scheme. Integer Position Encoding The first approach that may jump to mind is simply to add the integer value of the token position to each component of the token embedding, with values ranging from 0 → 𝐿 0→L where 𝐿 L is the length of our current sequence. In the above animation, we create our positional encoding vector for the token chased chased from the index and add it to our token embedding. The embedding values here are a subset of the real values from Llama 3.2 1B. We can observe that they're clustered around 0. This is desirable to avoid vanishing or exploding gradients during training and therefore is something we'd like to maintain throughout the model. It's clear that our current naïve approach is going to cause problems. The magnitude of the position value vastly exceeds the actual values of our input. This means the signal-to-noise ratio is very low, and it's hard for the model to separate the semantic information from the positional information. With this new knowledge, a natural follow on might be to normalize the position value by 1 𝑁 N1. This constrains the values between 0 and 1, but introduces another problem. If we choose 𝑁 N to be the length of the current sequence, then the position values will be completely different for each sequence of differing lengths, violating 𝑃 𝑟 1 Pr1. Is there a better way to ensure our numbers are between 0 and 1? If we thought really hard about this for a while, we might come up with switching from decimal to binary numbers. Binary Position Encoding Instead of adding our (potentially normalized) integer position to each component of the embedding, we could instead convert it into its binary representation and s t r e t c h our value out to match our embedding dimension, as demonstrated below. We've converted the position of interest (252) into its binary representation (11111100) and added each bit to the corresponding component of the token embedding. The least significant bit (LSB) will cycle between 0 and 1 for every subsequent token, whilst the most significant bit (MSB) will cycle every 2 𝑛 − 1 2n−1 tokens where 𝑛 n is the number of bits. You can see the positional encoding vector for different indices in the animation below 1. We've solved the value range problem, and we now have unique encodings that are consistent across different sequence lengths. What happens if we plot a low dimensional version of our token embedding and visualize the addition of our binary positional vector for different values. We can see that the result is very \"jumpy\" (as we might expect from the discrete nature of binary). The optimization process likes smooth, continuous and predictable changes. Do we know any functions with similar value ranges that are smooth and continuous? If we looked around a little, we might notice that both sin ⁡ sin and cos ⁡ cos fit the bill! Sinusoidal positional encoding The above animation visualizes our position embedding if each component is alternatively drawn from sin ⁡ sin and cos ⁡ cos with gradually increasing wavelengths. If you compare it with the previous animation, you'll notice a striking similarity! We've now arrived at Sinusoidal embeddings; originally defined in the Attention is all you need paper. Let's look at the equations: 𝑃 𝐸 ( 𝑝 𝑜 𝑠 , 2 𝑖 ) = sin ⁡ ( 𝑝 𝑜 𝑠 1000 0 2 𝑖 / 𝑑 ) 𝑃 𝐸 ( 𝑝 𝑜 𝑠 , 2 𝑖 + 1 ) = cos ⁡ ( 𝑝 𝑜 𝑠 1000 0 2 𝑖 / 𝑑 ) PE(pos,2i)=sin(100002i/dpos)PE(pos,2i+1)=cos(100002i/dpos) where 𝑝 𝑜 𝑠 pos is the tokens position index, 𝑖 i is the component index in the positional encoding vector, and 𝑑 d is the model dimension. 10 , 000 10,000 is the base wavelength (henceforth referred to as 𝜃 θ), which we stretch or compress as a function of the component index. I encourage you to plug in some realistic values to get a feel for this geometric progression. There's a few parts of this equation that are confusing at first glance. How did the authors choose 10 , 000 10,000? Why are we using sin ⁡ sin and cos ⁡ cos for even and odd positions respectively? It seems that using 10 , 000 10,000 for the base wavelength was determined experimentally 2. Deciphering the usage of both sin ⁡ sin and cos ⁡ cos is more involved, but crucial for our iterative approach to understanding. The key here is our desire for a linear relation between two encoded positions ( 𝑃 𝑟 2 Pr2). To understand how using sin ⁡ sin and cos ⁡ cos in tandem produce this linear relation, we will have to dive into some trigonometry. Consider a sequence of sine and cosine pairs, each associated with a frequency 𝜔 𝑖 ωi. Our goal is to find a linear transformation matrix 𝑀 M that can shift these sinusoidal functions by a fixed offset 𝑘 k: 𝑀 ⋅ [ sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) ] = [ sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 ( 𝑝 + 𝑘 ) ) cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 ( 𝑝 + 𝑘 ) ) ] M⋅[sin(ωip)cos(ωip)]=[sin(ωi(p+k))cos(ωi(p+k))] The frequencies 𝜔 𝑖 ωi follow a geometric progression that decreases with dimension index 𝑖 i, defined as: 𝜔 𝑖 = 1 1000 0 2 𝑖 / 𝑑 ωi=100002i/d1 To find this transformation matrix, we can express it as a general 2×2 matrix with unknown coefficients 𝑢 1 u1, 𝑣 1 v1, 𝑢 2 u2, and 𝑣 2 v2: [ 𝑢 1 𝑣 1 𝑢 2 𝑣 2 ] ⋅ [ sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) ] = [ sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 ( 𝑝 + 𝑘 ) ) cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 ( 𝑝 + 𝑘 ) ) ] [u1u2v1v2]⋅[sin(ωip)cos(ωip)]=[sin(ωi(p+k))cos(ωi(p+k))] By applying the trigonometric addition theorem to the right-hand side, we can expand this into: [ 𝑢 1 𝑣 1 𝑢 2 𝑣 2 ] ⋅ [ sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) ] = [ sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑘 ) + cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑘 ) cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑘 ) − sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑘 ) ] [u1u2v1v2]⋅[sin(ωip)cos(ωip)]=[sin(ωip)cos(ωik)+cos(ωip)sin(ωik)cos(ωip)cos(ωik)−sin(ωip)sin(ωik)] This expansion gives us a system of two equations by matching coefficients: 𝑢 1 sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) + 𝑣 1 cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) = cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑘 ) sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) + sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑘 ) cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 )𝑢 2 sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) + 𝑣 2 cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) = − sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑘 ) sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) + cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑘 ) cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 )u1sin(ωip)+v1cos(ωip)u2sin(ωip)+v2cos(ωip)=cos(ωik)sin(ωip)+sin(ωik)cos(ωip)=−sin(ωik)sin(ωip)+cos(ωik)cos(ωip) By comparing terms with sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) sin(ωip) and cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) cos(ωip) on both sides, we can solve for the unknown coefficients: 𝑢 1 = cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑘 ) 𝑣 1 = sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑘 )𝑢 2 = − sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑘 ) 𝑣 2 = cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑘 )u1u2=cos(ωik)=−sin(ωik)v1v2=sin(ωik)=cos(ωik) These solutions give us our final transformation matrix 𝑀 𝑘 Mk: 𝑀 𝑘 = [ cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑘 ) sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑘 ) − sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑘 ) cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑘 ) ] Mk=[cos(ωik)−sin(ωik)sin(ωik)cos(ωik)] If you've done any game programming before, you might notice that the result of our derivation is oddly familiar. That's right, it's the Rotation Matrix! 3. So the encoding scheme designed by Noam Shazeer in Attention is all you need was already encoding relative position as a rotation back in 2017! It took another 4 years to go from Sinusoidal Encoding to RoPE, despite rotations already being on the table... Absolute vs Relative Position Encoding With the knowledge in hand that rotations are important here, let's return to our motivating example and try to discover some intuitions for our next iteration. 0 1 2 3 4 The dog chased another dog -2 -1 0 1 2 The dog chased another dog 01234The dog chased another dog-2-1012The dog chased another dog Above we can see the absolute positions of our tokens, and the relative positions from chased chased to every other token. With Sinusoidal Encoding, we generated a separate vector which represents the absolute position, and using some trigonometric trickery we were able to encode relative positions. When we're trying to understand these sentences, does it matter that this word is the 2149th word in this blog post? Or do we care about its relationship to the words around it? The absolute position of a word rarely matters for meaning - what matters is how words relate to each other. Positional encoding in context From this point on, it's key to consider positional encoding in the context of self attention. To reiterate, the self-attention mechanism enables the model to weigh the importance of different elements in an input sequence and dynamically adjust their influence on the output. Attn ( 𝑄 , 𝐾 , 𝑉 ) = softmax ( 𝑄 𝐾 𝑇 𝑑 𝑘 ) 𝑉 Attn(Q,K,V)=softmax(dkQKT)V In all our previous iterations, we've generated a separate positional encoding vector and added it to our token embedding prior to our 𝑄 Q, 𝐾 K and 𝑉 V projections. By adding the positional information directly to our token embedding, we are polluting the semantic information with the positional information. We should be attempting to encode the information without modifying the norm. Shifting to multiplicative is the key. Using the dictionary analogy, when looking up a word (query) in our dictionary (keys), nearby words should have more influence than distant ones. The influence of one token upon another is determined by the 𝑄 𝐾 𝑇 QKT dot product - so that's exactly where we should focus our positional encoding! 𝑎 ⃗ ⋅ 𝑏 ⃗ = ∣ 𝑎 ⃗ ∣ ∣ 𝑏 ⃗ ∣ cos ⁡ 𝜃 a⋅b=∣a∣∣b∣cosθ The geometric interpretation of the dot product shown above gives us a magnificent insight. We can modulate the result of our dot product of two vectors purely by increasing or decreasing the angle between them. Furthermore, by rotating the vector, we have absolutely zero impact on the norm of the vector, which encodes the semantic information of our token. So now we know where to focus our attention, and have seen from another angle why a rotation might be a sensible \"channel\" in which to encode our positional information, let's put it all together! Rotary Postional Encoding Rotary Postional Encoding or RoPE was defined in the RoFormer paper (Jianlin Su designed it independently on his blog here and here). While it may seem like voodoo if you skip to the end result, by thinking about Sinusoidal Encoding in the context of self attention (and more specifically dot products), we can see how it all comes together. Much like in Sinusoidal Encoding, we decompose our vectors ( 𝑞 q or 𝑘 k, instead of pre-projection 𝑥 x) into 2D pairs/chunks. Rather than encoding absolute position directly by adding a vector we drew from sinusoidal functions of slowly decreasing frequencies, we cut to the chase and encode relative position by multiplying each pair with the rotation matrix. Let 𝑞 q or 𝑘 k be our input vector at position 𝑝 p. We create a block diagonal matrix where 𝑀 𝑖 Mi is the corresponding rotation matrix for that component pairs desired rotation: 𝑅 ( 𝑞 , 𝑝 ) = ( 𝑀 1 𝑀 2 ⋱ 𝑀 𝑑 / 2 ) ( 𝑞 1 𝑞 2 ⋮ 𝑞 𝑑 ) R(q,p)=M1M2⋱Md/2q1q2⋮qd Much the same as Sinusoidal Encoding, 𝑀 𝑖 Mi is simply: 𝑀 𝑖 = [ cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) − sin ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) cos ⁡ ( 𝜔 𝑖 𝑝 ) ] Mi=[cos(ωip)−sin(ωip)sin(ωip)cos(ωip)] In practice, we don't use a matrix multiplication to compute RoPE as it would be computationally inefficient with such a sparse matrix. Instead, we can directly apply the rotations to pairs of elements independently, taking advantage of the regular pattern in the computation: 𝑅 Θ , 𝑝 𝑑 𝑞 = ( 𝑞 1 𝑞 2 𝑞 3 𝑞 4 ⋮ 𝑞 𝑑 − 1 𝑞 𝑑 ) ⊗ ( cos ⁡ 𝑝 𝜃 1 cos ⁡ 𝑝 𝜃 1 cos ⁡ 𝑝 𝜃 2 cos ⁡ 𝑝 𝜃 2 ⋮ cos ⁡ 𝑝 𝜃 𝑑 / 2 cos ⁡ 𝑝 𝜃 𝑑 / 2 ) + ( − 𝑞 2 𝑞 1 − 𝑞 4 𝑞 3 ⋮ − 𝑞 𝑑 𝑞 𝑑 − 1 ) ⊗ ( sin ⁡ 𝑝 𝜃 1 sin ⁡ 𝑝 𝜃 1 sin ⁡ 𝑝 𝜃 2 sin ⁡ 𝑝 𝜃 2 ⋮ sin ⁡ 𝑝 𝜃 𝑑 / 2 sin ⁡ 𝑝 𝜃 𝑑 / 2 ) RΘ,pdq=q1q2q3q4⋮qd−1qd⊗cospθ1cospθ1cospθ2cospθ2⋮cospθd/2cospθd/2+−q2q1−q4q3⋮−qdqd−1⊗sinpθ1sinpθ1sinpθ2sinpθ2⋮sinpθd/2sinpθd/2 That's all there is to it! By artfully applying our rotations to 2D chunks of 𝑞 q and 𝑘 k prior to their dot product, and switching from additive to multiplicative, we can gain a big performance boost in evaluations 4. Extending RoPE to 𝑛 n-Dimensions We've explored the 1 𝐷 1D case for RoPE and by this point I hope you've gained an intuitive understanding of an admittedly unintuitive component of transformers. Finally, let's explore extending it to higher dimensions, such as images. A natural first intuition could be to directly use the [ 𝑥 𝑦 ] [xy] coordinate pairs from the image. This might seem intuitive, after all, we were almost arbitrarily pairing up our components previously. However, this would be a mistake! In the 1 𝐷 1D case, we encode the relative position 𝑚 − 𝑛 m−n through a rotation of pairs of values from our input vector. For 2 𝐷 2D data, we need to encode both horizontal and vertical relative positions, say 𝑚 − 𝑛 m−n and 𝑖 − 𝑗 i−j independently. RoPE's brilliance lies in how it handles multiple dimensions. Instead of trying to encode all positional information in a single rotation, we pair components within the same dimension and rotate those, otherwise we would be intermixing the 𝑥 x and 𝑦 y offset information. By handling each dimension independently, we maintain the natural structure of the space. This can generalize to as many dimensions as required! The future of positional encoding Is RoPE the final incarnation of positional encoding? This recent paper from DeepMind deeply analyses RoPE and highlights some fundamental problems. I anticipate some future breakthroughs, perhaps taking inspiration from signal processing with ideas like wavelets or hierarchical implementations. As models are increasingly quantized for deployment, I'd also expect to see some innovation in encoding schemes that remain robust under low-precision arithmetic. Conclusion Positional encoding has and continues to be treated as an after thought in transformers. I believe we should view it differently - self attention has an Achilles heel that has been repeatedly patched. I hope this blog post showed you that you too could have discovered state of the art positional encoding, despite it being unintuitive at first. In a follow up post I'd love to explore practical implementation details for RoPE in order to maximise performance. Thanks to Madeline Ephgrave for proof reading this.

What is the connection between the two? Where does \"Q\" come from? What are \"K\" and \"V\"? (I know they stand for \"Query\", \"Key\", \"Value\"; but what do they have to do with position embeddings?) reply flebron 32 minutes agoparentAll of them are vectors of embedded representations of tokens. In a transformer, you want to compute the inner product between a query (the token who is doing the attending) and the key (the token who is being attended to). An inductive bias we have is that the neural network's performance will be better if this inner product depends on the relative distance between the query token's position, and the key token's position. We thus encode each one with positional information, in such a way that (for RoPE at least) the inner product depends only on the distance between these tokens, and not their absolute positions in the input sentence. reply valine 17 hours agoprevOne of the things I really love about rope is that it allows for a lot of interesting encoding schemes at inference time without model retraining. I’ve had a lot of fun playing with different relative positions. You can elicit a lot of interesting behaviors from the model when you use different rotations for keys vs queries, they don’t always have to match. For example exact position doesn’t matter too much when tokens are spaced out. Let’s say you use token position 100 for your query, you can shift all the keys around position 100, and the further they are back in the context the more freedom you have to play with the value. reply zackangelo 47 minutes agoparentI'm surprised this is the case! I've been working on a rope implementation for my own project (needed to account for padding in unique situations) and even an off by one error usually causes the model to produce non-sensical output. reply valine 40 minutes agorootparentYou have to be careful to keep the relative positions for adjacent and nearby tokens intact.

The model will still follow the instruction but the behaviors are more global. It’s behaves more like a fine-tune and less like the instruction is part of the conversation. reply rgovostes 16 hours agoprevThanks to the author for clarifying something that's been a mystery to me for a few years.

When given a permuted sequence, the attention output will also be permuted, not identical. The need for positional encodings is due to two tokens resulting in the same value in the final attention matrix regardless of the tokens' absolute and relative position; that is enough to miss a lot of meaning. reply aconz2 5 hours agoparentTo add on since this took me a while to understand: for a single token, self attention is permutation invariant because we take the qK (one query dot all the other keys) weighted sum of all the values; that sum is what gives the invariance because + is commutative. But for all the tokens, the mha output matrix will not be invariant, but rather equivariant, where you apply the same permutation to the output matrix as you did to the input tokens. What might be a more useful example is to take one position, like the last one, and compute its mha for every permutation of the previous tokens; those will/should all be the same. reply FL33TW00D 10 hours agoparentprevThe first code example says False because of high precision, I've updated the example. reply jmmcd 9 hours agorootparentBut u/imjonse's reasoning seems right.

At first glance it seemed to be way overcomplicated just to encode position, so I figured I was missing something. ChatGPT was super helpful in explaining spiking neural networks to me so I just spent 20 minutes asking ChatGPT to explain this to me and I feel like I actually learned something. Then at the end I asked ChatGPT how this all relates to how it operates and it was interesting to see things like: >Tokens as Subword Units: I use a tokenization method called Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which breaks text into subword units.

Are there techniques to do that.

So that when trained again another part of the same book, the model can learn they were from same context. reply jmmcd 3 hours agoparentThis is a good idea! The answer to my knowledge is no-one does this, we just the simplest, stupidest, possible method, which is to concatenate all the text in the world. That is during training, of course. At runtime, there is the system prompt. The second simplest method might indeed use something like a system prompt with metadata like that, injected before the current window of text. But what would happen at runtime, when that metadata is not present? Probably performance would be much worse. reply throwawaymaths 16 hours agoprevMaybe someone could answer this for me: it seems like encoding the positional embeddings as augmentations to the \"natural\" activations instead of as their own inputs (concatenated onto the activations) make things like sliding a window much harder... I guess obviously the drawback is you have a somewhat less textually derived information. I recall a early transformers video where they tried both and it turned out that adding the position onto the existing vectors was no worse so they went with it... No further discussion about motivations happened in that video. Is it worth revisiting that maybe now that activations have a gobsmackingly large dimension? reply stephantul 13 hours agoparentThey are not concatenated, but summed. I think concatenation wouldn’t work, as you indicate. I think you mean the line in the original paper where they say compared the learned attention weights with the predefined encoding, and it made no difference. reply throwawaymaths 11 hours agorootparent> I think concatenation wouldn’t work, as you indicate. Why do you say that? reply donkeyboy 6 hours agorootparentConcat could work too although less efficient because you need to make a new tensor. Actually summing might learn a concat on its own. Imagine the embedding learned for a token takes up the first N-20 dimensions and leaves the last 20 dimensions as 0. And the positional encoding causes the first N-20 dims to be 0 and the last 20 to encode the information. Then when you sum you are actually concatenating. So I think of them as equivalent except add is more efficient/preserves the dim space, while concat would grow the dim space. And for something like position, which certainly does not need to occupy 1000+ dimensions, it would not make sense to concat all of that since it would be wasteful reply cperciva 14 hours agoprevThe binary coding example would have been much better with Gray codes. reply logicchains 10 hours agoprevDoes anyone know why 2D rope implementations apply two separate 1D rotations to pairs, instead of applying a 2d rotation to triplets? reply rini17 6 hours agoparentNo they apply many rotations, same as the number of dimensions of the embedding space. reply Der_Einzige 12 hours agoprev [–] Similarly, \"you\" could have designed state of the art LLM sampling: https://openreview.net/forum?id=FBkpCyujtS&referrer=%5BTasks... reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "BY DHRUV MEHROTRA SECURITYNOV 13, 2024 8:37 PM Teen Behind Hundreds of Swatting Attacks Pleads Guilty to Federal Charges Alan Filion, believed to have operated under the handle “Torswats,” admitted to making or orchestrating more than 375 fake threats against schools, places of worship, and prominent US politicians. PLAY/PAUSE BUTTON PHOTO-ILLUSTRATION: ANJALI NAIR; GETTY IMAGES IN PERHAPS THE largest swatting case to ever be prosecuted, an 18-year-old from Lancaster, California, has pleaded guilty to federal charges stemming from a nationwide spree of hundreds of shooting and bomb threat hoaxes that sent police scrambling to high schools, courthouses, and the homes of law enforcement officials and prominent politicians. Alan Winston Filion now faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison for each of four counts of making interstate threats to injure the person of another, according to the United States Department of Justice. Early this year, Filion was arrested and extradited to Seminole County, Florida. At the time, state prosecutors charged Filion with four state-level felony counts stemming from a single incident in which, prosecutors allege, Filion told a Sanford Police Department dispatcher that he was armed with pipe bombs and an AR-15 rifle and was walking into Masjid Al Hayy Mosque to kill everyone he saw. Filion, whom authorities believe operated online as “Torswats,” has been in jail without a trial for nearly a year. He entered a plea of not guilty to the state charges. The federal charges announced on Wednesday, along with interviews from people connected to the investigation—and Filion himself—allege his swatting activities reached far beyond Florida’s borders. Between approximately August 2022 to January 2024 Filion made more than 375 swatting calls, according to the plea agreement. These included incidents where he claimed to have planted bombs or threatened to conduct mass shootings at targeted locations that included religious institutions, high schools, and historically black colleges and universities. “This prosecution and today’s guilty plea reaffirm the Justice Department’s commitment to using all tools to hold accountable every individual who endangers our communities through swatting and hoax threats,” deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco said in a statement. “For well over a year, Alan Filion targeted religious institutions, schools, government officials, and other innocent victims with hundreds of false threats of imminent mass shootings, bombings, and other violent crimes. He caused profound fear and chaos and will now face the consequences of his actions.” According to court records, Filion was also part of a high-profile international swatting group that targeted several prominent figures between December 2023 and January 2024. Among the victims were US Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Jen Easterly, Republican US representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and Republican senator Rick Scott of Florida. Investigators say they linked the scheme to roughly 100 calls, one of which targeted an unnamed former president of the United States.

During interviews with the US Secret Service in January and February, both men admitted their roles in the scheme. Radovanovic, however, claimed that he was directed by a third party who provided detailed scripts and selected the targets. According to the plea agreement, Filion admitted to orchestrating the operation, supplying the names, addresses, and phone numbers of many of the targeted individuals. “I shot my wife in the head with my AR-15,” a man identifying himself as \"James\" said in one such call. He told dispatchers in Georgia that he caught his wife sleeping with another man and, after killing her, had taken the man hostage. “I’ll release him for $10,000 in cash,” he added, threatening to detonate pipe bombs and blow up the house if his demands weren’t met. This call targeted the home of Georgia state senator John Albers. The case against Filion, first reported by WIRED, was built on a trail of digital evidence left across platforms like Telegram, YouTube, and Discord, and pieced together by Brad “Cafrozed” Dennis, a private investigator. Dennis had been hired by two high-profile Twitch stars, both victims of Torswats’ calls, to find the person responsible. For months, Dennis had posed online as a vengeful ex-husband looking to troll and harass his former wife. He used this persona to infiltrate private Discord servers and Telegram groups where Torswats and affiliates hung out. These were chats dedicated to extortion plots and racist memes; channels filled with child sexual abuse material, self-harm, and animal abuse—some of the worst content he'd ever seen, Dennis told WIRED. On New Year's Eve 2022, Dennis sent Torswats a private message on Telegram: “You wanna make some real cash? Add me on Tox,” he wrote, referring to the peer-to-peer messaging service, under the pretense of arranging a swatting. Using network monitoring tools, Dennis then captured the IP address linked to the Torswats account and uncovered a new username: \"Paimon Arnum.\" In January 2023, Dennis handed this critical piece of evidence, along with other usernames and active Discord servers he had tracked over several months, over to the FBI.

By early May, the FBI had successfully pinpointed Torswats’ identity and location. That month, Torswats privately took responsibility for swatting incidents in Telegram chats reviewed by WIRED. These incidents affected up to 25 schools in Washington state, impacting approximately 18,116 students and costing taxpayers an estimated $271,173 in lost instructional time, according to Don Beeler, CEO of TDR Technology Solutions, a company specializing in school surveillance and threat analysis. Additionally, 911 audio and other police records obtained by WIRED corroborate that the same individual made the calls for more than a dozen of these swatting incidents. In some instances, the caller told dispatchers he had been commanded by Satan to kill students. In others, he said he had been mistreated because he was gay. In others, he seemed to have become bored enough with the game that he didn’t bother to make up a reason. On July 12, the Torswats handle announced a new swatting operation dubbed the “Grand Offensive,” targeting a dozen senators. Three days later, the FBI raided Filion’s home and seized his electronic devices. But the raid didn’t stop the swatting. On November 6, 2023, someone using the Torswats handle took responsibility for a bomb threat aimed at North Beach High School in Ocean Shores, Washington, through a Telegram message. According to police reports and call records obtained by WIRED, the caller impersonated a drug dealer who wanted to report his client to the police because he had said he had placed pipe bombs around the school and was planning a mass shooting. That same month, a person going by Torswats also admitted to swatting an investigator and cybercrime expert named Keven Hendricks in private Telegram communications. Both threats could be attributed to the same individual, according to a law enforcement official who reviewed the recordings for WIRED but requested anonymity because they were unauthorized to speak to the press. Details about Filion’s life outside his online activities remain sparse. Enrollment records from Lancaster’s Antelope Valley Community College show that Filion began pursuing a degree in mathematics in the fall of 2022. A former classmate, who requested anonymity due to fears of retaliation, described Filion as quiet and “forgettable.” “He didn’t appear to have many friends,” they said. In January 2024, an individual affiliated with the Torswats Telegram account and claiming to be a friend of Filion suggested that he was part of a group aiming to incite racial violence and that he sought money to “buy weapons and commit a mass shooting.” The allegation aligns with a written tip, placed to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center in April 2023 and obtained by WIRED, alleging that the person behind the Torswats account was involved in a neo-Nazi cult known as the Order of Nine Angles. “He believes he is doing his part to bring about the end of days by ‘bleeding the finances and man hours of the system,’” the tipster wrote. Filion’s family could not be immediately reached for comment. A sentencing date for the teenager has not yet been set. Updated at 10:45 am EST, November, 2024: Added additional details about Filion’s involvement in swatting attacks against prominent US government officials and others.",

This is not accurate. The timeframe is not wrong; it is true that the concept of the modern police, at least in the US, was largely based on the Peelian model created in London in the 1820s. But saying it evolved from \"warehouse guards and slave patrols\" is ahistorical. Most modern police forces modeled after London's Metropolitan Police replaced night watch systems that have been around for literally all of recorded history. reply michaelt 2 hours agorootparent> the concept of the modern police, at least in the US, was largely based on the Peelian model created in London in the 1820s. There are some pretty big differences between the UK policing model and the one used in the US. The UK model was set up against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars (the French police's role included monitoring dissent, suppressing political opposition [1] and even censoring books) and the Peterloo Massacre [2] (where cavalry were set on a peaceful protest campaigning for more than 2% of people to be allowed to vote) The Peelian model [3] is one of 'policing by consent' where the police focus their efforts on the sorts of crimes the average citizen wants solved - rather than on suppressing political dissent, or censoring books, or launching cavalry charges against protests. Peel's police aren't a military force, which is why very few of them have guns. If the American police are based on Peelian principles, then an awful lot of the principles have gotten lost in translation. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fouch%C3%A9#In_Napoleon...

As merchants grew, and their goods became more valuable targets, the merchants would hire on guards, but saw the opportunity to turn the existing night watch systems in place to their favor, essentially insisting on distributing the cost of guarding their goods across the community. I'm not saying the night watches didn't evolve into police departments, I'm saying the night watches were co-opted prior to them becoming uniformed departments. And slave patrols led directly into being police departments in some parts of the US. I do not claim that's in the history of all depts, but across the south there are many cases of patrols becoming formalized into police departments. reply andrewla 2 hours agorootparentFor the warehouse guards, to summarize, you're saying that night watchmen and city watchmen were de facto warehouse guards before the formation of professional police forces? That seems a far cry from \"evolved out of warehouse guards\". Police still put resources into protecting property, but this does not make them \"warehouse guards\" any more than resources put on petty crime make them \"cutpurse chasers\" unless you're just making rhetorical points.

Unfortunately, I speak from experience. I received a credible threat, called my local PD, and they began to investigate immediately. They also put notes in their dispatch system (which is shared by the local SWAT team) indicating that this had happened before, and to proceed with extreme caution. The \"swatter\" never did follow through on the first attempt, but did follow through about 6 months later. I didn't get any threats from the swatter that time, but did get a call from my local PD while I was at work, and they let me know they'd driven by my place and called it off after being confident it was a false alarm. Anticipating questions: no, there's no sort of protocol I setup with the PD. They have to investigate every threat, and even if we setup some sort of \"shared secret\" ahead of time, if a swatter says I'm cutting up my family in the basement, the PD can't know with certainty that I'm not. About the best I can do is make sure to answer the door when/if the PD shows up so they can more quickly establish things are safe.

To be clear, your 2nd statement is why ACAB. The police are the people fighting against the open & honest accountability you are asking for. When accountability comes up, they refuse to do their jobs[1], inflate crime numbers & incident severity[2], harass the few cops trying to improve accountability until they quit[3], and actively campaign against accountability[4].

Except that there is no way, biochemically speaking, the kind of contact they had with fentanyl could have produced anything resembling those symptoms. It was an entirely psychosomatic reaction, brought on by the police's own utterly false propaganda about how terrifyingly dangerous fentanyl is. Similarly, so much of their \"high stress\" is because they expect to be attacked/shot/killed at any given moment even when, by any reasonable analysis, they are 100% safe. Furthermore, a lot of the actual danger to them is manufactured by this exact phenomenon: they expect a physical confrontation, so, in order to ensure they \"win\" it, they create it, striking preemptively in one fashion or another. reply slothtrop 2 hours agorootparent> But a very large percentage of the \"high stress/pressure\" of being a police officer in the US is literally manufactured by the police themselves.

And when they do go out of their way to deal with people who many become violent they show up with the kind numerical advantage that would make Stalin proud.

The argument that that means only firearms similar to those available at the time of the passing the Second Amendment sounds largely similar to the thinking. And be careful about brining the First Amendment into that... the First Amendment as it was understood by its creators was not about your write to say anything you wanted without government response, it was about your right to publish your own newspaper (or broadsheet/advertisement) without the government issuing you a license or collecting a tax (both of which the colonial government did). The second amendment was ratified in 1791, and just 7 years later (1978) the Alien and Sedition Acts were ratified by congress, in large part other silence critics of the federal government by making it illegal to say \"false, scandalous, and malicious\" about it (with the exception of about the Vice-President). And it was absolutely used as a political tool, and this was approved of by the Supreme Court at the time.

The phone companies never claimed to be building a \"secure telecom system\", nobody ever offered to pay for them to ensure high grade authentication and integrity checking of phone calls. And the cops know that. And don't care. They are the people showing uo with military weapons to people's homes. It's their responsibility to know and understand the reliability of the information they're acting on, and the ease with which the phone system can be made to show them misleading information.

I think they're really fucking stupid. I think they think that since they are making up claims that everything will be alright. Like the cops are going to bust in, see that there's no drugs/hostages/satanic rituals/whatever, say \"My bad\", and fuck off. But there's always the chance that things go horribly wrong.

Brutal police behavior is seen as either acceptable, or what even desirable. I've seen reddit posts where a protester slightly taunts the police and gets pepper sprayed in the face, and all the commenters were gleefully saying things like \"fuck around and find out\", without even thinking that maybe there wasn't enough fucking around to warrant any finding out. When you try and point this out, you're called various names, because apparently you either support the police 100%, or you're a criminal. reply mlinhares 16 hours agorootparentExactly this. There's no fixing the system when there is no onus on the police to act like they care. They enter a home that was a victim of swatting and kill everyone? Tough luck, \"it's part of the job\", \"we told them to stand down and they didn't\", \"we couldn't risk the life of the first responders\". There's always a reason as to why police violence is fine. Its almost as if the police isn't really there to protect normal people. reply stavros 15 hours agorootparent> Its almost as if the police isn't really there to protect normal people. Well, it's not. Even here, the function of the police is to enforce the will of the state, not to protect people. The protection is a side-effect of the enforcement, but enforcement can also be things like terrorizing minorities. reply Loughla 16 hours agorootparentprevI'm pretty sure there are a number of people in the US who don't support the police in any way at all. There was a whole song a few years ago called Fuck the police, I'm pretty sure. It's like sweeping categorizations of an entire country are usually not accurate or something. reply davely 16 hours agorootparentThat song was released in 1988 by NWA, a hip hop group from Compton, California.

Yes, this is so trivially true of any place that it's not worth mentioning, as generalizations are meant as just that: Something that a majority (or at least a large minority) are like. For example, people do say \"people in the US speak English\", even though there's a number of people that don't. This doesn't make the generalization any less useful than \"Americans like baseball\" or \"Americans wear shoes around the house\". reply scruple 12 hours agorootparentprevI grew up in a small town and was on the wrong side of law enforcement (sometimes rightfully -- underage drinking, etc., nothing that serious -- but oftentimes not) around 2 dozen times between 16/17 and 21 when I got the fuck out of that town. I haven't so much as spoken to an on-duty cop in over 20 years. To this day I still get nervous when I see a police car. They earned their image problems and they haven't even begun to try to correct it. Even if they started tomorrow, it would still take them decades to fix it. I'm not hopeful that any meaningful change in policing in the US will take place in my lifetime. And, for anyone who isn't reading between the lines here, without a doubt I'm only so lucky as to avoid their attention today because I made it and have spent the last 2 decades living in nice neighborhoods and driving nice cars. reply bear141 15 hours agorootparentprevI live in America and while I have compassion for some individual cops, I hate them as a whole with a burning passion.

A cop who does everything right leaves the force. reply ClassyJacket 16 hours agorootparentprevnext [33 more] [flagged] ganoushoreilly 16 hours agorootparentThis is a mischaracterization of what actually happens in the us. Using sensationalism doesn't help, instead let's focus on the actual numbers and be constructive on how to decrease them. In 2023 it's estimated police killed around 1,248 people. Notice I said killed vs Murdered as words matter. Out of that only 104 were unarmed. Now without looking at each case or example here, you can still account for the mass majority of police interactions ending in a death, the civilian was armed at a minimum. Using the data provided we could say easily that 1,248 people is way too many. Hell, 1 is too many. That doesn't change reality though, if 1,248 deaths were related to individuals engaging in crime, this is a causality that you can lay solely on the civilian victim, as they chose to engage in this action. We can argue how many were crimes, that's fair and i'm happy to throw out and say let's assume 25% were not crimes and really were just an escalated interaction. The bureau of justice statistics gave numbers for 2022 that estimated that 49.2 million people or 19% of the US had an interaction with the police. If that's true, napkin math would put the police murders at .0025% of the interactions, and assuming 333,287,557 million people in 2022 (census bureau) places it at .00037% of the population died by the hands of police. Some related statistic. Roughly 500 people die from falling out of bed or off furniture, 300-400 die from drowning in a bath tub, 4,000 die from choking on food, 150 die from coconuts falling on their head, 500-600 die from falling from a ladder. Looking at the numbers, it's very hard to say that police \"Regularly murder people\". As for the \"Everyone having guns\" that's a separate debate, but I would posit you're correct with regard to criminals performing criminal acts, that are armed, increase the likelihood of a negative out come. Federal arrests for weapons offenses were around 8,000 with states being at close to 12,000. Putting that at 20,000 or so arrests per year. Even with those numbers if you're arrested with a firearm, you're still at around 6% chance of death. Again given the circumstances and propensity for needless escalation, these numbers while bad aren't crazy. There are multiple problems in the US. We need better training and funding for police departments, we do need to weed out the bad cops (as with any field), but with all that the most common denominator is criminal behavior. All of that said, If you've got data points or information that may be counter to the above, i'd be very curious to see it. I'm very much open to having my mind changed on the topic and encourage you to post it up for all of us here. reply brohee 12 hours agorootparentGoing in details on how they were armed would be interesting. How many people with a limp \"armed\" with a cane... Pretty sure they managed to sneak this one (https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/john-fauver-harford-c...) in the armed category Also dogs are not any more armed in the US than in Europe, yet American cops shoot a lot more dogs. They do so because they are antisocial and know they'll face no consequences (and even if they get fired from on PD, another will recruit them).

And that's ignoring any of the armed individuals who are not, in fact, threatening anyone or committing a crime. And the people for whom a crime may be being committed, but for which \"death\" is not an appropriate punishment - even ignoring the police being judge, jury, and executioner in a society where we presume innocence and require conviction by a jury of our peers. reply bruce511 14 hours agorootparentI'd add that \"armed\" doesn't mean necessarily a firearm. I don't know what threshold is used in after-action reports (written by those involved or others), but presumably finding a pocket knife on someone counts as \"armed\". Would personal protection devices (mace, batons etc) count as armed. Call me a cynic, but 104 people being 'unarmed' makes me think the reports in those cases simply lack creativity in defining \"arms\" and, (again cynically) I expect some number of the other cases the individuals were either helpfully discovered to be armed after the fact. (And in some cases actually provided with arms after the fact.) reply jakelazaroff 15 hours agorootparentprev> In 2023 it's estimated police killed around 1,248 people.

Now without looking at each case or example here, you can still account for the mass majority of police interactions ending in a death, the civilian was armed at a minimum. Does the Second Amendment not exist? Which other constitutional rights do you think we should use to justify these murders? reply harshreality 13 hours agorootparent\"Armed\" is a proxy for criminals being criminals, and almost always reaching for, displaying, or using the weapon in some antisocial way prior to being shot dead. Legal gun owners not committing obvious crimes are only rarely accosted by police, and shootings are exceedingly rare, and they usually make the news and result in legal action. They also usually involve the victim doing something that's not advisable, even if they're not doing anything legally wrong. Philando Castile, for instance, or Johnny Hurley. \"Unarmed\" doesn't represent what the suspect was doing that got them shot. Were they resisting arrest or being noncompliant and reaching for their waist or a center console or glove compartment? There are cases where police shoot suspects, armed or unarmed, unjustifiably. They're not as rare as anyone wishes they were. They're still fairly rare. Behaving civilly, even while recognizing that many police are like barely constrained wild animals, goes a long way toward ensuring that an accidental furtive gesture isn't interpreted as reaching for a weapon. reply jakelazaroff 4 hours agorootparentNo, “armed” isn’t a proxy for anything. It means they were found to be carrying a gun. It doesn’t matter whether they were committing a crime or doing something inadvisable — the point is that if merely being armed justifies your extrajudicial murder by police, then the Second Amendment doesn’t actually exist. reply harshreality 1 hour agorootparentIt is, because cops never shoot someone just for being armed. They just don't. It's a combination of being armed plus (believed) criminal status, or behavior during the encounter. (And it's exceedingly rare that cops will believe an upstanding citizen who's legally armed and behaving civilly is a criminal. It happens, for instance in the two cases I cited, but it's rare. They're a rounding error in the police killing stats.) reply jakelazaroff 33 minutes agorootparentWhy do you believe that? We routinely see police break the law, harass people and otherwise abuse their power, but when it comes to encounters with armed civilians they become upstanding professionals with perfect judgment? reply Rebelgecko 14 hours agorootparentprevThe 2nd Amendment doesn't give you the right to brandish at cops (or anyone else, outside of limited situations like self defense) reply jakelazaroff 13 hours agorootparentGP merely said “armed”, not “brandishing”. reply Rebelgecko 1 hour agorootparentThat feels like a weird category to use IMO. People who brandish are armed but not all armed people are brandishing. More to the point, if you went to your local PDs website and watched body cam from the last 10 shootings, how many do you think would be involve law abiding gun owners with CCWs using guns in a way consistent with the 2nd Amendment vs people brandishing or using their guns in a criminal and/or dangerous way? reply jakelazaroff 1 hour agorootparentAgain, I am not the one using that category; I am responding to its use. How many were using their guns in a dangerous and/or criminal way? We may never know, because they were deprived of their right to the trial by jury which would have determined that. reply ganoushoreilly 12 hours agorootparentprevArmed during a police encounter.

From that perspective, 'regular' sounds like something of an understatement. Swatting just isn't a thing here - our armed officers are trained completely differently and held to much stricter standards regarding the use of force. American police do have to deal with much more widespread gun ownership and higher rates of violent crime, but that's only one half of the equation. Policing in the US is exceptionally fragmented across thousands of agencies, with no consistent standards of training and supervision. Even if there was a clear political mandate to reduce the number of police-involved shootings, there's no effective mechanism to change how policing is carried out on the ground. https://www.statista.com/statistics/319246/police-fatal-shoo... https://www.college.police.uk/about reply monetus 15 hours agorootparentCan I ask you about the political power of police? Is there an equivalent to our police union? My mayor is downright afraid of them. reply jdietrich 5 hours agorootparentExtremely limited. Police officers are not legally permitted to join a conventional trade union, because of the risk to public safety that would be posed by industrial action. Rank-and-file officers are represented by the Police Federation, which has many of the functions of a trade union but none of the legal recognition. More broadly, the British police are a service, not a force. A British officer would never refer to a member of the public as a \"civilian\", because our police are civilians in uniform. They have powers granted to them by Parliament, but their right to use those powers comes from the consent of the public that they serve.

I would suggest that both appear here. Personally I would prefer votes to be on quality of post rather than popularity of position as that leads to the possibility of examining an issue from multiple viewpoints. (When responding to a post that has been thought out, but down voted, I feel the need to point out that although I disagree, I'm not the one downvoting.)

Every significant element of TCP, from its stream orientation to its expectation of in-order packet delivery, is wrong for the datacenter. It is time to recognize that TCP's problems are too fundamental and interrelated to be fixed; the only way to harness the full performance potential of modern networks is to introduce a new transport protocol into the datacenter. Homa demonstrates that it is possible to create a transport protocol that avoids all of TCP's problems. Although Homa is not API-compatible with TCP, it should be possible to bring it into widespread usage by integrating it with RPC frameworks.

You’re basically looking for a protocol supported in hardware from endpoint to endpoint, including in firewalls, switches, routers, load balancers, traffic shapers, proxies, etcetera - a very tall order indeed. Then, to add to that very expensive list of criteria, you also need the talent to support it - engineers who know it just as thoroughly as the traditional TCP/IP stack and ethernet frames, but now with the added specialty of data center tuning. Then you also need the software to support and understand it, which is up to each vendor and out of your control - unless you wrap/encapsulate it in TCP/IP anyway, in which case there goes all the nifty features you wanted in such a standard. By the time all of the proverbial planets align, all but the most niche or cutting edge customer is looking at a project the total cost of which could fund 400G endpoint bandwidth with the associated backhaul and infrastructure to support it - twice over. It’s the problem of diminishing returns against the problem of entrenchment: nobody is saying modern TCP is great for the kinds of datacenter workloads we’re building today, but the cost of solving those problems is prohibitively expensive for all but the most entrenched public cloud providers out there, and they’re not likely to “share their work” as it were. Even if they do (e.g., Google with QUIC), the broad vibe I get is that folks aren’t likely to trust those offerings as lacking in ulterior motives. reply klysm 3 hours agoparentIf anybody is gonna do it, it's gonna be someone like amazon that vertically integrates through most of the hardware reply stego-tech 3 hours agorootparentThat’s my point: TCP in the datacenter remains a 1% problem, in the sense that only 1% of customers actually have this as a problem, and only 1% of those have the ability to invest in a solution. At that point, market conditions incentivize protecting their work and selling it to others (e.g., Public Cloud Service Providers) as opposed to releasing it into the wild as its own product line for general purchase (e.g., Cisco).

It was designed to connect block storage devices to servers while making the OS think they are directly connected. OSs do NOT tolerate dropped data when reading and writing to block devices and so Fibre Channel has a extremely robust Token Bucket algorithm. The algo prevents congestion by allowing receivers to control how much data senders can send. I have worked with a lot of VMware clusters that use FC to connect servers to storage arrays and it has ALWAYS worked perfectly. reply Sebb767 12 hours agoparent> I wonder why Fibre Channel isn't used as a replacement for TCP in the datacenter But it is often used for block storage in datacenters. Using it for anything else is going to be hard, as it is incompatible with TCP. The problem with not using TCP is the same thing HOMA will face - anything already speaks TCP, nearly all potential hires know TCP and most problems you have with TCP have been solved by smart engineers already. Hardware is also easily available.

Back in ~2012 I was setting up a high-frequency network for a forex company and at the time we deployed Mellanox and they had some very (at the time) bleeding edge networking drivers that significantly reduced the overhead of writing to TCP/IP sockets (particularily zero-copy which TL;DR meant data didn't get shifted around in memory as much and was written to the ethernet card's buffers almost straight away) that made a huge difference. I eventually left the firm and my successors tried to replace it with cisco gear and Intel NICs and the performance plummeted.

It just sounds like bad planning to me. And still not a protocol issue. reply bayindirh 2 hours agorootparentDepends on where you run out of ports, actually. A datacenter has layers of networking, and some of it is what we call \"the core\" or \"the spine\" of the network. Sometimes you need to shuffle things around, and you need to move things closer to core, and you can't because there are no ports. Or you procure the machines, and adding new machines requires some ports closer or at the core, and you are already running at full capacity there. I mean, it can be dismissed like \"planning/skill issue\", but these switches are fat machines in terms of bandwidth, and they do not come cheap, or you can't get them during lunch break from the IT shop at the corner when required. Being able to carry 1.2Tbit/sec of aggregated network from a dozen thin fibers is exciting, but scaling expensive equipment at a whim is not. At the end of the day \"network core\" is more monolithic than your outer network layers and server layout. It's more viscous and evolves slowly.

Did it make any difference? In theory for shortlived TCP connections, fastopen ought to be a win. It's very easy to implement in Linux (just a couple of lines of code in each client & server, and a sysctl knob). And the main concern about fastopen is middleboxes, but in a data center you can control what middleboxes are used. In practice I found in my testing that it caused strange issues, especially where one side was using older Linux kernels. The issues included not being able to make a TCP connection, and hangs. And when I got it working and benchmarked it, I didn't notice any performance difference at all. reply slt2021 13 hours agoprevthe problem with trying to replace TCP only inside DC, is because TCP will still be used outside DC. Networking Engineering is already convoluted and troublesome as it is right now, using only tcp stack. When you start using homa inside, but TCP from outside things will break, because a lot of DC requests are created as a response for an inbound request from outside DC (like a client trying to send RPC request). I cannot imagine trying to troubleshoot hybrid problems at the intersection of tcp and homa, its gonna be a nightmare. Plus I don't understand why create a a new L4 transport protocol for a specific L7 application (RPC)? This seems like a suboptimal choice, because RPC of today could be replaced with something completely different, like RDMA over Ethernet for AI workloads or transfer of large streams like training data/AI model state. I think tuning TCP stack in the kernel, adding more configuration knobs for TCP, switching from stream(tcp) to packet (udp) protocols where it is warranted, will give more incremental benefits. One major thing author missed is security applications, these are considered table stakes: 1. encryption in transit: handshake/negotiation 2. ability to intercept and do traffic inspection for enterprise security purposes 3. resistance to attacks like flood 4. security of sockets in containerized Linux environment reply jayd16 12 hours agoparentAre you imagining external TCP traffic will be translated at the load balancer or are you actually worried that requests out of an API Gateway need to be identical to what goes in? I could see the former being an issue (if that's even implied by \"inside the data center\") and I just don't see how it's a problem for the latter. reply slt2021 9 hours agorootparentA typical software L7 load balancer (like nginx) will parse entire TCP stream and HTTP header and applies bunch of logic based on URL, and various HTTP headers. There is a lot of work going on in the userland, like filling up TCP buffer, parsing HTTP stream, applying bunch of business logic, creating a downstream connection, sending data, getting response, etc. This is a lot of work in the userland and because of that a default nginx config is like 1024 concurrent connections per core, so not a lot. L4 load balance on the other hand works purely in a packet switching mode or NAT mode. So the work consists in just replacing IP header fields (src.ip, src.port, dst.ip, dst.port, proto), it can use various frameworks like intel vectorized packet processing or Intel dpdk for accelerated packet switching. Because of that, L4 load balancer can work perform very very close to the line rate speed, meaning it can load balance connections as fast as packets arrive to the network interface card. Line rate is the theoretical maximum of packet processing. In case of stateless L4 load balancing there is no upper bound in number of concurrent sessions to balance, it will almost as fast as core router that feeds the data. As you can see L4 is clearly superior in performance, but the reason L4 LB is possible is because it has TCP inbound and TCP outbound, so the only work required is replace IP header and recalculate CRC. With Homa, you would need to fully process TCP stream, before you initiate Homa connection, meaning you will waste a lot of RAM on keeping TCP buffers and rebuilding the stream according to the TCP sequence. Homa will lose all its benefits in the load balancing scenario. Author pitches only one use case for homa: East-West traffic, but again - these days the software is really agnostic of this East-West direction. What your software thinks is running in the server in next rack, could as well be a server in a different Availability Zone or read replica in different geo region. And that's the beauty of modern infra: everything is a software, everything is ephemeral, and we don't really care if we running this in a single DC or multiple DCs. Because of that, I think we will still stick to TCP as a proven protocol that will seamlessly interop when crossing different WAN/LAN/VPN networks I am not even talking about software defined networks, like SD-WAN where transport&signaling is done by the vendor-specfic underlay network, and overlay network is really just abstraction for users that hides a lot network discovery and network management underneath reply nicman23 12 hours agoparentprevonly thing homa makes sense is when there is no external tcp to the peers or at least not on the same context ie for roce reply slt2021 9 hours agorootparent1. add software defined network, where transport and signaling is done by vendor-specific underlay, possibly across multiple redundant uplinks 2. term \"external\" is really vague as modern networks have blended boundaries.

Joking aside, I've seen this first thang when using things like ethernet/tcp to transfer huge amounts of data in hardware.

Then stanrds have modes, and even if you use a subset the hardware must usually support all to be compliant, adding much most cost in hardware.

You try offering a consumer service over SCTP first, and that is decades old by this point. reply cletus 5 hours agoprevNetwork protocls are slow to change. Just look at IPv6 adoption. Some of this is for good reason. Some isn't. Because of everything from threat reduction to lack of imagination equipment at every step of the process will tend to throw away anything that looks weird, a process somebody coined as ossification. You'll be surprised how long-lasting some of these things are. Story time: I worked on Google Fiber years ago. One of the things I worked on was on services to support the TV product. Now if you know anything about video delivery over IP you know you have lots of choices. There are also layers like the protocls, the container format and the transport protocol. The TV product, for whatever reason, used a transport protocol called MPEG2-TS (Transport Streams). What is that? It's a CBR (constant bit rate) protocol that stuffs 7 188 byte payloads into a single UDP packet that was (IPv4) multicast. Why 7? Well because 7 payloads (plus headers) was under 1500 bytes and you start to run into problems with any IP network once you have larger packets than that (ie an MTU of 1500 or 1536 is pretty standard). This is a big issue with high bandwidth NICs such that you have things like Jumbo frames to increase throughput and decrease CPU overhead but support is sketchy on a hetergenous network. Why 188 byte payloads? For compatibility with Asynchronous Transfer Mode (\"ATM\"), a long-dead fixed-packet size protocol (53 byte packets including 48 bytes of payload IIRC; I'm not sure how you get from 48 to 188 because 4x48=192) designed for fiber networks. I kind of thought of it was Fiber Channel 2.0. I'm not sure that's correct however. But my point is that this was an entirely owned and operated Google network and it still had 20-30+ year old decisions impacting its architecture. Back to Homa, three thoughts: 1. Focusing on at-least once delivery instead of at-most once delivery seems like a good goal. It allows you to send the same packet twice. Plus you're worried about data offset, not ACKing each specific packet; 2. Priority never seems to work out. Like this has been tried. IP has an urgent bit. You have QoS on even consumer routers. If you're saying it's fine to discard a packet then what happens to that data if the receiver is still expecting it? It's well-intentioned but I suspect it just won't work in practice, like it never has previously; 3. Lack of connections also means lack of a standard model for encryption (ie SSL). Yes, encryption still matters inside a data center on purely internal connections; 4. QUIC (HTTP3) has become the de-facto standard for this sort of thing, although it's largely implementing your own connections in userspace over UDP; and 5. A ton of hardware has been built to optimize TCP and offload as much as possible from the CPU (eg checksumming packets). You see this effect with QUIC. It has significantly higher CPU overhad per payload byte than TCP does. Now maybe it'll catch up over time. It may also change as QUIC gets migrated into the Linux kernel (which is an ongoing project) and other OSs. reply javier_e06 5 hours agoprevIn your data center usually there is a collection of switches from different vendors purchased through the years.

And that thing tesla presented recently, with custom silicon even. And as usual, hardware gets faster, better and cheaper over the next years and suddenly the problem isn't a problem anymore - if it even ever was for the vast majority of applications. We only recently got a new fleet of compute nodes with 100gbit NICs. The previous one only had 10, plus omnipath. We're going ethernet only this time. I remember when saturating 10gbit/s was a challenge. This time around, reaching line speed with tcp, the server didn't even break a sweat. No jumbo frames, no fiddling with tunables. And that actually was while testing with 4 years old xeon boxes, not even the final hw. Again, I can see how there are use cases that benefit from even lower latency, but thats a niche compared to all DC business, and I'd assume you might just want rdma in that case, instead of optimizing on top of ethernet or IP. reply silisili 10 hours agorootparentThis is a solid answer, as someone on the ground.

Or a burst of interference could disrupt the radio link. Or a backhoe could slice through the cable. Or many other things.

But that both misses the point and is part of the point. The reason that I ask is that WebSockets seem to almost always be used in the context of web applications. TCP/IP still seems to dominate control communications between hardware. But why not WebSockets? Almost everyone ends up building a message framing protocol on top of TCP/IP, so why not just use WebSockets which has bi-directional message framing built-in? I'm just not seeing why WebSockets aren't as ubiquitous as TCP/IP and only seem to be relegated to web applications. reply dataviz1000 12 hours agorootparentThere isn't much of a difference between a router between two machines physically next to each other and a router in Kansas connecting a machine in California with a machine in Miami. The packets of data are wrapped with an address of where they are going in the header. WebSockets are long lived socket connection designed specifically for use on the 'web'. TCP is data sent wrapped in packets that is ordered and guaranteed delivery. This causes a massive overhead cost. This is different from UDP which doesn't guarantee order and delivery. However, a packet sent over UDP might arrive tomorrow after it goes around the world a few times. With fetch() or XMLHttpRequest, the client has to use energy and time to open a new HTTP connection while a WebSocket opens a long lived connection. When sending lots of bi directional messages it makes sense to have a WebSocket. However, a simple fetch() request is easier to develop. A developer needs to good reason to use the more complicated WebSocket. Regardless, they both send messages using TCP which ensures the order of packets and guaranteed delivery which features have a lot to do with why TCP is the first choice. There is UDP which is used by WebRTC which is good for information like voice or video which can have missing and unordered packets occasionally. If two different processes on the same machine want to communicate, they can use a Unix socket. A Unix socket creates a special file (socket file) in the filesystem, which both processes can use to establish a connection and exchange data directly through the socket, not by reading and writing to the file itself. But the Unix Socket doesn't have to deal with routing data packets. (ChatGPT says \"Overall, you have a solid grasp of the concepts, and your statements are largely accurate with some minor clarifications needed.\") reply j16sdiz 12 hours agorootparentprevWebSocket is fairly inefficient protocol. and it needs to deal with the upgrade from HTTP. and you still need to implement you app specific protocol.

With raw TCP you're going to be spending a week doing something millions of other developers have done again and again in your own custom bespoke way that nobody else will understand. Your second point is very dismissive. You're inserting random application requirements that the vast majority of application developers don't care about and then you claim that only in this situation do WebSockets make sense when in reality the vast majority of developers only use WebSockets and your suggestion involves the second unwanted protocol (e.g. the horror that is protobuffers and gRPC). reply wmf 12 hours agorootparentprevInteresting point. For example, Web apps cannot speak BitTorrent (because Web apps are not allowed to use TCP) but they can speak WebTorrent over WebRTC and native apps can also speak WebTorrent. So in some sense a protocol that runs over WebSockets/WebRTC is superior because Web apps and native apps can speak it. reply tkin1980 13 hours agoparentprevWell, Websocket is over TCP, so you already need it for that. reply znpy 8 hours agoparentprev> Unrelated to this article, are there any reasons to use TCP/IP over WebSockets?

You can tell the app is made by a patient who suffers from the condition, which is amazing. I would be really careful in this area though, especially using ChatGPT to generate suggestions. This to me this does venture into medical device territory, based on the intended use. Check the guidelines here https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-devices-s... - UK specific, but will be similar for FDA. Honestly, I would seek proper consultancy advice, remove any suggestions / recommendations for now, and just have it as a data-logging platform. The disclaimer unfortunately will not stand up.

Yep - exactly, they took a leap, but importantly didn't release a full product / package on the App Store, or charge for features.

I downloaded the app, just to check it out, and the one thing that just struck me right off the bat is the permissions.

I don’t know the full app ecosystem, and if it would be possible for your app to interfere with the insulin delivery settings on her pump. if you have a website or anything that discusses how the application operates and what the permissions are used for it definitely check it out.

I can see the obvious use cases like photo recognition of meals for tracking, but wondering if there's anything more unique. reply ajith-joseph 3 hours agoprevThis is an incredible initiative, Joshua—combining personal experience with technology to tackle such a complex challenge is inspiring. I have a few questions and thoughts: 1) Data Security and Privacy: Since Islet uses ChatGPT for query translations and insights, how do you handle sensitive health data? Is everything processed locally, or is some data shared with external servers? Many users will likely have concerns about privacy, especially given the nature of medical information. 2) Accuracy and Reliability: How do you ensure that the insights provided by the app, powered by ChatGPT, are consistently accurate and reliable for users managing diabetes? For instance, if there’s a delay in CGM data or inaccuracies in user-entered data, could the insights potentially lead to incorrect interpretations? 3) Long-term Vision: Are there plans to integrate real-time data syncing with devices like CGMs or insulin pumps to enhance automation? Perhaps features like predictive alerts for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia based on activity patterns? 4) Community Input: Have you considered ways for users to share feedback or contribute to the app’s development, perhaps through an open forum or beta program? This could foster a community around Islet and accelerate improvements. This feels like a tool with the potential to truly make a difference. Excited to see how it evolves and wishing you the best in your journey! reply therahim 2 hours agoprevCongratulations on shipping! This looks incredibly polished for an initial release from a solo developer. And as others have said, great name! As a T1D dad it's great to see work like this, not least because it should raise the expectations of what we should expect from well funded engineering teams within the established players. Right now it's not a great fit for my use case, in that one phone follows my 9 year old around, but the bulk of management happens on other phones on distinct accounts. I agree with @jcims point about the permissions, greedily allowing write permissions to those data items up front feels like a real point of friction, I'd much prefer to see that done lazily at the point the user is enabling a feature that needs it. reply ainiriand 7 hours agoprevI would like to know more about what kind of data is powered by ChatGTP, what kind of data is sent there because it states on-device. I am not sure how ChatGPT can give any advice (if it is even given in the app) about insulin or glucose. reply yeatsy 7 hours agoparentHey, Thanks for asking. The Islet app is designed as a knowledge base that logs crucial data, including insulin dosages, meals, and physical activities. It aims to provide users with insights into how these factors interact to impact their blood sugar levels. Here's a breakdown of how ChatGPT integrates into the app and what data is involved: What kind of data powers ChatGPT in Islet? The ChatGPT component in Islet acts as a translation and query layer rather than the sole knowledge source. Islet’s knowledge base aggregates and organises the user’s logged data, such as: - Glucose Levels: Derived from CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) data. This Data is currently on a 3hr delay in the app. - Insulin Dosages: Logged by the user to capture the timing, type, and amount of insulin administered. - Meals: Users can log meals in detail, including macronutrient composition, portion sizes, and timing. - Activities: Logs include exercise type, intensity, and duration, as physical activity significantly impacts glucose regulation. Does ChatGPT provide advice? While the app itself does not directly provide medical advice, the ChatGPT integration facilitates better use of the logged data by enabling the user to ask targeted questions. For example: - \"How has my blood sugar been affected by pasta meals over the past two weeks?\" - \"What impact does my 30-minute cycling routine typically have on my glucose levels?\" - \"Are there patterns between my evening meals and morning glucose levels?\" Purpose of the App The primary purpose of Islet is to empower users with a system that captures and organises their diabetes-related data into a knowledge base. The ChatGPT layer makes querying this knowledge base intuitive by translating user questions into actionable insights, offering: 1. Pattern Analysis: It helps users understand trends by analysing recurring meals and activities regimens and their effects on blood sugar levels. 2. Education: Users gain a better understanding of their unique responses to different scenarios, supporting informed decisions in their diabetes management. By focusing on personalised, data-driven insights rather than generic advice, Islet ensures that the ChatGPT integration remains a helpful tool for exploring user-specific trends. reply rubymamis 5 hours agorootparentThis reply seems to be partly generated by chatGPT, which makes me nauseous… reply andrewchilds 16 hours agoprevCongrats on the launch, Joshua!

Appreciate the kind words about Islet. It still has a long way to go ! reply Nk26 17 hours agoprevDoes the photo recognition attempt to carb count what it sees? Is that even possible? My son is a T1D and he still struggles with carb counting. reply jrflowers 17 hours agoparentIt is absolutely not possible to carb-count through photo recognition in a way that is reliable enough for a diabetic to safely use to make treatment decisions. reply nihzm 6 hours agorootparentIndeed, around 2019 I was reading many computer vision papers for volume estimation and came across a few that tried to estimate the weight of the meals from pictures using the size of known objects (cutlery beside the plate). The idea was good but they were very far from accurate and not robust at all, and that was just for the weight, not even carb counting. I know CV is a fast moving field but I wouldn't bet that the tech has improved enough to be anywhere near medically safe. reply je42 12 hours agorootparentprevHowever, if you dont have carb info, the alternative is to judge yourself. Your own model may be better than gpts model, though. I would use GPTs output and at least look at it on a case by case basis reply Nk26 16 hours agorootparentprevI meant more in a general way, like a piece of pizza is usually around X carbs. We have apps that make the guess a bit easier but it's almost always a guess. I was thinking could this look at a photo and know there's a sweet potato, a piece of chicken and some corn and give a basic idea. reply jrflowers 16 hours agorootparentThe answer is still Absolutely Not, especially since all food can involve a treatment decision for people with type 1 diabetes. Pizza is a good example of why not. Slices come in very different sizes, sauces have very different carb content, so do crusts, and toppings. Edit: for example this pizza(1) is 31g per slice and this pizza(2) is 73g per slice. The difference is very meaningful and the “general idea” given by photo recognition would likely be wrong to the point of dangerous for a diabetic in both cases. If you’re looking for software that can make a guess simply for the sake of generating a number to write down and not be used in any way, a random number generator would be safer since the risk of output being misconstrued as actual information is much lower. 1 https://www.costcobusinessdelivery.com/kirkland-signature-ca... 2 https://sbarro.is/product/bbq/ reply pimeys 13 hours agorootparentYep. And the issue with pizza is the amount of fat that comes with the carbs. This quite often (depending on the position of the moon) gives you some of the carbs when you eat it to your blood, and the rest will come after several hours. What you want to do is to inject a bit of insulin before eating, then after two or three hours more while measuring your glucose levels. Of course if you eat a Neapolitan pizza with not that much of cheese everything changes again. And YMMV, I'm just talking about my experiences. reply je42 12 hours agorootparentNot only fat plays a role with pizza, but also the amount of protein in it. When having pizza we usually add protein to the carbs. 50% immediately bolus. Other 50% spread over 3-4 hours, and let AAPS dose the insulin. reply Nk26 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you use then to make these decisions? If you use your eyes, app, nutrition label or Chatgpt, you would still have the same variables. You're still making the decision based on averages, and best guesses. reply jrflowers 16 hours agorootparentI use nutrition labels. I have absolutely no idea whatsoever why anyone would lump nutrition labels in with your eyes or chatgpt. The people that make the label make the food. They know what they put in it. Because they made it. They wrote down what they put in it for you to read and make decisions off of. The difference is categorical. reply junikaefer 15 hours agorootparentprevI cook myself and i know which and how much ingredients i use and how much carbs they contain. Either from a food label or in general (like 100g of cooked potatoes contain about 16g carbs). Then I calculate how much my serving contains. Depending on what you eat, what type of diabetes you have and how it’s treated you may have to consider the amount of protein and fat as well (they slow digestion and cause a delayed rise in blood sugar levels). If you have an insulin pump you may want to program a delayed insulin dose to handle that. Sounds complicated? It is, but only during the first weeks. You quickly learn the carbs content of the food you frequently eat and learn to estimate how much is on your plate. Like, two units for a bun. There are also great nutrition apps out there that help a lot. reply renewiltord 10 hours agorootparentprevPersonally, I take a representative sample and then use a calorimeter to test it. Anyone who doesn't do this is being grossly irresponsible and will only have themselves to blame when they eat so dangerously. I recommend a CK 5E-C5808J but you have to ensure a trained professional is helping you. Otherwise, you might as well not eat at all. reply jevogel 16 hours agorootparentprevYeah, you can try this on the ChatGPT app. Take a picture and ask ChatGPT to give you the nutrition info, then do your own calculations based on weight and the USDA database and see how it compares. reply jrflowers 1 hour agorootparentSimilarly, chatgpt can run a mile for you if you ask it to and then get up and run a mile. reply OccamsMirror 17 hours agoparentprevIt's probably slightly worse than an educated guess? reply astura 6 hours agoparentprev>Is that even possible?

Instead of sending your data to ChatGPT, it uses multiple scientific models to calculate your insulin resistance, basal dose and can give you an accurate amount of insulin to dose based on the number of carbs you input. What the Android app can do and iOS makes very hard is to control your pump and close the loop. It is illegal to distribute health apps in binary form if they control your pump, but very much legal in source code form. Try it out: https://androidaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ This is a life-changing app. It lowered my A1c values from around 8% to 5.5%. What is so special with Android is how easy it is to side-load apps, so you can compile AndroidAPS by yourself and keep using it. In Apple ecosystem you need the developer subscription and you also need to reinstall the app every now and then.

    "title": "How Japanese black companies oppress workers (2014)",
    "originLink": "https://www.tofugu.com/japan/japanese-black-companies/",
    "originBody": "If you hear the term \"black company\", what kind of company do you imagine? As we all know, black is the darkest color, so if you pictured an evil company with a dark side then you would be on the right track. A black company (aka \"black corporation\" or \"black business\") is buraku kigyō ブラック 企業きぎょう in Japanese. In general, it is a term used to refer to an unacceptably exploitative employment system. Now, maybe you're thinking this is a word to describe a factory somewhere in China, but you'd be wrong. The term is actually usually associated with white-collar industries rather than blue-collar ones. It was coined by young IT workers in the early 2000's and, being the IT workers that they were, spread this nickname around the internet as an internet meme. Now, thanks to its fame, it is a term that can be used for other industries that are not IT. The Black Company And A Film As the popularity of the term grew, the black company problem received more and more attention in Japan. In 2009, a drama film called \"A man on the verge at a BLACK company\" was released. It was based on an office worker who started a 2ch thread about the black company he worked at. This company's ruthless and unethical work environment was duplicated in the film. As you can see in the film clip, the workers are being pushed to their limit and obviously not in good shape. Can you imagine working someplace like that for real? Well, bad (black) companies are really out there and this sparked a move towards calling them out. Still, there was a long way to go to bring about public awareness. The Black Company Awards Source: Beshef In 2012, a group of people that included journalists, activists, and university professors formed a special committee to create the \"Black Corporations Award\" where the public could vote on \"the most evil corporations of the year.\" The award name may sound silly, but its creators were not joking. They were hoping to raise awareness of black company issues as well as expose some of the evil abusers of employees. This is now an annual award. The most recent award, which took place on June 17th of 2013, nominated eight companies: Watami Foodservice Co., Ltd (Restaurant Chain) Cross Company Inc. (Clothing Retailer) Benesse Corporation (Education and Publishing) Sun Challenge Corporation (Steak Restaurant Chain) Ohsho Food Service Corporation (Restaurant Chain) Seino Transportation Co., Ltd (Transportation Service) Tokyu Hands Inc. (Department Store) Tohoku University All nominations were made on the following basis: Actual public records on occupational problems such as a long work time, sexual harassment, or abuse of power. Long intense work hours. Low pay. Compliance violations. Flaws in the system, such as lack of childcare leave or maternity leave. Hostility to unions. Discrimination against temporary workers. Temporary worker dependance. npaid overtime (and lies about paid overtime in the job advertisements). Most black companies already have the above problems, so the nominees were chosen for being especially bad. After the nominations, there was a period in which people could vote. The winner? Watami Foodservice Co., and by a wide margin. They got 21,899 votes, 72% of the total. This was followed by Tohoku University (3,475 votes), Benesse Corporation (1,258 votes), Cross Company Inc (1,220 votes), Seino Transportation Co., Ltd (1,000 votes), Ohsho Food Service Corporation (744 votes), Sun Challenge Corporation (649 votes), and Tokyu Hands Inc (346 votes). Watami has won this award for two years in a row so far. Watami's winning streak is due to its notoriously abysmal mistreatment of young workers. In 2008, Mina Mori, a female employee of Watami, committed suicide at the age of 26 after reportedly working 141 hours of overtime in one month. It happened just two months after joining the restaurant chain. Some people may think committing suicide is an individual matter and that a company cannot be held responsible. However, it is reasonable to assume Mori would not have chosen suicide for herself had she not been forced into such a desperate situation. Furthermore, it is apparent just how \"black\" the Watami company is simply by the cold reaction of Watami founder Miki Watanabe's reaction to the case. He not only refused to meet with her family but also refused to apologize to them until last month. He finally did offer an apology in court on March 27, 2014, though he still has denied liability. According to an interview with a former Watami restaurant manager conducted by Takarajima magazine (September 2013 edition), upon hearing the news of Ms. Mori's suicide, the ex-manager wondered if it was really just 141 hours. During his time at Watami, he regularly worked from 7am to 12am with almost no break, making his monthly overtime over 300 hours. He also revealed that Miki Watanabe gives extreme messages to workers on every payday, such as: \"Regret as hard as you die!\" He even received a personal letter from the evil president in his paycheck envelope saying: \"you should reflect on your sales this month by killing yourself.\" Source: Miyo Sekimoto There was also an illegal but mandatory 1,000 yen deduction from every payment and workers were told that it was for \"social contribution.\" When Watanabe published his own book, the price of the book was automatically deducted from the payment and workers were forced to buy them as well. Although there wasn't any physical violence, he remembered that there was much verbal violence, often relating to \"killing himself.\" That sounds pretty awful, right? These workers were not treated like human beings… more like robots. Though even robots shouldn't have to work this hard. Obviously a lot of other people felt the same way and anti-Watami movements have risen. On the same day that Watami apologized to Ms. Mori's family, Watami decided to temporarily close 60 restaurants (about 10% of the total) to improve their work environment. I hope this will really be the start of some reform so that others won't have to endure the same mistreatment. Perhaps thanks to this and the awareness brought about by the Black Company Awards, the term buraku kigyō ブラック 企業きぎょう made the final 10 of the most popular or influential Japanese buzzwords in 2013! So, consider the checkbox of \"raising awareness\" filled in, though there's still much work to be done. What Colors A Company Black? Source: David Gunter So what are the exact qualifications for a company to be considered a black company? You can get some idea from the stories of Watami, but a lawyer named Yoshiyuki Iwasa, who is also the author of ブラック 企業きぎょうに 倍返きぎょうしだ! (which means \"to take double revenge on the black company\") created a checklist for a website called Business Media to find out whether the company is \"black\" or \"not black.\" There are thirty items on the list and if none of them apply to the company, it is pure white. If 1-9 items are applicable, it is considered gray. 10-14 is dark gray. 30 out of 30 is pitch black. You get the picture. Now let's take a look at the list. I do work overtime, but overtime is never paid. It's usual to work more than 80 hours overtime a month. I don't have a break, or at the most, 10 minutes a day. I work on my days off. Actually, I'm not even sure when my days off are. There is no paid time off system or if there is such a system, I am never allowed to use it. I never get reimbursed for expenses and always have to pay out of pocket. There is no social insurance, benefits, or pension. If I ask about this, I would be bullied. If I converted my monthly wage into an hourly rate equivalent, it would be less than minimum wage. Regardless of how long I work overtime, the overtime payment is a fixed amount. The company is constantly hiring new employees. The advertised job wage is different from the actual amount paid. There are no time cards or someone else punches you in and out. There are one or more workers who can't come to the office due to psychotic depression or nervous breakdown. I'm so busy that I often can't get adequate sleep. There is no union or company regulations. Some employees are promoted to an administrative position right after joining the company, but there is no extra remuneration for that. Employees have to run private errands for their employers. There is a slogan saying \"work until you die\" on the company wall. Abuse of power and sexual harassment are very common. There are so many affiliate companies and subsidiaries, though I don't even know what those companies do. Whenever some incident happens, the company changes its name. There are training sessions, which use what can be considered brainwashing or hazing. Threats such as \"I'm going to kill you\" can be commonly heard at the office. Violence is rampant. All the supervisors are relatives of the CEO. I was told to quit the company in a roundabout way like, \"you may not be cut out for this position.\" I can't quit the job. If I say I'm going to quit, I'll be threatened that I will have to pay damages for quitting. They don't provide the necessary documents such as the separation slip to those who try to quit. The worker's average age is really young. The rate of people leaving their jobs within 3 years is really high. Now after looking through them, do any of these conditions apply to your company? Many of the items may sound ridiculous, but I have worked under some of these conditions before and I have some friends who work for such companies. However, I'm not sure if their companies are pitch black. Maybe just very, very dark? Source: rockandbacon According to Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the number of cases delivered to the General Labor Consultation Center in 2012 was 1,067,210. 254,719 of them involved troubles at work such as encouragement of early retirement, worsening work conditions, the lowering of pay, long periods of overtime without payment, or mean, abusive bosses and/or coworkers. A decade ago, only around 100,000 cases were reported. This number has increased about 2.5x, showing that either black companies are increasing in number, or, what is more likely, more people are coming forward. These companies are finally having their true colors exposed (black). In September, 2013, the Labor Ministry began a crackdown on black companies, too. They examined 5,111 such companies based on their high turnover rates of young workers, their past violations, and complaints from employees. Then it was revealed that over 80% of them, 4,189 companies, were indeed actually black companies engaged in illegal business practices. They were flagged for violations against the Labor Standards Act. The ministry intends to discipline the companies in question and if those companies continue to violate the Labor Standards laws, their names will be made public. So, now that the Labor Ministry is getting involved, can we call this the end of the story? Well, I'm afraid it's not over yet. This was only the ministry's first survey on black companies and there are over 4 million companies in Japan. So, the exciting fight has only just begun! We're counting on you, Black Company Awards and Japan's Labor Ministry!",

Therefore, employers include it as a way to increase total compensation at a lower cost. The origin of the practice was in WW2, when Roosevelt froze wages. To attract more and better employees, the companies threw in health insurance as a way around the restrictions. reply KptMarchewa 5 hours agorootparent>The reason is explicable - health insurance paid by the employer is tax-deductible, while insurance paid by the employee is not.

We're talking about bringing back denying coverage for existing conditions and allowing insurance to deny medication on grounds of religious reasons. Changing the tax deduction status would harm businesses, and therefore I can't see a conservative administration ever letting that fly. reply KptMarchewa 2 hours agorootparentWhich goes again to my original point. reply ponow 9 hours agorootparentprevThanks for reminding us that state intervention is the source of the problem. Stop linking medical insurance to employment via this tax bigotry. Buy it on the open market instead, or subsidize it if you're a leftist, but don't put that burden on jobs, you'll only get fewer jobs with greater hassle. People can agree to the arrangements they prefer, and it's not for us to second guess that. If there are people who end up coming up short, then you can help them yourself, or force the whole society to chip in (again, if you're a leftist), but don't force such considerations on the fragile links among private individuals and businesses. reply specproc 12 hours agorootparentprevI can spell it out, if it helps.

Then of course, being unemployed, you have the option of COBRA (you probably don't want that though), and if it does not make you immediately eligible for Medicaid in your state (40 of 50 have Medicaid expansion), it would make you eligible for the ACA subsidized plans. NB: more than one-third of employer-sponsored plans are HDHPs, meaning employees have deductibles in the thousands of dollars anyway. It's certainly a disruption, and it's one more thing to consider, but the idea that \"most Americans\" are one job loss away from being killed by lack of health care is not remotely true - most people don't need health care that regularly, unemployed people have insurance options, and at a last resort, for the most part, you can accrue unlimited medical debt in most places with few real-world consequences. reply smugma 4 hours agorootparentMy wife was once a day light on her birth control.

It's expensive because your employer's share of insurance was a significant part of your compensation (And because US healthcare costs are pants-on-head insane.) I'll point out that it's generally quite expensive to, like, stop getting paid. Practically, post-ACA, health insurance in the US is about as tied to employment as having a roof over your head and food on your table is.

As an employee in the USA (contract or freelance), I can quit any time I like. My contract may be for two years, but I can cancel it tomorrow if I want, and only in extreme cases is there any penalty for doing so. In the EU, if I sign a 1-year contract there is an expectation that I will actually work that year. If I break contract by deciding to get another job without negotiating early exit with my employer, I could be on the hook for damages. This doesn't come up very often because in the EU people just don't break contracts like this--if you want to hire someone you ask when their contract is up and work around that. But the reason why people behave this way is because the termination of a contract is a serious deal and hard to navigate. The US is (mostly) at-will employment. One aspect of that everyone talks about is that the company can fire you at any time for almost any reason. That sucks. The flip side though is that you can fire your employer any time you like, and walk of the job to somewhere that pays you better or treats you better. This is at the root of a lot of American dynamism, and a good thing. At-will employment is definitely something that cuts both ways. reply Symbiote 6 hours agorootparentThis is wrong.

I've btw never heard of anyone where I live getting sued or unable to quit a job. reply chasontherobot 13 hours agoparentprevNeither of these things is completely true. 1. While it is technically true a company could sue a worker for quitting, the amount of damages they'd have to show is far beyond anything they'd be able to do outside of an upper management position. As far as I know, you could not sue someone for doing a half assed job. 2. I'm not even sure how you are using the word \"illegal\" here. AFAIK there is no provisions in criminal law for punishing people who break employment contracts. What I assume you are talking about is that a contract worker is bound by the terms of their contract as far as notice to quit goes, but there are a couple of limits to this. - This only applies in the first year of the contract. After the contract has been renewed once, standard Japanese labor law applies, which is two weeks of notice. - Similar to the above statement about suing someone for quitting, Japanese law only allows for suits to be for actual damages, so the company would have to prove significant damages to make the suit worth it. Contract workers are generally not high value employees so it would be unusual for one to be worth suing over. reply hackit2 12 hours agorootparent> a half assed job A judge would automatically throw out the case if this was the argument for suing an employee. The reasoning being, if you continued to pay the employee during the term of their employment, and you knew that the employee was not performing based on some KPI or some yard stick, you would issue warning to the employee to improve their performance, or you would fire the employee on the spot. Continuing keep an underperforming employee is giving tactic consent that their work is reasonably acceptable because if it wasn't, you would start disciplinary action or cease their employment. Threating a employee with coercive threats (such as threats of legal action) is going to land the business into hot water in any modern society. reply lmm 12 hours agorootparent> The reasoning being, if you continued to pay the employee during the term of their employment, and you knew that the employee was not performing based on some KPI or some yard stick, you would issue warning to the employee to improve their performance, or you would fire the employee on the spot. Continuing keep an underperforming employee is giving tactic consent that their work is reasonably acceptable because if it wasn't, you would start disciplinary action or cease their employment. We're talking about an employee on a fixed term contract, so there's not really any scope for disciplinary action of the \"performance improvement plan\" type. And the argument would be that they were hired because of a time-sensitive job (hence the need for this kind of irregular employee) and so just not paying them for work doesn't make the company whole, they needed someone to do that work at that specific point in time and if not then they have damages that are much larger than the salary they would've paid. Of course by the time you get to court you can poke several holes in this argument. But under Japanese law it's a valid argument on its face, so it's something the employer can use to threaten. reply hackit2 11 hours agorootparentEach party has their own valid argument that is why they're seeking the court to make a ruling. How-ever coercive threats of legal action is also in of itself constitute a encroachment of someone free will and statutory right which everything being equal could be ground for further legal recourse by the other party.

In many countries that kind of lawsuit would be trivially dismissed, because an employee not working does not give an employer a cause of action. In Japan a company can at least in theory be owed damages if an employee on a fixed-term employment contract of less than a year fails to work, so a case like that would go to trial on the merits (even if everyone knows it's very difficult for the company to actually meet the bar for showing damages) and be significantly more costly to defend, and that fact creates a chilling effect. > How-ever coercive threats of legal action is also in of itself constitute a encroachment of someone free will and statutory right which everything being equal could be ground for further legal recourse by the other party. Under what law? reply unscaled 5 hours agoparentprev> If an employee, for example, decides to put in notice and then half-ass their job until their departure date, a company could actually sue the employee and win. That sounds rather exaggerated. There may have been cases of an employee being sued for damages by their a employer for not performing their jobs well, but I've personally never heard of them and without digging deep into courts records, I doubt there are many of these. The reason I highly doubt that, is that even just firing employees in Japan who are half-assing their job requires going to court and providing ample evidence that the employee has been continuously under-performing even though they were notified, given opportunity and failed to improve. This standard is considered so high, that Japanese companies rarely fire employees for this type of reason (Ordinary termination 普通解雇 futsuu kaiko). When companies absolutely want to get rid of a certain employee, they often prefer to slowly make the employee's life miserable by giving them them demeaning tasks (or in some cases just no tasks at all!), bullying them and cutting their pay — a practice generally called iyagarase (roughly translated as \"making someone feeling unpleasant\"). That kind of play can also land the employer in legal trouble, but at least the burden of proof would fall on the employee. In many other cases still, companies just keep around employees that are under performing or convince them to take an voluntary retirement package. In addition to all of that, employment contracts generally require a 30 day notice before quitting in Japan (I guess this is the maximum set by law). Combine that with the fact that most employees tend to have at least 14 days of unused leave accumulated, which they'd use just before leaving, they're not left with so enough working days in which they can half-ass their jobs. I'm not quite sure about breaking your contract for contract employees, but it the original example (\"I'll be threatened that I will have to pay damages for quitting\") doesn't seem like a contract employee, and the term \"black companies\" and the discourse around usually refers to full-time employment. It's probably just threats, as the quote says. Managers sometimes say the craziest things to scare their companies out of quitting. reply kochikame 14 hours agoparentprevTo balance this comment, if you are a full time employee you are super well protected and cannot be fired for any reason other than gross negligence or actively breaking the law.

I am still boycotting Paris Baguette and their sister companies because of their stubbornness and refusal to go beyond the legal minimums in safety equipment. 2 years ago a 23-year old employee got pulled into a sauce making machine and was crushed to death, with nobody finding her body until the next day. Let's say you are a bright 22-year old from the Philippines who got offered 3x your peers salary for working at an industrial bakery. It doesn't sound so bad right? Now let's say your friend got killed by machinery, and the company refuses to take responsibility because the safety equipment that could have prevented their death was optional and not legally required. You're 4 months into your 12-month contract. Do you have enough money to even get a flight back home? Do you have enough money to break your contract and pay the company for your flight from your home country, pay the company for breaking your subsidized lease in the dorms, etc? No you don't. That is a bad situation to be in. If it were me I would break the contract and just never come back to Korea. They're not going to extradite you for this debt, but does everyone know that? Especially migrant workers? Now I know this is about Japan and not Korea. Look into how many Vietnamese go work in the textile industry in Japan and get injured. Should there really be more barriers and intimidation when it comes to forcing the workers to stay for the duration of their contract when their roommate was crippled by the machinery? Or should it be easier for people to leave potentially dangerous situations? --- This also applies to white collar workers. Do you know how many Indian college students are lured to go work at a Japanese company with the promise of a high salary, only to then move to Tokyo and realize they're spending way more money than they expected due to the higher COL? Companies absolutely take advantage of this system. In the US companies usually only offer contracts to highly skilled workers, while in other countries companies offer contracts in order to trap individuals into poor working conditions and being underpaid when they're naive to the job market. reply pif 6 hours agorootparentMy point is that constraints must be equally strong on both sides. If you want to be free to leave, just accept that the company is free to let you go. That's all! reply roobs 12 hours agoparentprevI live in Japan and while also not a lawyer I've had experiences with the labor bureau - this is totally false, and even explicitly stated in the Labor Standards Act: \"Article 5: An employer must not force a worker to work against their will through the use of physical violence, intimidation, confinement, or any other means that unjustly restricts that worker's mental or physical freedom. ... Article 16: An employer must not form a contract that prescribes a monetary penalty for breach of a labor contract or establishes the amount of compensation for loss or damage in advance.\" (Source: https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/3567) This explicitly applies to contract workers (契約社員) too, and protections for employees (正社員) are so strong that it can often take months of documentation to dismiss someone. Whether people know they have these protections, knew they had them before they sign something their company gives them or feel comfortable actually reporting when a company has violated them is a different story. But basic salary is protected strongly enough that most Japanese companies heavily weight compensation on annual/semi-annual bonuses, housing allowances etc... (which are not protected). reply _rm 6 hours agorootparentI think this is only a prohibition on liquidated damages clauses though (plus making the act of even writing a penalty clause, which are already unenforceable, unlawful). It doesn't appear to be an exclusion of actual damages due to e.g. a one year contract worker quitting after 6 months, if it actually caused their employer damages. reply skhr0680 13 hours agoparentprev> a company could actually sue the employee and win. It's difficult and costs money to prove that someone is half-assing their job on purpose, and that cost a company a specific dollar amount of losses. It's why they may threaten to sue, but rarely do. > Other Japan-labor-law fun fact: if you are a contract worker, it is literally illegal for you to quit prior to your contract expiry date. Hope you like that job you signed onto! It's technically a contract violation, but there are many exceptions that allow you to quit within the first year, and that's assuming the company is totally above board legally (hint: if it's a black company, then they aren't.) reply _rm 6 hours agoparentprevConstitution of Japan, Article 18, prohibition of forced labor. So \"illegal\" isn't the right word. While damages are theoretically possible for leaving a fixed term employment contract early (with an exception after one year has passed), I'd be very interested in the precedent you're talking of, regarding an actual case of a contract employee being sued for quitting early. Only case I found was the K's International case, 1992, where an employee quit after 4 days, and the employer sued and was awarded damages (amount unknown) due to the disruption it caused. I couldn't find any further details though. reply vr46 14 hours agoparentprevAll this has gone a long way to make me feel better about not keeping up my Japanese language skills after university.

The construction quality of the average Japanese house is absolute garbage. Most likely you will need to demolish it and rebuild from scratch. 2. Outside of the big cities, Japan sucks hard. The average small city or village is just a bunch of big box stores and houses scattered everywhere.

This sounds much like rural America. Houses scattered everywhere, and a super Walmart. The big difference I've noticed here in Japan (I live in Tokyo), at least from my window on the train going through rural areas, is that the houses tend to be clustered together much more closely.

There is a friendly, win-win way to move skilled staff out of your company, but my impression is it's not widely known nor often occur. When a company finds that a particular staff member \"isn't a good fit for the company\" they will add this person to an informal list that is traded through back-channels with other companies. At some future time such personnel might be directly approached by headhunters on behalf of inquiring companies. Of course the current employer overlooks the poaching activity, they want the member gone. The only clue the office gets is one day out of the blue that member shows up to work wearing full interview attire, and might soon after announce that they are moving on. For the managerial tier and above, they frequently socialize and will have a sense of when it is time to move on, in accordance with societal expectations. Given that the managerial profession comprises a relatively smaller group in Japan, they can expect to land their next gig soon enough. As for the rest, I've heard of plenty of tactics used to induce (eventual) voluntary departure, \"black\" or otherwise. I don't advocate for them myself, but the culture, market, and law is what it is.. reply tgsovlerkhgsel 11 hours agoparentThat only works if it really is a fit issue/the process is primarily used for fit issues, no?

If every company was a black company, they probably wouldn't have a word for it! That said, it is far more common to work overtime here than in my home country and I'm puzzled by how many Japanese people I encounter who are like \"Yeah working too much overtime is bad and people shouldn't have to do it. I don't like having to work overtime. Also I work multiple hours of overtime every day and have no plans to do anything to change that, it is what it is.\" When I inquire further, it doesn't seem like they CAN'T change jobs, more like inertia and passivity (and perhaps a sense that it's too hard/unlikely to find a significantly better situation).

The hotel owned the apartments they lived in, and everything in the town was run by onsens, so there was no \"job market\" really to play. I don't know how much they were paid, but it didn't seem like they were rolling in it. Many of them were complaining about their husbands not working, drinking etc., so I can only imagine that at 9.30pm, they would actually take care of everything in their homes as well. One day, one of them just collapsed, and she was given a day off. Yet, the workers seemed to accept this as \"business as usual\" and were generally good-spirited. They were totally screwed over by management, cause the hotel was really expensive, and they knew they were being taken advantage of. But such is the effect of culture on people.

The culture here doesn't exactly reward risk-taking and failing in public, and unfortunately becoming proficient in a language requires that you stumble through things a lot while you practice.

His knees touched the cold concrete, and he bowed so profoundly that his head almost met the ground. “Dogeza,” the most sincere way to apologize for a serious offense, performed by a salaryman in his boss’s office. The reason? Mr. Iida submitted his resignation. But, after a brief silence, there was a tearing sound, and he realized his boss had ripped his resignation letter to shreds. The message was clear: you are not allowed to quit. In Japan, leaving a job can be challenging. Traditionally, employment is considered a lifelong commitment. Though Japan is moving away from this outdated mentality, many traditional companies still expect employees to work until retirement without changing jobs. For some older generations, there is still a deep sense of shame in switching jobs, as work ethic in Japan is closely tied to loyalty and respect. Japanese law technically guarantees the right to quit, but doing so is often seen as disrespectful, as companies invest time and money in training employees. It is a mutual investment — the company invests in you, and you, in turn, commit to advancing within the organization over time. “I Can’t Take This Anymore” Mr. Iida performed the dogeza three times before his boss, apologizing for “letting him down,” yet his resignation still wasn’t accepted. He had to find another way out. He contacted the resignation agency Momuri, whose name translates to “I Can’t Take This Anymore.” For around ¥22,000, they handle the entire resignation process, contacting the boss on behalf of the client, negotiating with the company, and even recommending lawyers if legal disputes arise. According to Yujin Watanabe, a spokesperson from Albatross Corp., which manages Momuri’s services, their typical client profile is young people in their 20s who work for small to medium-sized companies, often in corporate or welfare industries. Mr. Iida is far from alone in seeking outside help to resign. Since 2022, Momuri, just one independent resignation agency, has received 35,000 requests from people needing assistance quitting their jobs. 1 in 5 in Their 20s Use Resignation Agencies Mynavi Corporation: use of resignation services in the past year by age group and occupation. A new survey by the employment information provider Mynavi Corp. found that nearly 1 in 5 people in their 20s who quit their jobs in Japan last year used agencies like Momuri to help them. The survey, which included employees ages 20-50 who quit jobs between June 2023 and June 2024, shows that 18.6% of those in their 20s used these services, 17.6% were in their 30s and 17.3% were in their 40s. Only 4.4% were in their 50s, indicating that older employees tend to stay in jobs longer—even if conditions are poor—as the younger generation is more likely to adjust to their needs and wishes. The top-cited reason for using resignation agencies, at 40.7%, was that companies refused to let them quit. Other reasons included fear of backlash if they resigned alone or their work environment discouraged employees from quitting independently. Mynavi Corp. also surveyed workplaces and asked managers how often employees under their supervision had used resignation agencies. Between January and June 2024, 23.2% reported that they had employees who used resignation agencies. The most common fields were insurance, finance and IT. Resignation Agencies Reflect Japan’s Mental Health Crisis According to Momuri, most Japanese people in corporate roles have a low awareness of mental health. Social norms often discourage seeking help for mental challenges—many of which stem from their work. This lack of support is one reason more Japanese people now turn to resignation agencies. They quit to avoid damaging their mental health and use resignation agencies to sidestep the stress of handling the process themselves. Mr. Iida’s experience of his boss tearing up his resignation letter is not unique. In fact, it’s far from the most extreme case. Momuri confirms stories of companies forcing employees to visit temples to ‘cure’ their desire to quit. Sometimes they even receive home visits from managers pressuring them to stay. Those fortunate enough to leave are sometimes asked to send apology letters to colleagues or deliver speeches expressing regret for their “selfishness” and “disrespect.” Of course, these are the most extreme cases–but they do occur, according to Momuri. Some companies are notorious for resignation difficulties, excessive overtime and intense work pressure. So much so that they are labeled as “black companies.” The problem has become so severe that Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare’s Labor Standards Bureau has published a list of these companies to warn potential job seekers. Mynavi Corporation: Reasons for using resignation service. Generational Change Could Be Japan’s Savior A generational shift is underway in Japan, one that may eventually ease work-related pressures and their sometimes fatal consequences. Physical strain and mental stress contribute to both karojisatsu, or ‘overwork suicide,’ and karoshi, or ‘death by overwork’. According to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the number of Japanese people who committed suicide due to their work rose from 1,935 cases in 2021 to 2,968 in 2022. This marked a record high. While the figure has since slightly decreased, the strain on workers remains severe. Since they first appeared in 2018, resignation agencies have become an essential ally in Japan’s work culture shift. These agencies empower young workers to prioritize their mental well-being and advocate for change, providing a way out for those trapped in restrictive work environments. This growing reliance on resignation services underscores a generational pushback against outdated norms and signals a potential transformation in Japan’s work culture. If these shifts continue, Japan’s younger generation may indeed pave the way toward a more balanced and sustainable future for the country’s workforce. Let’s hope they succeed.

I have some friends-of-friends living in Japan. It’s interesting to hear their experience with culture evolve over time. They openly admit that they get a free pass around some of the more difficult cultural situations due to not being born and raised originally in Japan. Hearing their stories has definitely given me a different perspective on some of the overly idealized views of Japan that get repeated online. A lot of social media posters with experience in Japan fall into a routine where they post about how things in Japan are so much better and more straightforward than in the United States (and other countries) because it gets attention.

They conveniently leave out a lot of the less romantic and positive differences though. That kind of whataboutism is a common issue in politics though. Why can't we all go and look for every field of politics look what other countries do and if what they do is better, then do that as well without taking the worse parts? For example, look at Switzerland when it comes to education, to Germany's Mittelstand and trades education system for a vibrant and healthy SME business field, to the US for access to venture capital and cutting-edge research, to Austria or Denmark for their pension system, to Japan for public transport reliability... reply inglor_cz 6 hours agorootparentOften, because some entrenched interests stand in the way. Famously, NYC builds new subway tunnels very expensively, about three times more expensively than Paris. What stands in the way of a substantial cost reduction? Many factors, including local unions that defend their lucrative turf. The French withdrew from the project of the Californian High-Speed Rail blaming total governmental dysfunction and comparing Californian public sector negatively to Morocco, where a French-built HSR actually was built successfully. reply mschuster91 5 hours agorootparentWell, Morocco can hardly be called a democracy [1]. It's easier to (literally) bulldoze through obstacles when you're a kingdom looking for a fancy toy for the ruler to show off, compared to building infrastructure in a democracy. [1] https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/538683/umfrag... reply inglor_cz 5 hours agorootparentStill, plenty of democracies managed what California couldn't, and built a useful HSR network. Which in Cali would mean SF to LA, and that is probably not going to happen. reply mschuster91 5 hours agorootparentMany of these projects were started in times where the needs of the infrastructure had priority over local objections and environmental protection laws were not much of a thing though.

If you have enough paid vacation you could pad that period with your vacation, but it requires pre-acceptance, so cooperation from your employer. Otherwise you're into non-accepted vacation territory, which could lead to financial penalties (basically withdrawing your salary, with potential tax adjustements. They could also try to sue you, and given you're fleeing assume they'd get a default judgement for instance) Then there's all the paperwork you actually want to have properly done by your employer. They're legally obligated to, but it's always harder if you're in adversarial mode. All in all, you can still quit cold turkey (\"bakkure\"), but that's a usually a PITA. Getting a pro to negociate a clean separation will be better than just disappearing, if you're not in the mood/capacity to face your employer. PS; There are magical words that would give any employee an immediate option to never see their employer again. I don't want them in my comments, but anyone interested will find them with a simple search. reply Woeps 10 hours agorootparentI'm a bit surprised that people are so caught of guard. I have never had a resignation period of less then 1 month in several European countries (BeNeLux and Poland) My last job had resignation period of 7 week from the Monday after sending my notice. reply Foobar8568 9 hours agorootparent4 full calendar months for my current resignation period, e.g. if I resign today, my last official day will be the 31 March (December, January, February , March). reply skhr0680 13 hours agorootparentprev> If you have enough paid vacation you could pad that period with your vacation, but it requires pre-acceptance, so cooperation from your employer. It doesn't necessarily need their cooperation. A letter sent by registered mail saying \"I am using my paid leave for x days from y day\", then another one saying \"I resign on y day + two weeks\" is enough. Of course, people would actually need to know and be willing to use their labor rights in order to do that, which is the service that quitting agents are providing. reply chasontherobot 14 hours agorootparentprevContracts might require it, but the law says 2 weeks (on a regular full time contract or a limited contract after the first year) and contracts can't supersede the law. reply makeitdouble 13 hours agorootparentYes. The law clearly set 2 weeks [0]. It puts the employee in the strongest position, but doesn't completely voids a contract. For instance the employer can still fight it by justifying a necessity for them to have a longer period, or convincing a court the contract had enough provisions to make it a reasonable clause. It would be a huge PITA on both sides though, I don't see many companies wanting that much trouble just for a single employee trying to leave the boat.

In Japanese this kind of abbreviation does not carry the childish/frivolous connotations it does in English. reply mrcsd 9 hours agorootparentIn my experience, the connotations are very similar to English use. What matters is the context. Say sekuhara or sexual harassment at work: very serious connotation. Amongst friends or in media (comdey/anime/etc): potentially frivolous/unserious connotation. reply omoikane 14 hours agorootparentprevThe second reddit link above includes an example, where the person has a visa change and would get in trouble with immigration if they continue to remain employed. If the person was leaving because they accepted an offer from another employer, being on two payrolls simultaneously might also be a problem. reply Aeolun 15 hours agorootparentprevIt’ll become messy if they keep paying you? reply presentation 15 hours agoparentprevYeah nobody I know has told me they’ve experienced this, but maybe it’s common amongst some groups and not others. Black companies are something else. reply unscaled 13 hours agoprevI think the real percentage of employees using a resignation agency is probably lower than 18.6%. Internet surveys tend to be less accurate and I don't know the methodology they've used to select the 800 or so participants. But companies bullying employees on resignation seems to be a bigger issue than I thought. reply MarketingJason 16 hours agoprevReading this, I was assuming that this behavior was enforced by reference checks for new hires being commonplace. However, the few sources I found in a quick search make it seem like asking/requiring references is a more recent practice due to western influence. I'd guess it's just guilt and shame? reply presentation 15 hours agoparentJust guilt and shame, companies don’t have a right to do it but people just comply anyway. reply lr4444lr 15 hours agoparentprevI too was struggling to understand the problem described herr: does unilaterally quitting a job actually harm the employee's future employment prospects inside Japan, or is the problem here just a matter of culturally enforced social stigma? reply rtpg 15 hours agorootparentThere are documents that your former employer often needs to provide you for stuff like health insurance. And now suddenly it's some direct confrontation to get a document, while your future employer (Who could still just let you go!) is asking you for a document to move forward. So you're facing a bunch of time pressure in gnarly cases, without many people around to help you out. There are procedures to get around this stuff but since it's not the common case, when it does happen suddenly you get to learn about labor law. I think anywhere in the world, when there is active antagonism causing bureaucracy to not be able to move forward, most people freeze up like a deer caught in headlights. Turns out that being a sociopath can be quite helpful for exploiting workers! reply shiroiushi 15 hours agorootparentSometimes I wonder what a society would look like if they could very reliably identify sociopathy at an early age, and then either euthanize those people or at least blacklist them so they can never have any job higher than a janitor. Would such a society work better than current societies? Or would it be like that episode of Star Trek where Kirk gets split into good and bad versions, and the good version was too ineffectual to be a decent captain without his bad side? reply zdragnar 14 hours agorootparentMore like \"It's a Good Life\" from the Twilight zone. Have unhappy or bad thoughts? Off to the \"corn field\". Disagree with the decision makers? Want to do things differently? Want to just be different? Off to the corn field! Sociopathy is no more a single thing than cancer or the common cold are single things. Even less so, because it is only defined by subjective interpretation of outward symptoms. reply shiroiushi 14 hours agorootparentI'll have to go rewatch that episode; it doesn't sound familiar. However, I thought sociopathy was pretty well-defined as having a complete lack of empathy. reply zdragnar 3 hours agorootparentIn the episode, the main character is the sociopath. My use of it is to say that giving people the power to execute or blacklist sociopaths will inevitable create more, only they'll be the ones in power. \"Lack of empathy\" can easily be interpreted in many ways. What you are upset about are the actions of those you accuse of not having empathy. You think that killing anyone without empathy is the solution. You clearly have no empathy for those without empathy. You are the monster you fought against. reply Dylan16807 12 hours agorootparentprevAt least three of the four things you listed are things we can already detect. This doesn't make much sense as a reply to \"what if we could detect sociopathy\". And that's on top of it being a bad analogy to swap different traits and actions arbitrarily. reply zdragnar 2 hours agorootparentSuggesting we murder (\"euthanize\") people who are predisposed to a lack of empathy is probably the least empathetic reaction I could think of. The proposed answer to sociopathy is itself sociopathic. This inherent contradiction is evidence enough that no sufficiently objective metric may distinguish \"sociopath\" from \"not-sociopath\". The power offered is great enough that it would be immediately abused. reply Dylan16807 27 minutes agorootparentOne person suggesting an overboard response means that it's impossible to do an objective test in the first place? That argument makes no sense to me. reply toomuchtodo 17 hours agoprevCan anyone in Japan share what ground truth looks like around this? Does this churn matter to businesses when they’re in a labor supply shortage? Do these folks have other jobs they’re moving to? Or are they potentially NEETs bailing on being employed? reply Seb-C 15 hours agoparentThis definitely exists, even when switching jobs. However I would say that IMO it's another case of foreigners buzzing by depicting boring and common stuff under a \"weird Japan\" light. Shitty companies manipulating employees to stop them from resigning is something that exists in any country. And this escalating to the labor authorities or going through a lawyer is not a rare thing anywhere either. It happens more frequently in Japan because the culture of not being confrontational is strong. The fact that lawyers can afford to specialize in this matter alone is just a logical result of the larger number of customers. EDIT: I also want to add this: if you have been in a company for a while, you are eventually going to see or hear about how resignation is handled for other employees. If you want to quit and already know that the company is going to harrass you and make your life hell, is it so weird to save your time and mental health to delegate all of that to a dedicated professional? reply TulliusCicero 12 hours agorootparentDoes it? You hear stories in the US of people trying to manipulate employees into not quitting or lambasting them for leaving, but trying to actually, seriously deny their ability to quit is nearly unheard of. reply 3D30497420 9 hours agorootparentI don't recall seeing examples in the US of directly preventing someone from resigning. But I have read about situations where companies make it harder to get the next job, essentially forcing someone to stay in a bad work situation. For example, non-competes for service jobs (fast-food, hairdressers, etc.) reply Ekaros 11 hours agorootparentprevThey would absolutely do that if contracts would be stronger. But as they want to keep their ease of firing and laying off people, contracts are weak in both direction. reply rightbyte 8 hours agorootparentprevFor agricultural workers it is quite common with 'we safekeep your passport for you' and similar schemes. I think foreign workers are more exploited in general but outside of the cities it is way harder to escape such employers. reply umanwizard 13 hours agorootparentprev> Shitty companies manipulating employees to stop them from resigning is something that exists in any country. I have never heard of it in the US. I’m sure some examples exist but I’d be really unpleasantly surprised if it’s a major social issue here. reply travisgriggs 12 hours agorootparentAmen. IMO, it's an tortured example of Hanlons Razor: Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. I see tons of shitty stuff roll downwards to employees in US companies, but I never see the kind of competence at the upper levels to pull off the kind of manipulation implied here. It's just negligence, ignorance, and dysfunctionality that tends to screw us yanks at the bottom. reply gampleman 6 hours agorootparentprevAnd what do you think a broad non-compete clause is?

In what other countries are we talking about here where a company escalates to the labor authorities to prevent you from quitting? Usually this kind of thing is reserved to harass visa holders, not native workers. reply Seb-C 8 hours agorootparentI mean that the employees escalates it, not the companies. reply rjh29 14 hours agoparentprevMy gf used one. She had a legal right to quit but it was inconvenient for the company. They refused multiple times, they also gaslit with \"what about the children we teach, if you leave the school might have to close\" etc. etc. Using the agency means you do a 10 minute phone call and that's it. You don't even have to work your remaining days or talk to the company ever again. The agencies seem to have some legal powers that a normal person doesn't, or at least in reality they get results much faster and aren't allowed to screw around. What did amuse me is there's a discount if you use them multiple times. reply DonsDiscountGas 7 hours agorootparent> The agencies seem to have some legal powers that a normal person doesn't I suspect the power that they have is actually knowing the law. Also by hiring one the employee has shown they are willing to hire a lawyer, so the employer can't bluff with legal threats. And very few employees are actually going to be worth the trouble to sue reply _rm 6 hours agorootparentprevThe special powers are probably the following sentence: \"sure, you could sue; also, we could check more closely for labor law violations; which would you like?\". reply rkagerer 12 hours agorootparentprevIs that \"gaslighting\" or simply plain old guilt tripping? reply rjh29 10 hours agorootparentYou're right, thanks for the correction. reply Aeolun 15 hours agoparentprevBased on what I’ve seen and heard (luckily, not experienced), I think it depends on the company. Smaller ones with older management may be both more reliant on the labor and more used to lifetime employment. I suspect there’s probably some maximal fuckiness point. Most companies aren’t like that, but resignation in Japan has a lot of stigma even if everything goes well, so many people will use these services just so they don’t have to deal with it. The way the culture works there’s no way for the managers to be anything but unfailingly polite to an external party that calls to resign on behalf of the employee. reply alkonaut 9 hours agoprevI don't understand, what really constitutes a \"won't let me quit\" scenario? If I hand in my resignation, I don't really care whether my employer rips it or not. I consider my contract terminated because it's a contract that can be terminated by either party to the contract. If I have a notice period, I'll work that period, then stop showing up. If they want to consider the contract as still valid, they can. And then they'd have to pay me, but I don't see why they would if I'm not turning up to work? There must be something in the above reasoning that isn't correct? reply bsaul 9 hours agoparentYou probably wouldn't also give your letter of resignation with your knees on the floor, asking the boss to \"forgive me because i failed you\", right ? Yes, japan is a whole different mentality, with a completely different set of values and social norms ( mostly focused on \"don't show disrespect to others\", and \"don't embarrass yourself\"). Traveling from japan to the US/Hawaii was probably where i experienced the largest culture shock (and not in a flattering way for americans). It felt like going from civilization to barbaric lands. On the other hand i can see why some japanese people can't handle that much pressure on their everyday behavior and prefer the western mentality at some point in their life. reply usea 9 hours agoparentprevImagine you have a strong deference to authority and an incredible fear of confrontation. It would be very easy for someone in a position of authority to take advantage of you. People don't always do what's in their best interest. People talk to the police without a lawyer all the time.

What is the actual enforcement mechanism other than guilt? reply autumnstwilight 13 hours agoparentApart from the paperwork that you need to pass on to your next employer, salaries can be structured in a way that makes the base pay rather low, but the yearly income is boosted up to a reasonable level by bonuses, overtime allowance (fixed monthly amount paid whether you work the overtime or not), etc. If the company doesn't want to let someone quit, they can make it financially painful by withholding these things, or subtracting \"damages\" caused by the employee leaving. EDIT: Come to think of it I'm actually not 100% sure about the legality of this, but they sure try it! reply w00kie 12 hours agorootparentThey can reduce or plain not pay your bonus, yeah. But making the employee pay for \"damages\", even by subtracting them from remaining pay or bonuses, is very very illegal. reply _rm 6 hours agorootparentThe problem is these companies are comfortable with this level of illegal, because they're multiplying potential fines by the odds the employee will actually go to the authorities, and then weighing that against the exploitation benefits multiplied by their whole workforce. reply lmm 16 hours agoparentprevJapanese companies have some culture of bullying and harassment. The laws against it are limited and enforcement is toothless. But yeah, it's mostly ultimately a lack of courage from the employees in question. reply presentation 15 hours agorootparentIt’s definitely illegal, labor rights are pretty strong in Japan. I think your typical Japanese person is just very compliant when faced with an uncomfortable situation and bad bosses abuse that dynamic. reply lmm 14 hours agorootparent> It’s definitely illegal, labor rights are pretty strong in Japan. In some ways they are. Notably Japan has no concept of constructive dismissal, and companies have a pretty broad right to assign work and even to assign someone to work at a faraway office. There may be some anti-harassment law on the books, but it's very hard to get anything recognised under it, and if someone is just constantly assigned bad work, or no work, they have very little recourse. And even if you could win a lawsuit, Japan doesn't do punitive damages or damages for emotional distress. So you'd be able to claim, maybe, lost wages for your time out of work, and... that's probably it. reply bugglebeetle 14 hours agorootparentprevLabor rights are far stronger in Japan than countries like the US, but like regulations everywhere, are only as strong as they are actively enforced, where companies suffer meaningful penalties for violating them. Japan is by no means a place where this is true, such that companies fear violating them. reply evan_ 16 hours agoparentprevWithholding a letter of recommendation maybe? If the culture truly is such that you get a job in your early 20s and stay there until you retire or die, then presumably a job seeker in their 30s would be virtually unhireable without a good explanation. reply prisonality 15 hours agorootparentIn that case, I don't think Resignation Agencies could help to get them to spit out letter of recommendation. But the again - these agencies might be solving an entirely different problem. reply anabis 15 hours agoparentprevYou need proof of layooff (離職票) to collect you unemployment benefits.

To me, it seems like if you were designing a brand new society optimized only to maximize the countries GDP, you'd implement the Japanese model - employees who never leave their employers, extremely long work hours and mandatory after work social activities. China, Japan and SK have all effectively implemented a version of this and their economic growth post WWII has been nothing short of remarkable (China was poorer than Sub Saharan Africa in the 50's). Obviously, you could say this has not been going very well for Japan more recently but I'd argue the main drawback to this paradigm is the inevitable population implosion. reply shiroiushi 14 hours agorootparentAs with other places, it worked extremely well as long as the society was inherently sexist, and women weren't allowed to have \"men's jobs\" and were basically forced by society at large to be mothers and homemakers for husbands who were almost never at home and who never spent any time with their kids. With nothing better to do with their lives and time, and reliable birth control not yet invented or easily available, people had lots of kids to keep the system going. Nowadays, women want to have more meaning in their lives than just being married to some guy they barely know or care about and raising his kids as some kind of servant with 2nd-class citizen rights. This isn't just in Japan, it's in every developed nation. The result of this is a far lower birthrate, so you can't have a super-high GDP for too long; you get a boost at the beginning because nearly 100% of adults can now contribute to GDP, but it burns out in a few decades because there's no one to replace them. Societies need to come up with a new model. reply kiba 12 hours agorootparentThe result of this is lower birthrate in the current cultural configuration. As is, women regularly delayed having children until they're near or past their fertility window, if they want children at all. In our current society, it's difficult to both have a career and be a mother. reply shiroiushi 11 hours agorootparentVery, very true. Professional women these days are going to extreme lengths now to have children at older ages: IVF, etc. As it is, it starts getting difficult at around age 35. Yet, advanced education can easily last until your late 20s, and your late 20s and 30s are the time when you need to build your career. If scientists could come up with a way of making women much more fertile up to, say, age 60 (in an affordable and reliable way I mean, current treatments are unreliable and horrifically expensive), I wonder what effect this would have on the birth rate. reply gred 8 hours agorootparentOr we could work with the natural order of things, rather than against it... nah, too crazy. reply probably_wrong 4 hours agorootparentI'm not sure I'm joking when I say: if you manage to convincingly solve the \"work/children\" dilemma you may become a strong candidate for a Nobel prize (or at least The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences). reply gred 4 hours agorootparentNah, I would propose that people stop trying to \"have it all\", accept reality, and settle for one or the other (mainly one for men, and the other for women).

In terms of GDP, the US has been doing so much better than the rest of the world in the last several decades. reply master-lincoln 8 hours agorootparentI could only find data for the last decade quickly, but looking at this, the USA was not the leader in GDP growth. It was in absolute GDP though, but OP was talking about growth reply prmoustache 14 hours agorootparentprevlonger work hours != efficiency reply unscaled 13 hours agorootparentprevJapan's economic growth started well before World War 2. In fact, Japan wouldn't have been able to fight WW2 against the US for so long if it wasn't a fully industrialized country by that time. The country was devastated after the war (just as Germany was), but it wasn't starting from scratch. Many (if not most) of the large Japanese manufacturing conglomerates of today have been successful zaibatsu before the war, that have been only partially broken down and restructured as keiretsu. I think it's a compelling story to see Japan, the Asian Tigers (two of them former colonies of Japan, the other two former British colonies) and China as having the same growth story, but I don't think it's the same story in all of these places. Outside commentators love to bring up Confucianism, but Confucianism (just like Christianity or Buddhism) is a pretty ancient philosophy and religion that have seen many iterations and has taken many different, perhaps even contradictory shapes and forms over the years. A certain version of it was extremely influential in Japan during the Edo period, but a modern Japanese would probably cite Confucius directly less than a culturally Chinese person would do. And it's certainly an influence in Japan, but the culture is just so different than China, which had its own local influences (including decades of Communism and a not-so-minor Cultural Revolution which targeted the \"Four Olds\"). I think the best explanation is that all of these countries (in their respective growth period!) had a good degree of political stability and achieved the necessary level of education. They all exercised government guidance through export-oriented policies, but left enough leeway for private companies to choose their own way (in other words, a heavy dose of government meddling that would make neoliberals blush, but not a full-on command economy). And most of all, the timing was right. These countries started to grow their industry (or rebuild it and re-orient it towards export in Japan's case) while fertility was still high and they were relatively poorer than the countries which bought up their goods. And of course, this all happened while world was rapidly globalizing. It's easy to miss the complex factors involved and recommend the export-oriented playbook to countries where it won't fit, or to think that the same playbook would work forever. It's also easy to blame culture when the things fail. Within Japan, you'd find many commentators who believe the attitudes during the Showa era (1926-1989) were different and the current generation is just incapable of hard work, innovation or whatever else. But from all I've read and heard about Showa era businesses, they were far less efficient than current Japanese businesses are. The businesses culture was probably probably less risk-averse, but that aversion is itself partly the result of decades of having a somewhat stagnant economy. My pet theory is that Japan was successful during its economic miracle period DESPITE the vast inefficiencies of its corporate culture. It only had western economies to compete with (the Asian Tigers hadn't started to roar yet and China was still far away from industrialization) and the wages in Japan were initially far lower than in the US. From various productivity metrics inefficiencies in other Western countries probably weren't much different back then (this tracks, since it all happened before the mass digitization of the workplace and government which Japan was late to). and despite management, office work and sales practices being inefficient, Japanese companies (most famously Toyota) have developed innovative methods for increasing efficiency and quality on the factory floor. Fast forward to the 1990s, and Japan is seeing fierce competition from other cheaper producers on many products even before the baby boomer generation is facing retirement with a shrinking population. During that period rich economies are improving their productivity, while poorer economies can just undercut prices due to cheaper labor. Toyota's innovative manufacturing methods are getting adopted outside Japan as well. Japan still leads in places where it has technology advantages or even just a brand or market capture, but in general competition just becomes a lot harder. At this point, mature economies can only do so much. No matter what the government and individual corporations do, we cannot expect anything close to the growth rates of the 1950s-1970s again. But inefficiencies are clearly hurting Japanese businesses. reply badpun 10 hours agorootparentJapan is one of the oldest nations in the world (in terms of demographics), and, unlike other super-old nations (Germany, Italy), is refusing to let in immigrants. Under such conditions, having just 0% GDP growth, and not a constant recession, is not a bad result. reply makeitdouble 15 hours agoparentprevThis isn't ineficiency though, probably closer to bullying. Quitting a job has no complex moving parts, and most corporation will deal with it with minimal paperwork (you really only need to prove you gave them your resignation. An email reply would be enough legally). The issues these new graduates (the source of the TFA is MyNavi, which is new graduate centric) are facing are arbitrary, purposefuly set to make their life harder. reply asdasdsddd 13 hours agorootparentW.r.t quitting jobs, the economic inefficiency is that knowledge doesnt diffuse properly. A certain amount of corporate mobility is hugely beneficial. But that's just the tip of the iceberg for bad corporate culture; the social binge drinking, poor sleep, no social life, etc must be bad for productivity... I don't understand how they manage it. reply stainforth 15 hours agorootparentprevCan you enumerate the issues new graduates are facing, and when they began on timeline?(if even possible to see explicitly first public) reply jappgar 15 hours agoparentprevWell, Japan hasn't done too well in the software world over the last 30 years. Meanwhile American software companies and employees are both infamously disloyal and have done quite well. reply kergonath 11 hours agorootparentIs that a cause, though? I can see both as being consequences of the sheer amount of money sloshing around in the Silicon Valley. It generally helps things because there’s just so much resources to tap. It also helps employees getting poached with better salaries and compensation. But it does not mean that it can be replicated that way in another country. reply jappgar 3 hours agorootparentYou're right. It's not that disloyalty necessarily enables better software but that, apparently, loyalty is not a requirement. It can also be true that the work culture in Japan stymies effective modern software development. I've heard anecdotes to this effect but it doesn't seem like something you could easily measure. reply adamc 15 hours agoparentprevIt's fascinating and makes me want to know more about how the culture works. reply latentsea 15 hours agorootparentIt works by having it beaten into for you several decades of your childhood that you don't speak up, you put the groups first, and appearances trump reality. I don't necessarily think it's any better or any worse than western culture. My perspective is \"it just has different failure modes\". reply Escapado 15 hours agorootparentAgreed and I would add to the list the ungodly amount of hours they work. I know per hour they might not be as productive (or simply held back by antiquated processes within their companies) but they seem to make up for it in part by working so much overtime. reply Dalewyn 15 hours agorootparentprevYes, a large part of why Japanese society appears (and in fact performs) so perfect is because of an absolute fear of shame. From the moment you are born you are taught to care about what and how others think and feel about you and your conduct. If it's not your social peers, it's the literal Sun (\"Otentou-sama\") looking down upon you and judging your every single moment. If you shame yourself, you also bring shame upon your family and your ancestors both living and dead. To be clear: This does work, and most Japanese are happy to serve society rather than feel compelled to do so at threat of cancellation. There are also benefits for the compliant, namely in the form of social safety nets both legal and social to ensure a minimum standard of living. Japanese expats are a particular bunch, they left Japan because they couldn't stand the shaming and strict adherence to social codes. A kind of \"you can't fire me if I quit\" response. reply dyauspitr 12 hours agoparentprevIt’s not inefficiency.

They say 16.6% of people who changed jobs last year used these services, but only 23.2% of companies report having any employees use them. If 16.6% is correct, the % of companies number should be much higher, supposing companies have multiple resignations per year. The method for the first number on how they found their respondents is described just as \"internet survey,\" with no further info. There are a lot of ways to do this that would over-sample people who use these services. reply mahoho 14 hours agoparentI'm not gonna read the whole thing but the 23.2% is only for the first half of the year 上半期(2024年1月～6月)に退職代行サービスを利用して退職した人がいた企業は23.2％だった。 reply reallyeli 14 hours agorootparentHmm thanks — what about the historical trend numbers? > \"上半期(2024年1月～6月)に退職代行サービスを利用して退職した人がいた企業は23.2％だった。また、過去の退職代行利用者の実績を年度別に聞くと、2021年は16.3％、2022年は19.5％、2023年は19.9％\" These seem like full-year numbers, but they're much lower than what I'd expect if 23.2% is the half-year number — implying a huge jump in 2024? reply 0sp 12 hours agorootparentI think there is a possibility that this year's figures will be significantly higher.

    "originBody": "60 Minutes Overtime Bhutan, after prioritizing happiness, now faces an existential crisis By Lesley Stahl, Aliza Chasan, Shari Finkelstein, Collette Richards November 17, 2024 / 7:35 PM EST / CBS News Bhutan building Mindfulness City Bhutan building Mindfulness City to create jobs, lure young Bhutanese home from abroad 22:16 Bhutan, the tiny kingdom that introduced Gross National Happiness to the world, has a problem: young people are leaving the country in record numbers. The country boasts free health care, free education, a rising life expectancy and an economy that's grown over the last 30 years — still, people are leaving. Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay believes it is ironically the success of Gross National Happiness that has made young Bhutanese so sought after abroad. \"It is an existential crisis,\" he said. Holding the outside world at bay Bhutan, which is about the size of Maryland, was largely isolated from the rest of the world for centuries. The kingdom was so protective of its unique Buddhist culture that it only started allowing foreign tourists to visit in the 1970s and didn't introduce television until 1999. Buddhism is the country's national religion. Bhutanese, especially older men and women, spend hours spinning prayer wheels full of Buddhist scriptures. Prayer flags flutter on hillsides and in forests, turning nature itself into a shrine. Bhutan's capital city of Thimpu still has no traffic lights. The nation's roads are shared by cars and cows. Dasho Kinley Dorji, who ran Bhutan's first newspaper before serving as the government's minister of information and communications, describes the population as nervous, surrounded as it is by India and China, and lacking military might or economic power. Dasho Kinley Dorji during an interview with Lesley Stahl 60 Minutes \"Bhutan's strength was going to be our identity, to be different from everyone around us,\" he said. Bhutanese wear different clothes and construct buildings in a traditional architectural style. The culture remains strong today. \"We came to realize that, you know, that what we had in the past, what is old, is actually very valuable,\" Dorji said. Bhutan was, and is today, largely a subsistence agricultural society. Many families still live in multigenerational farmhouses. The country was unified by the man who became its first king in 1907. His sons and grandsons — who are referred to in Bhutan as the second, third, fourth and today, fifth, kings — have reigned since. Bhutan's unique path to modernity It was Bhutan's fourth king who, as a young, newly-crowned ruler in the 1970s, set Bhutan onto its path toward modernity. Jigme Singye Wangchuck, on his way home from a summit of nonaligned nations in Cuba, landed at an airport in India, where journalists asked him what Bhutan's gross national product was. \"And the king said, 'Actually, in Bhutan, gross national happiness is much more important to us than gross national product,'\" Dorji recounted. The phrase stuck and attracted international attention. Maximizing Gross National Happiness became a primary responsibility of Bhutan's government, led today by Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay. Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay 60 Minutes \"Gross National Happiness acknowledges that economic growth is important, but that growth must be sustainable. It must… be balanced by the preservation of our unique culture,\" Tobgay said. \"People matter. Our happiness, our well-being matters. Everything should serve that.\" Every five years, surveyors fan out across Bhutan measuring the nation's happiness. The results are analyzed and factored into public policy. \"Gross National Happiness does not directly equate to happiness in the moment. One happiness is fleeting, it is emotion, it is joy,\" Tobgay said. Experiencing Bhutan's ancient and wondrous traditions The other — the kind Bhutan is focused on, Tobgay said — is contentment, being happy with life and oneself. It's also about nature. By law, at least 60% of the country must remain under forest cover. And with most of its energy coming from hydroelectric power, Bhutan was the first and remains today one of the only countries in the world to be carbon negative. It earns foreign revenue selling excess hydropower to India and from tourism, but there are limits. The country is full of gorgeous mountains, but summiting mountain peaks isn't allowed. \"For a Bhutanese, it's very easy to understand: You know, the mountains are sacred,\" Dorji said. School is taught in English and it's free, as is health care. And though the country has a king, Bhutan is also a democracy. Introducing Bhutan to democracy A quarter century after introducing Gross National Happiness, the fourth king decided the best thing for his country would be to have an elected parliament and a prime minister. \"[It's] the only country where democracy was introduced in a time of peace and stability, where democracy was literally gifted, imposed on the people, not just gifted, because the people didn't want it,\" Tobgay said. As a reporter, Dorji covered the king's travels throughout Bhutan as he held meetings called consultations to discuss the idea with his subjects. Dorji remembers people begging the king not to institute a democracy. Bhutan's king walks with Lesley Stahl 60 Minutes \"Because when they looked around the world, their horizon was India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan: Democracy,\" Dorji said. \"Which is really synonymous with violence, with corruption. So they said, 'No, thank you. We don't really need that. We are fine.'\" The king was not swayed by their arguments, arguing in response that a leader chosen by birth and not by merit might one day lead the country to disaster. Then, at just 51, he abdicated and passed the crown to his 26-year-old son, the fifth and current king. Bhutanese headed to the polls for the first time ever in 2008. Today the fifth king is 44. He is adored in the country and works closely with the prime minister. So why are young Bhutanese leaving the country in record numbers? Bhutan is currently facing what is known in the country as a crisis of outmigration. The COVID-19 pandemic hit Bhutan's economy hard, shutting down tourism. Recovery has been slow. Many Bhutanese, with their excellent English, found higher-paying jobs in Australia, even doing menial labor. Word of opportunities spread fast on social media and now a devastating 9% of the country's population, most of them young people, have left. \"This is a very difficult situation for Bhutan,\" Tobgay said. Luring people back with a City of Mindfulness Bhutan's government has mobilized, with the king launching a bold, high-stakes plan to lure people back. Prime Minister Tobgay is trying to attract more business and tourists to Bhutan, highlighting landmarks like a centuries-old suspension bridge, part of an ancient 250-mile trail from one end of the country to the other that is now open to trekking tourists. But tourism can only do so much and Bhutan's king knows it, so he has decided to create a new city in southern Bhutan with different rules from the rest of the country. It will be an attempt at a new model of robust economic development, while still holding true to Bhutanese values. The king is calling it the Gelephu Mindfulness City. He turned to Danish architect Bjarke Ingels to design it. The new city will have neighborhoods nestled between the area's many rivers, connected by a series of unusual bridges. The bridges will also act as public buildings, with one home to a Buddhist center, another to health care facilities and yet another a university. There won't be any skyscrapers, and everything will be built with local materials. Danish architect Bjarke Ingels 60 Minutes Right now, the area — located in Bhutan's lowlands — is largely undeveloped. Dr. Lotay Tshering, a former prime minister whom the king has tapped to lead the new city, said it will be built in phases over the next two decades, with no polluting industries allowed. The area is also home to a lot of wildlife, including elephants. The new city will have wildlife corridors to protect the animals. The king has said the success of the project will shape the future of Bhutan. \"When we say we follow the principles of Gross National Happiness, we do not mean we are happy with less… We also want to be rich. We also want to be technologically high standard,\" Dr. Tshering said. \"We want Bhutanese to be heading multi-million dollar companies, multinational companies.\" A Bhutanese team is collaborating with experts around the world, seeking investors to help build the city, the cost of which is likely to run in the billions. The city will have its own legal framework modeled on Singapore's and will run on clean hydroelectric power, with the hope of drawing technology companies, especially AI. Deciding to stay Ingels presented his plans to the king, and the king then presented them to the nation, last December. Namgay Zam, a journalist who used to anchor Bhutan's nightly newscast, was in attendance. She'd been in the middle of planning a move to Australia with her family when she went to hear the king that day at a packed stadium. \"He did what no king had done before. He asked the people to help him directly. And he said, 'Will you help me?' And there was shocked silence,\" Zam said. \"Even for me, I froze. And I was like, 'Did he just ask us to help him?' And then he said, 'Will you help me,' a second time.\" Namgay Zam 60 Minutes For Zam, it was a yes. \"I came home and I told my husband, 'We can't leave,'\" Zam said. \"And he said, 'Why?' And I said, 'I've signed a social contract with his majesty, because I said yes.'\" Zam and her husband did not go to Australia, but the king and his family did. He visited the country last month to bring his vision for the new Gelephu Mindfulness City and the future of Bhutan to packed stadiums of more than 20,000 Bhutanese who live in Australia now, all in the hopes of one day luring them back home. \"If we succeed, we can show that you can create a city that does not displace nature, that is anchored and rooted in the local heritage and culture, and that still allows for growth and prosperity to happen,\" Ingels said. \"That is a struggle a lot of places in the world are struggling with.\" More from CBS News The ancient traditions of Bhutan How an Australian drama school opened doors to Hollywood Reclaiming the 9/11 dead Scientists still identifying 9/11 victims' remains, giving answers to loved ones Lesley Stahl One of America's most recognized and experienced broadcast journalists, Lesley Stahl has been a \"60 Minutes\" correspondent since 1991. © 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

Social comparison theory is the idea that our satisfaction with what we have isn't an objective measure, but is actually based on what we see other people have. Young people generally seem to have an innate desire to leave their hometowns and seek out what else might be waiting out there for them. When you add in globalization and media influence exposing them to what looks like a \"better\" life with more things, it's not surprising that they've seen ~9% of young people leave Bhutan. The other question is, what will happen if Bhutan does increase their financial wealth as well as their happiness? Will they then see a net influx of people through immigration, looking for the lifestyle Bhutan promises? And will those new people be able to maintain the culture Bhutan has cultivated? It sounds like the concept of Gross National Happiness is a successful one, on its own, but it brings new challenges that couldn't have been forseen originally. That doesn't mean they can't solve them without giving up their core values. reply cardanome 3 hours agoparentNah, the issue is the one that many developing countries suffer from: brain drain. The best people leave the country because the can earn orders of magnitude more money in the developed world. This is why countries like the US keep being so successful while developing countries stay poor. It is just the rational best decision for a young people to try their luck abroad and earn more money that they could ever dream of in their home country. Why shouldn't they? Idealism? There is nothing wrong with striving for a better life, it is what moves humanity forward. Offering great and free education will always backfire for developing nations. The solution is to either keep the population ignorant, hamstringing their education so they are less useful abroad and implementing a strict censorship regime so they don't get \"corrupted\" by the West or well force them to stay. We saw that all play out in the Soviet Block. There is a good reason there was a wall. I think the fairest solution is to NOT make education free but instant offer a deal of having to stay in the country and work for X-years in the profession one has been trained in by the state. Once they get older and settle down they are less likely to leave anyway. Being a developing country just sucks. There is a reason most never break the cycle of poverty. reply FLT8 47 minutes agorootparentThis reminds of the corporate adage: \"You can choose to invest in your people and run the risk that they leave, or you can choose not to invest in your people and run the risk that they stay\". It seems to me that the smartest people would be far more motivated to leave a country where they are unable to find other people like themselves to collaborate with. And they'd be far more likely to come back in future and reinvest their overseas earnings in a country that they felt warmth towards than one that had forced them to play life in hard mode and was actively hostile towards them. reply FredPret 3 hours agorootparentprevI'm part of the brain drain from my developing country-of-birth. It's more than just money. To me, the money is a symptom of the real issue. The real issue for me was the culture that exists in my birthplace. It just isn't welcoming to nerds or rich people.

I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902–1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916.

Then come better roads, better infra, less traffic, etc. When you call 911, the police actually come. An ambulance actually arrive. In India, police first find if the perpetrator is from the local ruling party or under a local crime lord. They come only if the answer is negative. Then they push the perpetrator for hefty bribes. If they pay, again, no case. If they don't pay, you are at the mercy of local courts, which will give you justice in, say, 25 years. In India, there is no basic human decency allotted for you.

Stabilizing at only two viable parties rather than several that must (most of the time) form coalitions to govern causes a bunch of problems, with few benefits. It is also why so much of the rest is hard to fix, including why this system of elections has been so hard to move away from. At the strictly federal level, the notorious electoral college system reinforces FPTP and has accomplished little of its positive intentions, leaving only \"give lower-free-population slave states more power\" (which has become simply \"give lower population states more power\" after the civil war) which effect is simply bad, as was the original primary reason for including it (and again, secondary reasons like \"direct election of a position like president is kinda dumb [true!] so we should instead vote for trusted, wise representatives to go make the decision for us\" never worked as intended, so aren't reasons to keep it) The Supreme Court was recognized as super-dangerous at the founding and the solution some of our much-revered founders provided was \"I guess we can just ignore them when they do really bad things?\" which definitely seems not great. Lack of a defense against gerrymandering is extremely bad, but file under things that jettisoning FPTP would largely fix without further specific action. The many ill effects of FPTP are why it's so bad.

And the second principle is merely this: that the political instinct or desire is one of these things which they hold in common. Falling in love is more poetical than dropping into poetry. The democratic contention is that government (helping to rule the tribe) is a thing like falling in love, and not a thing like dropping into poetry. It is not something analogous to playing the church organ, painting on vellum, discovering the North Pole (that insidious habit), looping the loop, being Astronomer Royal, and so on. For these things we do not wish a man to do at all unless he does them well. It is, on the contrary, a thing analogous to writing one's own love-letters or blowing one's own nose. These things we want a man to do for himself, even if he does them badly. I am not here arguing the truth of any of these conceptions; I know that some moderns are asking to have their wives chosen by scientists, and they may soon be asking, for all I know, to have their noses blown by nurses.

The way I think about it, the differences are as follows: * Under monarchy, one person is chosen to rule \"at random\". Under dictatorship, there is a competition where the most ruthless person gets to rule. * Under monarchy, the people believe the monarch rules by divine right. Under dictatorship, the dictator rules by fear. * Monarchies are more stable, meaning the ruler can plan with a long time horizon. Dictators are more likely to siphon resources while the siphoning is good, since they fear a coup. * Lacking popular legitimacy, a dictator is forced to consider the self-interest and loyalty of their underlings. This leads to extractive and regressive policy. See this excellent video explaining the game theory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs * Under monarchy, criticism is kept in check while maintaining rule of law, via lèse-majesté laws which make it illegal to criticize the monarch. Under dictatorship, criticism is kept in check via repression. That same repression makes the dictator less popular, which triggers more criticism, and thus more repression, in a doom loop. Monarchy is an imperfect system. A lot comes down to the person who is \"randomly\" chosen to rule. But I do wonder if monarchy should be considered an option in countries where democracy has been consistently dysfunctional and the population is poorly educated -- Haiti perhaps? Most successful democracies were monarchies at some point in the past.

This comes with culture changes such that they can act like a monarch instead of a dictator. reply 0xDEAFBEAD 2 hours agorootparentBased on my reading about history, I sketch the situation as follows: In pre-industrial societies, having a king was considered the mark of a developed state. The king was seen as a divine or semi-divine figure. Democracy popped up every so often, but it had a tendency to end in chaos, enhancing the legitimacy of the nobility. It's only in the past few hundred years that we've seen a reversal, where democracy is now considered the legitimate form of government. The lack of legitimacy is a big problem for dictatorships, and creates the need for repression. There's also an adverse selection problem in modern times -- since 'everyone knows' that democracy is the more ethical form of government, those who volunteer to be dictator tend to be unethical. reply bluGill 1 hour agorootparentReading between the lines though, I suspect that isn't quite correct even though a simple reading of history says that. Remember the victors write history. The great dictator tends to be good at war, and so they write history.

It's so easy to become addicted to the stuff, and the costs to society are so high to get an addict clean, that one has to at least consider the pros and cons of prohibition. In an ideal world, all consenting adults should have the free choice to ruin their life if they wish, and perhaps in a post-scarcity society this is what we should allow everyone to do. But while resources are still limited, heroin addicts (and by extension opiates) create a lot of negative externalities. Personal freedom is all good, but where does it end? Should a person be free to ruin the lives of others when they cannot get their fix other than to rob people? And when someone is getting withdrawal symptoms, they have no more free will, they'll do anything to avoid that suffering. It's tricky to say what would be the marginal increase in heroin users if it was easily available. I agree with you that rational people with well balanced lives and a strong safety net in terms of family and finances are unlikely to go out and buy heroin. People who are bored, in a bad spot, depressed, etc... might just go out and do it if all it takes is a short walk to the nearest shop. reply ImHereToVote 3 hours agorootparentprevStar Trek had Starfleet. reply Throw383839 4 hours agoparentprevMaybe the \"free stuff\" is not there.

And how they compare to other nations. reply tolciho 3 hours agoparentprevThere are changes in other spheres too which we must expect to come. When the accumulation of wealth is no longer of high social importance, there will be great changes in the code of morals. We shall be able to rid ourselves of many of the pseudo-moral principles which have hag-ridden us for two hundred years, by which we have exalted some of the most distasteful of human qualities into the position of the highest virtues. We shall be able to afford to dare to assess the money-motive at its true value. The love of money as a possession -as distinguished from the love of money as a means to the enjoyments and realities of life -will be recognised for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semicriminal, semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease. All kinds of social customs and economic practices, affecting the distribution of wealth and of economic rewards and penalties, which we now maintain at all costs, however distasteful and unjust they may be in themselves, because they are tremendously useful in promoting the accumulation of capital, we shall then be free, at last, to discard. John Maynard Keynes, Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren (1930) However Keynes goes on to say the \"only\" option is to hitch our wagon to these psychopathic criminals, regardless of where their rocket toboggan is going, without consideration of alternatives, nor of Regulations (such as mentioned by Adam Smith) or even holding higher standards of conduct to the Mammon-addled, in order to better blunt some of their more charming aspects. reply tim333 45 minutes agorootparentKeynes was a great economist but I think he was a bit off on human nature there with: \"The love of money\" .... \"semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease\".

The most fascinating thing here is that these people managed to convince others that they are smart. > Now this is, I say deliberately, the only defect in the greatness of Mr. Shaw, the only answer to his claim to be a great man, that he is not easily pleased. He is an almost solitary exception to the general and essential maxim, that little things please great minds. And from this absence of that most uproarious of all things, humility, comes incidentally the peculiar insistence on the Superman. After belabouring a great many people for a great many years for being unprogressive, Mr. Shaw has discovered, with characteristic sense, that it is very doubtful whether any existing human being with two legs can be progressive at all. Having come to doubt whether humanity can be combined with progress, most people, easily pleased, would have elected to abandon progress and remain with humanity. Mr. Shaw, not being easily pleased, decides to throw over humanity with all its limitations and go in for progress for its own sake. If man, as we know him, is incapable of the philosophy of progress, Mr. Shaw asks, not for a new kind of philosophy, but for a new kind of man. It is rather as if a nurse had tried a rather bitter food for some years on a baby, and on discovering that it was not suitable, should not throw away the food and ask for a new food, but throw the baby out of window, and ask for a new baby. Mr. Shaw cannot understand that the thing which is valuable and lovable in our eyes is man—the old beer-drinking, creed-making, fighting, failing, sensual, respectable man. And the things that have been founded on this creature immortally remain; the things that have been founded on the fancy of the Superman have died with the dying civilizations which alone have given them birth. When Christ at a symbolic moment was establishing His great society, He chose for its corner-stone neither the brilliant Paul nor the mystic John, but a shuffler, a snob a coward—in a word, a man. And upon this rock He has built His Church, and the gates of Hell have not prevailed against it. All the empires and the kingdoms have failed, because of this inherent and continual weakness, that they were founded by strong men and upon strong men. But this one thing, the historic Christian Church, was founded on a weak man, and for that reason it is indestructible. For no chain is stronger than its weakest link. reply tim333 2 hours agoparent [–] I'm not sure there's much correlation between governments wanting their people to be happy and building gulags.

Ostensibly this is taking on art museum snobbery, but many of these works are by amateurs and were literally pulled out the trash. It feels like an embittered teacher making fun of a kid, while the class snickers at the spectacle of public humiliation. To each of the artists: congratulations for having the courage to trust in your imagination. I hope that others have engaged with your works with greater generosity. EDIT: There’s a missed opportunity here for a critic to participate in the exhibition by praising the works sincerely. (If museum goers can detect sarcasm then the critique has failed.)

For example Monochrome 006 (supposedly inspired by Schoenberg) would IMO fit right in at MOMA and was actually kind of cool. Likewise, Inside The Egg, Twins In Utero, and Spewing Marshmallows were both really interesting. Some of these are actually goofy doodles, but it's a shame to dismiss everything that isn't a conventional oil painting as \"bad\". I say this as someone who doesn't really enjoy or appreciate modern art (or modern music like Schoenberg for that matter). I see the same problem in other sections too. A New Day looks like a child's doodle. But Greenscape and Burning Bush are interesting. They both look like they were painted by big Bob Ross fans. Amateur, sure.

I'm fairly creative, I can draw (at one time in my life I seriously wanted to be a comic book illustrator) and I'm a musician. I appreciate that art is subjective, often difficult to do well and that technical skill is not the only factor that matters. But when I looked at their \"collections\" page my first thought was \"How does this distinguish itself from the bulk of what goes on display in modern fine art exhibits?\" The serious question being posed is: \"What makes this particular collection 'bad' but something like 'Voices of Fire' is so 'good' that it was worth charging the Canadian tax payers $1.8 million dollars in 1980s money to acquire for the National Gallery of Canada? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_Fire reply GuB-42 57 minutes agorootparentI didn't know about \"Voice of Fire\" but it is the story makes it interesting. By itself, the painting is not bad, kind of like a flag, just not particularly remarkable. But that it was bought for $1.8M with taxpayer money and the controversy it created is where its real value lies. With a name like \"Voice of Fire\", it is almost as if it was the plan. According to the Wikipedia article, it has been valued $40M in 2014, which, if real, would have made that $1.8M a worthy investment! reply PrismCrystal 1 hour agorootparentprevWith a work of a size like \"Voices of Fire\", one has to consider the possibility that it hits differently in real life versus seeing a reproduction in a book or on the internet. For example, some people who were sceptical about the value of Mark Rothko’s paintings (which are fairly comparable in style) were won over once they saw the works in person. Or consider how Arvo Pärt, a composer who writes music in a style that could be labeled anti-modern, was moved almost to tears at seeing Anish Kapoor’s modern-art sculpture Marsyas. Museums like the National Gallery of Canada like having in their collection pieces that might make people go wow, and tell other people who in turn might visit the museum. reply zelos 2 hours agorootparentprevI guess it would be an interesting experiment to randomly mix 'good' art into the bad art collection and vice versa and ask a load of critics and/or artists to comment on them. reply ceejayoz 3 hours agorootparentprev> In 2014, it was reported that senior personnel at the National Gallery estimated that the current value of the painting is in excess of $40 million.

Even if it has appreciated after adjusting for inflation (and I'm sure it has), what is the National Gallery's possession of that piece of canvas, oil and pigment doing to help the taxpayers with anything that concerns them in either 1989 or 2024? In any event, this is a huge digression from the topic. I never meant to start a conversation about whether or not tax dollars should be used to purchase art, and what kind of art. The discussion is what makes art 'good' or 'bad'. And Voices of Fire was controversial in 1989 and still is ... because many Canadians are like \"why do rich people pay money for this kind of stuff?\" reply ceejayoz 3 hours agorootparent> How does it help the tax payers to have a 40 million dollar asset on display?

His work got picked by MOBA and was made fun of, but they totally missed the point. reply the_af 3 hours agorootparentprevI didn't know this piece or the artist. Went through the few examples in Wikipedia of his art and it's almost all like this, minimalist blocks or stripes of color. Definitely not my thing. Why does it matter? To me, because it's different for a masterful artist to purposefully create something minimalist (e.g. Picasso) when you know they could make something technically complex if they wished so, vs an artist for which there's no evidence they could create anything else but a few blobs of color. In the second case, why are they not in the Bad Art Museum? Is it because of financial success of the art piece? Seems odd. (I'm not trying to dictate anything universal or what others should think, it's just my own preferences and musings about art and artists). reply microtherion 1 hour agorootparentSome time ago, I attended the memorial service for a skilled painter (not exactly a household name, though), and one of the stories told about him was that he visited the municipal museum, where there was a new exhibit of a newly acquired abstract expressionist painting (I believe by Mark Rothko), which just consisted of painted rectangles. He studied the painting for some time, and then asked to see the director of the museum, to inform him that the painting was hung upside down! When asked why he would think that, he pointed out that wet paint does not flow upward… So it is indeed possible for a connaisseur to distinguish interesting details in a painting like this. reply the_af 7 minutes agorootparentExcellent anecdote! Thanks for sharing. Isn't this more evidence that it's arbitrary to decide something is \"bad art\" vs \"good modern art\" (of the pop/avant garde variety)? reply ferguu_ 4 hours agoparentprevMy thoughts exactly! What makes a bad art piece anyway? While they might not have yet mastered the brush or the canvas, these artists are obviously passionate all the same, and isn't that what matters? Real bad art is soulless and as such would offer no value, be it entertainment or contemplative, when placed in a gallery. That is a true Mueseum Of Bad Art, and I suppose the curators know this. I thought some of these pieces were quite incredible, actually. reply vundercind 4 hours agorootparentEntertainingly bad is different from simply bad in every(?) art. So-bad-it's-good film isn't the worst film in every dimension—often it's competently- or even well-made in at least some ways. Films that are simply all-around bad, made with no amount of skill at the craft and insufficient effort, usually aren't entertaining and aren't the kind of thing anybody wants to watch. So-bad-it's-good is defined by being a kind of bad that one can still appreciate, even if part of the appreciation is of the ways in which it is bad. There was a thread on here about bad songs the other day, and the kind of bad people meant wasn't, like, an untalented and under-practiced 9-year-old screeching out their original composition on a violin. Obviously that's worse than nearly anything, but nobody means that when they talk about something like \"what are the worst songs?\" A credible effort has to be put in for anyone to even care to think about it to shit on it. I think it's still useful to call those categories \"bad\", even if they're not the most bad. Often the badness is what distinguishes them from the merely forgettable. reply ferguu_ 2 hours agorootparentI definitely agree with you - it reminds me of an inverted bell curve, or the YouTube series \"The Search For The Worst\" - It is far better from a viewer's perspective to wholeheartedly and absolutely fail, then create something so mediocre and lacking in soul that it isn't worth a thought. I suppose the primary purpose of an art gallery, at least this one, is to entertain, and MOMA (Mueseum Of Mediocre Art in this case) was already taken [https://www.moma.org/] I'm reminded also of the corporate art style [https://thebroadsideonline.com/17614/opinion/opinion-the-cor...] - every effort was taken to produce something so inoffensive and average that it could not possibly provoke any emotion in any demographic. Nobody would ever say that this is their favourite art style. What's your favourite piece within the collections on the MOBA website? reply vundercind 2 hours agorootparentThe entire sports category is hard to beat. I think its tendency to provoke an attempt at depicting somewhat-realistic humans in action gives it an edge on some of the others, in terms of producing multidimensionally-baffling pieces. reply geophile 2 hours agorootparentprevI think it is quite simple to characterize MOBAs curation process. First, it has to be bad, in an ambition-vastly-exceeds-talent kind of way. Second (per MOBA rules) there is a price limit on each acquisition.

Whatever the people who buy art and are influential say is bad. In general, very wealthy people and the dealers in their orbit determine which art is worthy and which art and artists will be forgotten. reply ferguu_ 2 hours agorootparentMy favourite painting of all time \"The Escorial from a foot-hill of the Guadarrama mountains\" by Lucas van Uden [https://data.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/id/image/media-4256550851] is quite a small painting that I'm sure most people have never heard of, hell, I'd never heard of it before I found it tucked politely in a corner of the Cambridge Fitzwilliam Museum, and I sure as hell don't know who Lucas van Uden is. Nevertheless, it is a remarkably beautiful painting and demonstrates true craft from the artist. I have no idea what a painting like this would cost, but I can't say it would be worth much compared to some of the other pieces in there. Your comment leads me to wonder what the incredibly wealthy would have to say about this painting's quality. It certainly feels worthy to me. reply forinti 3 hours agoparentprevI actually thought \"Blue Mushroom Man\" in Poor Traits was alright, although the other \"poor traits\" were really weird. reply rob74 3 hours agoparentprevI guess some genres attract worse artists than others. Most in the \"Oozing My Religion\" and \"In The Nood\" categories are truly atrocious, while some from \"MOBA Zoo\" are actually not that bad (including my favourite - more because of the retroactively added title than because of the work itself - \"You're a Mule, Dear\")... reply the_af 3 hours agoprevSome of these look similar to stuff I've seen in galleries purporting to display good modern art. There's an asymmetry going on here... I think making bad art at this level is very easy. Most of it looks like things created by children (or young people) who are not very talented or still lack direction and practice. Perspective errors, hiding body parts that are difficult to draw for novices, uninteresting composition, garish colors... (making things more confusing: each of these \"flaws\" can be done on purpose by a decent artist, to make a statement). I wonder what qualifies for inclusion in MOBA. Creating good art is difficult, but creating bad art is trivial.

I suspect that it is because artists are absolutely soaked in art from all over history. They study it, they live and breathe it, and by this point they are bored of it. So they try to make something different and unlike the art of old, but have lost sight of the fact that normal people aren't jaded and bored of old art like they are. So they wind up making stuff which can only possibly appeal to others who are just as soaked in art (and bored of the old stuff) as they are. It basically turns art into this giant circle jerk of artists making stuff to impress each other, having lost touch with their audience. I've noticed the same thing with other fields as well, not just art. Cooking is this way, for example. The food that fancy chefs at fancy restaurants make is so ridiculous that it feels like a joke sometimes. And as far as I can tell, it's the same thing. Those chefs are bored of normal food, are trying super hard to make something creative that has never been done before, and have lost sight of the fact that it's just not going to appeal to people who aren't as bored with food as they are. Maybe it's the inevitable result of being steeped in a craft and spending all your time on it, IDK. reply pavl- 1 hour agorootparentWhy do you think the goal of modern art should necessarily be to appeal to as many people as possible - or when you say \"universally bad\" do you mean to say \"perceived as bad to people who aren't immersed in art\"?

But what really makes the museum so wonderful are the blurbs on display with each piece of art. They are written in the style of Very Serious art museums (the art is \"exploring\" some issue, or \"asking a question\"), but tuned to the particular piece of horrendously bad art you are looking at. They used to be in the basement of the Dedham theater, when I lived nearby. Then they had the decency to move to the basement of the Somerville Theater when I moved to Somerville. But they have moved again, to Dorchester. Fortunately, not too far. I went to the (re)opening in Dorchester, and actually got to meet the couple who started the museum, and got the story of MOBAs birth firsthand. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Headline features in this release include: support for the Arm permission overlay extension, better compile-time control over which Spectre mitigations to employ, the last pieces of realtime preemption support, the realtime deadline server mechanism, more EEVDF scheduler development, the extensible scheduler class, the device memory TCP work, use of static calls in the security-module subsystem, the integrity policy enforcement security module, the ability to handle devices with a block size larger than the system page size in the XFS filesystem, and more. See the LWN merge-window summaries (part 1, part 2) and the KernelNewbies 6.12 page for more details. to post comments Milestone release Posted Nov 18, 2024 8:11 UTC (Mon) by alspnost (guest, #2763) [Link] (1 responses) This seems like a big milestone release, as the 2024 LTS. A lot has happened since 6.6, and this kernel is packed with major goodies. It will presumably form the basis of next year's Debian 13 and derivatives, so it's going to end up being in widespread use. I look forward to running it soon, via Liquorix, on my Ubuntu 24.04 system. It will be interesting to see where the baked-in RT capability takes it next, though I suppose it still won't be running any nuclear power plants quite yet... Milestone release Posted Nov 18, 2024 9:05 UTC (Mon) by Sesse (subscriber, #53779) [Link] The RT stuff is obviously a great milestone! This is one of the few kernel releases where I have a patch in myself; perf now supports linking against LLVM instead of libbfd, which means that “perf report” on distro builds (which cannot link to libbfd due to GPLv2-vs-GPLv3 shenanigans) is sped up something like 10–100x. Without libllvm or libbfd, it has to start up addr2line in a pipe for every symbol resolution, which obviously is pretty slow. And QR code panics Posted Nov 18, 2024 17:31 UTC (Mon) by pbonzini (subscriber, #60935) [Link] That might actually be the feature that pushes distros to enable Rust in the kernel!

That's the workflow the Linux kernel has used for years. reply rurban 12 hours agorootparentnext [4 more] [flagged] sevg 12 hours agorootparentWhat a strange comment. Are you trolling?

And Linus Torvalds particularly. reply bonzini 12 hours agoparentprevThere's no minor and major. All releases are equivalent but the first number is bumper when the second becomes large enough, which happens every 2-3 years. reply yjftsjthsd-h 11 hours agorootparentIn fairness, that is a weird versioning scheme, and I really do wish that Linux either switched to full semver (in which case it'd be version 2.9000.0 or so by now) or just drop the leading digit and go full build number kinda like NT does. But as cousin comments note, not my project not my call:) reply usr1106 9 hours agorootparentFull semver is an illusion. It's often debatable what is a new feature (we support a previously unsupported functionality) vs. what is a bug fix (it did not work correctly before). Also what is a non-compatible change is not always clear. Did the user do it wrong in their existing code or did the project make an incompatible change? The kernel has said for long times that they don't make incompatible changes. We don't break user space as they say. So you could prefix their numbers with an imaginary \"1.\". Of course sometimes opinions vary, whether a change breaks userspace or breaks wrong code. That said the kernel numbering scheme is weird. Increasing the first digit after 19 *or* 20 is less logical than imperial units. reply bonzini 6 hours agorootparent> The kernel has said for long times that they don't make incompatible changes Which is also not entirely true, as sometimes bad or obsolete functionality is dropped (e.g. /dev/mem). Given how big the kernel is, probably all versions would be a semver bump for one of it's many subsystems. reply homebrewer 10 hours agorootparentprevWhat for? Every kernel release is equal as far as maintainers are concerned, the list of features that go in depends on what is ready in time. They would have to change release processes significantly to accommodate \"major versions\", and I don't think they would want to do that. Also, the kernel doesn't really have an external kernel API, the user API is supposed to be 100% stable, and its internal kAPI is nobody else's business, so there's one less reason for semver. reply CorrectHorseBat 10 hours agorootparentWhy then confuse users with the first dot?

They are as large as they are, a dot in between doesn't change that. The only thing I can imagine is trying not to break scripts looking at the kernel version and expecting two dots.

I can't tell how old qemu 4.0 is, but even without knowing details I would feel pretty confident in roughly when a hypothetical qemu-2024.1 had been released. reply dessimus 10 hours agorootparentprevI would think most if not all of the enterprise distros would object as generally they lock their kernel versions for the duration of a \"release\" lifecycle and backport security fixes from newer kernels to the version they chose. They wouldn't want users thinking they were still using a \"2024\" kernel in 2032, for example, when they have 10+ years of support to provide. reply RandomThoughts3 8 hours agorootparentNote that the world would be significantly better if entreprise distros stopped doing that and just shipped the latest kernel. I understand freezing user space because most developers don’t care about shipping stable software and break compatibility all the time but the kernel takes its pledge to never break user space very seriously. The backporting is very much hit and miss. reply bonzini 5 hours agorootparentRegressions in upstream kernel exist; they may be security issues, assertion failures, performance regressions, and so on. It's just too much work to validate a whole new kernel every six months, and also much harder to pinpoint a regression. People have tried shipping the latest kernel; it's the same in all environments, from enterprise distros to network appliances to phones, people end up sticking to an upstream release and do backports on top. reply fuoqi 8 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I wish they have just used dates for user-facing releases. At least, it would contain some useful information. reply perlgeek 9 hours agorootparentprevFor regular releases without semver, I'd slightly prefer a version number that contained the year (and possibly month), like Ubuntu does it. Gives immediate feeling for how old (or young) a version is. reply blueflow 9 hours agoparentprev [–] Linux uses their own versioning scheme of Version/Patchlevel/Sublevel. See their Makefile.
