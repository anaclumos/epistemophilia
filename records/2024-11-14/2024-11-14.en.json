Listen to this article · 6:25 min Learn more Share full article 648 Alex Jones, the founder of Infowars, outside a federal courthouse in Houston ahead of a bankruptcy hearing in June. Credit... David J. Phillip/Associated Press By Benjamin Mullin Nov. 14, 2024 Updated 1:49 p.m. ET The Onion, a satirical publication that skewers newsmakers and current events, said on Thursday that it had won a bankruptcy auction to acquire Infowars, a website founded and operated by the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. The Onion said that the bid was sanctioned by the families of the victims of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, who in 2022 won a $1.4 billion defamation lawsuit against Mr. Jones and his company, Free Speech Systems. Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit dedicated to ending gun violence that was founded in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting, will advertise on a relaunched version of the site under The Onion. The publication plans to reintroduce Infowars in January as a parody of itself, mocking “weird internet personalities” like Mr. Jones who traffic in misinformation and health supplements, Ben Collins, the chief executive of The Onion’s parent company, Global Tetrahedron, said in an interview. Family members of the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting, which claimed the lives of 20 first graders and six educators, sued Mr. Jones in Connecticut Superior Court in 2018 after he spread the baseless claim that the rampage was a fabricated pretext for confiscating Americans’ firearms. The Onion declined to disclose the price it had paid for Infowars and its assets, including its production studio and diet supplement business, though it said in a tongue-in-cheek story that the site cost “less than a trillion dollars.” (The article added that all of the diet supplements would be melted down “into a single candy bar-sized omnivitamin.”) In a court filing Thursday, the trustee in charge of the bankruptcy auction said the deal was expected to close before Nov. 30. The backup bidder is First United American Companies, a business associated with an online supplement store that bears Mr. Jones’s name. That bidder requested a meeting Thursday to address “apparent defects in the sale process,” according to a separate court filing. Mr. Jones could not immediately be reached for comment, but he said on the social media platform X this week that he planned to continue producing his online program, “The Alex Jones Show,” until he was forced to stop. In September, a Houston judge ruled that Infowars and other assets owned by Free Speech Systems could be auctioned off in bankruptcy to compensate Mr. Jones’s creditors, which include the families of the Sandy Hook victims. Mr. Jones declared bankruptcy in 2022 as the Sandy Hook case made its way to court. Mr. Collins said that he was informed late Wednesday by the trustee in charge of the bankruptcy auction that The Onion’s bid had prevailed. In a video posted online Thursday, Mr. Jones said that his lawyers had been told by the trustee about the sale to The Onion. “We thought this would be a hilarious joke,” Mr. Collins said. “This is going to be our answer to this no-guardrails world where there are no gatekeepers and everything’s kind of insane.” Mr. Collins declined to disclose the value of the advertising deal with Everytown but said that it was a multiyear agreement that would include banner advertisements and sponsored articles on the site, which will be redesigned to fit its new editorial direction. While the alliance between Everytown and The Onion may seem like an odd fit, the two organizations share an interest in curbing gun violence, said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown. Mr. Feinblatt said that mission was underscored with depressing regularity in the aftermath of mass shootings, when The Onion goes viral with its oft-shared headline: “‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens.” “This was an opportunity for us to give The Onion the facts, the storytelling, the data and the research that’s at our fingertips,” Mr. Feinblatt said. “And for them to give us the creativity of how to turn all of that information into new messaging to a new audience.” Mr. Collins said that the relaunched Infowars might publish its own satirical stories that underscored the epidemic of gun violence in America in addition to sponsored content from Everytown. Chris Mattei, a lawyer for the families of the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting, said in a statement that taking possession of Infowars amounted to accountability for “Alex Jones and his corrupt business.” “By divesting Jones of Infowars’ assets, the families and the team at The Onion have done a public service and will meaningfully hinder Jones’s ability to do more harm,” Mr. Mattei said. Mr. Collins said The Onion began contemplating a bid for Infowars this summer, when he read online that it was going to be auctioned off. The publication’s leadership team saw an opportunity to play a very funny, very public joke on Mr. Jones if things broke their way. In early fall, Mr. Collins reached out to the lawyers for the families of the victims of the Sandy Hook shootings, whom he knew from his days as a reporter covering misinformation at NBC News. The families expressed support for The Onion’s bid, Mr. Collins said. “The dissolution of Alex Jones’s assets and the death of Infowars is the justice we have long awaited and fought for,” Robbie Parker, whose daughter Emilie was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting, said Thursday in a statement. The Onion’s plan is to relaunch Infowars next year with an approach reminiscent of Clickhole, The Onion’s sister site that poked fun at “listicles” from BuzzFeed and other purveyors of viral content. Mr. Collins declined to provide financial details for The Onion, which is privately held, but he said that the company’s relaunched print edition had garnered “an arena” full of subscribers, helping finance the company’s bid for Infowars. Global Tetrahedron is backed by Jeff Lawson, a co-founder of the tech company Twilio. Mr. Collins said that the families of the victims were supportive of The Onion’s bid because it would put an end to Mr. Jones’s control over the site, which has been a front of misinformation for years. He said they were also supportive of using humor as a tool for raising awareness about gun violence in America. “They’re all human beings with senses of humor who want fun things to happen and want good things to take place in their lives,” Mr. Collins said. “They want to be part of something good and positive too.” Benjamin Mullin reports on the major companies behind news and entertainment.

You elect the representatives, and they nominate in turn whoever bureaucrats they feel comfy to work with. Or is this in the UK different? reply maeln 3 hours agorootparent> You elect the representatives, and they nominate in turn whoever bureaucrats they feel comfy to work with. This is not always the case, although I guess it depends how you define bureaucrats. As an example, in France, most of the administration is not nominated. You become a public worker through exam, and the representative usually have no power over your nomination, raises, etc. It does make sense in a lot of cases. For example, in a city, only the mayor and its advisers are elected, and they do not have any control over the administration of the city. But the administration cannot refuse to work with a specific mayor. If they do, they would need to be moved elsewhere, or simply be fired for not doing their job. On the other hand, they are also bound by the law, so they also act as a counter power to crazy mayor who wants to do illegal stuff. Meaning, if the mayor ask the administration to do something illegal, they can absolutely say no with no fear of repercussion for their job. It also makes sense for other counter-power office, where having the currently elected representatives being able to choose who control the office would go against its whole purpose. reply lucianbr 3 hours agorootparent> You become a public worker through exam, and the representative usually have no power over your nomination, raises, etc. Who else would have power over \"nomination, raises etc\" of anyone, if not elected representatives? Other public workers? At this point would they not be a sovereign group distinct from France, untouchable by the french people? I guess the elected representatives have indirect power over everything in the end, if France is still a democracy. May be lots of layers of indirection, like the need to pass or change a law, but still. Who defines and administers the exam you mentioned? Other public representatives? Can they decide to pass their relatives? reply johannes1234321 2 hours agorootparent> Who else would have power over \"nomination, raises etc\" of anyone, if not elected representatives? In many countries that is done based on laws describing career progression process. In Germany most administration workers are \"career\" folks, who study at the university of administration and then have a career paths, where levels at are relatively clearly described. Only heads of different authorities are \"political\" positions, which are nominated by ministers and can be fired/retired relatively easily but even those in most cases stay across administrations. Only ministers and their direct staff change. In some ministries there sometimes is the saying \"we don't care who is minoster below us\" but if a some minister with an agenda is appointed they still can be very effective. reply lucianbr 2 hours agorootparentSeems like a pretty good system. Or who knows. But since the law is written by elected representatives, to say that the representatives have no power in this case seems wrong, to me. That's all. If the voters will vote for the \"fire Joe\" party 20 years in a row, I guarantee Joe the civil servant will eventually be fired, even in Germany, France, anywhere. Well, maybe not in China, but that's different. Anywhere where votes still matter. Solutions would be found, laws changed, exceptions provided, and so on. reply Yeul 1 hour agorootparentCivil servants are a-political so why would you need to fire them? A civil servant carries out whatever law is enacted by the government. The bureaucracy is a tool and tools don't have a will. reply jowea 22 minutes agorootparent> Civil servants are a-political so why would you need to fire them? Have you watched the British documentary series \"Yes, Minister\"? rsynnott 3 hours agorootparentprev> Who else would have power over \"nomination, raises etc\" of anyone, if not elected representatives? Other public workers? Yes, that's how the civil service works in most countries, more or less. The US is an outlier in that the executive appoints about 4,000 civil servants; most places don't work like that (even in the US; _most_ civil servants (about 2.8 million of them, federal) are hired, promoted, disciplined etc by other civil servants; the president doesn't sit in on every interview or anything.) > I guess the elected representatives have indirect power over everything in the end, if France is still a democracy. The elected representatives pass laws. The civil service implements them. Separately, at least in many countries, not sure about France, you have the concept of power devolved to the minister, where the legislature passes a law allowing the minister to make orders in certain restricted areas, a bit like a scope-limited version of US presidential executive orders. This occasionally has amusing repercussions if the original devolution legislation was insufficient or unconstitutional; for instance in Ireland nearly all drugs (morphine, heroin, cannabis and possibly cocaine remained illegal) were accidentally legalised for a day, when the supreme count found that the legislation used to enable the Minister for Justice to ban drugs was insufficient, thus legalising everything which had been banned since it was passed. reply maeln 2 hours agorootparentprevYou are not wrong. Exam, raises, lateral and vertical move are decided (in most case) by: 1. The law. For example, public worker salary's are explicitly defined on a public grid, which depends on several factor (exact position, how long you have been in the job, the national public worker salary index, ...). 2. Their boss / future boss. Promotion it partly a matter of law, but also partly at the discretion of your boss. Same for a lateral move. If a position open, and you are qualified to fill it, you have to have interview just like a normal job offer. There is a bunch a caveat and details, but that's the gist of it. So, technically, representative do have power over this. Some representatives can change the law, and some are technically more or less the boss of the top officer at some administration. But it still make a lot of things difficult if not impossible. A mayor cannot change national law, only Deputé of the national assembly can, so he has no power over the salary of his administration. He also has no power to fire someone from the local administration unless he can prove that they did something that the law consider a fireable offense. The same would go for a minister. Of course, in effect, they do yield a lot of influence. While public worker are very, very rarely fired, they can be moved to another position, which is easier to do and what usually happen when someone powerful want them gone without having the actual power to do so directly. reply wwweston 3 hours agorootparentprev> I guess it depends how you define bureaucrats. “If Gondor, Boromir, has been a stalwart tower, [those who work at public bureaus] have played another part.

They work on a specific strain of the virus, they're not effective against other strains. The whole point about quarantining, social distancing, masks, etc, is to lower the spread of a strain before it has a chance to mutate into a new one so a vaccine that targets it can be administrated to enough of the population so it can actually be effective in stopping its spread. Did you happen to have a brain worm by any chance? reply nixdev 2 hours agorootparent> you can invent new ones without changing the definition. Yet, editors of prominent dictionaries DID change the definition. The existing unadulterated definition doesn't leave room for mRNA gene therapy. The mRNA gene therapy is literally not a vaccine without the adulterated new definition. By that existing definition, a new vaccine was not created. > They work on a specific strain of the virus, they're not effective against other strains. This is a fair argument and I was one of those presenting this argument at the time.

Unlikely. It's worth remembering that Jones was never actually tried for defamation. He instead received a default judgment. In the US, both sides of a civil case have the right to a fair and speedy trial. If there's delays, you had better have a good reason for them and they need to fit the rules of procedure. Jones and his company, Free Speech Systems, more-or-less refused to participate in the trial. The Knowledge Fight podcast has some episodes dealing with the discovery and deposition process for the suits, with actual deposition audio. I'm not a lawyer but it was absolutely brutal to listen to how ill-prepared Jones, his employees, and his representatives were. They were submitting Wikipedia articles about false flags as evidence, had a comprehensive background check on one of the parents that was in FSS records that no one could seem to explain the presence of, and generally didn't comply with other discovery requests. The end result of this is that his life's work has been reduced to a satire and he is likely financially hobbled for the rest of his life.

But I guess most of his viewership is. But they existed on the internets in the beginning too. Plenty of them. Maybe the recommendation engines bring more people into the \"self-sustaining\" circle, than would be otherwise? I think what has changed is mainly that there are more 'leaders'.

If someone does not abide the terms of mutual tolerance, then they are not covered by the contract. By definition intolerant people do not follow the rules so they are no longer covered and should not be tolerated. reply int_19h 46 minutes agorootparentThat's awfully close to \"terrorists shouldn't have rights\", and problematic for the same reason. reply genrilz 19 minutes agorootparentI think it's actually closer to \"terrorists should go to prison\". Terrorists and other criminals have broken a social contract, and a level of punishment that some approximation of society deems to be acceptable is extracted from the terrorists. This doesn't mean that terrorists don't/shouldn't have some rights. Similarly, thinking about tolerance as a social contract doesn't require stripping anyone who violates this contract of all of their rights. reply int_19h 11 minutes agorootparentFWIW I don't actually have a problem with Jones specifically getting in trouble over defamation after getting his day in court. What I have a problem with is the broad notion that it's generally okay to \"not tolerate the intolerant\" to the point of forcibly suppressing them. The paradox of tolerance is not really a paradox when we're talking about intolerant speech. genrilz 2 minutes agorootparentI'm kind of worried about society deciding which speech is \"intolerant\", so I'm not completely on board with the idea of treating tolerance as a social contract. That being said, if we could stop a genocide merely by suppressing people's speech, I feel like that would probably be a worthwhile thing to do. That is to say, it feels like the least bad way to prevent a genocide. Again, figuring out which speech is worth suppressing is a whole other can of worms. renewiltord 2 hours agorootparentprevIndeed.

There has got to be some space for that too, right? And ok, if there is some committee somewhere to dictate that all satire must be \"responsible\", must follow its founding Swiftian maxim, then fine, we don't have to call it that.

Hegseth is woefully underqualified to be the SecDef. He was in Army Natl Guard, not Army. He spent a year at Guantanamo in 2004, deployed to Iraq in 2005-2006 and Afghanistan in 2011-2012. That's it. The rest of the time was ARR and IRR. He has never held any public office at any level. I'm not trying to dismiss his military service itself, it's fine, but to imply it remotely qualifies him to be the SecDef is beyond reason.

    "originLink": "https://jan.miksovsky.com/posts/2024/11-12-momboard",
    "originBody": "MomBoard: E-ink display for a parent with amnesia November 12, 2024 Today marks two years since I first set up an e-ink display in my mom’s apartment to help her live on her own with amnesia. The display has worked extremely well during those two years, so I’m sharing the basic set-up in case others find it useful for similar situations. Note: unless you have specific experience caring for someone who has amnesia but not dementia, please do not offer care suggestions. The patient In June 2022 the side-effects of a long surgery left my mom with permanent anterograde amnesia: she can no longer form new long-term memories. Memory isn’t just one neurological system, so very occasionally she will able to remember certain types of things. But for the most part, if she hears or sees something, a few minutes later she will no longer remember it. To medical professionals her condition looks a lot like dementia — amnesia is a common symptom of dementia — but she doesn’t have dementia. One difference is that (as I understand it) dementia is a progressive disease, while this amnesia is stable. There is no cure. Someday I might post about the experience about caring for her, but for now I’ll just say that this type of amnesia is not something one should wish on one’s worst enemies. Needs My mom still lives on her own in an apartment. Because she cannot remember things, she goes through each day in a state of low-grade anxiety about where her grown children are and whether they are all right. She feels she hasn’t heard from any of us in a long time. This anxiety manifests as extremely frequent attempts to call or text us. Paper notes and other forms of reminders didn’t seem to help, and would become out of date even if they weren’t misplaced. My siblings and I would call to let her know we were okay, but five minutes later she’d be back to being worried. She wasn’t in the habit of scrolling back through text messages, so once she’d read a message, it was immediately forgotten and effectively lost. I thought some sort of unobtrusive, always-on device installed in her apartment might be able to show her notes written by my siblings and me. Design goals My goal was to find a display that: Could stay on for months on end Would let my siblings and I easily post short messages to it that would remain visible until replaced Was large enough and easy enough to read without glasses Required no interaction to wake or read and was relatively foolproof (touching it wouldn’t disrupt it) Was resilient to network failures Didn’t glow at nighttime Didn’t require hardware hackery (I’m a software person) Would boot directly into displaying messages (no interaction needed to start an app) Was not enshittified with a subscription service or proprietary app store Was reasonably affordable Would not look out of place in a home Device Given the above design goals, I searched for a tablet-size electronic ink display with Wi-Fi connectivity and a decent web browser. One device that seemed to fit my parameters was the BOOX Note Air2 Series. At the time it cost US$500, which is expensive but is still far cheaper than screens intended for use as commercial retail displays. It’s marketed as a note-taking device and ebook reader, but it also has a capable web browser. It’s big enough to read from a few feet away. A critical question I couldn’t answer online was whether I’d be able to have the device automatically start its web browser and have that browser display a designated start page. Happily, when the device arrived I was able to confirm it could do both of those things. The physical case of the Note Air2 looks reasonably nice and not particularly tech-y. The e-ink display is clear and legible; it refreshes quickly enough to not be distracting. By default the device’s backlight was turned on but I could turn it off. I found a small metal stand to serve an easel for the display so that it felt more like a picture frame. Web software Since the physical device was satisfactory, the next step was writing a simple website that could drive the display. The site would have two pages: A Board page showing the messages. The e-ink device would boot into showing this page. This is the only page my mom needed to see. A Compose page my siblings and I write messages and save them to be displayed. The device needed to run for months, and needed to be resilient in the case of network and service failures. At the same time, I also needed to be able to remotely update not only the messages being displayed, but the software displaying those messages. With that in mind, I factored the Board page into an outer frame and an inner page: The top-level outer frame acts as a thin shell around the inner page. At top of every hour, the outer frame reloads the inner page to pick up potential software changes. If the network is down and the inner page doesn’t reload, the frame just tries again an hour later. To maximize reliability, the outer frame has very little logic and no external dependencies. The inner page actually displays the messages. Every 5 minutes it queries a simple web service for message data and displays the messages. The inner page contains a small amount of logic, but as few dependencies as possible. Since it’s essentially impossible to debug anything that happens on the device, I made as much use of vanilla HTML and CSS as possible. I used a small amount of JavaScript but no framework or other libraries. The Compose page presents a simple web form my siblings and I can use to compose and save a message. I designed the form to work well on a phone screen so that we can write messages when we’re out and about. A small web app manifest lets us save the Compose page to a phone’s home screen as an icon for quick access. The whole site is tiny, entails no build process, and with the exception of the service (below) is just static files. Visual design I was concerned about the possibility of e-ink burn-in, so the Board page randomly changes which message appears where. Other visual elements like the date and time alternate from side to side, with the intention that no single pixel is always on. To style the note text I chose the free Architect’s Daughter font for a handwritten feel. This font works well on the e-ink display. Labels are displayed in Open Sans. One small challenge was maximizing the size of the message text. Sometimes a message is just a word or two; other times it might be several sentences. A single font size can’t accommodate such a wide range of text content. I couldn’t find a pure CSS way to automatically maximize font size so that a text element with word wrapping would display without clipping. I ended up writing a small JavaScript function to maximize font size: it makes the text invisible (via CSS visibility: hidden), tries displaying the text at a very large size, and then tries successively smaller font sizes until it finds a size that lets all the text fit. It then makes the text visible again. Service Just a tiny amount of text data is necessary to drive the display, so I was happy to find the minimalist JsonStorage service that was perfect for this project. A single JSON object stores the text and metadata for the current set of messages. The Compose page can save to the service with a POST request, and the Board page can retrieve the data with a GET. The service has a free tier that I started with, but I liked the service so much that I eventually paid for a $1/month basic tier. (It appears that tier is now $5/month.) Trial and installation I spent a couple of weeks working on the software and letting it run for long periods of time. I was pleasantly surprised that the Boox display worked as well as it did and seemed to stay up indefinitely. I brought the display over to my mom’s apartment on November 12, 2022, turned it on, joined it to her Wi-Fi, and rebooted it to confirm everything worked in the new environment. I thought the bathroom counter might be a good place for it, but my mom thought she’d rather have it in her bedroom, so we found a home for it on a windowsill. My mom was happy with the display right away. Retrospective Despite her amnesia, my mom came to remember that this display exists and what it’s for. She looks forward to seeing updates from her children on it. If we tell her about something that’s coming up, she often asks whether we’ve already put that event on the MomBoard. On the flip side, we have to be careful to keep it up to date; if we fail to take down a message that no longer applies, it confuses her. Looking back, the display is essentially the only intervention of any kind we’ve tried that’s actually been successful at improving her quality of life (and ours). One reason it’s worked so well is that it didn’t require her to learn anything new. Without the ability to remember new things, it’s virtually impossible for her to learn a new skill or to form new habits. The device’s reliability has surpassed my expectations. There was one period where the device seemed to stop working, but I traced the problem to a faulty Wi-Fi hub; after that was replaced, it’s worked flawlessly since. For my part, keeping the software as simple as possible and sticking to vanilla web technologies surely helped avoid bugs. The display still looks great, and it still displays messages day in and day out. If you want to try to set up something similar to what I describe here, I’m happy to answer technical questions or share advice.",

Such a beautiful and simple use of technology to make a clear and big improvement in someone's life. As a side note on his mother remembering that the tablet exists, it sounds like she has amnesia quite like Henry Molaison, a famous case study in neuropathology. He had very specific brain damage that seemingly stopped him forming new memories in the same way as OP's mother, but studies showed that he could remember some things, just not consciously. So for example he would have warm feelings towards people who'd been caring for him despite not remembering them, and would also pick up card games more and more quickly as he played them repeatedly despite saying he didn't remember the game. OP's mother remembering the tablet sounds very similar, particularly when paired with the feeling of being remembered and loved by her children. reply ghosty141 4 hours agoparent> but studies showed that he could remember some things, just not consciously.

If I try to play something too slowly or if I really start thinking about what I'm doing it all falls apart. I think that's when you really know a piece, when you can play it incredibly slowly.

You can further subdivide explicit into semantic (Paris is the capital of France) and episodic (events that you have experienced), and implicit into procedural (how to ride a bike) and emotional conditioning (memories of feelings). Those categories aren't related to neurophysiology though, which is where I think it gets really interesting because I doubt matches those rather Platonic categories. reply 0xdeadbeefbabe 2 hours agorootparentprevYes it is strange to practice a song one day and then come back to it again the next day.

My dad didn't like poetry clock, but he does like image gen. So we got a (color) Inky Impression 7.3 and hooked it up to an RPi. I made a basic telegram bot that you could send a verbal prompt to (\"snowy day\"). It would then ask which of your favorite artist styles it should create an image in. I found that presenting a list of two styles combined had cooler results.

Sometimes a message is just a word or two; other times it might be several sentences. A single font size can’t accommodate such a wide range of text content. I couldn’t find a pure CSS way to automatically maximize font size so that a text element with word wrapping would display without clipping. > I ended up writing a small JavaScript function to maximize font size: it makes the text invisible (via CSS visibility: hidden), tries displaying the text at a very large size, and then tries successively smaller font sizes until it finds a size that lets all the text fit. It then makes the text visible again. Wow -- not just for accessibility but this seems like a very useful feature to have in native CSS. Nice find. Overall such a heartwarming use of technology. Love. reply zackmorris 3 hours agoparentI've been watching the evolution of the web since 1995, and I remember when css got popular in the late 90s thinking that it didn't match real-world use cases. Somehow design-by-committee took us from drawing our sites with tables in the browser's WYSIWYG editor, to not being able to center text no matter how much frontend experience we have. Css jumped the shark and today I'd vote to scrap it entirely, which I know is a strong and controversial statement. But I grew up with Microsoft Word and Aldus PageMaker, and desktop publishing was arguably better in the 1980s than it is today. Because everyone could use it to get real work done at their family-owned small businesses, long before we had the web or tech support. Why are we writing today's interfaces in what amounts to assembly language? Anyway, I just discovered how float is really supposed to work with shape-outside. Here's an example that can be seen by clicking the Run code snippet button: https://stackoverflow.com/a/33953666 Notice how this tiny bit of markup flows like a magazine article. Browsers should have been able to do this from day one. But they were written by unix and PC people, not human interface experts like, say, Bill Atkinson. Just look at how many years it took outline fonts to work using strokes and shadows, so early websites couldn't even place text over images without looking like Myspace. I think that css could benefit from knowing about the dimensions of container elements, sort of like with calc() and @media queries (although @media arguably shouldn't exist, because mobile shouldn't be its own thing either). And we should have more powerful typesetting metaphors than justify. Edit: that would adjust font size automatically to fit within a container element. IMHO the original sin of css was that it tried to give everyone a cookie cutter media-agnostic layout tool, when we'd probably be better off with the more intuitive auto flow of Qt, dropping down to a constraint matrix like Apple's Auto Layout when needed. Disclaimer: I'm a backend developer, and watching how much frontend effort is required to accomplish so little boggles my mind. reply rosslh 17 minutes agorootparentYour comment is some interesting food for thought, but I wanted to respond to a couple statements you made: > not being able to center text no matter how much frontend experience we have Not being able to center things is a bit of a meme, but flexbox was introduced back in 2009 and has been supported by major browsers for quite a long time.

    "originBody": "I Followed the Official AWS Amplify Guide and was Charged $1,100 October 31, 2024 6 minute read Allegory of Failure during the Pilgrimage of Life, by Monogrammist HSR, 1519 A few months ago, I was adapting an official guide for an AWS service. Specifically, integrating OpenSearch with Amplify. I worked through the guide, and modified and debugged it for my own purposes. A few weeks later, I received an AWS bill for over $1200, and almost had a heart attack. I hadn’t selected the most expensive OS instance type. I hadn’t even used it much at all. I had worked with Amplify & OpenSearch back in 2020 (back when it still was ElasticSearch). It’s pricey for personal use, usually around $50 per month, but not $1200. Elliott I think the [OpenSearch] domains should have only been billed for part of the month, for one machine. The Amplify + OpenSearch behavior was unexpected. While I appreciate it if you waive my charges, I would also recommend raising this issue to the team in charge of documentation/implementation at Amplify. Name of the Service: Amazon OpenSearch Service Total Amount: 1,124.88 Time Frame( in Days, Weeks and Months): One Month AWS Customer Support After a detailed review of your case and account, I’m happy to inform you that we’ve processed a billing adjustment for the unexpected charges as a one time courtesy. […] Regarding your follow-up notes, I have reached out to the concerned team to investigate it further […] I opened a support ticket with AWS. I narrowed down what happened. There were a few behaviors with Amplify + OpenSearch that I felt were oversights. The response from AWS was prompt. They had me set up a budget alert and gave me service credit for both OpenSearch and its storage. Kudos! Even if you are not using Amplify/OpenSearch, I recommend getting familiar with AWS budgets. They predict future spend, for a service or for AWS as a whole, and can send you alerts if you are projected to break them. However, I was terrified from that experience, and set the project, and Amplify, aside. I came back to it recently and… The behavior still exists! This post exists to caution the reader about using AWS Amplify, especially with OpenSearch. That said, let’s jump into how you can rack up thousands of dollars of compute by just following the official guide. 1. Follow QuickstartPermalink The quickstart is pretty straightforward. You spin up a toy app, with code provided by AWS, that includes DB schema for TODO notes. Amplify creates a DynamoDB database as well as authenticated CRUD requests for you. You also get a nice login flow, and it intelligently only shows the right TODOs to the right users. You can run it locally, but Amplify also creates a domain that you can visit. Enjoy the cute formatted build status update: ✨ hotswapping resources: ✨ AWS::AppSync::ApiKey '******' ✨ AWS::AppSync::ApiKey '*******' hotswapped! ✅ amplify-amplifyvitereacttemplate-mymac-sandbox-xxxx ✨ Deployment time: 4.82s Here is what the webapp looks like: Webapp after quickstart 2. Follow Guide for OpenSearch SetupPermalink The next part I followed involves writing a bunch of Typescript boilerplate for the Amplify to declare your resources. You don’t need to commit this to memory, but here’s a quick overview: set DynamoDB table as a variable so we can reference it elsewhere and use it in the pipeline create an OpenSearch instance, index, and indexMapping (where you declare the fields & their types) write a query to access the data living in OpenSearch create an OpenSearchIngestionService pipeline to copy from DDB -> OS All of this is written in Typescript/Javascript, and lives in your repo with the frontend code. The CLI command is npx ampx sandbox, which spins up the AWS services. It detects changes to your configuration, and automatically modifies the existing AWS services as needed. At this point, we have a DynamoDB database, one OpenSearch service, one OSIS pipeline, and various other things (like IAM roles). Warning: As an aside, this setup creates mid-price r5.large.search OpenSearch instances by default. Nowhere in the boilerplate code or guide is this mentioned. That will run you $134 per month at minimum. t3.small.search instance pricing r5.large.search instance pricing 3. Shut it Down for the DayPermalink Nice job, you are done with work for the day. You hit CTRL-C and stop your sandbox. It asks if you want to delete everything permanently. Not wanting to go over budget, you say “Y”. If you were a smarter cookie than me, you may double-check the AWS console. Is everything gone? DynamoDB is gone, but your OpenSearch domain is still there! 4. Spin it back upPermalink You come back in the morning and re-create your services. You need an OpenSearch instance, but npx ampx sandbox will create a new one. In fact, running npx ampx sandbox delete will not delete your original instance. You suddenly have two OpenSearch domains! Rinse and repeat a few times, and you will find yourself with multiple domains in the background, ticking up to thousands of dollars in dues to AWS. Two OpenSearch domains created for the same project Is This a Bug?Permalink I certainly think so, but it hasn’t been addressed since my customer support ticket with AWS. This seems like a huge footgun. There are a few old bug reports, but I did not find anything from less than a year ago. Perhaps the OpenSearch domain was correctly deleted in v1, but no longer in v2. Regardless, it’s now run through npx, not the Amplify CLI. In addition, I am also irked by the fact that the r5.large.search is the default machine type. In my opinion, there shouldn’t be a default at all, it should be a required field. The guide should default to r5.large.search so it’s more visible to the user. This default is not Amplify-specific, however, so I don’t blame the Amplify team. It’s part of the AWS CDK. ConclusionPermalink A certain section of readers will be quick to say, “you should understand what you are working on” or “you should double check pricing.” That is technically correct, but misses the point. It’s so difficult to be paranoid about every single technology you use. When using new technologies that promise to speed up the developer flow, I already expect them to be more expensive than bare metal, but I think this is beyond the pale. It’s again worth noting that AWS does have a “budget” console, and you can use this to receive alerts to warn if you are projected to go over budget. In fact, AWS required me to set up a budget before sending me credit for the unused OpenSearch domains. I’m not sure if Amazon doc writers expect you to double-check all this. It’s a complicated piece of technology at a complicated company, so I think it’s more likely an oversight than intended behavior. There is so much going on within the Amplify guide. Just within the OpenSearch section, it creates IAM accounts, an OpenSearch domain, an OSIS pipeline, a log group, and s3 storage. Because OpenSearch is often used for enterprise customers, I wonder if OpenSearch is considered “advanced,” and users of OS are expected to have a stronger understanding of the AWS ecosystem. I’ll admit that I myself am only using OpenSearch because it supports geo_point bounding-box queries, a subject that I don’t have a full understanding of. Perhaps there is a way to do these with a simpler product, and OpenSearch is overkill. Perhaps this relates to a larger problem: it’s difficult to figure out what you need when you start with conscious incompetence on the internet.

Hard spend limits might make sense for indie / SME focused cloud vendors though. reply traceroute66 7 hours agorootparent> Hard spend limits are an anti-feature for enterprise customers Yada yada yada, that's the same old excuse the cloud providers trot out. Now, forgive me for my clearly Nobel Prize winning levels of intellect when I point out the following... Number one: You would not have to turn on the hard spend limit if such functionality were to be provided. Number two: You could enable customers to set up hard limits IN CONJUNCTION WITH alerts and soft limits, i.e. hitting the hard limit would be the last resort. A bit like trains hitting the buffers at a station ... that is preferable to killing people at the end of the platform. The same with hard spend limits, hitting the limit is better than waking up in the morning to a $1m cloud bill. reply Terretta 5 hours agorootparentThere's no way to implement a hard limit without getting in the middle of your system in ways that (a) alter the system design, (b) in ways you cannot correct for, and (c) not for the better. reply traceroute66 53 minutes agorootparent> There's no way to implement a hard limit without ... I don't believe that for a minute. You know why ? Let's turn it on its head. What happens if the credit card on your AWS account expires or is frozen ? You think AWS are going to continue letting you rack up money with no card to charge against ? I betcha they'll freeze your AWS assets the nanosecond they can't get a charge against the card. The mechanism for customer-defined hard limits is basically no different. reply fallingsquirrel 4 hours agorootparentprevOf course there is. If someone hits their spending limit, asynchronously shut off the services (using the same API call that your customers can use, so no need to alter the system). Then apply the hard limit in the billing code. If it took a minute or two to shut off all the instances, maybe the customer's bill should have been $1.001M instead of $1M, but cap the bill to $1M anyway. Given their profit margins of x,000% I think they can afford the lost pennies. reply sigseg1v 4 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience every AWS service I've worked with has an API to destroy the resource, eg destroy RDS instance without backup, terminate EC2, etc. I want it to irrecoverably destroy everything in my account when it hits the limit, no questions asked. reply tw04 8 hours agorootparentprev> Hard spend limits are an anti-feature for enterprise customers, who are the core customer of AWS.

That feels like a bit of a red herring — if that was their ethos, then you'd _have_ to choose burstable/autoscaling config on every service. If I can configure a service to fall over rather than scale at a hard limit, that points to them understanding different their use cases (prod vs dev) and customer types (start-up vs enterprise). Additionally, anytime I've worked for an enterprise customer, they've had a master service agreement set-up with AWS professional services rather than entering credit card info, so they could use that as a simple way to offer choices. reply Terretta 5 hours agorootparentA service doesn't just \"fall over\" at a limit. There has to be other machinery to limit it. Given that all your usage and traffic other than that at the limit request should not be gated or limited, why would you want someone else injecting additional complexity and bottleneck risk inline? Determine your own graceful envelope, implement accordingly. reply another-dave 5 hours agorootparentThe OP was saying that having any spending limit would be antithetical to enterprise usage because it could bring critical services to a halt.

With 16 vCP, 64GB ram, 360 GB SSD. That's crazy, I didn't realize there's such a huge difference. I think your comment is actually impressively valuable to me... I'm going to bring it all over during the weekend. That's really exciting to find out much cheaper prices, because I've had disk space running out constantly on my DO. I do all my docker builds, files, databases and everything there as well. And for side projects I usually value all the cache and development speed as opposed to trying to optimize everything to take min performance and storage. Also I spend way too much on Supabase. I think also $300+/month and increasing, I will bring that over and self host with a large SSD. I think at this point I prefer self hosting a postgres anyway to Supabase.

Sort of related, another wishlist feature I have is a way to start an EC2 instance with a deadline up front, and have the machine automatically suspended or terminated if it exceeds the deadline. I have some programs that start an EC2 instance, do some work, and shut it down (e.g. AMI building), and I would sleep a tiny bit better at night if AWS could deadline the instance as a backstop in case my script unexpectedly died before it could. > Also you have variable costs (like s3 traffic) Yeah, that's what I mean by it wouldn't solve the problem of usage-based billing. There they could just cut you off, and I think that's the bargain that people who want hard caps are asking for (there is always a spend cap at which I'd assume something had gone horribly wrong and would rather not keep spending), but I agree that the lack of real-time billing data is probably what stops them there. reply Aeolun 8 hours agorootparentprevThey can shut it down where it makes sense and keep racking up charges for storage.

I've heard all the excuses — they all suck. Businesses with lawyers and stuff can afford to negotiate with AWS etc. when things go wrong.

But if they don't choose to provide spending controls of their own accord, I'll continue to call them out for being grossly irresponsible, because they are. reply benterix 8 hours agorootparentprevPeople kept up bringing this argument since the very beginning when people already asked for this feature. This used to be the most upvoted request on AWS forums with AWS officially acknowledging (back in 2007 IIRC), \"We know it's important for you and are working on it\". But they made a decision not to implement it. The details don't matter, really. For those who decide to set up a hard cap and agree to its terms, there could be a grace period or not. In the end, all instances would be shut down and all data lost, just like in traditional services when you haven't paid your bill so you are no longer entitled to them, pure and simple. They haven't implemented and never will because Amazon is a company that is obsessed with optimization. There is negative motivation to implement anything related to that. reply Aeolun 7 hours agorootparentThat, and AWS just doesn’t really care for people with a spending limit as their customers, which is entirely reasonable.

There was an error (on my side) preventing the service from starting up, but cloud waatch only had logs about 20% of the time, so I had to redeploy five times just to get some logs, make changes, redeploy five more times, etc. They charged me for every single failed deploy. After about two days of struggling and a $100 bill, I said fuck it, deleted my account and deployed to DigitalOcean’s app platform instead, where it also failed to deploy (the error was with my app), but I had logs, every time.

I think technically I was just being charged for the container host machine, but while each individual deploy only lasted a minute or so, I was being charged the minimum each time.

So I can understand why, but it doesn't change that if their logging hadn't been so flaky, I should have been able to fix the issue in minutes with minimal cost, like I did on Digital Ocean.

It’s been a few years so my memory is hazy, but isn’t Fargate just a special case of ECS where they handle the host machines for you? In any case, the problem wasn’t so much ECS or Fargate, beyond the complexity of their UI and config, but rather that Cloudwatch was flaky. The problem that prevented the deployment was in my end, some issue preventing the health check from succeeding or something like that, so the container never came up healthy when deployed (it worked locally). The issue is that AWS didn’t help me figure out what the problem was and Cloudwatch didn’t show any logs about 80% of the time. I literally clicked deploy, waited for the deploy to fail, refresh Cloudwatch, saw no logs, click deploy, repeat until logs. It took about five attempts to see logs. Every single time I made a change (it wasn’t clear the error was on my end so it was quite a frustrating process). On digital ocean, the logs were shown correctly every single time and I was able to determine the problem was on my end after a few attempts, add the required extra logging to track it down, fix it, and get a working deployment in under ten minutes. reply davedx 11 hours agoprevThis seems like a glaring bug in the scripts run by that `npx` command.

Stay away from the \"wrapper\" services. AWS Amplify, or Cloudformation, or any of their Stack type offerings. Use the core services directly yourself. All services have an API. Getting an API key tied to an IAM user is as simple as clicking a button. Everything else is manageable with reasonable caching and ensuring that your cost model is matched to your revenue model so the services that auto scale cost a nearly fixed percentage of your revenue regardless of current demand. We take seasonal loads without even noticing most years. Bandwidth is the only real nightmare on AWS, but they offer automatic long term discounts through the console, and slightly better contract discounts through a sales rep. Avoid EC2 for this reason and because internal bandwidth is more expensive from EC2 and favor direct use of Lambda + S3 + CloudFront.

Even when I tried to add a different card from Revolut, which is a prepaid card, I received a message stating that such cards are not accepted and that it has to be an actual CREDIT card. reply antonhag 8 hours agoprevAWS has good base building blocks (ALB, EC2, Fargate, RDS, IAM etc). But it takes knowledge to put the pieces together. Thus AWS tries to create services/tools that orchestrate the base blocks (Amplify, Beanstalk) for you, which in my experience always becomes a mess where you don't actually understand what you are running in your cloud setup. I'd recommend either learning the basic building blocks (these skills also transfers well to other clouds and self hosting) or using a higher level service provider than AWS (Vercel etc) - they do it better than AWS. reply userbinator 9 hours agoprevWarning: As an aside, this setup creates mid-price r5.large.search OpenSearch instances by default. Nowhere in the boilerplate code or guide is this mentioned. That will run you $134 per month at minimum. A good rule when working with any sort of cloud service: Everything that can be charged for, will be. There are plenty of stories of people getting charged massively, and one may wonder whether this has any negative effects on them getting new customers. Unfortunately it's usually not the ones working with it who are the ones making the decision to use AWS or other cloud services, and the ones who are have their minds fully clouded by the propaganda --- I mean marketing. reply p0w3n3d 6 hours agoprevThe repeating problem with cloud is that it no longer stops my bad code by OOM, rather the sky is the limit for both the memory and the cost. I heard funny story about people who bought badly written code which was constantly going up through the roof with resources. They got angry with my friend, told him the software is not bad, but the hosting is (software was bought with hardware from the manufacturer) and migrated to cloud, only to meet the hard iron hammer of karma (which in this case was embodied by high bill) Also in my opinion billing is the new perf test but post factum and obscure, i.e. it is super easy to miss some key points in the development and then wake up with the costs falling down the responsibility sink (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41891694) reply krelian 9 hours agoprevCloud computing is ridiculously expensive.

It's better business to have people beg for mercy and then magnanimously waive fee than to have any discussion about actual hard limits (which would be used by big corps too not just students). Yes it can be done technically - Azure already has a not loudly advertised account type that is hardcapped. And no billing alerts aren't a solution. Hell you could even do opt-in \"yes I understand my data will be deleted\" hardcaps. This is a fixable problem - they just don't want to because a fix would be bad for earnings. reply Aeolun 8 hours agoprevI think anyone doing anything with anything AWS amplify will get burned sooner or later.

On the one hand I get that if your business depends on such a service you don't want it to suddenly go down. But on the other hand there is almost never a hard mechanism to limit your risk. Or if there is, it is opt-in.

Or your disk fills up from log file spam, it gets 'backed up', you get charged for it. Or a program is caught in a loop and uses limited CPU usage. I think its all hiding the fact that people don't want to take the time to design (and maintain) scalable infrastructure and instead rely on fake abstractions that pretend to be infinite, always-available, magic, or w/e. I'm sure there is some open source software that helps here. reply ionwake 5 hours agoprevI remember checking with and calling an amazon rep on the phone - he assured me I could use one of the \"heavier\" graphic card instances and would only be charged per minute usage at the rates shown. I ran it for 1 minute expecting to be paying the $5 or whatever it was per minute and was charged around $100 for it to \"boot up\". Cancelled it. Never trusted amazon billing again = ( Bezos keeps waxing lyrical in all his interviews on how he \"tests\" his company services by calling them on the phone to make sure the SLAs or whatever are accurate. But they aren't. TBH I was kind of confused how proud he was that it took 10 mins to get through to someone on the phone instead of 1 minute or something, on how they noticed it and had to \"rearrange\" things. Like wtf, I would have fired ALL of my executive below me if such an egregious false advertising existed. It can't be that bloody hard as one of the richest people on the planet to just pay some dude $5 an hour to make sure services are billed as expected, run as expected. I am sorry to complain, I know they have all done great jobs, but it makes me wonder whether I would be \"out of touch\" if I was ever in a C-suite role. From what I see around me, I definately would be. But maybe those margins don't matter? I honestly am confused after decades in IT why management is never held responsible. If I ran a company mgmt would be the FIRST to be fired if there were any issues. I swear I read a comment on HN once from a manager saying why should they be held responsible if there is a fuck up lower down the chain, I was like wtf, the whole point of being a manager is to be RESPONSIBLE. Management isnt a luxury \"earn the big bucks\" because Im better than everyone else, and thus should be protected. The easiest way to diagnose this as a CEO is to see how often MGMT have been let go at different tiers, and if there havent been any, well there must be a form of corruption / nepotism occuring. Been burnt as a \"small\" entrepeneur by all of the greats, Google ( shutting down my instance when it went viral because I decided to upgrade the hosting which for some unknown reason mean it had to be shutdown WITHOUT warning for 24 hours, possibly to transfer it or something god knows.

Eg. factor in underutilization but also refunds. For a flat rate, a price point at 70% of total value of included volume still is better bottom line if you set included volume high enough that the average usage is 50%, yet it still feels more generous and less risky from customer point of view. OTOH very granular unit pricing lets everyone underestimate total costs and complicates comparison with competing offers, „bread and butter“ product prices mask more uncommon ones, etc. In IT underutilization is high, also on own infra, that’s something cloud vendors (and hardware and software vendors) can rely on. Paying for it at least incentivizes to improve utilization, autoscaling is better, sometimes the cloud vendor does it for you, sometimes you have to donitnyourself. In IT laziness is rampant, time is often seen as more valuable than cash out. Also someting the vendors can rely on. I‘ve seen a howto for Azure for a scalable LLM API Gateway. It cost me almost 2 hours to get an estimate for min costs - with default values it would have cost almost 10k per month, I could size it down to less than 1k. A simple loadbalanced reverse proxy on vms cost less than 400. Be especially cautious when everyone is in a hurry. The pre-made solutions may try to cash in on that. Over all: Pricing and pricing models are part of the product properties you buy, and looking for and dealing with psychological pricing strategies and tactics is part of doing business. reply hereonout2 10 hours agorootparentprev [–] There's certainly wastage in large organisations. Over provisioning or keeping that huge S3 bucket full of data from some long forgotten project. I suspect a lot of the huge AWS customers just eat this because it's so hard to mitigate. If a business has hundreds of AWS accounts it becomes very hard to track, and if each account can only shave a few hundred dollars a month off their individual bill then there's very little impetus to actually do the work for the individual teams.

Happy to answer any questions! Here's a start -- \"Did you get poached by Anthropic/etc\": No, I am starting a new company with a friend. We will announce more about it in due time! \"Who uses Keras in production\": Off the top of my head the current list includes Midjourney, YouTube, Waymo, Google across many products (even Ads started moving to Keras recently!), Netflix, Spotify, Snap, GrubHub, Square/Block, X/Twitter, and many non-tech companies like United, JPM, Orange, Walmart, etc. In total Keras has ~2M developers and powers ML at many companies big and small. This isn't all TF -- many of our users have started running Keras on JAX or PyTorch. \"Why did you decide to merge Keras into TensorFlow in 2019\": I didn't! The decision was made in 2018 by the TF leads -- I was a L5 IC at the time and that was an L8 decision. The TF team was huge at the time, 50+ people, while Keras was just me and the open-source community. In retrospect I think Keras would have been better off as an independent multi-backend framework -- but that would have required me quitting Google back then. Making Keras multi-backend again in 2023 has been one of my favorite projects to work on, both from the engineering & architecture side of things but also because the product is truly great (also, I love JAX)! reply harisec 5 hours agoparentCongrats, good luck with your new company! I have one question regarding your ARC Prize competition: The current leader from the leaderboard (MindsAI) seems not to be following the original intention of the competition (fine tune a model with millions of tasks similar with the ARC tasks). IMO this is against the goal/intention of the competition, the goal being to find a novel way to get neural networks to generalize from a few samples. You can solve almost anything by brute-forcing it (fine tunning on millions of samples). If you agree with me, why is the MindsAI solution accepted? reply mFixman 7 hours agoparentprev> I was a L5 IC at the time Kudos to Google for hiring extremely competent people, but I'm surprised that the creator and main architect of Keras hadn't been promoted to Staff Engineer at minimum. reply toxik 5 hours agorootparentHierarchy aside, I am surprised the literal author and maintainer of the project, on Google’s payroll no less, was not consulted on such a decision.

My question isn't related directly to the big news, but to a lecture you gave recently https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_NlkBwdj8&ab_channel=Machi... At 20:45 you say \"So you cannot prepare in advance for ARC. You cannot just solve ARC by memorizing the solutions in advance.\" And at 24:45 \"There's a chance that you could achieve this score by purely memorizing patterns and reciting them.\" Isn't that a contradiction? The way I understand it on one hand you are saying ARC can't be memorized on the other you are saying it can? reply trott 10 hours agoparentprevCongrats, François, and good luck! Q: The ARC Prize blog mentions that you plan to make ARC harder for machines and easier for humans. I'm curious if it will be adapted to resist scaling the training dataset (Like what BARC did -- see my other comment here)? As it stands today, I feel like the easiest approach to solving it would be BARC x10 or so, rather than algorithmic inventions. reply fchollet 10 hours agorootparentRight, one rather uninteresting line of approaches to ARC consists of trying to anticipate what might be in the test set, by generating millions of synthetic tasks. This can only work on relatively simple tasks, since the chance of task collision (between the test set and what you generate) is very low for any sophisticated task. ARC 2 will improve on ARC 1 by making tasks less brute-forceable (both in the sense of making in harder to find the solution program by generating random programs built on a DSL, and in the sense of making it harder to guess the test tasks via brute force task generation). We'll keep the human facing difficulty roughly constant, which will be controlled via human testing. reply versteegen 8 hours agorootparentHi! As someone who spent the last month pouring myself into the ARC challenge (which has been lots of fun, thanks so much for creating it), I'm happy to see it made harder, but please make it harder by requiring more reasoning, not by requiring more human-like visual perception! ARC is almost perfect as a benchmark for analogical reasoning, except for the need for lots of image processing as well. [Edit: however, I've realised that perception is representation, so requiring it is a good thing.] Any plan for more validation data to match the new harder testset? reply Skylyz 4 hours agorootparentI had never thought about how close perception and reasoning are from a computational point of view, the parts of ARC that we call \"reasoning\" seem to just be operations that the human brain is not predisposed to solve easily. A very interesting corollary is that the first AGIs might be way better thinkers than humans by default because of how they can seamlessly integrate new programs into their cognition in a perfect symbiosis with computers. reply c1b 9 hours agoparentprevHi Francois, I'm a huge fan of your work! In projecting ARC challenge progress with a naive regression from the latest cycle of improvement (from 34% to 54%), it seems that a plausible estimate as to when the 85% target will be reached is sometime between late 2025 & mid 2026. Supposing ARC challenge target is reached in the coming years, does this update your model of 'AI risk'? // Would this cause you to consider your article on 'The implausibility of intelligence explosion' to be outdated? reply fchollet 9 hours agorootparentThis roughly aligns with my timeline. ARC will be solved within a couple of years. There is a distinction between solving ARC, creating AGI, and creating an AI that would represent an existential risk. ARC is a stepping stone towards AGI, so the first model that solves ARC should have taught us something fundamental about how to create truly general intelligence that can adapt to never-seen-before problem, but it will likely not itself be AGI (due to be specialized in the ARC format, for instance). Its architecture could likely be adapted into a genuine AGI, after a few iterations -- a system capable of solving novel scientific problems in any domain. Even this would not clearly lead to \"intelligence explosion\". The points in my old article on intelligence explosion are still valid -- while AGI will lead to some level of recursive self-improvement (as do many other systems!) the available evidence just does not point to this loop triggering an exponential explosion (due to diminishing returns and the fact that \"how intelligent one can be\" has inherent limitations brought about by things outside of the AI agent itself). And intelligence on its own, without executive autonomy or embodiment, is just a tool in human hands, not a standalone threat. It can certainly present risks, like any other powerful technology, but it isn't a \"new species\" out to get us. reply YeGoblynQueenne 1 hour agorootparentARC as a stepping-stone for AGI? For me, ARC has lost all credibility. Your white paper that introduced it claimed that core knowledge priors are needed to solve it, yet all the systems that have any non-zero performance on ARC so far have made no attempt to learn or implement core knowledge priors. You have claimed at different times and in different forms that ARC is protected against memorisation-based Big Data approaches, but the systems that currently perform best on ARC do it by generating thousands of new training examples for some LLM, the quintessential memorisation-based Big Data approach. I too, believe that ARC will soon be solved: in the same way that the Winograd Schema Challenge was solved. Someone will finally decide to generate a large enough dataset to fine-tune a big, deep, bad LLM and go to town, and I do mean on the private test set. If ARC was really, really a test of intelligence and therefore protected against Big Data approaches, then it wouldn't need to have a super secret hidden test set. Bongard Problems don't and they still stand undefeated (although the ANN community has sidestepped them in a sense, by generating and solving similar, but not identical, sets of problems, then claiming triumph anyway). ARC will be solved and we won't learn anything at all from it, except that we still don't know how to test for intelligence, let alone artificial intelligence. The worst outcome of all this is the collateral damage to the reputation of symbolic program synthesis which you have often name-dropped when trying to steer the efforts of the community towards it (other times calling it \"discrete program search\" etc). Once some big, compensating, LLM solves ARC, any mention of program synthesis will elicit nothing but sneers. \"Program synthesis? Isn't that what Chollet thought would solve ARC? Well, we don't need that, LLMs can solve ARC just fine\". Talk about sucking out all the air from the room, indeed. reply cowsaymoo 8 hours agoparentprevI’m really going through it, trying to get legacy Theano and TensorFlow 1.x models from 2016 running on modern GPUs due to compatibility headaches due to OS, NVIDIA CUDA, CuDNN, drivers, docker, python, and package/image hubs all contributing their own roadblocks to actually coding. Ideally we would abandon this code, but we kind of need it running if we want to thoroughly understand our new model's performance on unseen old data, and/or understand Kappa scores between models. Will the move towards freeing Keras from TF again potentially reintroduce version chaos, or will it future proof it from that? Do you see a potential for something like this to once again befall tomorrow's legacy code relying on TF 1.x and 2.x? reply fchollet 8 hours agorootparentKeras is now standalone and multi-backend again. Keras weights files from older versions are still loadable and Keras code from older versions are still runnable (on any backend as long as they only used Keras APIs)! In general the ability to move across backends makes your code much longer-lived: you can take your Keras models with you (on a new backend) after something like TF or PyTorch stops development. Also, it reduces version compatibility issues, since tf.keras 2.n could only work with TF 2.n, but each Keras 3 version can work with a wide range of older and newer TF versions. reply dkga 10 hours agoparentprevHi François, just wanted to take the opportunity to tell you how much your work has been important for me. Both at the start, getting into deep learning (both keras and the book) and now with keras3 as I'm working to spread DL techniques in economics. The multi-backend is really a massive boon, as it also helps ensure that the API would remain both standardised and simple, which is very helpful to evangelise new users that are used to higher-level scripting languages as my crowd is. In any case, I just want to say how much an inspiration the keras work has been and continues to be. Merci, François ! reply fchollet 10 hours agorootparentThanks for the kind words -- glad Keras has been useful! reply fransje26 8 hours agoparentprevFrom one François to an other, thank you for you work, and all the best with your next endeavor!

There you go as far as having scrum teams with developers, alongside that one or more architect, and \"above\" that a CTO. Conversely, companies like Google have tens of thousands of people in IT alone. But likewise, since we're fans of equality in my country, there's no emphasis on career ladders / progression; you're a developer, maybe a lead developer or architect, and then you get to management, with the only distinguishing factor being your years of experience, length of your CV, and pay grade. Pay grade is \"simply\" bumped up every year based on performance of both you personally and the company as a whole.

It dominates because this is the appropriate way to manage hundreds of thousands of people in a impersonal, rule based and meritocratic way. Third world countries work the other way around, they don't have professional bureaucracies, they only have clans and families. It's not ossified but efficient. If a company like Google with about ~180.000 employees were to make decisions by everyone talking to everyone else you can try to do the math on what the complexity of that is. reply dbspin 8 hours agorootparentBureaucracies are certainly impersonal, but you'd be at a loss to find one that's genuinely rule based and meritocratic. To the extent that they become remain rule based they are no longer effective and get routed around. To the extent that they're meritocratic, the same thing happens with networks of influence. Once you get high enough, or decentralised enough bureaucracies work like any other human tribes.

The fact that management consultancies are making (in perpetuity) a plush living by helping reduce \"middle management layers\" tells you explicitly that the beast has a life of its own. Empire building and vicious internal politics that are disconnected from any sense of \"efficiency\" are pretty much part of \"professional bureaucracies\" - just as they are of the public sector ones. And whether we are clients, users or citizens we pay the price. reply Barrin92 8 hours agorootparent>These are just assertions. Efficient compared to what? Compared to numerous small companies of the aggregate same size. It's not just an assertion, Google (and other big companies) produces incredibly high rates of value per employee and goods at extremely low costs to consumers. >Why should an organization even have 180000 employees? What determines the distribution of size of organizational units observed in an economy? Coase told us the answer to this[1]. Organizations are going to be as large as they can possibly be until the internal cost of organization is larger than the external costs of transaction with other organizations. How large that is depends on the tools available to organize and the quality of organization, but tends larger over time because management techniques and information sharing tools become more sophisticated. The reason why large organizations are efficient is obvious if you turn it on its head. If we were all single individual organizations billing each other invoices we'd have maximum transaction costs and overhead. Bureaucracy and hierarchies minimize this overhead by turning it into a dedicated disciplines and rationalize that process. A city of 5 million people, centrally administered produces more economic value than a thousand villages with the same aggregate population.

Hierarchy of some form is innate to human organization, this is not the point. The alternative to a large organization with a sky-high hierarchy is not an inefficient solopreneur but a smaller organization with (possibly) a flater hierarchy. Even strictly within the Coase logic the \"external cost\" can be artificially low (non-priced externalities [1]), ranging from the mental health of employees, to the impact of oligopolistic markets on society's welfare etc. This creates an unusually generous buffer for \"internal costs\".

I'd say that large bureaucracies are endemic to the public sector in large part because they can't use efficient price or profit mechanisms. A firm doesn't typically operate like a market internally, but instead it operates like a command economy. Orders flow from the top to be implemented at lower levels, feedback goes the other way, and divisions should generally be more collaborative than competitive. Bureaucracy manages that command economy, and some amount of it is inevitable. However, inevitability does not mean infallibility, and bureaucracies in general are prone to process orientation, empire-building, and status-based backstabbing. > ranging from the mental health of employees Nitpick: I think that disregard of employee mental health is bad, but I don't think it's an unpriced externality. Employees are aware of their own mental health and can factor it into their internal compensation/quality-of-life tradeoff, staying in the job only when the salary covers the stress. reply robertlagrant 5 hours agorootparentI agree with all of that.

In retrospect I think Keras would have been better off as an independent multi-backend framework -- but that would have required me quitting Google back then. The fact that an \"L8\" at Google ranks above an OSS maintainer of a super-popular library \"L5\" is incredibly interesting. How are these levels determined?

L8s generally have massive systems design experience and decades of software engineering experience at all levels of scale. They make decisions at Google which can have impacts on the workflows of 100s of engineers on products with 100millions/billions of users. There are less L8s than there are technical VPs (excluding all the random biz side VP roles) L5 here designates that they were a tenured (but not designated Senior) software engineer. It doesn't meant they don't have a voice in these discussions (very likely an L8 reached out to learn more about the issue, the options, and ideally considered Francois's role and expertise before making a decision), it just means its above their pay grade. I'll let Francois provide more detail on the exact situation. reply fchollet 10 hours agorootparentprevThis is just the standard Google ladder. Your initial level when you join is based on your past experience. Then you gain levels by going through the infamous promo process. L8 represents the level of Director. Yes, there are conflicts of interests inherent to the fact that OSS maintainers are usually employed by big tech companies (since OSS itself doesn't make money). And it is often the case that big tech companies leverage their involvement in OSS development to further their own strategic interests and undermine their competitors, such as in the case of Meta, or to a lesser extent Google. But without the involvement of big tech companies, you would see a lot less open-source in the world. So you can view it as a trade off. reply lrpahg 10 hours agorootparentprev> How are these levels determined?

Keras is designed around the principle of \"progressive disclosure of complexity\": there are easy high-level workflows you can get started with, but you're always able to open up any component of the workflow and customize it with your own code. For instance: you have the built-in `fit()` to train a model. But you can customize the training logic (while retaining access to all `fit()` features, like callbacks, step fusion, async logging and async prefetching, distribution) by writing your own `compute_loss()` method. And further, you can customize gradient handling by writing a custom `train_step()` method (this is low-level enough that you have to do it with backend APIs like `tf.GradientTape` or torch `backward()`). E.g. https://keras.io/guides/custom_train_step_in_torch/ Then, if you need even more control, you can just write your own training loop from scratch, etc. E.g. https://keras.io/guides/writing_a_custom_training_loop_in_ja... reply rd11235 15 hours agoparentprev> it was just the wrong abstraction: too easy to start with, too difficult to create custom things Couldn’t agree with this more.

Maybe he figured out a model that beats ARC-AGI by 85%? reply trott 18 hours agoparent> Maybe he figured out a model that beats ARC-AGI by 85%? People have, I think. One of the published approaches (BARC) uses GPT-4o to generate a lot more training data. The approach is scaling really well so far [1], and whether you expect linear scaling or exponential one [2], the 85% threshold can be reached, using the \"transduction\" model alone, after generating under 2 million tasks ($20K in OpenAI credits). Perhaps for 2025, the organizers will redesign ARC-AGI to be more resistant to this sort of approach, somehow. --- [1] https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2024/discussio... [2] If you are \"throwing darts at a board\", you get exponential scaling (the probability of not hitting bullseye at least once reduces exponentially with the number of throws). If you deliberately design your synthetic dataset to be non-redundant, you might get something akin to linear scaling (until you hit perfect accuracy, of course). reply fastball 17 hours agorootparentI like the idea of ARC-AGI and think it was worth a shot. But if someone has already hit the human-level threshold, I think the entire idea can be thrown out. If the ARC-AGI challenge did not actually follow their expected graph[1], I see no reason to believe that any benchmark can be designed in a way where it cannot be gamed. Rather, it seems that the existing SOTA models just weren't well-optimized for that one task. The only way to measure \"AGI\" is in however you define the \"G\". If your model can only do one thing, it is not AGI and doesn't really indicate you are closer, even if you very carefully designed your challenge. [1] https://static.supernotes.app/ai-benchmarks-2.png reply trott 17 hours agorootparent> But if someone has already hit the human-level threshold There is some controversy over what the human-level threshold is. A recent and very extensive study measured just 60.2% using Amazon Mechanical Turkers, for the same setup [1]. But the Turkers had no prior experience with the dataset, and were only given 5 tasks each. Regardless, I believe ARC-AGI should aim for a higher threshold than what average humans achieve, because the ultimate goal of AGI is to supplement or replace high-IQ experts (who tend to do very well on ARC) --- [1] Table 1 in https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01374 2-shot Evaluation Set reply aithrowawaycomm 3 hours agorootparentIt is scientific malpractice to use Mechanical Turk to establish a human-level baseline for cognitively-demanding tasks, even if you ignore the issue of people outsourcing tasks to ChatGPT. The pay is abysmal and if it seems like the task is purely academic and hence part of a study, there is almost no incentive to put in effort: researchers won't deny payment for a bad answer. Since you get paid either way, there is a strong incentive to quickly give up thinking about a tricky ARC problem and simply guess a solution. (IQ tests in general have this problem: cynicism and laziness are indistinguishable from actual mistakes.) Note that across all MTurk workers, 790/800 of evaluation tasks were successfully completed. I think 98% is actually a better number for human performance than 60%, as a proxy for \"how well would a single human of above-average intelligence perform if they put maximal effort into each question?\" It is an overestimate, but 60% is a vast underestimate. reply nl 17 hours agorootparentprev> The only way to measure \"AGI\" is in however you define the \"G\" \"I\" isn't usefully defined either. At least most people agree on \"Artificial\" reply echelon 14 hours agorootparentThat's the problem with intelligence vs the other things we're doing with deep learning. Vision models, image models, video models, audio models? Solved. We've understood the physics of optics and audio for over half a century. We've had ray tracers for forever. It's all well understood, and now we're teaching models to understand it. Intelligence? We can't even describe our own. reply TheDudeMan 17 hours agorootparentprevWhat you're calling \"gamed\" could actually be research and progress in general problem solving. reply fastball 16 hours agorootparentAlmost by definition it is not. If you are \"gaming\" a specific benchmark, what you have is not progress in general intelligence. The entire premise of the ARC-AGI challenge was that general problem solving would be required. As noted by the GP, one of the top contenders is BARC which performs well by generating a huge amount of training data for this particular problem. That's not general intelligence, that's gaming. There is no reason to believe that technique would not work for any particular problem. After all, this problem was the best attempt the (very intelligent) challenge designers could come up with, as evidenced by putting $1m on the line. reply trott 16 hours agorootparent> That's not general intelligence, that's gaming. In fairness, their approach is non-trivial. Simply asking GPT-4o to fantasize more examples wouldn't have worked very well. Instead, they have it fantasize inputs and programs, and then run the programs on the inputs to compute the outputs. I think it's a great contribution (although I'm surprised they didn't try making an even bigger dataset -- perhaps they ran out of time or funding) reply thrw42A8N 18 hours agorootparentprev> If you are \"throwing darts at a board\", you get exponential scaling (the probability of not hitting bullseye reduces exponentially with the number of throws). Honest question - is that so, and why?

I added a clarification. reply TechDebtDevin 16 hours agorootparentprevI personally think ARC-AGI will be a forgotten, unimportant benchmark that doesn't indicate anything more than a models ability reason, which honestly is just a very small step in the path towards AGI reply mxwsn 16 hours agorootparentprevMy interest was piqued, but the extrapolation in [1] is uh... not the most convincing.

Enter Ghost Jobs Authors:Hunter Ng View PDF Abstract:This study investigates the emerging phenomenon of \"ghost hiring\" or \"ghost jobs\", where employers advertise job openings without intending to fill them. Using a novel dataset from Glassdoor and employing a LLM-BERT technique, I find that up to 21% of job ads may be ghost jobs, and this is particularly prevalent in specialized industries and in larger firms. The trend could be due to the low marginal cost of posting additional job ads and to maintain a pipeline of talents. After adjusting for yearly trends, I find that ghost jobs can explain the recent disconnect in the Beveridge Curve in the past fifteen years. The results show that policy-makers should be aware of such a practice as it causes significant job fatigue and distorts market signals.

Enter Ghost Jobs (arxiv.org)334 points by JSeymourATL 4 hours agohidepastfavorite432 comments bradley13 3 hours agoI once applied for a job that precisely matched my qualifications. It was crazy - the job description could have been written by someone looking at my CV. I didn't even get an interview. Likely no one did. It wasn't a ghost job, though. It was a position created for a someone they wanted to hire. Being a public institution, they were required to advertise positions. That didn't mean that they actually wanted any of the candidates who applied. reply goochphd 3 hours agoparentI once applied to a position like this. It was eerily similar to my background, and when I did a little digging I found that the group lead had even directly cited my research papers in his own research work. I applied on the site, reached out on LinkedIn to the group lead and the recruiter, and even was able to find emails for those two, which I also messaged as well. They didn't even bother to send me an automated rejection notice. There was nothing at all, no responses to any messages, no email, nothing. I have to assume that position was posted with someone already in mind that they wanted to hire. reply endtime 2 hours agorootparentWhen I last changed jobs, I started looking at the end of 2021. I was a staff SWE at Google, MS CS from Stanford, etc. - a good resume. I also found myself applying into a black hole. But when I used second degree connections to get someone at the company to acknowledge I existed, everything started moving, and I ended up with great offers from both the companies I had applied in.

The ATS doesn't kick out your resume automatically, it just fails to include you in the 25 top candidates that get forwarded on to the hiring manager.

Most large corps have higher total comp compared to smaller corps. reply georgeecollins 8 minutes agorootparentMaybe, I don't really have data on that but there's a huge range for both. I would say, think about your career, its growth and longevity. Posters on HN have pointed out some large companies that have a habit of laying people off before they fully vest. And there is the whole challenge of getting meaningful responsibility in a large organization. Everyone thinks when they are starting out that they are going to march up the organizational ladder. Everything I am saying is anecdote, not data, but I have seen people propel themselves up into large organizations by being entrepreneurs. I think of a friend who worked for a bit for a large company, had a start up with mixed results, and then went back to another large company as an SVP. I don't know if that person would have gotten their marching through the ranks. bangaroo 1 hour agorootparentprevi'm a hiring manager for engineers and have worked with tons of ATSes and have yet to work with a system that does this. i'm not saying it isn't real, but even as a director with fairly privileged access to the hiring pipeline and near-administrative access to the ATS at a public company with tons of applicants, i've never even seen an option for this sort of thing. the ATS will tag candidates who meet certain key requirements or highlight them, but for the most part it's just a big messy list of people that someone has to filter through. humans are super bad at eliminating their biases and there's a sense that the top of the hiring funnel is mostly noise and unqualified folks, so i think the much more mundane reality is that until you make it past the first (very arbitrary) screen you don't get that much consideration as a candidate. when i'm helping recruiting make a dent in inbound applications, i'd say charitably i spend 5 minutes per application on initial screen (to clear a backlog of sometimes hundreds.) i try my best to be aware of my biases, but that's almost no time for absorbing someone's entire career, trying to find correlations between their accomplishments and the role, sussing out red flags and then making a decision as to whether their application is worth investing potentially hours of time on in next steps. a couple other things that play into this: - i've never worked at a company that didn't believe they'd hired so well that they were truly one of the stand-out, high performing teams that could afford to be picky, and \"as good as us\" often isn't good enough when the mandate is to \"constantly raise the bar.\" obviously this is delusional but it's pervasive in corporate culture. - right now in particular, the terrible market combined with the intricacy of AI-generated applications for candidates that don't exist (this is the most bizarre trend I've experienced thus far - candidates with personal websites, githubs that are just forks of public repos, and extensive and impressive resumes at major companies who do not exist and when brought onto interview calls will not turn on their cameras and speak with a weird delay as if they're asking ChatGPT for answers) really means that the zone is utterly flooded with garbage. the mental fatigue on resume 50 of 400 is substantial, let alone on one deeper in the pile. you're reading document after document that's nearly identical, trying to figure out which ones are worth pushing forward. ultimately i think the task is so herculean that most folks, whether they admit it or not, wind up responding most directly to folks whose backgrounds they personally relate to, or who manage to demonstrate the right amount of personality that makes you go \"huh, i think we should talk to them a little more.\" i present this all as a known problem, and i'm not trying to diminish the frustration of job hunters by saying \"oh it's bad on the other side, too\" because i absolutely know how much the experience of job hunting sucks and don't wish it on anyone. i just think that in the absence of people being willing to admit how haphazard and human-driven the whole process is, conspiracy theories about AI rejections and ChatGPT reviewing resumes en masse run amok. reply thecosas 3 minutes agorootparentFirst, thanks so much for sharing your experience on the HR/hiring side! I recall in the multiple post-pandemic layoffs (especially in tech industry) that hiring teams were some of the first to be gutted. Made sense on a practical level since, at least in theory, layoffs > fewer job openings > fewer applicants to go through > less people needed to go through them. However, I'm sure that's also led to more people applying for the fewer job openings that are available. Does that seem like an accurate read? Maybe a contributing factor to lack of communication, even if it's simply a templated decline? reply cj 14 minutes agorootparentprev> right now in particular, the terrible market combined with the intricacy of AI-generated applications for candidates that don't exist (this is the most bizarre trend I've experienced thus far This is a major problem and isn't widely talked about because it's only seen by HR and hiring managers.

I offered 4 day work week, no on-call, no overtime, but paid less than their previous employer (because I couldn't afford it). I am sure lots of people value things besides salary. reply Dylan16807 1 hour agorootparentChanging the work hours doesn't technically affect \"salary\" but it's a change in wages. I think your example mostly reinforces the point, but we should be using the word \"wages\" to be clearer. reply nonameiguess 10 minutes agorootparentprevMaybe software-adjacent people applying to startups, but in general, this obviously can't be true. Relatively low-paying but high-status jobs, like FBI agent, military officer, elected official, judge wouldn't exist, nor low-paying passion work like social worker, wildlife conservation, most non-profits, low-paying jobs that are simply fun like most musicians, pro athletes in unpopular sports. Plenty of capable, talented people who could be making more money choose not to. reply Sohcahtoa82 30 minutes agorootparentprevI mean, that's not entirely true. Mostly true, yes. A monthly pizza and beer party won't make up for lack of salary, but extra PTO that I can use can. Like...if I had the choice of a job that offered $200K/year but only 2 weeks PTO, and another offered only $185K but 5 weeks PTO, I'd take the latter. Honestly I'd love a company that gave 4 weeks PTO with the option to take up to another 4 weeks unpaid. reply schmidtleonard 1 hour agorootparentprevThat's only 99% true, but the 1% of exceptions will get an egregiously disproportionate amount of attention and concern. reply saas_sam 1 hour agorootparentprevIf you people only valued salary you'd all be in sales :) reply marssaxman 52 minutes agorootparentprevAre you serious?

Because there were only 148,603 [1]. Notice that even though Republicans talked about immigration, neither party is talking about reducing H1-B filled roles. The kicker is if you’ve had a gap doing your own thing or because you were laid off and you apply for a job at a discount salary, you’re still not competitive against an H1-B worker because employers know you’d be able to trade up once you’ve been working for a few months. [1] https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/h1b-visa... reply returningfory2 2 hours agorootparentThese numbers probably don't mean what you think they mean. Certainly, the number of H-1B holders in 2021 and 2023 is about the same. An \"admittance\" is someone with a H-1B visa appearing a port of entry like an airport to enter the US. If a single H-1B holder goes on (say) 3 international trips in 1 year, that will count as 3 \"admittances\" in that year. The reason why the number is so low in 2021 is that the US government had a COVID non-immigrant travel ban. People with H-1B visas couldn't re-enter the US from many countries e.g. most countries in Europe. Many people in H-1B status (like myself) simply didn't take international trips that year. reply jameson 2 hours agorootparentGreat point. The H-1B receipts total[1] is probably what most are looking for 2020: 427,200 2021: 398,300 2022: 474,300 2023: 386,600 [1] https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/reports/f... reply returningfory2 1 hour agorootparentYes! Great find. (Although, even these statistics are not as simple as they seem! E.g., when an H-1B status holder changes employer this counts as a new receipt even though the number of H-1B workers hasn't changed. In periods of time when there is lots of churn in the labor market, like in 2022, you would see higher receipt numbers just from the churn. It's complicated!) reply doctorpangloss 2 hours agorootparentprevBut if I bothered to look up what the words mean about complex administrative questions, I forfeit my right to be outraged! reply e1g 2 hours agorootparentprevBy law, the number of H1B visas issued per year is capped at 80k, and that's how many have been issued every year for the last twenty years. \"Admittance rates\" measure how many H1B people travel internationally and then return to the USA. Unsurprisingly, in 2023, more people traveled internationally than in 2021, when almost all countries closed their borders. reply HarHarVeryFunny 29 minutes agorootparentprevRight, and while the fraudulent H1-B hires (taking jobs where there are qualified unemployed Americans who would like them) are taking jobs from Americans, the illegal immigrants, about to be deported, are not (even if we taxpayers are paying $500/night to put them up in NYC hotels etc). I don't think Trump give a crap about helping American workers, anymore than his buddy Elon does - the anti-immigrant thing was just that. reply ChumpGPT 2 hours agorootparentprevIndia is exporting its poverty to the entire world.

How is it hard to fire someone? I live in Austria and you can fire people for pretty much any reason. You have to give them 6 weeks notice, and there are some extra protections for people who are old or who have disabilities and who have been working for your company for a long time, but even then you can fire them. You can even fire people for getting sick a lot. And that's assuming you directly hire them as employees in the first place. Many people work via agencies or as contractors, and they have practically zero protections. reply throwaway2037 23 minutes agorootparentWow, I am genuinely shocked by this post. I had no idea. Honestly, I assumed that most central European countries have reasonably strong labour laws that make it difficult to fire employees. Let us assume that your post is (mostly) true. How does Austria have such a large, robust, stable middle class without strong labour protections, or a wide/deep social safety net?

Bureau of Labor Statistics puts out average market rates for each job category and the H1B sponsor has to match or pay above that to get the H1B application approved. I was also checking out my market rates (i.e., applying for other companies that allows H1B transfer) constantly during my H1B time because I can move to another job if my current company was paying me lower than average wages. On the other hand, for some shady companies that are set up as contract shops, then I'd not be surprised if the wages are lower than average market rate, but I have never worked at one, so I might be misleading by even mentioning this here. reply hollerith 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's what I would naturally expect to happen in the absence of consistent heroic efforts by the authorities to prevent it. reply cscurmudgeon 1 hour agorootparentIf that is happening widely, surely there will be some data to support that right?

To me, the point of H-1B and similar programs isn't \"we can't get the individual staff we need\". It's rather that at a society-wide level, having more software engineers at an overall lower salary can be more beneficial to the country than fewer engineers at a higher salary.

Economic growth and prosperity does benefit a broad swath of society. reply carlosjobim 13 minutes agorootparentFor non-workers the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, while for workers the disadvantages outweigh the benefits. If your income is from owning capital or from real estate value increase or from government benefits, then anything that can reduce the price of things you want to buy is a benefit. This is a large part of the population. If your income is from working and producing goods and services, then getting paid less is a negative that is far worse than the positive from cheaper things. Many people have their foot in both camps. Their main source of income is from their real estate appreciating in value, while working is just a means to pay off the old mortgage so that they soon can get a new cash out by mortgaging at a higher value. It's very much also economic warfare waged by the elderly against the young. The elderly own almost all capital and are interested in increasing it.

OP then must interview to prove the role can't be filled by a citizen. An interviewee knocks it out of the park, failing the check and so the green card application is denied.

My first job out of university was at a dotcom consultancy with over 90% of software engineers there on H1B visas. The company was not at all shy about the fact that they only hired citizens/permanent residents if they had no other choice. I was hired because I had experience with a particular obscure RTOS that they couldn't find anyone on a visa who could do the work on a project they already told a client we were experts in. Our VP of Software Engineering (here on a visa himself) stood right next to my desk telling one of our programmers not to worry about his visa expiring because they'd post his job for 24 hours on the company website, accept resumes for one week, and then declare the job unfillable by local talent so he could get his visa renewed. This was in 2000 and this type of thing has been practiced openly and with no fear of there ever being any consequences for violating both the letter and spirit of the law regarding using labor visas. These threads end up fire hosed with people claiming hiring visa holders over citizens and permanent residents doesn't happen nor does it push down wages. They know these are lies and have been lies for decades. But since there are no consequences, legally or socially, it continues to be the default behavior.

With experience only in the startup style business, you ought to structure the economics of the deals to your employees such that they can buy what they want if everything works out, and all the incentives align. So to me, it’s not super material, green card this, PERM certification that: if you make a ton of money, you can surmount any bureaucratic obstacle in this country. Is that the purpose of the system? A complex administrative problem like UCSIS policy and related politics cannot defeat the power of the almighty dollar.

The incentives here are so screwed up for everyone, it effectively codifies a caste system of immigrant workers. reply alwa 3 hours agorootparentI took the implication to be that GP already had a good employee who was hired legitimately under the terms of the H1B, but that, to convert to a green card, you have to see whether a US person could do the job. So you have to put out for interviews to see, but you don’t have to act on that information. If the interview process yields a US person equally qualified, GP can’t (and doesn’t) certify the guest worker’s green card application. But that doesn’t mean they have to fire them and send them home early: they can let the guest worker work out their contract if they want to (which they probably do, it probably pays well compared to other options). And an experienced, already-trained, good employee is probably more valuable to the business than an immediate, unplanned new hire anyway. So yes, certainly screwed up incentives—but I don’t see how it would be better to require guest workers to put their jobs in immediate jeopardy just to apply for permanent residency. reply em-bee 1 hour agorootparentexactly that. you actually want/need a few years of warning if your greencard is going to be accepted or not. having to put out a ghost job in order to find out if the greencard is going to be accepted is really the problem (for the ghost candidate) reply umanwizard 3 hours agorootparentprevNo, you're missing the point.

But by admitting this, your company is admitting liability for citizenship discrimination (8 U.S.C. § 1324b). Even though you are not submitting a PERM and running into potential issues with fraud there, the underlying act of rejecting US citizen/LPR applicants is the same, so I don't see how this would be any different than, for example, the Apple case last year (https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-25...) with a $25M settlement. In the Apple case, the company did actually obtain PERMs for some of the positions, but they were only charged with discrimination against the un-hired applications, not anything to do with the the hiring/sponsoring of the foreign workers. Furthermore, the case did not even allege actual tossing out of US citizen resumes, but merely making the applications deliberately inconvenient to avoid actually receiving any unwanted \"real\" applications. reply gmueckl 1 hour agorootparentI don't think you interpret the Apple case correctly.

OP is now in the process of doing a green card application for said employee. They can't move forward with the GC application because there are other qualified citizens/residents, but they don't have to fire the existing H1B employee. That's how I understand OP, if that's legally true or not, I don't know. reply morpheuskafka 3 hours agorootparentYou're correct that they are under no obligation to fire the employee on the H-1B. (In theory, they are applying for a \"new\" job, and them not getting it for whatever the reason isn't an issue for their current job and status.) However, what OP is missing is that rejecting the US citizen application based on their citizenship is still likely a prohibited discrimination case regardless of what they do with the existing employee. reply phil21 1 hour agorootparentOP isn't rejecting the US citizen application because they are a US citizen - they are rejecting all candidates applying for the position regardless of ability to do the job or not since the position is already filled. There was no intent to fill the position to begin with - just a test to see if they can sponsor the current h1b employee for their greencard or not. There is no discrimination if no applicant had a chance of being hired to begin with. They might be running afoul of discrimination laws if they only interview US citizens to cut down on their workload for fake interviews, but I'd guess someone this careful (e.g. not actually submitting the greencard sponsorship where many employers would with a wink and a nod) is likely careful enough to not filter candidates on such obvious things either. It's a problem with the h1b (and green card) program itself, not OPs behavior. If anything, OP is probably in the top few percentile of ethical businesses/managers if they are actually denying the sponsorships because they made a good faith attempt to test to see if the local market had appropriate candidates. reply grugagag 3 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is that it’s hard to prove they did that.

Since out of country students pay the highest tuition rates, universities love them and give them preferential admissions. Though not as bad as elementary and high schools, universities suffer from grade inflation and are reluctant to kick out paying customers, especially those paying the highest tuition. As a consequence, academic standards are being reduced at a rapid rate. If you want to come to the US to get a professional job, attending a US university instead of a domestic one is going to be worth the extra cost when it guarantees you a Green Card. There might be a reduction in the flow of low skilled labor, especially for those looking to hire workers without legal status, but up the middle class portion of the labor market, expect the system to continue to favor cheap imported labor over domestic labor. reply selimthegrim 3 hours agorootparentSTEM grad student tuition is paid by government grants reply p10_user 2 hours agorootparentGenerally not for Masters' programs though, which is the most popular and easiest way to get a temporary study visa.

I've heard there are good recruiters, I don't doubt it, but it doesn't seem easy to find anymore than the next job is. reply lumost 2 hours agorootparentThere really isn't a \"good\" recruiter from a candidate perspective. Their incentives are to support the firms they recruit for, and screen candidates. They do not work for your benefit.

I had to take the gigs which had lower competition e.g. systems administration. reply nerdponx 1 hour agorootparentSort of. 3rd-party recruiters get paid on commission: they make money when their candidate gets hired in favor of the other recruiters' candidates. In that sense, the incentives are actually aligned in your favor when you're applying for a job that you really want: the recruiter is motivated to work to get you hired, and is only constrained by the need to not annoy the hiring manager. The incentives turn against you when the recruiter doesn't have any jobs that you really want, but is trying the numbers approach and putting you forward for things that you aren't really qualified for, \"just in case\" it's a good fit. You need to be aware that both of these scenarios can occur, so you can steer yourself away from the latter and towards the former. reply nerdponx 1 hour agorootparentprevThe good recruiters are the ones who won't put you forward for a job that you're not qualified for, and will advocate for you during the hiring process in a job that you are qualified for.

I don't know if it will do well but if it nets me a half-dozen to a dozen students that I am instructing 1-1 via zoom for 20-30 minutes on a weekly basis when I FIRE here in the next five years I'll be happy. reply tartoran 57 minutes agorootparentThanks a ton, I wish good luck and you a happy sane life. reply mixmastamyk 2 hours agorootparentprevSimilar. Time to reach out to your network. reply spacephysics 3 hours agoparentprevI got laid off then brought back on last minute (whiplash), and though i was burned out while applying during the transition period, end of the day i needed a job. So whether people check out as in, leave industry or take a smaller pay sure i can see that happening. But unless you have large savings or low expenses, you can’t really stop. If it didn’t take 50 app submissions for 1 interview, and the interviews weren’t l33t code crap, then i’d be crazy enough to enjoy the process. reply from-nibly 1 hour agorootparentThis is why we all need to live below our means if possible.

Same here. After a certain point you are doing yourself a disservice by enduring rejection notices if you actually have the skills you claim to. The hardest part is having faith in yourself and the possibility of acquiring a customer. reply masfuerte 2 hours agorootparentRejection notices? I get ghosted. I would welcome a rejection notice. reply spacebanana7 3 hours agoparentprevIt really depends on the position of the prospective employee. An unemployed person who needs a job should theoretically spend their workday hours on recruitment efforts. The prevalence of fake jobs might affect which roles they apply for but not the total number of applications. However for employed individuals seeking a promotion it can have a big impact. Is it worth spending many hours of your leisure time applying/interviewing for a job that pays 10% more, if the job has even a small likelihood of being fake? Probably not. reply seabass-labrax 1 hour agorootparentThe 'well could be poisoned' for unemployed people as well. Applying to job adverts isn't the only type of recruitment efforts; there is also further education and tending to professional social networks - the unemployed individual could easily consider these more valuable than applying to probably fake job adverts. Ultimately, this still hurts both worker and employer, because it just delays gainful employment and hides information from the market. reply UncleOxidant 1 hour agoparentprevYep. I just decided to stop playing the game. I looked for about the first 6 months (a requirement for unemployment) but after that I decided to just retire. I was planning to work a few years more, but it's just not worth it. It's not only the ghost jobs, it's the whole interview process where you could spend days on interviews and take home tests and you still don't get the job. And then there's the ageism. No thanks. I'm out. Fortunately I can afford to be (frugally) retired. reply chairmansteve 3 hours agoparentprevI gave up applying for jobs many years ago. Mostly because I am bad at the interview process. I maintain a good personal network and have a good reputation, so I can always find work. reply happyopossum 3 hours agoparentprevIME, it’s been a crap system for decades. 7 of my last 7 jobs (over ~25 years) have been obtained through “my network” - ie former coworkers who enjoyed (tolerated?) working with me and were happy to make referrals, reach out, or in other ways help when I was looking for a new job. And often when I wasn’t looking. reply Applejinx 3 hours agoparentprevThere are many analogous questions! One of the most interesting challenges in life is trying to observe when the presentation of reality is fundamentally dishonest for some reason. The well poisoned, as it were. I didn't know the hiring market was one of these situations, but I could see that being the case. Seems like a lot of hype and noise, but is anything really going on or is it just hollow? reply renegat0x0 3 hours agoprevRecently I have found several things: - there are some positions that exist only to receive new personal data information. There are companies that scrape user data when you apply for a job - some job positions are kept to make employees more productive - some job positions are kept open to show investors \"we are still hiring\", \"we have no problems, etc. - some HR just want to have more and more data, some times it is just useful to have new CVs at hand - my wife decided recently to apply to companies directly, not through work sites, to get directly to managers, etc. - in the end my wife found job by word of mouth, someone knew someone, etc. etc. reply kccqzy 2 hours agoparentTalking to a couple of people who found jobs recently, I realized that none of them actually found the job by applying online. All of them are through human relationships. It doesn't have to be someone who knew someone, but even an outsourced recruiting agency staffed by humans in a call center is more useful than applying online. The better recruiting agencies usually have an account manager who has a direct line to the company that's hiring. Online job seeking is dead. reply eulers_secret 2 hours agorootparentI got hired by directly applying via a company's website; it was my 11th application and my first that wasn't a moonshot (nvda/valve/etc). It was in late 2023 (very bad market), and I didn't have any connections to the company at all. I also have no online presence. Online applications are not fully dead. Of course this is just my experience as a senior engineer in embedded, so likely doesn't apply to others. But if you're looking, it's worth your time to apply... reply seabass-labrax 1 hour agorootparentI have a suspicion that your experience is representative of a general attitude in embedded engineering compared to other software disciplines. Embedded engineers usually still keep to proper part numbering, testing before shipping and working with greater platform limitations, all virtuous activities that are harder to find in other fields. I like to think this culture bleeds into other parts of the business such as implementing reasonable hiring processes! reply sotix 2 hours agoprevGhost jobs are certainly problematic, but I’ve been getting actual interviews where the technical bar feels too high. There’s extraordinarily little trust in previous job experience and interviews assess for test taking anxiety rather than actual skill[0].

If I happen across a board for a given company, look at the positions they have posted, and then come back to it a few months later and see the exact same ones listed without any change, then I just move on to something else. It tells me a few things: either they don't know what they're looking for and are just fishing, they want to make it appear they are grow-grow-growing but still can't figure out exactly what they want, they're trying to posture like they are bigger than they are, like you said. If they're playing the game, I probably don't want to be there. reply Simran-B 4 hours agoparentprevIt's certain abused for below-the-line marketing, such as for appearing bigger than they are, but also to make them look more competent by adding ridiculous requirements such as fluency in at least five different languages. reply KeplerBoy 4 hours agoparentprevSure, also HR needs to do this to look busy. They will sell management on doing this instead of being downsized themselves. reply mikeocool 3 hours agoparentprevI wonder who this is effective signaling mechanism for. Any investor that's on the board is going to have access to data that tells the real story (or if they don't they're neglecting their fiduciary duty). Any potential investor that's going to lead a funding round is going to do enough diligence to see what kind of financial shape they're in. And if the company doesn't have money to be increasing headcount, it'd look like they're making irresponsible hiring decisions. For customers -- small customers are probably not doing a level of diligence that would involve going out and looking at job postings. Large enterprise customers potentially are, but when dealing with startups, they'll often have clauses in their contracts that give them access to some level of financial data to ensure the vendor they're getting into bed with isn't about to collapse (though I suppose many of them never actually enforce those clauses). Employees pay a lot of attention to job postings, but they also pay attention to interview flow and hiring. If you have a job posting out, and no ones getting interviewed, people are going to notice pretty quickly (they're especially going to notice if someone else gets to put a req out, but the req for their dept keeps getting denied). Definitely not suggesting the idea is wrong -- companies have certainly done far more nefarious things, just wondering who they are trying to signal to with this. reply coliveira 3 hours agorootparentThere are well know ways to solve these issues. For example, companies have always used the strategy of firing the \"bad\" workers after a few years and then hiring more to replace them. Even though there is hiring going on, the net difference may well be zero or negative. Nobody would suspect this by looking just at the number of people being hired. reply NBJack 4 hours agoparentprevThat's a really good point. It's public data, so it's also a way for investors to gage success. reply dartos 4 hours agorootparentAnd growth.

I literally dont see americans getting hired at well known tech companies reply indoordin0saur 3 hours agoparentMy wife a couple years ago was at a cyber security company that had very generous referral bonuses. Multiple members of senior management in her company were laying off talented and hard-working American citizens on the justification that they needed to downsize. But then just months later they would change their tune and fill the vacated positions with friends or acquaintances (always non-American citizens), they would also collect a generous referral bonus (often $20k or more). I'm not sure if this was purely to collect the bonus, because of ethnic preference or a desire to help their friends/family migrate from India but something strange was certainly going on. My wife eventually was part of one of these cycles of layoffs \"because of the financials\" then later heard from a colleague still working there that her manager had shortly afterwards backfilled her position with a referral of his own. Last we heard it sounded like the company was approaching bankruptcy. reply underlipton 2 hours agorootparentI wish people would be aware enough to report behavior like this to authorities.

The hiring bar is higher, but the proportion of good Americans doesn't get higher.

I think it is worth placing writing/coding tasks into two buckets. Are you producing? Or are you learning? For example, I have zero qualms about relying on AI at work to write progress reports and code up some scripts. I know I can do it myself but why would I? I spent many years in college learning to read and write and code. AI makes me at least 2x more efficient at my job. It seems irrational not to use it. Like a farmer who tills his land by hand rather than relying on a tractor because it builds character or something. But there is something to be said about atrophy. If you don't use it, you lose it. I wonder if my coding skill will deteriorate in the years to come... On the other hand, if you are a student trying to learn something new, relying on AI requires walking a fine line. You don't want to over-rely on AI because a certain degree of \"productive struggle\" is essential for learning something deeply. At the same time, if you under-rely on AI, you drastically decrease the rate at which you can learn new things. In the old days, people were fit because of physical labor. Now people are fit because they go to the gym. I wonder if there will be an analog for intellectual work. Will people be going to \"mental\" gyms in the future? reply sam0x17 4 hours agoparent> Are you producing? Or are you learning? > AI makes me at least 2x more efficient at my job. It seems irrational not to use it Fair, but there is a corollary here -- the purpose of learning at least in part is to prepare you for the workforce. If that is the case, then one of the things students need to get good at is conversing with LLMs, because they will need to do so to be competitive in the workplace. I find it somewhat analogous to the advent of being able to do research on the internet, which I experienced as an early 90s kid, where everyone was saying \"now they won't know how to do research anymore, they won't know the Dewey decimal system, oh no!\". Now the last vestiges of physical libraries being a place where you even can conduct up-to-date research on most topics are crumbling, and research _just is_ largely done online in some form or another. Same thing will likely happen with LLMs, especially as they improve in quality and accuracy over the next decade, and whether we like it or not. reply behringer 15 minutes agorootparentA big one for me was nobody will know how to look up info in a dictionary or encyclopedia.

Understanding that I think can really inform you about how you might use these tools in work (or life) and where the lines need to be drawn for your own personal circumstance. I can't say I disagree with anything you said and think you've made an insightful observation. reply margalabargala 17 hours agorootparentIn the presence of sufficiently good and ubiquitous tools, knowing how to do some base thing loses most or all of its value. In a world where everyone has a phone/calculator in their pocket, remembering how to do long division on paper is not worthwhile. If I ask you \"what is 457829639 divided by 3454\", it is not worth your time to do that by hand rather than plugging it into your phone's calculator. In a world where AI can immediately produce any arbitrary 20-line glue script that you would have had to think about and remember bash array syntax for, there's not a reason to remember bash array syntax. I don't think we're quite at that point yet but we're astonishingly close. reply antasvara 13 hours agorootparentThe value isn't in rote calculation, but the intuition that doing it gives you. So yes, it's pretty useless for me to manually divide arbitrarily large numbers. But it's super useful for me to be able to reason around fractions and how that division plays out in practice. Same goes for bash. Knowing the exact syntax is useless, but knowing what that glue script does and how it works is essential to understanding how your entire program works. That's the piece I'm scared of. I've seen enough kids through tutoring that just plug numbers into their calculator arbitrarily. They don't have any clue when a number is off by a factor of 10 or what a reasonable calculation looks like. They don't really have a sense for when something is \"too complicated\" either, as the calculator does all of the work. reply margalabargala 1 hour agorootparentI totally agree. The neat thing about AI generated bash scripts, would be that the AI can comment their code. So the user can 1) check if the comment for each step match what they expect to be done, and 2) have a starting point to debug if something goes wrong. reply behringer 11 minutes agorootparentprevGo ahead and ask chat gpt how that glue script works. You'll be incredibly satisfied at its detailed insights. reply nkrisc 15 hours agorootparentprev> If I ask you \"what is 457829639 divided by 3454\" And if it spits out 15,395,143 I hope you remember enough math to know that doesn’t look right, and how to find the actual answer if you don’t trust your calculator’s answer. reply Baeocystin 14 hours agorootparentSanity Checking Expected Output is one of the most vital skills a person can have. It really is. But knowing the general shape of the thing is different than any particular algorithm, don't you think? reply bruce511 13 hours agorootparentThis gets to the root of the issue. The use case, and user experience, and thus outcome is, is remarkably different depending on your current ability. Using AI to learn things is useful, because it helps you get terminology right, and helps you Google search well. For example say you need to know a Windows API, you can describe it snd get the name. Then Google how that works. As an experienced user you can get it to write code. You're good enough to spot errors in the vote and basically just correct as you go. 90% right is good enough. It's the in-between space which is hardest. You're an inexperienced dev looking to produce, not learn. But you lack the experience and knowledge to recognise the errors, or bad patterns, or whatever. Using AI you end up with stuff that's 'mostly right' - which in programming terms means broken. This experience difference is why there's so much chatter about usefulness. To some groups it's very useful. To others it's a dangerous crutch. reply aquariusDue 17 hours agorootparentprevThis is both inspiring and terrifying at the same time. That being said I usually prefer to do something the long and manual way, write the process down sometimes, and afterwards search for easier ways to do it. Of course this makes sense on a case by case basis depending on your personal context. Maybe stuff like crosswords and more will undergo a renaissance and we'll see more interesting developments like Gauguin[0] which is a blend of Sudoku and math.

The difference is that you can trust a good calculator. You currently can't trust AI to be right. If we get a point where the output of AI is trustworthy, that's a whole different kind of world altogether. reply alasdair_ 15 hours agorootparent>The difference is that you can trust a good calculator. I found a bug in the ios calculator in the middle of a masters degree exam. The answer changed depending on which way the phone was held. (A real bug - I reported it and they fixed it).

But it will be very useful long before that. AI that writes a bash script doesn't need to be better than an experienced engineer. It doesn't even need to be better than a junior engineer. It just needs to be better than Stack Overflow. That bar is really not far away. reply treflop 12 hours agorootparentYou’re changing the goal post. Your original post was saying that you don’t need to know fundamentals. It was not about whether AI is useful or not. reply margalabargala 1 hour agorootparentI'm not changing goalposts, I was responding to what you said about AI spitting out something wrong and you spending 3 hours debugging it. My original point about not needing fundamentals would obviously require AI to, y'know, not hallucinate errors that take three hours to debug. We're clearly not there yet. The original goalposts remain the same. Since human conversations often flow from one topic to another, in addition to the goal post of \"not needing fundamentals\" in my original post, my second post introduced a goalpost of \"being broadly useful\". You're correct that it's not the same goalpost as in my first comment, which is not unexpected, as the comment in question is also not my first comment. reply visarga 3 hours agorootparentprev> Wait until AI prints out something that doesn't work and you can't figure out how to fix it because you don't know how it works so you do trial and error for 3 hours.

And done only one way.” The question for calculators is then the same as the question for LLMs: can you trust the calculator? How do you know if it’s correct when you never learned the “correct” way and you’re just blindly believing the tool? reply margalabargala 1 hour agorootparent> So we agree that there is more than one way to interpret 5/2+3 (a correct and an incorrect way) and therefore that the GP statement below is wrong. No. There being \"more than one way\" to interpret implies the meaning is ambiguous. It's not. There's not one incorrect way to interpret that math statement, there are infinite incorrect ways to do so. For example, you could interpret as being a poem about cats. reply kamaal 4 hours agorootparentprev>>How do you know if it’s correct when you never learned the “correct” way and you’re just blindly believing the tool? This is just splitting hairs. People who use calculators interpret it in only one way. You are making a different and a more broad argument that words/symbols can have various meanings, hence anything can be interpreted in many ways. While these are fun arguments to be made. They are not relevant to practical use of the calculator or LLMs. reply eyegor 12 hours agorootparentprevI don't honestly think anyone can remember bash array syntax if they take a 2 week break. It's the kind of arcane nonsense that LLMs are perfect for. The only downside is if the fancy autocomplete model messes it up, we're gonna be in bad shape when Steve retires cause half the internet will be an ouroboros of ai generated garbage. reply kamaal 15 hours agorootparentprev>>I wonder if my coding skill will deteriorate in the years to come... Well that's not how LLMs work. Don't use an LLM to do thinking for you. You use LLMs to work for you, while you tell(after thinking) it what's to be done. Basically things like- . Attach a click handler to this button with x, y, z params and on click route it to the path /a/b/c . Change the color of this header to purple. . Parse the json in param 'payload' and pick up the value under this>then>that and return etc. kind of dictation. You don't ask big questions like 'Write me a todo app', or 'Write me this dashboard'. Those are too broad questions. You will still continue to code and work like you always have. Except that you now have a good coding assistant that will do the chore of typing for you. reply AuryGlenz 46 minutes agorootparentI asked o1 to make an entire save system for a game/app I’m working on in Unity with some pretty big gotchas (Minecraft-like chunk system, etc) and it got pretty close to nailing it first try - and what it didn’t get was due to me not writing out some specifics. I honestly don’t think we’re far out from people being able to write “Write me a todo app” and then telling it what changes to make after. I recently switched back to software development from professional photography and I’m not sure if that’s a mistake or not. reply skydhash 14 hours agorootparentprevMaybe I'm too good at my editor (currently Emacs, previously Vim), but the fact is that I can type all of this faster than dictating it to an AI and verifying its output. reply kamaal 5 hours agorootparentYes, editor proficiency is something that beats these things any day. In fact if you are familiar with keyboard macros, in both vim and emacs you can do a lot of text heavy lifting tasks. I don't see these as opposing traits. One can use both the goodness of vim AND LLMs at the same time. Why pick one, when you can pick both? reply skydhash 3 hours agorootparent> One can use both the goodness of vim AND LLMs at the same time. Why pick one, when you can pick both? I mostly use manuals, books, and the occasional forum searches. And the advantage is that you pick surrounding knowledge. And more consistent writing. And today, I know where some of the good stuff are. You're not supposed to learn everything in one go. I built a knowledge map where I can find what I want in a more straightforward manner. No need to enter in a symbiosis with an LLM. reply dawidloubser 8 hours agorootparentprevI think that anybody who finds the process of clumsily describing the above examples to an LLM in some text box using english and waiting for it to spit out some code which you hope is suitable for your given programming context and codebase more efficient than just expressing the logic directly in your programming language in an efficient editor, probably suffers from multiple weaknesses: - Poor editor / editing setup - Poor programming language and knowledge thereof - Poor APIs and/or knowledge thereof Mankind has worked for decades to develop elegant and succinct programming languages within which to express problems and solutions, and compilers with deterministic behaviour to \"do the work for us\". I am surprised that so many people in the software engineering field are prepared to just throw all of this away (never mind develop it further) in exchange for using a poor \"programming language\" (say, english) to express problems clumsily in a roudabout way, and then throw away the \"source code\" (the LLM prompt) entirely such to simply paste the \"compiler output\" (code the LLM spewed out which may or may not be suitable or correct) into some heterogenous mess of multiple different LLM outputs pasted together in a codebase held together by nothing more than the law of averages, and hope. Then there's the fun fact that every single LLM prompt interaction consumes a ridiculous amount of energy - I heard figures such as the total amount required to recharge a smartphone battery - in an era where mankind is racing towards an energy cliff. Vast, remote data centres filled with GPUs spewing tonnes of CO₂ and massive amounts of heat to power your \"programming experience\". In my opinion, LLMs are a momentous achievement with some very interesting use-cases, but they are just about the most ass-backwards and illogical way of advancing the field of programming possible. reply jbmilgrom 3 hours agorootparentThere's a new mode of programming (with AI) that doesn't require english and also results in massive efficiency gains. I now only need to begin a change and the AI can normally pick up on the pattern and do the rest, via subsequent \"tab\" key hits as I audit each change in real time. It's like I'm expressing the change I want via a code example to a capable intern that quickly picks up on it and can type at 100x my speed but not faster than I read. I'm using Cursor btw. It's almost a different form factor compared to something like GH copilot. I think it's also worth noting that I'm using TypeScript with a functional programming style. The state of the program is immutable and encoded via strongly typed inputs and outputs. I spend (mental) effort reifying use-cases via enums or string literals, enabling a comprehensive switch over all possible branches as opposed to something like imperative if statements. All this to say, that a lot of the code I write in this type of style can be thought of as a kind of boilerplate. The hard part is deciding what to do; effecting the change through the codebase is more easily ascertained from a small start. reply dawidloubser 1 hour agorootparentProvided that we ignore the ridiculous waste of energy entailed by calling an online LLM every time you type a word in your editor - I agree that the utility of LLM-assisted programming as \"autocomplete on steriods\" can be very useful. It's awfully close to that of a good editor using the type system of a good programming language providing suggestions. I too love functional programming, and I'm talking about Haskell-levels of programming efficiency and expressiveness here, BTW. This is quite a different use case than those presented by the post I was replying to though. The Go programming language has this mantra of \"a little bit of copy and paste is better than a little bit of dependency on other code\". I find that LLM-derived source code takes this mantra to an absurd extreme, and furthermore that it encourages a though pattern that never leads you to discover, specify, and use adequate abstractions in your code. All higher-level meaning and context is lost in the end product (your committed source code) unless you already think like a programmer _not_ being guided by an LLM ;-) We do digress though - the original topic is that of LLM-assisted writing, not coding. But much of the same argument probably applies. reply dasKrokodil 7 hours agorootparentprevAt the time I'm writing this, there are over 260 comments to this article and yours is still the only one that mentions the enormous energy consumption.

In my experience most of the difficulty involved in learning something involved a few missing pieces of insight. It often took longer to understand the few missing pieces than the rest of the topic. If they are accurate enough, LLMs are great for getting yourself unstuck and keep yourself moving.

Some teachers make you read the lesson before class, others give you homework on the lesson before lecturing it, and some even quiz you on it on top of that before allowing you to ask questions.

I really want LLMs to help me in learning but the success rate is 0. They often can not generate relatively trivial code When they do, they can not explain that code. For example, I was trying to learn socket programing in C. Claude generated the code, but when I stared asking about stuff, it regressed hard. Also, often the code is more complex than it needs to be. When learning a topic, I want that topic, not the most common relevant code with all the spagheti used on github. For other subjects, like dbms, computer network, when asking about concepts, you better double check, because they still make stuff up. I asked ChatGPT to solve prev year question for dbms, and it gave a long, answer which looked good on surface. But when I actually read through because I need to understand what it is doing, there were glaring flaws. When I point them out, it makes other mistakes. So, LLMs struggle to generate concise to the point code. They can not explain that code. They regularly make stuff up. This is after trying Claude, ChatGPT and Gemini with their paid versions in various capacities. My bottom line is, I should NEVER use a LLM to learn. There is no fine line here. I have tried again and again because tech bros keep preaching about sparks of AGI, making startup with 0 coding skills. They are either fools or genius. LLMs are useful strictly if you already know what you are doing.

Looking back are some questions a little stupid ? Yes. But affcourse they are! I am coming with zero knowledge trying to learn how the socket programming is happening here ? Which functions are begin pulled from which header files, etc. In the end I just followed along with a random youtube video. When you say, you can get LLM to do anything, I agree. Now that I know how socket programming is happening, for next question in assignment about writing code for crc with socket programming, I asked it to generate code for socket programming, made the necessary changes, asked it generate seperate function for crc, integrated it manually and voila, assignment done. But this is the execution phase, when I have the domain knowledge. During learning when the user asks stupid questions and the LLM's answer keep getting stupider, then using them is not practical. reply isaacfrond 10 hours agorootparentI had no idea what even the question was.

I don't dismiss it as completely useless, because it pointed me in the correct direction a couple times, but you have to double-check everything.

We see a decrease in code quality across experience levels which needs to be rectified across all experience levels but even with the time spent refactoring it’s still an increase in productivity. I think I should note that we don’t use these metrics for employee review in any way. The reason we have them is because they come with the DORA (eu regulation) compliance tool we use to monitor code-quality. They won’t be used for employee measurement while I work here. I don’t manage people, but I was brought in to help IT transition from startup to enterprise so set the direction with management confidence. I’m a little worried about developers turning to LLMs instead of official documentation as the first thing they do. I still view LLMs as mostly being fancy auto-complete with some automation capabilities. I don’t think they are very good at teaching you things. Maybe they are better than Google programming, but the disadvantage LLMs have seem to be that our employees tend to trust the LLMs more than they would trust what they found on Google. I don’t see an issue with people using LLMs on fields they aren’t too experienced with yet however. We’ve already seen people start using different models to refine their answers, we’ve also seen an increase in internal libraries and automation in place of external tools. Which is what we want, again because we’re under some heavy EU regulations where even “safe” external dependencies are a bureaucratic nightmare.

I can remember phone numbers from 30+ years ago approximately instantly. I don't have to remember most of them from today, so I simply don't. (I do keep a few current numbers squirreled away in my little pea brain that will help me get rolling again, but I'll probably only ever need to actually use those memories if I ever fall out of the sky and onto a desert island that happens to have a payphone with a bucket of change next to it.) On a daily, non-outlier basis, I'm no worse for not generally remembering phone numbers. I might even be better off today than I was decades ago, by no longer having to spend the brainpower required for programming new phone numbers into it. I mean: I grew up reading paper road maps and [usually] helping my dad plan and navigate on road trips. The map pocket in the door of that old Chevrolet was stuffed with folded maps of different areas of the US. But about the time I started taking my own solo road trips, things like the [OG] MapBlast! website started calculating and charting driving directions that could be printed. This made route planning a lot faster and easier. Later, we got to where we are today with GPS navigation that has live updates for traffic and road conditions using systems like Waze. This has almost completely eliminated the chores of route planning and remembering directions (and alternate routes) from my life, and while I do have exactly one road map in my car that I do keep updated I haven't actually ever used it for anything since 2008 or so. And am I less of a person today than I was back when paper maps were the order of the day? No, I don't think that I am -- in fact, I think these kinds of tools have made me much more capable than I ever was.

The first point I like to make is that the purpose of having students do tasks is to foster their development. That may sound obvious, but many people don't seem to take notice that the products of student activities are worthless in themselves. We don't have students do push-ups in gym class to help the national economy by meeting some push-up quota. The sole reason for them is to promote physical development. The same principle applies to mental tasks. When considering LLM use, we need to be looking at its effects on student development rather than on student output. So, what is actually new about LLM use? There has always been a risk that students would sometimes submit homework that was actually the work of someone else, but LLMs enable willing students to do it all the time. Teachers can adapt to this by basing evaluation only on work done in class, and by designing homework to emphasize feedback on key points, so that students will get some learning benefit even though a LLM did the work. Completely following this advice may seem impossible, because some important forms of work done for evaluation require too much time. Teachers use papers and projects to challenge students in a more elaborate way than is possible in class. These can still be used beneficially if a distinction is made between work done for learning and work done for evaluation. While students develop multiple skills while working on these extended tasks, those skills could be evaluated in class by more concise tasks with a narrower focus. For example, good writing requires logical coherence and rhetorical flow. If students have trouble in these areas, it will be just as evident in a brief essay as a long one. reply Eisenstein 15 hours agoparentIt is trivially easy to spot AI writing if you are familiar with it, but if it requires failing most of the class for turning in LLM generated material, I think we are going to find that abolishing graded homework is the only tenable solution. The student's job is not to do everything the teacher says, it is to get through schooling somewhat intact and ready for their future. The sad fact is that many things we were forced to do in school were not helpful at all, and only existed because the teachers thought it was, or for no real reason at all. Pretending that pedagogy has established and verified methodology that will result in a completely developed student, if only the student did the work as prescribed, is quite silly. Teaching evolves with technology like every other part of society and it may come out worse or it may come out better, but I don't want to go back fountain pens and slide rules and I think in 20 years this generation won't look back on their education thinking they got a worse one than we did because they could cheat easier. reply low_tech_love 12 hours agorootparentAs a (senior) lecturer in a university, I’m with you on most of what you wrote. The truth is that every teacher must immediately think: if any of their assignments or examinations involve something that could potentially be GPT-generated, it will be GPT-generated. It might be easy to spot such a thing, but you’ll be spending hours writing feedback while sifting through the rivers of meaningless artificially-generated text your students will submit. Personally what I’m doing is to push the weight back at the students. Every submission now requires a 5-minute presentation with an argumentation/defense against me as an opponent. Anyway it would take me around 10-15 min to correct their submission, so we’re just doing it together now. reply jay_kyburz 9 hours agorootparentA genuine question, have you evaluated AI for marking written work?

You did it, so these students must do it, with no other rationale than that. reply sinuhe69 6 hours agorootparentYou have forgotten that pedagogy is based on science and research. That is why it is effective for the masses. Anecdotal evidence will never refute the result. Take learning to read, for example. While you can learn to read in a number of ways, some of which are quite unusual, such as memorising the whole picture book and its sound, research has clearly shown that using the phonics approach is the most effective. Or take maths. It's obvious that some people are good at maths, even if they don't seem to do much work. But research has shown time and time again that to be good at maths you need to practice, including doing homework.

ChatGPT is the new compiler: it creates results so fast that it’s literally more worth it to just turn them in and wait for the response than bothering to think about it.

I'm concerned about student using it to cheat, but I'm also pretty concerned about how teachers are using it. For example, many teachers have fed student essays into ChatGPT and asked \"did AI write this?\" or \"was this plagiarized\" or similar, and fully trusting whatever the AI tells them. This has led to some false positives where students were wrongly accused of cheating. Of course a student who would cheat may also lie about cheating, but in a few cases they were able to prove authorship using the history feature built into Google docs. Overall though I'm not super worried because I do think most people are learning to be skeptical of LLMs. There's still a little too much faith in them, but I think we're heading the right direction. It's a learning process for everyone involved. reply wdutch 16 hours agoparentI imagine maths teachers had a similar dilemma when pocket calculators became widely available. Now, in the UK students sit 2 different exams: one where calculators are forbidden and one where calculators are permitted (and encouraged). The problems for the calculator exam are chosen so that the candidate must do a lot of problem solving that isn't just computation. Furthermore, putting a problem into a calculator and then double checking the answer is a skill in itself that is taught. I think the same sort of solution will be needed across the board now - where students learn to think for themselves without the technology but also learn to correctly use the technology to solve the right kinds of challenges and have the skills to check the answers. People on HN often talk about ai detection or putting invisible text in the instructions to detect copy and pasting. I think this is a fundamentally wrong approach. We need to work with, not against the technology - the genie is out of the bottle now. As an example of a non-chatgpt way to evaluate students, teachers can choose topics chatgpt fails at. I do a lot of writing on niche topics and there are plenty of topics out there where chatgpt has no clue and spits out pure fabrications. Teachers can play around to find a topic where chatgpt performs poorly. reply freedomben 4 hours agorootparentThank you, you make an excellent point!

There is def an argument for high-performing students who understand how to use chatGPT productively but more importantly low-performing students struggle to get the most out of chatGPT due to bandwidth issues in the classroom. When I talk to teachers about AI in the classroom they prefer their students to stay as far away from chatGPT as they can because building a strong educational foundation with long lasting learning skills should come before using tools like ChatGPT. Once that foundation is there, generative AI tools are way more useful. In the classroom AI should be teacher facing, and not centralize around students and quick answers. reply ratedgene 22 hours agoprevI was talking to a teacher today that works with me at length about the impact of AI LLM models are having now when considering student's attitude towards learning. When I was young, I refused to learn geography because we had map applications. I could just look it up. I did the same for anything I could, offload the cognitive overhead to something better -- I think this is something we all do consciously or not. That attitude seems to be the case for students now, \"Why do I need to do this when an LLM can just do it better?\" This led us to the conclusion: 1. How do you construct challenges that AI can't solve? 2. What skills will humans need next? We talked about \"critical thinking\", \"creative problem solving\", and \"comprehension of complex systems\" as the next step, but even when discussing this, how long will it be until more models or workflows catch up? I think this should lead to a fundamental shift in how we work WITH AI in every facet of education. How can a human be a facilitator and shepherd of the workflows in such a way that can complement the model and grow the human? I also think there should be more education around basic models and how they work as an introductory course to students of all ages, specifically around the trustworthiness of output from these models. We'll need to rethink education and what we really desire from humans to figure out how this makes sense in the face of traditional rituals of education. reply rurp 20 hours agoparent> When I was young, I refused to learn geography because we had map applications.

This is certainly useful to a point, and I don't recommend memorizing a lot of trivia, but it's easy to go too far with it. Having a basic mental model about many aspects of the world is extremely important to thinking deeply about complex topics. Many subjects worth thinking about involve interactions between multiple domains and being able to quickly work though various ideas in your head without having to stop umpteen times can make a world of difference. To stick with the maps example, if you're reading an article about conflict in the Middle East it's helpful to know off the top of your head whether or not Iran borders Canada. There are plenty of jobs in software or finance that don't require one to be good at mental math, but you're going to run into trouble if you don't at least grok the concept of exponential growth or have a sense for orders of magnitude. reply casey2 20 hours agorootparentHelpful in terms of what?

Perhaps, but in the case that you are I think it's a stretch to say that the only utility of this is 'indoctrination' or 'understanding this. other forced meme'. The point is that lookups (even to an AI) cost time, and if you have to do one for every other line in a document, you will either end up spending a ton of time reading, or (more likely) do an insufficient number of lookups and come away with a distorted view of the situation. This 'baseline' level of knowledge IMO is a reasonable thing to expect for any field, not 'indoctrination' in anything other than the most diluted sense of the term. reply l33t7332273 22 hours agoparentprev> We talked about \"critical thinking\", \"creative problem solving\", and \"comprehension of complex systems\" as the next step, but even when discussing this, how long will it be until more models or workflows catch up?

And urban city design. And war strategy. And architecture...

This was also the correct way to handle it circa the calculator era.

But instead, we have to live in a world of luddites and authoritarians, who invent wonderful miracle tools and then tell you not to use them because you must struggle. The tyrant in their mind must be inflicted upon those under them! It is far better to spend one class period, teaching the rote long multiplication technique, and then focus on word problems and applications of using it (via calculator), than to literally steal the time of children and make them hate math by forcing them to do times tables, again and again.

But study after study shows that the bulk of engineers are not doing ML/AI work, even after a year of Linkedin putting up those banners -- and if there were even 2 ML/AI jobs at the start of such a period, then 10% week-over-week growth would imply that the entire population of the earth was in the field. Clearly that is not the case. So either those banners are total lies, or your interpretation of exponential growth (if something grows exponentially for a bit, it must keep growing exponentially forever) is practically disjointed from reality. And at that point, it's worth asking: what other assumptions about exponential growth might be wrong in this world-view?

I strongly disagree. I've seen the impact of students who used calculators to the point they limited their ability to do math. When presented with math in other fields, ones where there isn't a simple equation to plug into a calculator, they fail to process the math because they don't have the number sense. Things like looking over a few experiments in chemistry and looking for patterns become a struggle because noticing the implication that 2L of hydrogen and 1L of oxygen create 2L of water vapor being the same as 2 parts hydrogen plus 1 part oxygen creates 2 part water, which then means that 2 molecules of hydrogen plush 1 molecule of oxygen create 2 molecules of water, all of this implying that 1 molecule of oxygen has to be made of some even number of oxygen atoms so that it can be split in half to make up the 2 water molecules which must have the same amount of oxygen atoms in both. (This is part of a larger series of problems relating to how chemist work out the empirical formula in the past, eventually leading to the molecular formula, and then leading to discovering molecular weight and a whole host of other properties we now know about atoms.) Without these skills, they are able to build the techniques needed to solve newer harder problems, much less do independent work in the related fields after college. >Imagine a world where Statistics was primarily taught with Excel/R instead of with paper. It'd be better, I promise you! I had to take two very different stats classes back in college. One was the raw math, the other was how to plug things into a tool and get an answer. The one involving the tool was far less useful. People learned how to use the tool for simple test cases, but there was no foundation for the larger problems or critiquing certain statistical methodologies. Things like the underlying assumptions of the model weren't touched, meaning students would have had a much harder time when dealing with a population who greatly differed from the assumption.

Saying \"Chat GPT helped me write this\" is more like an acknowledgment than a citation. reply Fomite 14 hours agorootparentAgain, it is standard practice to cite things like (personal communication) or (Person, unpublished) to document where a fact is coming from, even if it cannot be retraced (which also comes up when publishing talks whose recordings or transcripts are not available). reply dr_dshiv 7 hours agorootparentprevThis is my point and better stated. I always acknowledge ChatGPT in my writing and never cite it. reply JadeNB 4 hours agorootparent> I always acknowledge ChatGPT in my writing and never cite it. These are not the uses with which I am familiar—as Fomite says in a sibling comment, I am used to referring to citing personal communications; but, if you are using \"cite\" to mean only \"produce as a reproducible testament to truth,\" and \"source\" only as \"something that reproducibly demonstrates truth,\" which is a distinction whose value I can acknowledge making even if it's not the one I am used to, then your argument makes more sense to me. reply ffsoftboiled 21 hours agoparentprevAs an Information Tech Instructor I have my students use ChatGPT all the time - but it never occurred to me to make them share the link.

I liked the data so much I built a quick cross-filter visualization on top of it to help explore it[2]. The data offers a fairly comprehensive and interesting perspective on China's research priorities and organization, I can't speak to the effectiveness of the programs themselves, but it does make me concerned that we are falling far behind in many areas, including cyber security.

So it is starting to be outdated and anyone using it should be well aware of it. It seems that an update is in an early stage. 2) In order to assess the actual risks, the sources that are provided at each institution's page are crucial. These are ommitted in your version. Please consider linking back to each institutions page under https://unitracker.aspi.org.au/ The question: What is the value added of your page over the official page https://unitracker.aspi.org.au/ ? I only see the map. Am I missing something? reply clwg 6 hours agorootparentI’ve updated my link to include the site and wish I had searched more thoroughly as it would have saved me hours; This visualization was more of a personal thing after I stumbled upon it while working within MISP and the raw data(so that's what I initially attributed it to), and just wanted to see it visualized outside of MISP, it's really good analysis. I've also added the references to the individual institution at the unitracker site as well. To answer your question, the visualization is just a simple cross-filter. I guess the differences are the categorized and topic-based breakdowns/filtering, filtering by description and it includes a map. I did consider adding a network graph, but my focus isn't really visualization. reply acheong08 15 hours agoparentprev> we are falling far behind in many areas, including cyber security In terms of quantity and quality of talent, I don't think the western world would fall behind China, especially with their strict control of information. Most people there will have difficulty independently learning about cybersecurity. The difference is that most talent is captured by the private sector with higher compensation or bounties. Meanwhile, China can very easily compel anyone they need into the government so the % utilization on outward attacks is probably higher. reply dluan 15 hours agorootparent> Most people there will have difficulty independently learning about cybersecurity. Speaking from my own limited anecdata, but since the 90s in order to use the internet in China you basically had to be somewhat proficient in \"cybersecurity\" just because of all the required hoops to jump through. There were definitely a lot of script kiddies, but the Chinese exploit scene (amateur and professional) has always been bustling. And just personally speaking, the most truly awe-inspiring and resourceful hackers I've ever known have been Russian, or Chinese. Like actual 10x engineers who think that walls put in place for other people don't exist for them. reply coretx 12 hours agorootparentWestern society is criminalizing and repressing such culture, so China has already won because they fail at doing the same. reply Aeolun 12 hours agorootparentThey are very clear about who is a valid target though. I think you’ll quickly find that those attacking domestic targets rapidly disappear. reply medo-bear 6 hours agorootparentKinda works both ways. In many western countries you still go to jail for refusing to give private encryption keys reply coretx 4 hours agorootparentOr they convict you for money laundry because you developed a crypto phone they can't crack and don't have any legal means to destroy you. ( Dutch example, and yes - the guy payed taxes everything, they made him hang because of a single client of a client his client his client being involved with shady things. ) State-Spite, Repression and such is rising globally. The rule of law is gone. reply richardw 13 hours agorootparentprevAny state actor who puts in the effort can get pretty good, and some countries make a very specific effort in this area. North Korea is one. Imagine the brightest people in your state (say, population 26 million) were all nudged into one very specific talent funnel, with the goal of stealing money for the government. China is different. Not quite as focused in terms of sheer government directive, but just think of the Chinese people you do know and extrapolate out the level of effort and talent. Being overconfident seems like a mistake. reply woctordho 15 hours agorootparentprevEvery ordinary Chinese needs to self-learn some cybersecurity to do daily things, like to watch YouTube, or to send messages to others without worrying being censored reply viraptor 14 hours agorootparentThere's a big difference between using tools intended for general population and being skilled enough in offensive security to make a difference. It may incentivise some people to learn further, but I don't think the effect would be that large. It's kind of like everyone at Uni knowing about P2P a few years ago - but they knew nothing about protocol design. reply throwaway290 14 hours agorootparentprevThe ordinary people have their douyin/bilibili and fear of the party so they don't need to learn those things reply roenxi 13 hours agorootparentWhy would ordinary Chinese people fear the party? The party has been overseeing the greatest expansion of wealth in human history combined with a massive internal propaganda effort which I would assume is pitching them as the good guys and downplays all the brutal stuff they've done If anything I'd expect ordinary people to be far too trusting that the authorities are reasonable and friendly. They must have real problems with earnest, motivated and well meaning people wandering off the approved parts of the internet into censored topics and getting confused by whatever happens next. reply tivert 11 hours agorootparentYou're forgetting all the corruption and hypocrisy in China. Do you think the individuals that make up the authorities act in a \"reasonable and friendly\" towards regular people who interact with them? The contradictions seen by anyone who's paying attention undermine the trust you posit and some fraction of the propaganda messages. It kinda feels like you understand China as a thought experiment and not a real place. reply throwaway290 13 hours agorootparentprevFear getting disappeared/jailed for doing something forbidden. You're right that they may not see it as \"fear of the party\" from inside. More like \"why would I do something illegal\". But in a system like that those things are actually equivalent. reply TaylorAlexander 12 hours agorootparentprev> In terms of quantity At the very least China is generally gonna have everyone else beat on quantity of people involved in quite a lot of things. reply tw1984 9 hours agorootparentcheck AI, green energy, EV, mobile computing, cloud computing, quantum stuff, robots etc. it is pretty much China vs US now when it comes to quality. how many people would seriously believe that EU or Japan can possibly compete with China on its own in terms of quality for those above mentioned sectors. just looking at those low quality & high pollution Japanese & European cars. reply easygenes 9 hours agorootparentIs the last line said ironically? Japanese brands long have and continue to absolutely dominate long term reliability ratings for vehicles, and the first mass market hybrid and full EV vehicles came from Japan. If you’re talking about innovation and mass EV manufacturing, sure the US and China are leading, but the European Volkswagen and BMW Groups are still competitive. Japan is admittedly a laggard in the EV market, but largely because EVs are still a luxury good and Japanese brands are primarily mainstream. reply tw1984 8 hours agorootparent> Japanese brands long have and continue to absolutely dominate long term reliability ratings for vehicles such hard earned experience is no longer relevant in the era of EV. > but the European Volkswagen and BMW Groups are still competitive none of them is even capably of designing self driven cars on their own. same for the AI based infotainment systems fitted on EVs. they are just Canon in 2024/2025. > EVs are still a luxury good I wouldn't call it luxury. It is the cheapest option to own a car in Shanghai, BYD Seagull is being offered for $9k USD. > Japanese brands are primarily mainstream they have already lost the battle. if EV makers can't build their own self driving systems and those AI based infotainment systems, then they are in the wrong business. Batteries is another story that can not be ignored, Japan and the EU do not have any meaningful control on that. I don't see any chance how European or Japanese car makers can survive in mid term. reply medo-bear 6 hours agorootparentprevInteresting also is the type of names that appear in so many western academic journals. What I mean to say is that even in Western journals \"Alice\" and \"Bob\" is quite rare reply tw1984 4 hours agorootparentwhen \"alice\" and \"bob\" can become a lawyer to talk their clients into paying some stupid amount, why bother studying STEM. reply throwthrowee 14 hours agorootparentprev> China can very easily compel anyone they need into the government I have worked with people in Chinese tech companies and in Chinese tech ministries, and I don't think this statement is true, any more than in the US. In the US, there are talented techies who work for FAANG, startups, Palantir, NSA, etc etc. Similarly in China. reply coretx 4 hours agorootparentCompel is a euphemism for a \"friendly\" visit to your wife & children or elderly parents. The western equivalent is to lawyer someone to death. Don't be naive. reply blackoil 14 hours agorootparentprev> especially with their strict control of information. You have gross misunderstanding of how this strict control works. It isn't like novels or North Korea where some govt agency is creating/curating the info. reply equestria 15 hours agorootparentprev> especially with their strict control of information. Most people there will have difficulty independently learning about cybersecurity. I'm puzzled by this assertion. I know quite a few self-taught infosec folks who grew up there. China is not North Korea. The government, by and large, doesn't monitor what you're doing day-to-day, unless you're a political activist or some other \"undesirable\". The Great Firewall doesn't stop you from accessing infosec content; and in any case, the use of VPNs is prevalent among techies. To be fair, the parent's claim that China is \"ahead\" in infosec also feels like fearmongering. The one thing that's true for China is that their government has far fewer qualms about hacking Western infrastructure to get dirt on dissidents, steal IP, and so on.

Yes, the whataboutism is unwarranted here. The US government is no angel, but is far more constrained in this regard. The bar to become \"the enemy of the state\" is much higher - for example, your comment won't get you in trouble here. The US government also wouldn't, say, hack Spotify and snoop on their business plans to prop up a competing US startup - something that is commonplace with the Chinese intelligence apparatus. reply tivert 11 hours agorootparentprev> To be fair, the parent's claim that China is \"ahead\" in infosec also feels like fearmongering.

Having worked in Beijing for 9 years, they pay techies fairly well, not USA FAANG well, but better than Japan, much of Europe, Korea, even Singapore. So there is a lot of private sector movement in these areas, not just government. Information is easily obtained, piracy rates are still very high so it’s not like anything is really locked down behind a paywall. There are plenty of hackers who are in it with a passion, not just for the money, much like you’d find in the states or anywhere in the developed world. reply wordofx 12 hours agorootparentHahahhahahah no way.

In that thread, someone said that rent is expensive in Beijing and Shanghai. It looks similar.

It sounds the cost of living in China is expensive. reply tw1984 9 hours agorootparent> in China I heard that if you go to hospital in a different household registration, you have to pay the full medical costs. When talking about paying such full medical costs, let me share some concrete numbers with you, all numbers are from tier 1 cities like Shanghai - Chest CT scan is 170-200 RMB, or 25-30 USD MRI scan is 260-460 RMB, or 35-65 USD Ultrasound is 20-170 RMB, or 3-25 USD PET CT is 6500 RMB, or 900 USD https://ybj.sh.gov.cn/cmsres/9b/9baabfec6f6c4e3fa03d6289f5e7...

You get paid peanuts because there’s so many people to do the job. reply seanmcdirmid 12 hours agorootparentprevNot in tech. There is a weird de-emphasis of programmers in countries that aren’t the USA or mainland china. So a programmer from Japan with some experience/skills can move to Beijing (yes, there were many Japanese expat SWEs when I was there) for a better salary. reply foohoge 12 hours agorootparentWhat? I'm Japanese but I've never heard a story about changing jobs to Chinese company. I heard a lot of stories about changing jobs to GAFAM. Could you tell me more about that? reply seanmcdirmid 11 hours agorootparentMicrosoft paid more in Beijing than Tokyo while I was there, it turns out even experienced programmers in Tokyo don’t make $200k/year. Especially if you have a PhD or research in a hot field, you can get a pretty good job in richer Chinese cities. But an apartment is probably more expensive to rent in Beijing, and definitely in Shanghai, than it is in much of Tokyo, so there are trade offs. reply foohoge 11 hours agorootparentIt's true that rents in Tokyo are expensive, but Kawasaki or Adachi, where the commute takes about 20 minutes, are cheap. I don't know about the salary, but I checked X or blog and it seems that some are work in the US headquarters, but none in Beijing. Anyway, when are you there? It looks you are talking in 2010. reply numpad0 10 hours agorootparentprevI don't think it's that much of an outrageous claim, plenty of our fellow countrymen works at local regional branches and English wings of China-owned companies these days. It doesn't take much stretch from there to imagine some of them moving to near their HQ. It's annoying that sometimes people thinks there has to be basic mutual intelligibility between Chinese and Japanese languages against the reality that there's none, but this is not about that at all.

In my experience, having lived in the West and in the East, I found that on average, at least in the urban population, people in the communist and ex-communist space seem to be far more computer literate while computer experts seem to mentally get around \"magic and fluff\" much easier. Also the authorities are far less concerned about \"incorrect\" ideologies creeping through (especially through academia) than you probably immagine. reply morpheuskafka 2 hours agoparentprevI came across that group (ASPI) before and wasn’t too impressed. Their name suggests they are a public agency—in fact, though sponsored by the AUS defence ministry, they are non-governmental and funded in part by weapons manufacturers and foreign governments. Their project [0] describes numerous civilian universities as “very high risk,” unnecessarily raising fears that ordinary Chinese students and researchers are dangerous. Especially since students uni choices are heavily determined by gaokao scores, I don’t think placing labels on people based on their undergrad uni as if they handpicked them for whatever defense connections they may have makes any sense. This is what the US is doing with Proclamation 10043 under both Trump I and Biden. Steven Miller, who will be returning to a similar role in Trump II, recently suggested banning all Chinese citizens from student visas in the US, demonstrating this irresponsible rhetorics effect. Moreover, Australia is basically a vassal state of the US for intelligence matters—-see the debate about whether the CIA ousted the only prime minister to question the NSA’s Pine Gap facility on Australian soil.

Like the WestWorld S3 “RICO crime app”. reply webdoodle 14 hours agoparentprevYep. Pretty much the dystopian governments go-to playbook for surveillance. Find a private entity that is providing a communication service they can't spy on, then pressure them to put in a backdoor with threats of jail, etc. Former CEO of Qwest Communications Joe Nachio claims he fought the NSA's initial requests for these backdoors, and was rewarded with being taken to court for insider trading. Remember no one at the top of these companies got there without breaking some rules along the way. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Nacchio reply CarpaDorada 16 hours agoparentprevNo it is not, because these are not backdoors, the entities legally own the data users have provided them and the courts require them to share the data for investigative purposes. When the FBI pressed Apple to break its encryption, it would not had been a backdoor, but simply a different product that Apple would've offered. A backdoor would be a secret exploit that circumvents encryption, or other security methods. reply greycol 16 hours agorootparentYou've probably conflated the saying \"going through the backdoor\" with the noun backdoor, which is an understandable mistake to make. Conflating the two is even easier when the backdoor is morally questionable i.e. When someone purposefully installs a wooden backdoor on a bankvault and says it's so that we don't need to go through the whole rigmarole of opening the main vault-door. Yes it allows them to do their job of checking what's in safety deposit boxes easier but the door itself is an evil. reply grayfaced 15 hours agorootparentA backdoor bypasses legitimate access mechanisms. Whether it is a backdoor or not depends fully on whether you believe lawful intercept is a legitimate access mechanism. And I think the law is on the side of it being not a backdoor. reply greycol 14 hours agorootparentWe've had multiple bills proposed by multiple countries for government mandated backdoors. Multiple articles refer to how these bills would create backdoors, multiple computer security experts say the bills would create backdoors in the software. Under your definition of the word they'd all be using the word incorrectly because logically no bill could create a legal backdoor by definition. It's seems there's a semantic schism on \"the point in software where security is weak enough (either purposefully or unkowingly) for 3rd party access by a 3rd party\" and \"the point in software where security is purposefully weakened for 3rd party access by the legal requirement of a 3rd party\" there's definitely a distinction but I generally conflate the two, perhaps incorrectly, under the word backdoor. If you've got another more appropos word for this purposeful and legal weakining of security for non primary user/provider access I'd love to know it because sadly I feel I'd use it fairly often in the coming years. reply CarpaDorada 14 hours agorootparentThese articles use the word \"backdoor\" for effect, for example . The bills you refer to by multiple countries simply want their own in-house wiretapping apparatus, because they don't want to be dependent on the US. Specifically, I'm thinking of EU's \"chat control\". Ironically those who oppose it are unwittingly doing the bidding for a more powerful US. The internet is fully wiretapped and there is no end in sight. reply greycol 13 hours agorootparentNo they use the word backdoor because there is no better word for these pathwatys/purposefully created weak spots in access to the software. Seriously please give me one that emphasises the security detriment to the 1st party user and i'll happily use it instead. I'll also add that ironically those who don't oppose these bills are unwittingly doing the bidding of strategic adversaries as demonstrated quite adequately by the PRC here. reply Lvl999Noob 13 hours agorootparentprevA backdoor in the technical sense (which is the real topic of this whole conversation) is one that bypasses the known way of entry. For an \"End to end encrypted\" communication channel, a backdoor allows someone to view the communication without being on either of the \"ends\". The problem is not whether the backdoor was legally mandated or not, and whether legal authorities are misusing them or not, the problem is that it exists. And the existence by itself is enough to let someone ignore any legal mandates and view the comms. reply CarpaDorada 15 hours agorootparentprev\"Using our backdoors\" is what was said, not \"going through the backdoor\". Backdoors have a very specific meaning in computer security. US law enforcement is not using backdoors to access the data of US companies. reply uptownfunk 14 hours agoprevHow many are there that we don’t even know they are targeting.

HN isn't exactly a representative sample of the sort of people who benefit from EU labour protections. reply nradov 15 hours agorootparentprevMan, nothing makes me appreciate USA labor laws like reading the HN comments. I (unironically) love how it's easy to get a job here; since firing is easy, employers are more willing to take a chance on hiring someone. Plus it would suck as an employee to be forced to give your employer 4+ weeks of notice if you want to resign. Whereas in the USA with at-will employment we can quit tomorrow with zero notice and suffer no financial penalties. reply DanielHB 8 hours agorootparentI have worked both in the EU and in Brazil and I do have to say that the Brazilian system is better. Labor protection is high (25 vacation days, guaranteed overtime pay, etc), but companies can still fire people. However doing so involves paying severance proportional to how long you been at the company. When you leave a company you need to give one month notice (so you can't just get up and leave). I never seen a \"layoff\" (you get notice that you are leaving, but still have your job for a few months and usually no severance) like they do in the EU. When you are fired, you are out of there the same day with your severance and unemployment benefits. This specific practice does have a few problems: 1) companies not firing about-to-retire employees who have been at the company for 10+ years because of the huge severance required. Instead they just wait for them to retire. However employees also really don't want to get fired in their last few years either before retirement because of how the pension system works, so it balances-out. 60+ year old people usually take it easy, but they are usually not just showing up for a paycheck. 2) Younger employees trying to get fired instead of quitting. If you been at a company for 3-4 years and you want to leave it is really a lot more beneficial to get fired instead. I have seen this happen, but not nearly as much as you would think (at least in IT). Although you would think companies would want to \"recycle\" employees by firing them every year to prevent the severance from piling up. The math doesn't really work out like that on top of all possible disruptions of such high attrition rate. reply Wytwwww 7 hours agorootparent> like they do in the EU EU is certainly not a single country and states have sometimes wildly different rules and labor laws. That specific situation is impossible at least in some countries. reply DanielHB 6 hours agorootparentI used quoted \"layoff\", in my experience when people are let go it happens during a reorganization mediated by an union where some positions are found to be unnecessary and people are given notice that their employment is being terminated but still work for a few months. Since this is mediated by an union it only happens if there is a good reason (usually financial problems). I never seen it on an individual case basis it is always multiple people at the same time. reply Wytwwww 50 minutes agorootparentYes but in some EU countries it's very unlikely that any union would be directly involved and the company would still be required to pay severance. reply ryall 13 hours agorootparentprevMust be nice to work under the eternal threat of being laid off on a whim. reply Wytwwww 7 hours agorootparentMaking an extra $50-150k+ per year (as long as you are in the correct field) might be very well worth it though? reply nradov 12 hours agorootparentprevIt's nicer than the alternative. reply regularfry 20 hours agorootparentprevI wouldn't be surprised if it's even more straightforward than that. They've got some very expensive office space that's extremely under-utilised, and they're probably at risk of the rent getting raised on a lot of it unless they can increase footfall. reply ghaff 20 hours agorootparentIf you have way-underutilized office space that you can sell or not renew leases on, you can shed it like a former employer was doing when I left. Otherwise, there's basically no value in how many or few people are filling the space unless they're actually delivering some business value to the entity paying for the lease. (Unless, maybe, it relates to promises made to some local jurisdiction that gave you tax breaks.) reply DanielHB 8 hours agorootparentYou underestimate the \"it looks bad on my numbers\" effect. For example, if you have real state that you can't get rid of, for the company it doesn't matter if the people use it or not if it doesn't affect productivity. But it sure does matter for some accounting department close to the CEO. It is like that old adage that goes along the lines \"Tell me the incentives and I will tell you the outcomes\" reply regularfry 19 hours agorootparentprevA lot might depend on how long a lease was signed, and what penalties there might be for breaking it. reply ghaff 19 hours agorootparentSure. Breaking leases have costs. But the cases I have some direct experience with are generally simply not renewing them. reply galleywest200 19 hours agorootparentFor what it is worth, Amazon has built (as opposed to just rent) very large buildings in Seattle, WA and Bellevue, WA.

Well, now these offices are vacant and the high paid workers are not even in the city like Amazon promised.

Grandparent is implying that all the execs making the RTO decisions are personally invested in business real state (why would multiple execs own a bunch of downtown real state?). Although a point could be made for companies who own their real state wanting to prop its value up before liquidating (so a pump and dump) it still stretches believability. You are implying most companies really think that much about long-term unquantifiable effects. I can see a better argument being made about executive with big ego likes sitting at the top of his ivory tower (his top-level corner-office) looking over the masses below him. reply heavyset_go 1 hour agorootparent> Grandparent is implying that all the execs making the RTO decisions are personally invested in business real state (why would multiple execs own a bunch of downtown real state?) That is not what I am implying. The owner/investor class have portfolios that depend on commercial and prime real estate holding, and continuing to increase in, value. They might not personally own buildings themselves, but they own companies and financial instruments that do. Maybe execs themselves are lucky enough to be that asset rich, maybe they aren't, but it's their jobs to call the shots based on the desires of their respective boards. reply grugagag 5 hours agorootparentprevIm not implying most companies think long term, just the very large ones and their interests are tied to some commercial real eastate they don’t want to lose on.

Raised, because the property owner has other investments that are affected by the presence of people, such as nearby restaurants and stores?

They're paying a lot in rent. 2. if they don't have workers in the office, then, adjacent spaces for ex. food service is less valuable. 3. If adjacent space is less valuable, the landlord is motivated to raise Amazon's rent to compensate 4. Therefore, they're making people go back to work to avoid rent increases 4 years on, and it seems a little bit odd it took that long for it to play it. But it seems (much) cheaper and sensible to find somewhere else to rent than give in to a threatening landlord who sees you as responsible for any shortfalls in adjacent revenue, instead of the anchor tenent you are. reply hn72774 18 hours agorootparentAmazon owns most of its downtown Seattle real estate. Low occupancy means balance sheet write downs, and higher cost of capital. reply reaperducer 19 hours agorootparentprevIf adjacent space is less valuable, the landlord is motivated to raise Amazon's rent to compensate Real estate is very much driven by supply and demand.

And I am genuinely trying to discuss a policy, not to be argumentative. I am also not assuming it's any better than remote. Maybe it is, I have no clue.

I wouldn't feel like I had to defend that policy to anyone. Put another way: why would Amazon need data for this? What's wrong with simply telling people they have to come in? If you don't want to come in, why not just find a remote job? reply BriggyDwiggs42 17 hours agorootparentThey’re legally allowed to do this already. We’re questioning why they’re doing it because it could still be an action driven by bad motivations, which would inform us more as to the nature of amazon and its leadership. reply 8note 16 hours agorootparentprevThe culture of Amazon is to demand data and anecdotes for every decision, and how that will make customers better off. > If you don't want to come in, why not just find a remote job? This is why it's described as a layoff, and they should just announce that it's a layoff and do their paperwork. reply makeitdouble 16 hours agorootparentprevYou are discussing a different point IMHO. The parent is focusing on the PR aspect of it. Amazon gave ample justifications for their moves, even if they had no obligation to explain anything, as you point out. Given they put their reasoning on the table, it's fair game to question it and call bullshit. > What's wrong with simply telling people they have to come in? On this very specific point, and irrelevant to the thread, I see a company of the size of Amazon as having more social obligation than a startup selling rainbow headphones for instance. I don't know if their shareholders see it that way, and it is totally legal for Amazon to not give a shit. But that's what I'd see as \"wrong\", in a moral sense. reply idiotsecant 16 hours agorootparentprevYou don't have to defend it, but if your motivations are that you want to have some measure of control over the serfs you own, be prepared for people to also mock and scorn you for it.

It all depends on the original understanding of when an employee came on board. If you hired someone with the understanding that it's a remote position and there is nothing that requires to be present in the office (e.g. lab work or doctor/nurse), then if you want them to suddenly come in, you do need to defend it.

Interest rates, and the value placed on the buildings. The latter will be driven almost entirely by occupancy rates. > So the answer to “why does Amazon care about occupancy rates” is that by driving those rates up, it can maximize the valuation of its properties, decrease to loan-to-value ratio of its financing, and secure the best interest rate possible. > The size of the prize is massive. > One point of difference in the interest rate attached to a commercial loan across a 10-year term equates to $100M in interest payments. Given Amazon will need to refinance several billion in commercial real estate over the next few years, the stakes of increasing occupancy could have a billion dollar price tag.

Zapier has grown strong and steady, 100% remote, Deel has grown quickly since 2019, also 100% remote etc. Clearly none of these businesses have issues collaborating. >Some of these issues wouldn't manifest themselves in a measurable way until more than a year later. So measure it as long as it takes. 1-2 years is a blip comparatively, and lots of companies already have internal data they could use to make this determination: look at employee performance and satisfaction rates before they worked from home and compare it to after they worked from home. Lots and lots of people worked at the same place before WFH became far more common, and after it became far more common. I imagine this is true at Amazon as anywhere else it would be.

My point is Why should anyone have to cater to either Person B or Person A? Whichever choice a company makes, someone is going to be dissatisfied. There are no right or wrong choices here, just choices. The employees have choices, too.

Converting an in-person culture to a remote culture can be hard and many companies haven't done a good job. A functioning team can go remote, but over team, many companies are starting to see where it falls down. For example, you don't have a culture of writing things down and decisions are made it meetings, or informal conversations. Tons of a context gets lost. Also discussions must be serialized. Most \"planning\" sucks over remote meetings because of this. Things like breakout rooms help parallelize discussion - but companies that are async first can run rings around the \"marathon meeting\" type cultures. Working in person smooths over many of the inefficiencies and minor disconnects this causes. And onboarding and training new people is much harder remotely ... if you don't actually have an onboarding process. In person, people can somewhat onboard by \"learning through osmosis\" and the natural connections of just meeting people, building report, helping them out. A few zoom training sessions and then getting tossed in the deep end is going to work for some people, not for others and then will bring an organizational toll over time. Companies like GitLab have remote-first ways to approach this ... but without similar investment, things will degrade. And third, it is that is much harder to gain visibility and micromanage a remote team. If you don't have good async processes, written culture, or metrics, managers can get in the trap of \"not knowing what everyone is doing,\" not being sure if they are on track for success or failure. Plenty of ways to avoid this, but plenty of things are much harder without approaching them from a remote-first mindset. Interpersonal issues on the team: old playbook, take them out to lunch for coffee for an informal conversation. New playbook, avoid or have an awkward conversation over a 30 minute 1:1 zoom, where you could be being recorded so nothing of consequence is said. Checkin on sales to see if the quarter is on track: walk down the sales area and assess the vibe. Tons of a excitement and backslapping and gongs, no worries; everyone looking glum, I need a have a deep conversation with the regional manager. New playbook: review salesforce data that you know is bullshit and are frustrated you can't figure out why things aren't like they used to be.

Good vibes are meaningless, they simply make someone feel better perhaps, but you really think because some sales people are having a good time it means sales are good? I don't think I'd rely on that, feels like a recipe for bad surprises. Also, you could just talk to people, like before. There's no rule against talking to people who work from home. These examples all seem outdated on both sides, and not realistic to me. Seems like asking management to adapt is the real sin. Yet these same management types decry so much about everyone else getting accommodated. I remember a time when people said 'businesses adapt or die'.

I don't think this is something that can be said generally - I have been in companies that worked much better in person, and in companies that wouldn't work without remote. I have no idea which one is Amazon. Ultimately though, I think this is a cultural choice - the companies that worked well in person specifically hired only people who wanted to work in that way. Some changed their mind during the pandemic, and they were asked to move on. I don't think they were wrong. I was one of these who went away, and I joined a remote first global corporate with people from all over the world. I had a blast working there and nothing like it would be possible otherwise.

They found zero reduction in employee productivity or career outcomes, and a 35% reduction in turnover in the hybrid cohort. So, yeah, you absolutely can A/B test company culture. (One might argue that Amazon already A/B tests company culture -- the culture within AWS and Amazon Retail are wildly different.) reply cj 17 hours agoparentprevI think it’s simpler than this. Managing people remotely is hard. Most managers still aren’t good at managing remote employees. When managers aren’t managing well, “productivity” goes down (however you measure it). So managers internally advocate for RTO because it’s easier to manage people when they’re in person. (Many people also miss the office, but that group tends to be way less vocal on HN) And since the company already has the office space, RTO is “free” to do. And if they’re already looking to cut head count, attrition as a result would be icing on the cake making the decision even more appealing to upper management. In other words, I think RTO would have still happened 4 years after Covid regardless of whether companies are trying to reduce staff or not. “They’re secretly using RTO to fire us” doesn’t make much sense - companies are very capable of doing layoffs. Hiding or disguising the layoff is more work than just flat out laying people off.

Even if you replace (a) with a proper video chat solution, it's a much, much narrower channel than real interaction between people where people perceive all these tiny non-verbal signals like changes in posture, gestures, mimics, breathing, and you can actually point a colleague to something with your finger, all in real-time. So, no, from my perspective, online interactions are very sad and simple, compared to real-world interactions. I work in a low-latency field, maybe I'm more sensitive to latency. But I find all those narrow communication channels a nuisance. I find it frustrating to have to rely on a variety of tools to achieve collaboration: Chat, video chat, digital whiteboard, code sharing. There is so much friction, at least in my workplace, to switch between those tools or to combine them. This can surely be improved, but there are things that naturally can't disappear, like latency.

I don't see well enough to identify most objects when someone points from across the room anymore, let alone to read someone's screen in the tiny font sizes the average person uses or cope with light mode.

That might be important to you, but to other people it may not matter at all, and for still others it is actually a negative. Consider that for a neurodivergent, or disabled person, all those non-verbal signals could easily be misinterpreted, or missed by one side or the other. Likewise, such signals could have different meanings in different cultures. And for some people face to face communication is stressful or emotionally draining. That's not to say that virtual communication in any medium completely solves those problems, or that such non-verbal communication doesn't have any value.

And there are some other factors that include more pre-COVID events and travel. But basically, a fairly hard switch to pure-video conferencing meant that, for the most part, I basically didn't establish new relationships (with some exceptions) to most people before I left. It wasn't sustainable but it was a fairly short runway. More generous travel budgets and more event travel would have helped certainly.

Which to iterate my understanding, its this: Google was founded and everyone worked in an office together, Google is a $2.5T marketcap company, therefore Google's work culture could only be created, fostered and maintained in an office setting and therefore Google is successful because they all worked an in office together. You can't actually prove the assertion that being in office makes the difference here at all. For instance, the article you linked t talks about the way two friends collaborated. The backdrop happens to be an office, but the office setting itself is not what made the collaboration successful. Merely, the fact they shared so much and worked collaboratively so closely is what let them to be successful, but nowhere in the article does it say \"well we could only do this if we were in person with one another\". The office is the backdrop to the story, its not the reason it happened. Also, you're throwing an entire field under the bus that our entire industry definitely builds on, which is business & management theory (aka social science), but if we couldn't use social science to make informed decisions, why do so many startup founders read things like 'Zero To One'?

Ah yes, that must be why execs at Google are incentivizing hiring in lower cost-of-labor locations like India and central Europe, and placing very large barriers in the way of business travel that would normally encourage knowledge-sharing and foster collaboration, all while forcing people back into the office and discouraging fully remote roles. I'd like to also point out that Alphabet's market cap was $0.9T back in March 2020 when WFH due to COVID started, and more than doubled in the ensuing year and a half (it was just shy of $2T back in Nov 2021). Further, during that same timeframe, the S&P 500 rose about 70%, so there's a fairly strong correlation between Google's market cap in this timeframe and overall stock market performance. ... which is a long-winded way of saying that I would not place as much stake in Google's current market cap being driven by the in-office culture as you seem to. (Speaking as someone who's been employed at Google throughout this period and then some.) reply LtWorf 19 hours agorootparentprev> Edit : Butthurt HNers downvoting a perfectly logical argument.

Nothing about the company’s organizational structure or resources are set up to be optimized for this. It’s like asking someone to play tennis, but you gave them a baseball bat. reply devjab 20 hours agorootparentI worked in digitalisation for a Danish city during Covid. Since I was the HR “data guy” I worked on every sort of metrics for them and sometimes had to sit through meetings just in case someone needed a technical explanation. I think that happened twice, but it’s been some years since. Anyway, I got to see the data on employees working from home. The short story is that efficiency and productivity went up but “hours worked” went down. Well, “hours spent active at the computer” and by that I mean not just keeping teams greens but actually doing things, went down. Which was taken to mean work, even though it could’ve been people doing their social media, shopping or whatever. The key take away for most of the decision makers involved was that productivity increased. Then they do the law required AMR and psychological evaluations that we do here in Denmark. It’s basically a questionnaire where you rate your mental well being, how the physical environment is and so on. For office workers the physical part is mostly about the air quality, but in a municipality you have employees who are physically assaulted from time to time, so the results can be pretty wild. You might expect that some of the groups working with Alzheimer, or some of the more violently mentally ill, patients. Employees who work in the department which removes children from bad parents. Such groups. Would be absolute outliners in these sort of analytics, and they were. The one group who scored higher on unhappiness, stress and a few other parameters were middle managers. So during Covid it was apparently worse to be a middle manager than someone who gets physically assaulted. Anyway, the positive reports were sort of buried. Unless you’ve worked in public service you probably don’t know what that means, but it basically comes down to bureaucrats vs politicians. So you might have someone with a candidate (or several) degrees in public management and a couple of decades of experience advice a janitor who is popular enough to have been elected to office for whatever reason. Obviously the bureaucracy wins. So they all went back to the office to keep the middle managers happy. I certainly don’t know how it’s like at Amazon, but I hope you can use my anecdotal story to see that it’s not always about productivity. Especially because measuring productivity in hours spent in office doesn’t show the same output as it would for someone standing at an assembly line. reply throw16180339 20 hours agorootparentprevIf nothing else, home offices can be a lot quieter than the usual mix of plague ward and bazaar that defines modern work environments. reply georgemcbay 18 hours agorootparentThis is a big factor for me, especially as someone who has been doing software development for a long time. When I first started it was typical to have individual offices, or at worst office sharing where you shared an office with one other dev who was likely trying to keep distractions to a minimum as much as you were. Now almost every workplace is an open office plan, hot desk swapping hellscape. If offices were like they generally were when I first started I would be a lot more personally pro-RTO, but the way they are these days I much prefer to work at home in peace and quiet. (Of course, the peace and quiet aspect will vary based on the particulars of everyone's homes/families/etc). Traffic is of course the other major factor. As someone who lives in Southern California, the commute time from where I live to where I work is either 15 minutes or an hour and a half based on traffic congestion and its pretty freeing to not have to worry so much about preplanning your commute to minimize the likelihood of landing on the bad side of this. reply flappyeagle 58 minutes agorootparentI say this as someone who’s worked from home for the last six years of my career pre-Covid I would never want to work at Amazon or Facebook or whatever while being remote. You’re leaving half of the benefit of being at those places on the table. reply karaterobot 20 hours agoprev> “We continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant.\" I presume that's believe in the sense of faith, rather than believe in the sense of drawing reasonable conclusions from evidence. In other words, what are those advantages, and how do you know they exist at all, let alone their significance? As I recall, Amazon did pretty good during Work From Home, so why not start with the hypothesis that WFH is actually good for Amazon, then try disproving that with evidence. If their Return to Office plan is itself a secret experiment to do just that, I apologize for jumping to the conclusion that they are making decisions under a combination of the sunk cost fallacy with respect to their commercial real estate, and the insane impulse to satisfy their management layer, while simultaneously shrinking their overall workforce size. reply slibhb 19 hours agoparentIt seems obvious why companies want employees in the office. Namely it's a lot easier to shirk while remote. If you do valuable work and prefer remote then your employer ought to make an exception. That's how things were before COVID (default in the office; WFH negotiated on a person-by-person basis). It makes sense to get back to that. reply bayarearefugee 18 hours agorootparent> Namely it's a lot easier to shirk while remote. In my long experience as a software developer its actually not this way at all in practice and is actually the inverse of your claim. In practice I've seen that it is actually much easier for lower productivity employees to get by on vibes alone while they spend all day browsing reddit/social media/HN/etc when everyone is in office, whereas when you are remote your actual output tends to be much more openly documented. Sure, when working from home you can go take a 1 hour nap in the middle of the day, which you can't do in the office, but such \"shirking\" as snapshots in time don't equate at all to actual sustained productivity (and in fact, being able to nap randomly during the day I've found is often a huge productivity boost if anything). reply slibhb 17 hours agorootparentIn my experience, a lot of remote empoyees not only do very little work but also are unresponsive. So when you need them, it's hours/days before you hear back. Even if people are unproductive in the office, they tend to at least be responsive. If someone actually works well remote and is responsive then they should be allowed to continue. reply bayarearefugee 15 hours agorootparentMy experience is very different than yours I guess. My coworkers respond in a timely manner to my slack messages. It might not be immediately, but I mean, there's almost never a situation in which I need an immediate answer. And in the cases where there is a delay I find that I still get the response quicker via slack than I would in person if I tried to find the person while they were at lunch in person and then had to go out of my way to try to find them again in the future, whereas the slack message allows for slightly async comms without me having to keep making requests which in my experience is more than adequate to get the job done. Perhaps you need a lot of hand-holding day to day but everyone I work with does not. reply koyote 17 hours agorootparentprevI see no difference in someone being unresponsive by not being at their home desk hours (days??) at a time than not being at their in-office desk. If it's an actual persistent issue with the employee and they are not on a pip, then that's a management issue. The amount of times that I have had to go to the numerous different kitchen areas only to find out the employee left the building to get coffee or run an errand is just as high if not higher than someone being 'away' on Teams when I need them. Only at home I just set an alert for when they're back online instead of attempting a wild goose chase. reply jjeaff 10 hours agorootparentprevthe more responsive someone is, the less busy they are. unless they are doing work that is so easy that constant interruptions don't matter. reply Spivak 17 hours agorootparentprevYou're basically arguing for WFH where working in-office is a PIP-lite so I'm not sure what you're arguing. reply Liquix 18 hours agorootparentprevThe way to get employees to not shirk their duties is to incentivize them with what they want: $$$, increased leisure/family time, opportunities for career advancement. Either the hiring process or the company culture are at fault if someone can't be trusted to deliver without a middle manager staring at them. If an employee isn't performing what's asked of them to a satisfactory standard, discipline and/or fire them. If they're non-physical laborers getting things done on time who'd rather not work in an office, there is no reason to force them to work in an office. reply slibhb 18 hours agorootparentI doubt giving someone who isn't doing a lot of work more money/leisure/status is going to motive them. reply consteval 2 hours agorootparentConversely, I doubt punishing them would make them work harder either. If anything, I would expect lower their quality of life can only further erode their quality of work. reply karaterobot 15 hours agorootparentprevBy \"easier to shirk while remote\" do you simply mean that it'd be logistically easier for an employee to do it if they wanted, or that people are actually doing it more? I don't deny the first, but I think the second requires evidence I have not seen. Have you seen evidence, and by that I mean methodically gathered, rigorous evidence, not anecdotes? And then the next thing you'd want to demonstrate is that shirking your work duties more at home is actually, in practice and on net, damaging for overall company productivity. I mean, it's entirely possible that enough people both work less, and get more done in a more conducive environment. For example, by working in intense, focused bursts, then fucking off for an hour, then coming back to work hard again. As opposed to being forced to sit at a desk in a cubicle all day, surfing the web, hating your life, and doing as little work as possible even though you are physically proximate to your manager. That's a testable thing. We can find that out, but to my knowledge no companies who are mandating RTO have gone to the effort. Instead, they're going with what seems obvious to them. reply consteval 2 hours agorootparentPersonally, I will deny the first. It's much easier logistically to slack off in office because you can use charisma and politics to your advantage. You can make yourself seem productive, while not actually being productive, much easier in an office environment. Just talk a lot, talk loudly, and talk confidently. Fake it till you make it. Also, if you just look smarter, like if you're tall, white, and a man, that helps. If you're wondering, this is why managers often suck. The ability to perform well in office politics and your performance/understanding are pretty much completely orthogonal. Slackers get promoted all the time, because they're likable and you're not. In a WFH environment you can't do this, so more emphasis is on your actual work. You can't swindle people with a pretty face and confident timbre. Or, at least, not anywhere close to the same extent. reply akira2501 18 hours agorootparentprevThey build this work force in the office. People went through their probationary period in the office. They were moved home out of concern for health. While you may be able to do this, I'm not sure it's so easy to sustain it, or to replace the hiring model with a fully \"hire into WFH\" mode. Running a company is a lot more than putting a time clock on the wall. reply nfRfqX5n 18 hours agorootparentprevI think now many folks would ask why can so and so work from home when I can’t? And management is not willing to tell others that some other person is just better and more reliable than you can reply Der_Einzige 12 hours agorootparentprev\"Shrink\" is what you call good WLB. The cosmic justice for dealing with a life-time of hatred from those around you for being a tech-bro/nerd (see hatred of \"coastal elites\" from MAGA) is that since they don't actually know what you do or how to measure you, it's extremely easy to make a mountain out of a mole hill on any technical issue. In literally every organization, tech job, or related I've been in, the amount of real hard work expected of you was almost inversely proportional to your compensation. Those paid the most were sitting in meetings all day, talking. No matter how much they cope and claim it's hard, it's easy compared to coding all day. This is why we still maintain the idea of \"he has management written all over him\" to the people who actually see through it and speak truth to power about how dumb most of the make-work that's being done actually is. The reality is that if you make it clear that you're willing to do a lot of grunt, annoying, stupid work because someone tells you to do it - they will naturally treat you worse for being gullible enough to uncritically do it. Those who buck the trend are treated well in American tech jobs.

They did this 4-5 times despite my insistence that we keep all correspondence written and over email and despite me fulfilling all listed documentation requirements.

These are the people making you billions and billions of dollars. And their jobs very clearly do not require them to work in an office, nor does it sap productivity, as years of experience and multiple studies confirm. And people could previously work in the office if they wanted to, so it's not like anyone was alienated before. It's like the execs are just sadists. There's no upside. reply sswaner 18 hours agoparentRather than call the Amazon execs liars and sadists perhaps consider that the senior execs (Andy and his directs) believe that they are responsible for crafting a successful company. It is far more plausible that they believe that while it may have worked to have remote workers, that they WANT a company that has the features of an in-office culture and feel it is within their right to take that path. Unless you think that you would be a lying sadist if you rose the ranks to senior leadership, why do you think that the Amazon leaders are somehow different? reply 0xbadcafebee 15 hours agorootparentActually I was being charitable. I was only assuming their decision is from spite. If I also assumed they thought this was good for the company in the long run, I'd have to assume they were idiots. There is no rational, data-driven argument against optional remote work. Even the one downside of it (not getting promoted) could be solved by an employee just opting to go into the office. Everything else is a plus, for the company and the employee. The company saves on real estate, salaries, can hire anywhere in the world, and gets increased productivity [and profit]. The employee gets flexible hours, choice of living arrangements, and improved quality of life, which then benefits the company as improved morale/loyalty. reply Wytwwww 6 hours agorootparent> There is no rational, data-driven argument against optional remote work If we ignore tangentially relevant (from the company's perspective) stuff like employee wellbeing etc. the same could be said about WFH. reply consteval 2 hours agorootparentSure, but employees are not machines and companies should realize this.

I think it's safe to say Amazon is openly creating a work environment hostile to people who have disabilities that prevent them from working in an office.

Just like during WFH, but with the time and expense of a commute. reply WhoSevenCow 9 hours agoparentThat's exactly what happened at my company. They said return to office three days a week, then half the devs quit. They frantically put together new smaller teams based on who had which skills. But I live in an expensive city that everyone moved away from when they could work from home. Therefore all the other devs had no choice but to quit as they couldn't come in, and the people I'd handed stuff over to recently were all in different offices. So I ended up coming into the office three days a week just to sit on Microsoft Teams. And then the managing director had the cheek to tell me that wasn't in the spirit of coming back to the office.

    "originBody": "Lessons from my First Exit November 13, 2024 33-minute read tinypilot In April of this year, I sold TinyPilot, the bootstrapped hardware company I founded and ran for four years. I wrote a post in May that told the story of the sale, but I’d like to share more about the practical lessons I learned from the experience. In this post, I’m sharing what went well, what I want to improve in the future, and what surprised me about selling my business. Table of contents 🔗︎ Details of the sale What I’m glad I did Invested heavily in documentation Created a transition checklist Worked with a broker I trusted Avoided seller financing Assumed I’d get nothing after closing Recognized the limits of my influence on the business post-close Revised the broker agreement so that the broker gets paid when I get paid Discussed contentious issues without lawyers first Used dedicated accounts for the business What I’ll do differently in the future Offer incentives for a cash buyer Discuss key contract terms earlier in the process Begin working with a lawyer earlier Create an unofficial “small stuff agreement” with the buyer Announce the sale to my team later Don’t catastrophize every setback Reveal vendors earlier, but put tighter restrictions in the LOI Eliminate inventory from the broker’s commission Assume from the start that nothing written is private Define what happens to money flows around the time of closing In the transition agreement, value calendar days more than work hours Disconnect non-transferable accounts from business email before closing Take even fewer dependencies on Google What surprised me Due diligence is unbounded, high-stress work As you prepare to sell, everything costs 4x as much You don’t strictly need a broker to sell If the non-compete is too restrictive, you’re screwed If there’s no cap on liability, you’re screwed Buyers have incentive to keep the seller happy Resources that helped me prepare Details of the sale 🔗︎ Sale price: $598,000 (2.4x annual earnings) Broker commission: $88,900 Legal fees: $18,297 My profit from the sale: $490,803 Payment terms: Full cash payment at closing (no earnout, no seller financing) Seller obligations: 30 days of free consulting (max of 80 hours total) Lifetime profit from business (including final sale): $920k over four years What I’m glad I did 🔗︎ Invested heavily in documentation 🔗︎ Before I started my first business six years ago, I read the book Built to Sell by John Warrilow. It encourages founders to build businesses that run smoothly without the founder actively managing day-to-day activities. An effective company should have a set of well-defined processes and a team that knows how to execute them. I’ve always loved reproducible processes, so when I started building the team for TinyPilot, I invested in documentation. Rather than train people in person or on video calls, I wrote playbooks in our Notion workspace. If we ran into issues with our playbooks, we’d revise them to reduce errors in the future. When new team members joined, they’d onboard via the same playbooks, and we’d continuously improve them. After I sold TinyPilot, the contract called for a 30-day transition period, during which I would provide up to 80 hours of consulting time. The buyer only needed about 25 hours. The team already knew how to run the day-to-day of TinyPilot, and the buyer had access to all of our documentation. Most of my time post-transition was just introducing the new owner to the team and our key vendors. Created a transition checklist 🔗︎ As I prepared the company for sale, I started a checklist of everything I wanted to do before selling. It included things like deleting obsolete playbooks and ensuring that all of our account credentials were in the company Bitwarden account. As we entered due diligence, I expanded this checklist to include things that would need to happen during the transition. I split the checklist into four categories: Things that must happen before closing Things that must happen a day or two after closing Things that should happen within the first week after closing Things that should happen within the first month after closing The checklist turned out to be extremely valuable, especially the week of the closing. So many accounts were changing hands, and processes needed tweaking for the new owner, so it was helpful to have a checklist I created in calmer times. Worked with a broker I trusted 🔗︎ I used to have a negative view of M&A brokers. When I thought “broker,” I imagined someone who just wanted to close deals as quickly as possible and didn’t care about anything else. I imagined them saying things like, “Let’s bottom line this,” or “Time for Jäger bombs!” When I attended Microconf in 2023, I met Chris Guthrie, an advisor at Quiet Light Brokerage. He immediately came across as laid-back, low-pressure, and founder-focused. He was a former founder, and he emphasized the importance of finding the best deal for the founder, not necessarily the quickest payout. I appreciated working with Quiet Light because our incentives felt aligned throughout the process. The pool of bootstrapped founders looking for M&A brokers is small and relatively tight-knit, so Quiet Light has natural pressure to maintain a positive reputation. In discussions about the sale, some people balked at Quiet Light’s $89k fee, as it represented 15% of the sale price. I still think that was a fair commission, as they found me a buyer I couldn’t have found on my own and kept the deal on track throughout the process. Avoided seller financing 🔗︎ I didn’t need cash desperately, so I was initially open to a buyer paying me in installments over several years. When I spoke to other founders, they warned me away from seller financing. As one founder put it: If you finance the purchase yourself, you now work for the buyer. I was puzzled. How does financing the sale mean I work for the buyer? The founder explained that you don’t get paid unless the business makes money, and the new owner knows that. The new owner can push management responsibilities onto you, knowing that if the business fails, you can’t collect your debt. The other risk of seller financing is that I, as a small lender, don’t have tools or experience to collect a loan if a buyer defaults. The buyer might decide they simply don’t feel like paying me even if they have the cash on hand. For a deal that’s under $1M, I’d probably spend more in legal fees than I could hope to collect from an unscrupulous buyer. I would have been open to seller financing had there been no other options available, but it would be a red flag to me that the buyer couldn’t secure a loan from a bank. Further, I’d need to charge well above prevailing interest rates because my risk would be higher than a bank’s. Assumed I’d get nothing after closing 🔗︎ From talking to other founders about their exits, most people seemed disappointed with the payments they were supposed to receive after closing. In some cases, the buyer failed to honor the contract, but it was too small an amount to litigate. In other cases, the new owner used creative bookkeeping to avoid paying performance-based bonuses. The advice I heard consistently was to structure the deal so that if I got nothing after closing, I’d still be happy. I should treat anything after closing as an unexpected bonus. The buyer and I did send some money back and forth after closing to account for little costs that we forgot to include in the deal, and that went smoothly. These amounts were a tiny part of the overall transaction, less than $5k. Had the buyer refused to pay, I would have been frustrated, but it would have been easy to move on. Recognized the limits of my influence on the business post-close 🔗︎ One of the most important criteria for the sale was finding a new owner who wanted to continue investing in the product, the team, and our customers. I asked other founders for advice on avoiding a buyer who’s out to gut the company and squeeze everything for short-term profits. Their advice was that I can’t control what the new owner does after closing, so I shouldn’t think about it. It’s true that I can’t control how the new owner runs their business, but it’s possible to screen out risky buyers. For example, if a private equity company like Idera approached me, I’d notice that they have a history of buying companies and laying off their staff, so I’d have a good guess about their plans for TinyPilot. I looked for buyers whose vision for the company aligned with mine, but I also recognized that my influence over the company ended on closing day. The new owner runs the business his own way, but his approach matches what we discussed about his vision for the company. I didn’t guarantee this outcome, but I think screening buyers increased my odds to some degree. Revised the broker agreement so that the broker gets paid when I get paid 🔗︎ The first draft of Quiet Light’s broker agreement said that their fee is a percentage of the purchase price, and it’s due at closing. The problem was that I, as the seller, may not receive the full purchase price at closing. I sign with the broker well before I know the terms of any deal they might find for me. If the purchase agreement involved deferred payment, I’d have to pay Quiet Light upfront and wait several years until I received my full payout. Worse, if the buyer failed to make payment after closing, I’d have paid a broker commission on money I never received. I requested that Quiet Light revise their broker agreement to say that they only get paid when I get paid, and they quickly agreed. I was relieved that they were willing to adjust the contract, as the new payment terms kept incentives aligned between me and Quiet Light. They’d have just as much desire to push back against deferred payments as I would. Discussed contentious issues without lawyers first 🔗︎ The buyer’s attorney drafted the asset purchase agreement for the sale rather than using a pre-made template from the broker. For the most part, we agreed on the initial draft, but there were a few key terms where we had different expectations. We could have each told our lawyers what we wanted and had them hash it out, but lawyers get expensive fast — mine was $550/hr. Lawyers also slow down the process. The buyer and I could usually arrange to meet within one business day, whereas it would have taken a week to arrange a meeting with both of our lawyers. For a process that already felt long at three months, every day mattered. When the buyer and I ran into disagreements in the contract, we’d first talk one-on-one. In these conversations, my goal was to go past the contract terms and find out the underlying need. For example, the first draft of the contract called for tight restrictions on discussing the sale publicly. I spoke with the buyer about why the clause was there, and it turned out that there were only a few things the buyer cared about keeping private. We adjusted the wording from “you can’t discuss anything publicly” to “you can’t discuss these two specific things publicly,” and we both felt good about the compromise. Used dedicated accounts for the business 🔗︎ Part of what made TinyPilot’s ownership handoff smooth was that its accounts and infrastructure were totally separate from my other business and personal accounts: I always sent emails related to the business from my @tinypilotkvm.com email address. I always used @tinypilotkvm.com email addresses whenever signing up for services on behalf of TinyPilot. I kept TinyPilot’s email in a dedicated Fastmail account. This wasn’t true at the beginning. TinyPilot originally shared a Fastmail account with my other businesses, but I eventually migrated it to its own standalone Fastmail account. I never associated my personal phone number with TinyPilot. Instead, I always used a dedicated Twilio number that forwarded to my real number. All account credentials were in Bitwarden. After closing, handing over control was extremely straightforward. I just added the new owner to Bitwarden, and they took over from there. There were a few hiccups around 2FA codes I’d forgotten to put in Bitwarden, but we worked those out quickly. What I’ll do differently in the future 🔗︎ Offer incentives for a cash buyer 🔗︎ The last time I bought a house, I requested a 10-day inspection period. I wanted to do standard checks with an inspector and an electrician before completing the purchase. The homeowner pushed back and asked me to limit the inspection period to seven days. They were worried about the cost of keeping the house off the market for an extra three days. And that’s a house! Its price is far more stable than a small business. I didn’t realize how much it would cost to take my business off the market for three whole months. Three months of due diligence meant three months where I was distracted from the business and spent 50% of my time on the sale itself. It also disincentivized long-term investments, as they’d reduce short-term profits and deflate the company’s valuation. One of the biggest factors for closing time is how the buyer finances the purchase. In TinyPilot’s case, the buyer used a loan from the US Small Business Administration (SBA), which typically involves three to five months of paperwork and approvals. For TinyPilot, the time from signing the letter of intent to closing day was three months, so we were on the quicker side, but it still felt dreadfully slow. The other subtlety of a bank loan is that it complicates the closing contract, which means you spend more on lawyers. Working through the requirements from the bank and the SBA probably consumed $10k in lawyer time on each side, so even if I accepted a lower price from a cash buyer, I’d make some of it back by reducing closing costs. Cash deals involve fewer decision-makers and require less paperwork and bureaucracy. I’ve heard of cash deals closing in 30 days or less. If I sell another business, I plan to offer incentives that make it easier for the buyer to purchase in cash. I could offer a discount for a cash purchase or make other accommodations to attract buyers who can purchase in cash and make a fast close. Discuss key contract terms earlier in the process 🔗︎ The most stressful part of the sale was the contract negotiations, and I’m still not sure how to do it better. I didn’t see the first draft of the contract until five weeks into due diligence. By that point, I felt like I was already in a terrible negotiating position. I’d invested so much time and revealed so much during due diligence that I felt exhausted and afraid of starting the whole process over with a new buyer. It would be wonderful if the buyer had to present the entire purchase agreement at the letter of intent stage. That way, if I saw terms I didn’t like, I could request adjustments before ever taking TinyPilot off the market or participating in due diligence. The problem is that buyers don’t want to spend thousands of dollars of lawyer time drafting a purchase agreement before they’ve gotten some commitment from the seller. What I’ll try next time is to negotiate a few terms I care about at the letter of intent stage. I’d want to include things like: Short transition time Limited restrictions on confidentiality Seller liability is limited to 50% of the sale price Begin working with a lawyer earlier 🔗︎ When I started talking with a broker, I also found an M&A law firm to represent me in the sale. The lawyer reviewed the broker agreement, but I didn’t reach out to them again until I had the purchase agreement from the buyer. I never asked my lawyer to review the letter of intent, as I figured there wasn’t much value in paying a lawyer to review something that wasn’t legally binding in the first place. In retrospect, it would have been helpful to involve my lawyer at that stage, as the letter of intent sets a baseline for the purchase agreement. Had I met with my lawyer earlier, they also would have helped me with other due diligence tasks like reviewing my existing contracts and gathering documents the buyer or lender would request later. Working with a lawyer at the letter of intent stage also would have been a good opportunity to find out if I liked working with my lawyer. I ended up feeling dissatisfied with mine, but by the time I saw the issues, it was too late to replace him. Create an unofficial “small stuff agreement” with the buyer 🔗︎ TinyPilot had a physical office that was a short drive from my house but a plane ride from the buyer, so they didn’t want to keep it. We had about $1k worth of equipment in the office, but the value was spread over so many small items that the cost of liquidating it would cancel out whatever proceeds we’d collect. For example, we could sell our printer for $40, but the cost of interrupting an employee’s normal work to sell a printer is higher than $40. Still, the stuff in TinyPilot’s office was a business asset, so the buyer and I felt like we had to define in the asset purchase agreement what should happen to it. We spent several hours enumerating everything of value in the office, working out a timeline of when the buyer would clear it from the office, and how long I’d extend the lease to facilitate that. The buyer and I probably spent $2k on lawyer hours trying to work out how to handle $1k worth of stuff that neither of us wanted. If I were to do this again, I’d propose to the buyer a “small stuff agreement.” This would sit outside of the official legal documents and maybe have some header at the top saying, “Nothing in here is a real legal agreement.” And that’s where we could define things where we need to decide something, but the stakes are so small that if one side breaches the agreement, it wouldn’t matter. Announce the sale to my team later 🔗︎ When should an owner announce a potential acquisition to their team? If you keep the sale a secret until the deal closes, you’re effectively lying to your team. If you’re completely transparent about the sale, you bear enormous risk. Members of the team might threaten to leave unless you offer them bonuses or promotions. Or the looming sale might kill their motivation and tank their job performance. I had a good relationship with every member of TinyPilot’s team, so I didn’t think anyone would use my candor against me in bargaining. That said, people do unexpected things when a relationship is about to end. I chose to reveal the sale to the team at the earliest formal step of the process: when I signed the agreement to begin working with my broker. That ended up being six months before closing. I regret that decision slightly. Nothing catastrophic happened, but announcing the sale affected management dynamics in certain cases and made it harder to work with employees on performance issues. To the team, an acquisition meant the new owner could fire them or drastically change their role. If they wanted to interfere with the sale, they could scare off a buyer and slice $50-100k off the valuation. Worse, they could delay the sale and leave me in a position where I’m managing the company, trying to prepare it for sale, and caring for a newborn all at the same time. I didn’t want a bad outcome for anyone, but the worst case for me was significantly worse than the worst case for any other member of the team. If I do this again, I’d wait to tell my team about the sale until it’s a done deal, but I’d also make sure the team knows that an acquisition is always a possibility. I’d explain before I even start looking for a buyer that an acquisition might happen, and that the team won’t necessarily know it’s happening. If it did, I’d prioritize a buyer whose vision aligns with the team’s interests, as I did with TinyPilot. This strategy is not ideal or fair to everyone, but it feels like the least bad of many flawed options. Don’t catastrophize every setback 🔗︎ I found the due diligence process quite stressful and demoralizing, but I made it even harder on myself by catastrophizing everything. Every time there was even a potential obstacle in negotiations, I began imagining exactly how this obstacle would ruin everything. I’d ruminate about the bad outcome so much that I’d feel like it already happened, and the deal was dead. For example, TinyPilot uses the H.264 video encoding algorithm. It’s patented, so we had to get a license from the patent holder before we shipped that feature. During due diligence, we discovered that the patent license forbade me from transferring the license in an asset sale. I immediately started imagining the worst possible outcome. What if the patent holder realizes they can block the sale, and they demand I pay them $100k? What if the patent holder just can’t be bothered to deal with a tiny business like mine, and they block the sale out of sheer indifference? I played out negative scenarios all day, and it kept me awake for hours that night. The next morning, the buyer emailed to say they’d already heard back from the patent owner. The wheels were in motion for a new license. I’d freaked out when there was no evidence of a problem in the first place. If I sell a company in the future, I hope to worry less about potential disasters. I need to remember to sleep on things and see how they feel in the morning. Reveal vendors earlier, but put tighter restrictions in the LOI 🔗︎ An experienced founder advised me to withhold the names of TinyPilot’s critical vendors until after the deal closed. They explained that you can force the buyer to sign something promising not to use the information if the deal falls through, but it’s hard to enforce that on small-scale deals. The only way to protect the information is not to share it at all. I withheld the names of my vendors, but I wouldn’t do it again. As part of due diligence, I had to share the last two years of TinyPilot’s bank statements. Our vendor’s names appeared frequently in the statements, so I had to go through a hundred PDFs searching for each vendor’s name, manually drawing black rectangles over them, and rasterizing the PDF to prevent leaks in the metadata. A few days later, I sent an inventory report to the buyer and was horrified when he replied, “Who’s FooCorp?” “FooCorp” (not their real name) was the very web-searchable name of TinyPilot’s electrical engineering vendor. I forgot that the report mentioned them, so I didn’t redact it before sending. And then just a few weeks later, the buyer’s bank firmly insisted on seeing vendor names, so I had to reveal everything anyway. If I sell a business in the future, my strategy will be to create a contract that forbids the buyer from acting on insider secrets they learn in due diligence. I’d guard trade secrets more carefully if I were selling to a competitor, but my default would be to rely on the contract to discourage bad behavior. Hiding the names of key vendors makes due diligence so much harder. On top of all the contortions to withhold information, missing a single redaction can undo hours of tedious work. Eliminate inventory from the broker’s commission 🔗︎ My only regret about my broker agreement with Quiet Light was that their commission included the value of TinyPilot’s inventory at the time of the sale. The value of TinyPilot’s inventory could vary by a factor of four depending on where we were in the manufacturing cycle. It makes no sense to pay the broker $20k if my inventory happens to be high vs. $5k if my inventory is low. Worse, I was selling my inventory to the buyer at cost. It’s not like the broker can negotiate a great price on my unsold inventory and earn their commission that way. If I have $100k in inventory, I only receive $90k for it after paying the broker their commission. The more inventory I had, the more money I’d lose in the sale. That said, I got lucky, and the deal closed when TinyPilot’s inventory was at its ideal level for the sale. On closing day, we were a couple of weeks away from placing our next manufacturing order for the subsequent eight months. That was perfect because we were low but not so low that the new buyer was coming in understocked. On top of that, there’s wiggle room in calculating inventory value for the broker fee, and Quiet Light calculated it in a way that was especially generous to me. Still, the broker fee on inventory was one more layer that made timing stressful. If the deal had stretched out another month, I’d have lost $10k on additional broker fees for the inventory. If I do this again, I’ll push the broker to eliminate inventory from the fee, even if it means giving them a higher percentage of the sale price. Assume from the start that nothing written is private 🔗︎ The acquisition was for TinyPilot’s assets, including all company emails. This seemed reasonable, as a lot of institutional knowledge is buried in old emails. As I started thinking more about the sale, I realized that some of my email would be complicated to hand over. What if an employee had said something that was personal and private? As a fictional example, imagine I had an email from an employee that said, “Ever since my father died, I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression, and I’ve been feeling unproductive.” That email would be to Michael, their human co-worker, not Michael, the corporate owner of TinyPilot’s email assets. It felt strange and cold to sell that email to the new buyer. Fortunately, I worked out an agreement between the buyer and the team that before closing, anyone could flag private, personal emails, and I’d purge them before closing. There were also other sensitive emails, like conversations with my lawyer about the acquisition itself. I didn’t want the buyer to see our private discussions even after the sale was complete, so the purchase agreement excluded those emails from the sale. In the future, I’d make two changes in how I approach emails in my business: Make sure everyone on the team understands that in the case of an acquisition, any emails and meeting notes will transfer to the new buyer. When working with lawyers and brokers on the sale itself, do it from a separate email account from the business I’m selling. Define what happens to money flows around the time of closing 🔗︎ When we reached closing day, we realized the contract left a lot of ambiguity around who’s entitled to money flowing in and out of the business around the time of the closing: How do you split bills for services that straddle the closing (e.g., a monthly charge that will be billed again a week after closing)? What happens to money in PayPal or Shopify that hasn’t yet transferred to your bank? Who pays when a customer purchases before closing but requests a refund after closing? Who receives revenue from sales on closing day? Who pays employees for work on closing day? Who pays fees associated with closing (e.g., escrow fees)? The buyer and I found amicable resolutions for everything after the fact, but I wish we had answered these questions more explicitly in the closing contract. In the transition agreement, value calendar days more than work hours 🔗︎ Most acquisitions have terms around how much work the seller agrees to do after the sale to help the buyer with the post-close transition. My initial offer to the buyer was that I’d do free consulting for two weeks after the closing for up to 40 hours per week. After that, he could purchase consulting hours from me at $180/hr for up to 10 hours per week. The buyer counteroffered 30 days of free consulting with a maximum of 80 hours total. That is, the same total hours stretched over a longer period. I knew a longer transition period would be a better deal for the buyer, but I didn’t realize how much it would cost me. Even though I was available for 40 hours per week, the buyer couldn’t really use all of those hours. He’s taking over a team of six employees and learning to run everything, so it’s hard for him to direct my time enough to fill 40 hours per week right out of the gate. I ended up only working about 10 hours per week, but there was still a high cost to me being available every workday for 30 days. There was nothing in the contract about how quickly I had to respond to emails, but I checked my TinyPilot inbox every hour or so. If I did two hours of transition work in a day, it was often spread into several 30-minute chunks, so I didn’t get much else done. Disconnect non-transferable accounts from business email before closing 🔗︎ Sales below $1M are usually asset sales, meaning that the buyer is purchasing assets from the business but not the business itself. So, I technically still own a company called TinyPilot, but I transferred all of its physical and intellectual property to the new owner. The few assets I kept were TinyPilot’s banking and payroll accounts, as they’re bound to the LLC itself. The problem was that I forgot to change the email address on those accounts before I handed over control of TinyPilot’s email to the new buyer, so they still had @tinypilotkvm.com emails. I worked with the new owner to fix the email address on those accounts, but I wish I’d done it myself before transferring TinyPilot’s email. Take even fewer dependencies on Google 🔗︎ All of TinyPilot’s account credentials were in Bitwarden, so transferring ownership of accounts was smooth. I just added the new owner as an admin in our Bitwarden organization, and he took possession of all the accounts. The one account that couldn’t transfer over was Google. I used Google Cloud Platform for some TinyPilot services, and I had a dedicated TinyPilot GCP project, but it was within my personal Google account. There’s a big “Migrate” button at the top of the GCP project settings page, so I naïvely thought pushing that button would let me — I don’t know, migrate the project to the new owner’s GCP account. When the sale closed, I finally clicked that button and immediately saw this error message: GCP’s project migration docs are a maze of confusing and incorrect instructions. The gist seemed to be that the new owner and I would each need to create paid Google Workspace accounts and go through some complicated process from there. We had a similar issue with some notes and old documents that I’d stored in Google Drive. The new owner decided it was too much hassle to do the official migration, so I exported what I could, and we deleted the rest. In general, I’ve tried to minimize my dependencies on Google, both personally and professionally. Google frequently burns me on corner cases like these, so this is a further reminder to depend on them even less. What surprised me 🔗︎ Due diligence is unbounded, high-stress work 🔗︎ I greatly underestimated how labor-intensive the due diligence process would be. At the start, I thought due diligence would be somewhat tedious but still straightforward. The buyer had already seen two years of profit and loss statements before they even signed the LOI. Maybe they’d spot-check a few bank statements to verify that my numbers were real. Perhaps I’d have an opportunity to show off my immaculate bookkeeping ledger, of which I was quite proud. It turned out that the due diligence process required me to share all of my bank statements from the last two years. And that was just part of the first round of requests. As we proceeded further into the due diligence process, I needed to create lots of one-off reports to demonstrate different aspects of my business, like how frequently our customers make repeat purchases or which platforms account for what percentage of our revenue. I didn’t want to expose customer data, so I did custom processing on our reports to avoid leaking customer details. But the more I customized the reports, the more I risked introducing errors into my records. And if I made an error, the buyer would have grounds to sue me later for selling the company based on fraudulent data. So, even for simple reports, I felt stressed about doing them perfectly. A non-cash buyer makes it harder to push back on due diligence requests. The buyer was presenting me with requests from both himself and the bank. The bank was hard to negotiate with because they didn’t care if the deal fell through. I was more comfortable pushing back against the buyer because he had skin in the game and was motivated to make a deal. But I can’t ask the buyer, “Is this request coming from you or from the bank? Because if it’s you, I’m going to say no; if it’s the bank, I’ll say yes.” As you prepare to sell, everything costs 4x as much 🔗︎ When you sell a small business, the sale price is usually some multiple of your profit or revenue. If your annual profit was $100k and businesses like yours sell at 3x annual profit, then you could sell your business for roughly $300k. Now, imagine you decided to give one of your employees a $10k bonus. Your profit drops to $90k, so your business is only worth $270k. Giving your employee their $10k bonus costs you $40k: the initial $10k you paid plus another $30k in deflated valuation. It’s not just bonuses — everything you spend money on is 4x as expensive as you’re preparing to sell. If you need to buy someone a new laptop, that $1k laptop now costs $4k. You don’t strictly need a broker to sell 🔗︎ I liked Quiet Light and have no regrets about using them as the broker to sell TinyPilot, but I was surprised to see that I didn’t strictly need a broker. My only frame of reference for a deal of this size is buying or selling a house. In that process, the broker does a lot of things I don’t understand or know how to do like listing on MLS or ensuring we’re following municipal regulations for the sale. Quiet Light’s main contribution was finding a buyer, as that’s something I couldn’t have done on my own. After that, they’re outside of the critical path of the deal. Once we found a buyer, the heavy lifting of getting the deal to close was on my M&A lawyer to prepare and negotiate all the legal documents. The M&A broker should provide guidance to keep the deal on track, which Quiet Light did. They even found a new lender when the buyer’s lender backed out. But if my broker had disappeared after the LOI, we could have completed the sale without a broker, whereas I couldn’t have closed without a lawyer. If I sell a business in the future, I may forego a broker if I can find a buyer independently. As a first-time seller, it was worth 15% of the sale price to have an advisor on my side from start to finish. Now that I have more experience, I’d feel more comfortable going through the process on my own, but I valued the broker enough that I’d always keep the option open. If the non-compete is too restrictive, you’re screwed 🔗︎ If a big tech company hires me as a developer, and the 500th page of my contract says I can never write software for any other company, a judge would likely reject that non-compete as unfair and unenforceable. If, however, I sell my company, and the purchase agreement says that I agree to never work in software again, a judge might hold me to that promise. My lawyer warned me that judges are stricter in acquisition agreements, as they assume I had reasonable bargaining power and awareness of the agreement. If I signed a bad deal, it’s on me. When reviewing TinyPilot’s purchase agreement, my lawyer carefully reviewed the non-compete clause with me to ensure that I was only agreeing not to work in the domain of KVM over IP devices rather than software or technology in general. If there’s no cap on liability, you’re screwed 🔗︎ When you run a business in the US as a corporation or an LLC, the most you can ever lose is the value of the business itself. If your business is worth $100k, and someone sues you for $5M, the worst that can happen is that they take your business. They can’t take your house, car, or first-born child — only the assets under the business itself. That’s what “limited liability” means in limited liability company (LLC). My lawyer warned me that when I sell my business, I lose limited liability protection. If the purchase agreement didn’t limit my liability to the buyer, the buyer could later sue me for any amount, even if it exceeds what they paid in the acquisition. The buyer’s lawyer originally wanted my liability to be uncapped. My lawyer pushed back and said I absolutely shouldn’t sign anything that exposes me to liabilities above the sale price, and the buyer’s lawyer eventually relented. Buyers have incentive to keep the seller happy 🔗︎ One of my fears in the process was that after I handed over all of TinyPilot’s accounts and domains to the seller, they’d lose incentive to cooperate with me. What if the buyer forgets to update the billing information on one of the accounts, and I get hit with a $2k credit card charge? What leverage would I have to make the buyer reimburse me? I trusted the buyer, but you also never know how people will behave when power shifts. It turns out that even if a buyer wants to cheat, the seller still holds the leverage of institutional knowledge. The buyer doesn’t want to screw over the seller for $2k only to realize a month later that they need the seller’s help to access some critical account. So, a nice balance of power keeps both sides on their best behavior. Resources that helped me prepare 🔗︎ One of the hardest things about the acquisition was how much of it was completely new to me. It’s hard to practice for an acquisition, as even experienced founders only go through a few acquisitions per lifetime. The most valuable things I did were to read about small business acquisitions and to ask other founders about their experiences selling their businesses. The following were the resources I found most helpful in approaching my exit: John Warrilow’s books and podcasts Built to Sell was helpful in understanding how to design my business from the start for a potential acquisition. The Art Of Selling Your Business covered the practical considerations of the sale itself. Built to Sell Radio, Warrilow’s podcast, tends to feature larger, less tech-focused companies. I listened to episodes with founders that seemed closest to my situation. My favorites were Natalie Nagele and Laura Roeder. I appeared on the show after my exit. Privately telling other founders I’m thinking of selling I didn’t know many people who had been through acquisitions, but I discovered that I knew people who knew people. A few friends put me in touch with people they knew who had experience going through acquisitions, and those were some of the most informative conversations I had. Microconf, an indie-focused founder conference I met Quiet Light at Microconf. It was helpful to meet several brokers in person and choose who felt like the best match. The conference attracts a lot of founders who have been through acquisitions, so it was helpful to ask attendees about their experience selling companies. Blog posts I learned a lot from reading blog posts about acquisitions written by other indie founders. My favorites were: “I sold Baremetrics” by Josh Pigford “What it’s like buying a $128k side project” by Kareem Mayan “Exactly How I Cold Emailed My Way to A Life-Changing Exit (And You Can Too)” by Laura Roeder In April, I sold my first business. Even though I'd done a lot of research about small business acquisitions, so much of the process felt like uncharted territory that nobody discusses publicly. I wrote about everything I wish I'd known before selling my business. [image or embed] — Michael Lynch (@mtlynch.io) November 13, 2024 at 9:05 AM Cover image by Piotr Letachowicz.

If the purchase agreement didn’t limit my liability to the buyer, the buyer could later sue me for any amount, even if it exceeds what they paid in the acquisition.” “Sales below $1M are usually asset sales, meaning that the buyer is purchasing assets from the business but not the business itself. So, I technically still own a company called TinyPilot, but I transferred all of its physical and intellectual property to the new owner.” Aren’t these contradictory? If it’s an asset sale, the deal is between TinyPilot LLC and the buyer for the assets. reply amccollum 4 minutes agoparentI don't know about the author's case, but often asset purchase agreements will make the principals / shareholders party to the agreement personally with specific liability provisions. If there are no assets left in the company, the buyer has no recourse against it, since it is essentially an empty shell. As a buyer, you will want to have some protection against issues you don't know about at the time of sale (perhaps because you weren't told about them, or the seller was negligent). reply mtlynch 37 minutes agoparentprevAuthor here. Yeah, that seemed strange to me, too, but that was how my lawyer told me it worked. And the buyer's lawyer cared enough to fight about the exact amount of liability, so I assumed the buyer's lawyer felt that way as well. In practice, it seems like liability protection would have to change in some way otherwise the seller could abuse the system. Like imagine that I sell the new owner $200k worth of inventory and then the new owner discovers that, unbeknownst to either of us, the inventory has some kind of defect and is unsellable. If the buyer comes back and says, \"Hey, I want my $200k back,\" it would be strange if I'm allowed to say, \"Oh, too bad for you. I've shut down the LLC that sold you that inventory and moved all the money to my personal accounts, so there's no money for you now.\" reply ffjffsfr 6 hours agoprevgreat write up. > $920k over four years so this gives an average yearly salary of 230k.

And that’s without doing any of the borderline or outright illegal stuff that I see many other business owners do, such as taking fancy vacations, leasing luxury cars, or buying real estate for personal use but writing them off as business expenses. The IRS basically now lacks the resources to go after most such cases, and even if they’re caught, the penalty often just amounts to paying back the avoided taxes. There’s really very little incentive to play by the rules. I’ve had CPAs tell me outright that I’m leaving money on the table by not using some of these so-called tax minimization strategies. Anyway, it’s all kind of beside the point because “tax the rich” as policy covers so much ground that it’s impossible to discuss the pros and cons without specifying what specific proposal we’re talking about. My point is simply that business ownership and entrepreneurial activity are already quite well incentivized/rewarded by the current tax code. reply hartator 3 hours agorootparentWhat are these miraculous tax deductions you are talking about?

Your worst case is you lose the deal and the time and money you spent on it, and their worst case is they are fired and lose their healthcare (that is how it works in America right?), is that correct? reply mtlynch 3 hours agorootparentThanks for reading! >Your worst case is you lose the deal and the time and money you spent on it, and their worst case is they are fired and lose their healthcare (that is how it works in America right?), is that correct? Yeah, I get that perspective. As I said, I don't think there's any good solution here. I don't think it's fair for me to hand the company over to someone who might just fire the employees, but I also can't promise to keep everyone in their role forever regardless of a sale. For added context, everyone at the company worked part-time, generally a max of 20 hours per week. Some were contractors who had multiple clients, others were founders with their own side projects, and others worked part time because they wanted to focus on other things in their personal life. Nobody had healthcare insurance through the company. So, in the worst case of an owner coming in and firing everyone, it would suck, but it's also not like anyone would be like, \"Oh no! I just bought a new house on the expectation that I'd be at the company for the next 20 years!\" The worst case for me isn't just that I lose some time and money. I was terrified of not being able to sell the company by the time my son was born. I was the sole founder and manager, so I can't exactly say, \"Okay, I'm going to take a few months of paternity leave. Pay yourselves and our vendors while I'm gone.\" So I'd be probably in a position of letting down both the team and my family trying to keep the company afloat while becoming a new father. reply depr 3 hours agorootparentAlright, thanks for answering my question! reply LouisSayers 28 minutes agoparentprevOne thing that wasn't really covered was: why did you sell?

Now that you've been through this process, how would you go about finding a buyer yourself? Also, are there any resources you found valuable for starting your business? How did you go about hiring your first employee and setting everything up for them as employees? Again, thanks for the writeup and congrats on the sale! reply mtlynch 3 hours agorootparentThanks for reading! >Now that you've been through this process, how would you go about finding a buyer yourself? It would have been tough to find a buyer. Before I met Quiet Light, I was worried a broker wouldn't take me, and I'd have to find a buyer myself. So my plan was to (in order) start more loudly telling other founders that I'm looking for a buyer, reach out to more adjacent companies pitching them on a strategic acquisition, discuss on my blog that I'm looking for a buyer, and if all else fails, put up a banner on the store website saying the company is for sale. The problem was that the more loudly I advertise the company is for sale, the more obvious it is to buyers that I'm desperate to sell. It also risks spooking customers who might not want to buy hardware from a company whose ownership is about to change. >Also, are there any resources you found valuable for starting your business? Minute for minute, the best resource I've found is Jason Cohen's talk, \"Designing the Ideal Bootstrapped Business.\"[0, 1] The key insight for me is that bootstrapped businesses have very different strengths and weaknesses than a VC-backed startup, so you should pick a business that plays to those strengths. I also enjoyed Start Small, Stay Small by Rob Walling [2] and The Mom Test by Rob Fitzpatrick[3]. The tl; dr from those is that you need to avoid the trap of building something for months and then looking around for customers once it's done. You instead should flip it and talk to customers before you even start and find out what they need. It's not a book or resource, but one of the most valuable things I did and wish I did it earlier was create a course. It's a very condensed version of the experience of bootstrapping a business because you need to identify a need, create a product that fills the need, then market it to customers. And you don't have to be the world expert on anything, you just need to know enough to get someone who's at level N to level N + 1 and who likes the way you explain things. And you can pick a small topic and create a course with 30-100 hours of work. I spent 60 hours on my first course, and it made $10k, so it's not like a smash hit, but it's the highest ROI thing financially I've done since quitting Google. >How did you go about hiring your first employee and setting everything up for them as employees? In the first few months, I was assembling all the devices, packing boxes, and printing out instruction sheets myself. It wasn't sustainable because I was also trying to write code and do customer support. It was during COVID and my wife and I were quarantining strictly, but she also was looking for a job since she was in grad school, so she was employee #1. We started with just Google Docs. I'd write things and share them with her, and she'd ask questions or make updates. My next hires were developers, which was a pretty dumb decision because it's the most expensive role, and it's the job I like doing most myself. I was finding that I didn't have time to advance the product because customer support was taking too much time, so I should have hired a customer support person. But I hired devs because I'd hired devs before and worked with a lot of devs, so it was a role I felt comfortable hiring. For that, I tried to add lots of automated checks on Github and document things there. I also wrote guidelines on my blog that became official guidelines for devs within the company.[4] We moved into an office in early 2021, and at that point, I had to hire real W-2 employees rather than contractors. For that I used JustWorks, which I hated. I switched to Gusto, and they were poor but not terrible. In the future, I'm going to avoid creating a business that needs W-2 employees because in the US, it's just set up so badly for small businesses to manage the paperwork around it. As we were moving into the office, we also switched from Google Docs to Notion, and I had a good experience with Notion. It's set up well for internal documentation, and it's user friendly, so it's easy for everyone to do basic searching and editing. I could go on and on about hiring, but those are the biggest things that come to mind.

Q: personal guarantee loans/contracts I know it's common practice for lenders & commercial real estate to make small business owners personally guarantee the loan/contract. Did you have any of this? And if so, how did you unwind those contract? reply mtlynch 3 hours agorootparentThanks for reading! No, the only place where I was personally on the hook was credit cards, but that was fine because I just paid the balance and closed the accounts. I maybe had to give a personal guarantee to rent our office, but it was $600/mo and the landlord was extremely laid back and agreed to month-to-month after our lease was up. I didn't take out any small business loans to start the business, as I started it with my own cash, and then it generated enough revenue to sustain itself. The buyer may have had more complicated agreements with his lenders to purchase the business, but I wouldn't be exposed to any of that. reply gwbas1c 3 hours agoparentprevJust wanted you to know that I've been looking at a lot of your blog entries for Tiny Pilot over the last few years.

I do still love the independence of working for myself, so I'm happy to have had the last six years of that rather than feeling unfulfilled at Google.

Or does that force you to go upmarket as hobbyists need only the minimal feature set? To be clear, I'm totally gone from the company at this point, so I'm not thinking about strategy for TinyPilot at all anymore. But I will say that every year, I'd see a new KVM over IP pop up that claimed that they were going to undercut TinyPilot by 60%. And then they fizzle out, and I never hear from them again. My suspicion is that people see TinyPilot and say, \"Wow, that looks like $100 worth of hardware being sold for $400!I could do what they're doing and sell for $200 and eat their lunch and still make $100 on every unit!\" But then as you get into it, there are all these more subtle costs like compliance testing, tariffs, customer returns, insurance, etc. And that's before you even get to customer support. For a KVM over IP, you can't just give customers a \"have you tried turning it off and on again?\" support response because the issues are more technical and deal with things like NATs and proxies. So if you're making $20 per sale on a low-cost device, and then the customer has one conversation with a support engineer, you lost your profit and probably would have been better off not selling to them at all. So, I think there's room to reduce prices as hardware prices come down, but I'll be surprised if other vendors can slash prices to below $100 and still run profitably in the long-term. reply dbacar 6 hours agoprevThanks for sharing with such clear concise information.

Dedicated email address: yes. Dedicated bank account: no, not from the start. What bank do you use that will give you a dedicated account for every business idea you have before you even know if it will materialize into something? I have a business checking account under my sole proprietorship before I know if the business will turn into anything. A few months into TinyPilot, I registered an LLC and created dedicated bank accounts at that point. But there's so much work and friction in opening a business bank account in the US that I couldn't possibly do it as soon as I have the idea for the business. I had ~10 other businesses that flopped before TinyPilot. It's impractical to have dedicated bank accounts for each one ready to go on day one.

    "commentBody": "New York City Council Votes to End Broker Fees Squeezing Renters (bloomberg.com)244 points by JumpCrisscross 21 hours agohidepastfavorite154 comments beisner 20 hours agoThis is a win for price competition - the \"broker fee\" paid by the renter is a classic example of principal agent problems / information asymmetry. First, the service is being provided to the landlord (listing, tours, etc.), not the client, for all listings these days (I don't know any young person who has ever used a renter's agent, except maybe if it's provided in a relocation package). The renter has no choice in which broker to use to find/transact w/ the property, so there's very little price pressure for these broker fees. Second the information asymmetry - the terms of the fee are completely opaque in the listings, and are not disclosed basically until signing unless you press brokers earlier. So there's basically no competitive pressure pushing these fees down, since it's basically a \"junk fee\" from a user experience perspective tacked on at the very end (and not listed on listings), and the landlord - who IS in a position to negotiate on price - doesn't care. I don't buy the argument that there will be some long-term price hike in rents as a result of this decision - people who rent for 1-5 years already are paying a MASSIVE \"net effective\" premium for having an additional month's rent tacked on up front - but also it strongly incentivizes tenant retention (e.g. by being more responsive, keeping prices lower, etc.), because the landlord does not want to have to eat a broker's fee next listing. reply aclimatt 19 hours agoparentPerfectly said on both counts. Rents, unlike broker fees, are highly transparent prices that are far more influenced by market pressure and competition, a win for buyers in a market already very lopsided toward sellers. Because broker fees are disclosed selectively and later in the purchase funnel, buyers (renters) often make less optimal and more expensive choices due to that information asymmetry. There definitely will be a small spike in the cost of rentals, but 1) it will definitely not be a perfect 12-15% transfer from what the fee costs, and 2) I predict that downward price pressure will bring rental costs around what they are now, especially given the prevalence of no fee units. The cost will likely just cut into landlords' revenue, and anyone claiming prices will rise substantially are probably lobbying on behalf of landlords. reply mistrial9 16 hours agorootparentWhatever lecture this came from needs to get a reality check -- \"downward price pressure\" on rental units in most of the USA was slowly disappearing until the COVID-19 lockdown, at which time the prices increased dramatically, across the board, in all markets (except maybe the Ohio valley? Mississippi ?). Secondly, AirBnB gave reliable revenue streams to property owners, across the western world, keeping units empty. Third, local government has converged on artificial constraint of construction in many markets. reply mattzito 16 hours agorootparentIn NYC, rents went way down, to the point where there was a sticker shock from people who moved to NY during Covid and were shocked when prices went back up a year or two later. reply ch4s3 1 hour agorootparentYeah I got 3 months free to stay in my tiny Gowanus apartment.

Buildings were offering 12 month leases with 4 months free. So when things normalized in 2021/22 people were facing 33% rent increases and then the pace of the increases basically never slowed down until this year. reply matwood 10 hours agorootparentWhich makes sense if you look at demand. We went from people will never live in cities again at the height of covid, to things like revenge travel and everyone wanting to give big cities a try now that prices were briefly down. reply freefaler 9 hours agoparentprevIt's good that the prices are more visible. But the price of the rent will mostly be affected by the supply/demand curve. Year Units Built Population Change (Number) 2019 26,900 -80,967 2020 23,000 +641,579 2021 24,000 -250,184 2022 24,000 -181,326 2023 27,980 -101,984 Last 5 years not much change in supply, but demand varies.

How does that change if the landlord pays it? The renter still hasn't chosen the broker. And either way, it comes from rent money. This feels no different from pricing that hides sales tax, versus reveals it. How about getting rid of these fucking agents. reply dghlsakjg 2 hours agorootparent> How about getting rid of these fucking agents. This is what will likely happen with this law. The prior system was that the person who hired the broker (the property owner) didn't care how high their fee was unless it caused them to lose a lease, since they weren't paying. So the incentive was for brokers to figure out how much money they could charge before they started blowing up deals for the person that hired them. If tenants would begrudgingly pay several thousand dollars to get the apartment, that is what they would charge. It was a race to the price ceiling since the payer wasn't the consumer. e.g. Owners don't care if one broker charges $2k, and one charges $3k, since as long as either can get a good tenant, they don't care. Now, their pricing structure has to be directly in line with the property owners incentives. Property owners aren't going to swallow paying thousands of dollars to an agent for unlocking a door and processing an application (there are apps for both of those things that get it done for 10s of dollars). Now, it will be a race to the best price for the service. If one agent is asking $3k and the other is asking $2k, the owner will choose the one who is asking $2k, or more likely, save themselves $2k and do the work themselves. reply kazinator 1 hour agorootparentThe fees are still that high, even though the broker is from the landlord's side? I wouldn't pay more than around $200 to have someone find me a tenant. Certainly not in landlord's market. It shouldn't be more than an hour or two of clerical work to talk to some people and sift through some applications. So yeah, if landlords have to cash out for this, the broker racket in NYC is likely going to be fucked. Landlords are going to be sticker shocked; I don't see why they would be willing to paying four-digit figures in a market where tenants are not rare unicorns that have to be searched for high and low, and wooed. reply MobiusHorizons 12 hours agorootparentprevI believe the argument is it should put downward pressure on the fees brokers request since the payer (landlord) would be able to shop unlike the current system, where the renter can’t see the price until they have already chosen. reply barryrandall 2 hours agorootparentprevMaking it a landlord cost changes the incentive structure. Landlords now have an incentive to pay agents as little as possible to maximize their profits. reply mcherm 10 hours agorootparentprevIf the party who chooses the service provider is not the same as the party who pays the fee then it is difficult for market forces to operate. Making the same party choose and pay can fix that. This is a different problem than \"the service provided isn't valuable\". reply kazinator 11 hours agoparentprev> the landlord does not want to have to eat a broker's fee next listing. Wouldn't a landlord who doesn't want to pay a broker just not use one? Advertise the place and handle the applicants on their own? reply remram 16 hours agoparentprevIt looks like this measure only applies to \"real estate agents who exclusively represent the landlord’s interests\". \"The bill requires landlords who hire real estate agents to pay the agents’ fees themselves\". My read is that as long as a broker works with multiple landlords, you the tenant will still pay them a fee. And it might remain difficult to find available lodging without going through brokers. reply paulgb 15 hours agorootparentHopefully the actual bill wording doesn’t leave this ambiguous, but I think the intent of “exclusively” here is meaning that they don’t also represent the buyer’s interest (dual agency), not that they have an exclusive deal with the landlord. reply SoftTalker 15 hours agorootparentprevNo it doesn't mean they can't work with multiple landlords, it means the represent the landlord(s) interests, not the tenants. If a tenant hires his own agent to find an apartment, that agent would (a) represent the tenant and (b) the tenant would pay for that service. But I'm not sure what stops the landlords from just raising the rent to cover the broker fees. Unless there's enough competition from landlords who don't use brokers. reply likpok 12 hours agorootparentLandlords will raise the rent but can only raise the rent to what the market will bear (which presumably they’re doing anyway). They then have incentive to ensure the broker is worth the fee. Previously landlords would require renters to work with (and pay) the broker, so there was no incentive to choose a cheaper broker. reply moomin 5 hours agorootparentprevHere’s the thing: let’s assume that that’s exactly what happens. It’s still a good thing. This is now reflected in the visible part of the cost enabling people to make better decisions. reply idontpost 15 hours agorootparentprevIt doesnʻt matter if they raise the rent to cover the fees. As another comment noted, THAT is a major win for price transparency. That would be a big improvement by itself. reply bsimpson 18 hours agoparentprevI live in a building primarily owned by offshore investors. NYC is a place where it's expected you'll always be on a lease - it's not common to go month-to-month after you fulfill your initial obligation (as it is in other cities). I've heard a common grift here is to offer current tenants awful terms to renew the lease. The broker is banking on you balking, so she gets to tell the owner (who's never met you or even been to the US) \"sorry - the existing tenant doesn't want to renew, so you're going to have to pay me to market the apartment again.\" reply mattzito 16 hours agorootparentAs someone who rented for 20 years in NYC, this is a bizarre scenario you describe. You deal with a broker during the leasing process, and then after you lease it, you pay the landlord, they have to sign the lease and approve repairs, and are the person with whom you review lease increases. The most arms length relationship I have ever heard or seen is having an admin assistant for the landlord handle all the operational things. I have never seen a situation where the broker is responsible for the lease terms, because in the end the landlord has to sign their end. reply harmmonica 15 hours agorootparentBrokers have gotten more “savvy” where they’ll actually act as a de facto property manager for a small fee or even for free and absentee landlords buy in because it’s less work for them (no communication at all with the tenant). And then the landlord wonders why tenants never stick around for more than a year! reply bsimpson 15 hours agorootparentprevMy lease is with \"Foreign Investor c/o Local Broker.\" I think the reason it was listed as a \"no fee\" apartment is because the brokerage is the de facto landlady. As the person who told me about this grift explained, this is not an uncommon relationship. reply harmmonica 14 hours agorootparentI tried to confirm your assertion about this grift but someone downvoted my previous comment saying as much. Just to reiterate: you’re right. This a real, relatively normal situation in NYC. reply nradov 17 hours agorootparentprevAbsentee landlords always get screwed by their local vendors. Nothing new there. It's routine for property managers to solicit kickbacks from other services that they hire like maintenance and landscaping. reply jclulow 16 hours agorootparentNo honour among thieves, I guess! reply CraigRo 18 hours agoparentprevTenants will have more cash each month. Tenants bid up rents to the point of affordability, and they'll become more affordable. Furthermore, there will be more would-be tenants b/c you don't need to save up a for a broker fee -- as long as your income is high enough, you can get a unit, at least in theory. So more competition.... reply bko 17 hours agoparentprevOf course there's competitive pressure to reduce or get rid of these fees. Plenty of people avoid buildings with brokers fee. Its even a filter in most real estate sites. I personally only looked at no fee brokers in the apartments or amortized the broker into the monthly payments. And for me, only no-fee apartments got my rent. People aren't dumb and look at an apartment and get quoted $4k a month and when they go sign they realize its an extra $6k broker fee and just open up their wallets like \"whoops\". It's definitely factored into the price and affects who gets in to the door reply crazygringo 17 hours agorootparent> Plenty of people avoid buildings with brokers fee. Very few units/buildings are no fee. And because so few are, there isn't much competitive pressure to reduce or remove the fees, because it's really hard to find a no-fee apartment that meets your other criteria. Hence, the new law. reply beisner 17 hours agorootparentprevWonks and experienced New Yorkers aren’t dumb. I too refused any apartment that wasn’t “No Fee”. But only a tiny fraction of the housing stock - especially very few “cheaper” places - are No Fee. And it is genuinely hard to not price anchor on the listed price - especially if you don’t know how long you’re going to live there (aka how much to amortize vs a No Fee) reply rKarpinski 17 hours agorootparentprevPlenty of people are surprised by the junk fee and end up eating it. reply BolexNOLA 17 hours agorootparentprevWe should avoid “caveat emptor” as the status quo when possible, shouldn’t we? reply voberoi 19 hours agoprevLinks to parts of today's NYC Council meeting where this passed today -- - The Speaker, Adrienne Adams, talks about the bill here: https://citymeetings.nyc/city-council/2024-11-13-0130-pm-sta... - The prime sponsor, Chi Ossé's, comments on the bill: https://citymeetings.nyc/city-council/2024-11-13-0130-pm-sta... - A vocal opposing voice, Vickie Paladino's, comments on the bill: https://citymeetings.nyc/city-council/2024-11-13-0130-pm-sta... reply addicted 19 hours agoparentI don’t know much about the bill at all but knowing that Vickie Paladino opposes it is the best endorsement it could have received in my eyes. reply readthenotes1 17 hours agorootparentI don't live in New York and don't know who Paladino is, but based on this quote (from a link in the comment currently right above yours), she is an idiot \"She believes the bill will force housing units to go unadvertised, limiting transparency and opportunities for tenants\" reply jakevoytko 13 hours agorootparentThis statement is pretty representative of how she presents her ideas. reply johnnyb9 17 hours agorootparentprevnext [2 more] [flagged] kstrauser 16 hours agorootparentIf that video's an example of the \"sane voice\", I fear for y'all. reply zjp 18 hours agoprevBased.

There was zero chance we'd have landed a house that year without her help, and landing when we did got us a record-low mortgage rate that has more than covered the commission already. reply kelnos 16 hours agorootparentThe problem is that there's no consistency, and you end up paying the same price regardless of how much value the realtor provides. When I bought my current house, it was the second one I looked at, out of several listings that my partner and I found on Redfin ourselves. Our realtor's expertise was useful when we were making an offer, and when dealing with financing and paperwork, but I don't think she provided $50k of value. If I were paying a fairly generous hourly rate for her time, she would have made less than $5k. Sure, sometimes a buyer's agent spends 100 hours helping their clients, finding and showing property after property after property, and has to deal with tricky negotiations, and is maybe worth the 2.5% commission. But I don't want to pay $50k for 10-15 hours of work; that's ridiculous. (And of course I was paying for the seller's agent's commission as well.) Another house I was involved in buying was similar: second house we looked at, only one counter-offer needed. If/when I buy again I will likely not use an agent. The new rules around not foisting the commissions onto the buyer will help too. reply Aurornis 14 hours agorootparentprev> There was zero chance we'd have landed a house that year without her help, These situations are created and maintained by real estate agents because they want to keep themselves useful. There's no reason we can't get a push notification to our phone when a house matching our criteria gets listed locally. Open app, check it out, decide to move on it or pass. The only reason real estate agents are helpful is because they've created their own system that they control. reply lolinder 13 hours agorootparentI'm not talking about her helping us to show up at a house—yes, we could have done that ourselves—I'm talking about how she helped us as first time home buyers to navigate the most intense housing market in decades and craft a persuasive offer that actually beat out multiple cash offers without losing us tons of money. We got the first house we made an offer on at a time when most young people in our shoes were despairing at ever getting a home. That situation wasn't created by real estate agents, it was created by sub-inflation mortgage interest rates, and she solved it by deeply understanding what a home seller wants out of an offer.

That's what a real estate agent is good for, and it's what I hope a larger percentage of agents are going to be good at now that the bad ones can't hide behind their monopoly. That's as may be, but the law in question is specifically about rentals not sales. WRT rentals, the price is generally not negotiable, the terms (at least in NYC) are prescribed by at least three city and state agencies, and until now, despite the fact that the broker acted as the landlord's agent exclusively, anyone who signed a lease (as the tenant) had to pay the broker. That's a very different situation, and not analogous to buying a home, except that (usually) you will live there. Edit: Fixed typo. Clarified prose. reply matwood 10 hours agorootparentprevFor a first time buying it can be daunting. I even used a 'good' agent in the past. But, what made her good was that her and her husband were also contractors and together they were effectively real-time home inspectors with any house we looked at. Since then I've bought a house without an agent and am about to sell another. All you really need is a lawyer and the internet. Then there are services you can pay to get on MLS. IMO, RE agents hosed themselves by not self scaling down their commission percentages as prices went up. Even people who do want their help will balk at paying someone 20k-30k+. reply blitzar 8 hours agorootparentprevReal estate agents have no business being in the mortgage industry. Charitably rereading your comment - this agent sounds like they were a buying agent.

Real estate agents regularly refuse to show homes to or entertain offers from buyers that are not represented by a real estate agent (unless they’re hoping to represent the buyer too - then they get both commissions!). “I never would have been able to do business in a monopolized market without doing business with a monopolist.” reply lolinder 16 hours agorootparentFirst, as noted by lotsofpulp, this isn't accurate: seller agents were always perfectly happy to deal with lone buyers because there's no other agent to share the commission with. Second, to the extent there is monopolistic behavior that gets in the way (and there definitely is), that's not what I'm talking about. The market that year was completely insane because of the interest rates, and there is no way we could have navigated it ourselves, real estate agent monopoly or no monopoly. I'm very glad that they've been forced to allow competition, and most real estate agents are horrible and should be avoided. All I'm saying is that in some markets a good real estate agent is absolutely worth their commission. reply lotsofpulp 16 hours agorootparentprevIt was the opposite. Home sellers paid both the home buyer’s agent’s commission and the seller’s agent’s commission, so buyers’ agents would not show houses they wouldn’t earn commission on, and simultaneously, buyers would choose to use an agent because they would not save any money by not using an agent. Now, I believe since the National Association of Realtors is not allowed to require their selling agents to share their commission with buyers’ agents, that everything is up for negotiation, and home buyers can save money by not using agents. reply paxys 14 hours agorootparentprevOnce sellers stop paying their commission buyer's agents are pretty much going to disappear. As I buyer I have no need to pay tens of thousands of dollars to someone for the work I'm anyways doing myself on Redfin and Zillow. reply JumpCrisscross 14 hours agorootparentAgree for commodity listings. A good buyer’s agent will create the supply you want. Mine did it by getting the property before it hit the MLS. Others will convince someone who wasn’t going list just yet to sell. reply kelnos 17 hours agoprevI never understood why landlord brokers are even a thing in a market like NYC. I live in SF and I've never heard of such a thing here, and we probably have a similar market when it comes to landlords getting to take advantage of high demand when it comes to listing visibility and negotiation. Why do landlords think they need a broker in order to rent out their units in NYC? I would think demand is so high there that listings on all the regular-suspect listing sites would be more than sufficient to get their units rented quickly and at a price they're happy with. No-fee listings seem to be a thing in NYC, but appear to be for a small minority of units. reply SoftTalker 15 hours agoparent> Why do landlords think they need a broker in order to rent out their units in NYC? In NYC, it probably ties back to organized crime somewhow. reply jakevoytko 13 hours agoparentprev> I never understood why landlord brokers are even a thing in a market like NYC. NYC is all about optimizing the grift. Imagine a small-time landlord that owns six 20-unit 6-story buildings across Queens. When 1/3 of their inventory turns over in September (the busy time for apartments in NYC), do you think they want to run all over the borough to 500 showings until they finally get all of the units rented? Do you think they want to hire a staff that will show all the units? Hell no! They can, FOR FREE, just tell one (or several!) brokers, \"if you manage to rent this unit out, you get to charge whatever fee you can get them to collect.\" And then they just need to do some paperwork when the broker finally lands someone. reply paxys 15 hours agoparentprev> Why do landlords think they need a broker in order to rent out their units in NYC? Because they know that the fee will be paid by the tenant, so why not? > I live in SF and I've never heard of such a thing here BTW brokers are very common in SF as well, usually called \"leasing agent\" or something similar. Every non-corporate rental I ever looked at had a broker involved at some level, e.g. organizing open houses, doing private tours, sending out application forms, vetting applicants, sending out lease agreements. It's just that you as the tenant don't have to know or care because you aren't the one footing the bill. reply fsckboy 14 hours agoparentprevmy assumption has been that the landlords noticed how much money the brokers were making and they figured why not bring it in-house and get a cut; i.e. the brokers are sharing the commissions with the landlords, and helping ensure there is no competition. My theory is if the landlords cannot make money doing this, they revert back to independent brokers. I don't have proof, but I'm pretty sure something like this is going on, and this law will do nothing. I think broker fees should be banned, and the rents should reflect the costs; if landlords want to hire broker/agents they can. reply lotsofpulp 17 hours agoparentprevGood brokers serve as a liability shield from being hit with discrimination claims. reply nicbou 8 hours agoprevGermany effectively banned broker fees in 2015 with the \"Bestellerprinzip\": the person who hired the agent pays for the agent. In most cases, this means the landlord. The fee is also capped to 2x the cold rent (before utilities). You also can't charge an agent fee for merely giving someone access to a database, and you can't be both the agent and the landlord, nor the agent and the previous tenant. Unfortunately, the difficult housing market ended up creating all sorts of other bribes. The most common is the previous tenant selling their furniture for an exhorbitant fee, or straight up requesting a bribe. These are obviously illegal, and you would be entitled to keep the apartment even after getting your money back in court. However rights are of little importance if you don't have the time/energy/means to enforce them. It's also a bad way to start a relationship with a landlord. German law is firmly on the side of tenants, but sometimes the greed is just too strong, and there is an endless supply of applicants who are willing to compromise.

This is why increasing the supply is so important too. Lawmakers like to overestimate the impact of their laws. But banning fees is so much easier than building house/going against your paymasters. We had a similar fee ban in England too. Has it moved the needle on the overall rental situation? I don't believe so reply billybones 18 hours agoprevSadly, this looks pretty toothless. The fine for noncompliance is $2k. Given the average price for an NYC apartment at north of $3k, the cost to a landlord of complying with the law even once looks significantly higher than the cost of the paying the fine. reply crazygringo 17 hours agoparentNot toothless at all. Even if the fine is $2k per tenant, that's way more than the landlord is going to pay to a service to list and show the apartment, which is maybe $500? Remember, broker's fees don't go to the landlord. They go to the brokers! The only reason landlords use them is because they're free for the landlord. It's absolutely cheaper for the landlord to hire a service than to pay a fine. reply adgjlsfhk1 13 hours agorootparent> Remember, broker's fees don't go to the landlord. They go to the brokers! I'm pretty sure there are landlords that charge the brokers for the chance to show their units. The landlords can advertise rents that are $300 lower (but get a $500 cut of the broker fee), and then can raise the rent by $300 the next year, increasing the chance that the tenant will go to another one of their (or their buddy's) properties and pay another brokers fee. reply crazygringo 7 hours agorootparentNo, that's not a thing. I don't know where you got that idea. And the last thing a landlord generally wants is for their tenant of just one year to leave. Remember, an apartment will often go vacant for a month or even two between tenants, which is lost rent. And if your tenant leaves, chances are miniscule they happen to move to another property you happen to own.

(That's assuming apartments even stay empty that long; when we were searching, we almost always had to commit to an apartment the day of the showing, or it'd be off the market the next day.

And brokers (especially in NYC) will have at least a dozen different folks who will want pretty much any decent apartment. Which allows the broker to charge outrageous fees because most landlords don't want to deal with the hoi polloi, just the folks vetted by the broker. As such, the power asymmetry between renter and broker was astounding. Changing this will be good for the renter, that's for sure. Brokers won't be able to get as much commission per apartment because the landlords will put the brokers on a flat fee annual retainer or something similar, because they have power (because they control the available inventory) to choose which broker(s) to work with.

Typically no fee apartments can get a 10 to even 20% premium on the monthly rent because it’s no fee. Makes sense because as others have said a lot of the inventory is broker-controlled so tenants will pay more in rent to avoid the upfront fee. My prediction is this will increase rents in high-demand neighborhoods because the prices today in those neighborhoods have been discounted to account for the broker fees. I’m talking the rental rate. Will it go up enough to where it’s more expensive than if there’d been a broker fee?

So when landlords are forced to pay the fee that have more optionality to negotiate the fee down. Even now, when a landlord has a lot of available apartments they need to move or when the market is soft (for example during peak COVID), they’ll typically offer a “1 month OP.” Meaning the landlord pays the broker a 1 month’s rent fee, and the broker markets the apartment to renters as no fee. Even if the landlord just roles that into the rent, it’s a savings over the 12-15% fee standard today. Also, landlords with larger buildings or geographic density are already figuring out that they can rent apartments cheaper with a few salaried leasing agents, instead of paying brokers. If more of them are forced to internalize the broker fee, more of them will figure that out. reply xp84 18 hours agorootparentNot a New Yorker here, can someone ELI5 (briefly, I don't want to waste your time) what function brokers serve other than extracting money from people? I know a real estate agent at least takes care of a great deal of paperwork that must be done correctly in the transfer of title, and shows properties to buyers. But in terms of rentals, I've never needed a third party to do any of that, and I lived in 5 rental apartments in about 8 years. Landlords 'just' list their properties on the Internet, people find said properties and submit applications or go see them at a predefined time. I'm aware of property managers and have dealt with them in cases where the landlord doesn't want to bother interviewing tenants and stuff -- is a broker a subset of these functions? I think of a property manager though as also serving the function of arranging repairs and handling the whole tenant relationship. In my experience, a property manager does charge a percentage of the rent to handle all this, which kind of means it's passed on, but in terms of how the broader market contains competitors who aren't paying a property manager constrains how much it can be fully passed onto the tenant. reply mikeocool 16 hours agorootparentThey provide zero value to the renter — it’s essentially an issue of supply and demand. There is a lot of demand for NYC apartments and not a lot of supply, so landlords can hand off their listings to a broker to market and show, and say “I’m not going to pay you, collect a fee from the tenant you bring in” and because of the supply and demand people deal with it. They ultimately provide a lot of value to landlord — paying for marketing, showing the apartment to a bunch of people, answering the NYU student’s parents questions about crime in the neighborhood, making sure that applicants have provided all the right paperwork, etc etc. The best part is that as a renter, just before you hand over the many thousand dollar check, you sign a piece of paper that says “this person you are paying does not work for you or represent your interests in any way in this transaction.” reply ics 17 hours agorootparentprevIn the past, there was some informational benefit for average Joe/Jane.

These days, most people I know exclusively look at direct listings and don't pay broker fees. The exception is usually when you are either more picky or in more of a rush.

Actually, we had these arcane things called \"newspapers\" that were filled with hundreds and hundreds of ads for apartment/house rentals, sales and even shares.

When can you come to look at it; 3. If you like it, snap it up (by writing a check[0]) before someone else does. As for brokers, the ads generally noted that it was 'no fee' if the rental was direct with the landlord. Apartment shares were generally 'no fee' as well, since you were just moving in with roommates you didn't know.

After doing a few real estate purchases with realtors, I've come to the conclusion that they're not really necessary as a buyer, unless you really need/want someone to hold your hand the whole way. The offer and purchase forms are standardized by the state realtor's association (technically they are not free to use, but you can find them online), and the seller will be responsible for filling out all the disclosure forms and whatnot, which you just have to sign that you acknowledge receipt. As I said, the title company (often also the escrow company) will handle all the title-related stuff. Your mortgage lender will help you fill out the mortgage application, and either the title company or a notary hired by the mortgage lender will walk you through signing the final forms. In states (like NY) where you're required(?) to have an attorney when you're buying property, I feel like a realtor is even more superfluous. On the seller side, I do believe realtors provide quite a bit more value. Whether or not it's enough to justify their commission is of course up for debate. Regarding rentals, yeah... before buying I lived in 9 different rentals (upstate NY, SF bay area, SF), and at no point did I need any third party to help with it, even when several of these were before the prevalence of listings on the internet.

I am not arguing that it will end up in the rent. I was only arguing that, if it did, that would still be a better arrangement. However, you are wrong that the service provided by the fee offers no value, and that the fee will not end up somewhere (even in a diminished way). - To landlords it offers upfront vetting, no required face time with prospects, and less work to land a tenant. We have a 1.4% vacancy rate in NYC -- apartments on the market will have hundreds of interested people and multiple applications. Landlords basically manage none of this. - To prospective renters who actively hire a broker -- and these do exist, I did this once -- it offers zero time on the prospect's part to look for, schedule, and research units. You tell the broker your parameters, they will do the research, and then set up a multi-hour tour of apartments. (Unless you are only looking at no-fee apartments, you are better off just hiring a broker so you get at least some value from it if you rent a fee-ful apartment) The value the fee provides to the people who care about it, will end up somewhere. This work doesn't go away. Many landlords and prospective renters will take on the work themselves, but many won't. These people will pay for the broker fee. Those broker fees end up with the landlord or the prospective renter. It is not my conclusion that eliminating the broker fee will result in higher rent. I think what will happen is: - The broker market will shrink. - Some landlords or renters will pay for it. In a nutty housing market like NYC's, there is actual value provided by brokers, to some people. Finally -- to be clear, I'm not arguing against the FARE Act.

They don't need to make up for lost revenue or something like that, with the kinds of schemes you're proposing. What happens now is that instead of a tenant paying $5K to the broker when they rent the place, the landlord pays $500 to a service which lists the apartment in a few places (like StreetEasy) and handles showing the apartment (which can often be offloaded to the super or similar).

Perfect versus good. reply throwaway241113 14 hours agoprevI own two apartments in Manhattan that I've rented out for over 20 years. I've occasionally assisted close relatives renting out a few other Manhattan apartments for longer. Sometimes I rely on a real estate broker as a middleperson, and sometimes I do the work myself, marketing the apartment as a \"no fee\" \"for rent by owner\" rental. I also own the apartment I live in. But before I owned my residence, I was a renter, and thus for a period I've also experienced the mad crazy dash that is NYC apartment hunting while in the shoes of a prospective renter. My impressions from my \"lived experience\" in case anyone finds it an interesting data point: There isn't much information asymmetry, if any. Most apartments are marketed through brokers, and everyone understands, apartment seekers especially, that the broker will charge a fee that the renter must pay to the broker, and how much that fee is. In contrast, when landlords advertise their apartments without a broker, they specify in the ad that it is on a \"no fee\" basis. Anyone hunting for an apartment to rent who doesn't understand this at the outset of their search learns it soon enough, and certainly before they sign a lease. My intuition is the bill requiring owners to pay the broker's fee, if it becomes law, will have little or no effect on the underlying economics. I expect the law will prove to have been mere theater, albeit perhaps theater that was \"well intentioned,\" to borrow from a Mayor Adams' quotation in the Bloomberg article. When I've decided what rent prices to advertise my apartments for, I've always assumed renters will pay the most they can afford to \"satisfice\" the apartment characteristics they seek. I've also assumed they will factor any broker's fee into deciding whether they can afford any specific apartment. Whenever I've marketed an apartment myself, I've advertised a higher price than I would were I to advertise it through a broker, and vice versa. The rule of thumb I've used for how much to add to the monthly rent I advertise when I'm doing it without a broker, is what a broker's fee would be if I were using a broker (which is typically 15% of the first year's rent) divided by 12. As far as I can tell, the negotiations and transactions that actually have transpired after I've marketed my apartments with and without brokers in the foregoing manner have matched the mental model of the market that I've relied on to estimate what prices to advertise. If the new bill becomes law and thereby requires me to pay any broker fee myself, I plan to do the reverse. I'll ask for a higher price when I market one of my apartments through a broker than when I market it myself. I also expect the monthly differential I'll choose when doing it myself will continue be roughly the hypothetical broker's fee divided by 12. reply burnt-resistor 16 hours agoprev [–] Now if they just did something about the lies in commercial real estate. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

When I saw that statement, from a company spokesperson, it was striking. Is it now respectable and advisable for a corporation to make official statements like this? reply moomin 19 hours agoparentThere’s people in the comments characterising this as political positioning, and I think they’re dead on. However, it continues to do my head in how utterly ridiculous this statement is. Literally, there’s not even a motive. reply bookaway 5 hours agorootparentUnless my memory is completely off, I don't recall Polymarket giving \"Trump will win\" vibes in the general lead up to the election. When they did, it was probably in the last few days. If that's the case, I would've expected to the statement to be something like, \"From our understanding, our only crime is to have presented an analysis that the outgoing administration also understood to be valid.\" reply qgin 15 hours agoparentprevIt’s a signal to the incoming President to protect them ASAP reply cdumler 54 minutes agorootparent> It is not clear what the FBI was seeking when numerous agents entered Coplan's apartment at around 6am, or if Coplan and/or Polymarket are the targets of an investigation. We have no information about why they are there, so you conclude it must be political retribution and they must be protected. THIS is why Trump won. So many people have zero critical thinking skills. When you see something that for which you have no information, you can say \"I wonder what is going on.\" Then, you stop. Things that could be: * Using collected data to facility spear phishing campaigns. * Running a child pornography/sex trafficking ring. * Participating in dogfighting. * Been a back channel for selling trade secrets. * Had some people killed. * Routing all the information collected to foreign groups, like Russia. * or.. has the other half of messages to someone under investigation whose phone locked.

When all the information is freely available. reply jpadkins 3 hours agorootparentSerious answer: I don't know, but we shouldn't rush to judge until all the facts come out. All we know is they did a raid on the CEO home (not the business?) and the CEO claimed politics is involved. I sincerely hope Congress performs their duty of oversight on the FBI well, so we can learn the truth of the matter. Overt politicization of federal law enforcement is a scary development. reply andy_xor_andrew 19 hours agoparentprevRespectable and advisable? No. Smart? Yes. Their audience here is the incoming administration, which is founded on party loyalty and an \"us-vs-them\" mindset, where \"them\" are the corrupt elites. They're making a bet that whoever is prosecuting them in 4 months is going to be a lot friendlier to them if they act like victims of a vengeful democratic elite, and they're probably right.

Every major corporation in the US is currently sucking up to Trump because his presidency will be entirely transactional and without regard to the constitutional purpose of the office. If you scratch his back, he will find a way to scratch yours - until it’s no longer convenient for him to do so. reply mannanj 19 hours agorootparentDoes it have anything to do with his statements about firing and enacting severe penalties, federal investigations in, and changes around the censorship requirements that many of these corporations engaged in with government agencies? He promised retraction of billions in federal funding- and many of these corporations are implicated. reply lesuorac 18 hours agorootparentNo, it has much more to do with he changed his tone on EVs after Musk started to publicly supported him and pretty much said the phrase \"I had to, he's helping me\". Or all the people he pardon'd in exchange for indirect money. It's literally transactional. reply lupusreal 20 hours agoparentprevRespectable is subjective. Advisable? If they're probably guilty then appealing to the biases of the incoming administration is probably a good idea. On the other hand, if they're innocent and their accusation of bias is accurate, then saying as much is probably a good idea too. reply JeremyNT 17 hours agoparentprevIf they can curry favor with the incoming (extremely crypto friendly) administration, their problems with the FBI go away. This kind of conspiratorial thinking dominates the Republican party and such a story would play well with the base. There is a clear motive for this approach - and it seems likely to work. reply iAMkenough 20 hours agoparentprevIf the bar for decorum is the President-elect, then yes this would be considered an acceptable statement. reply n2d4 18 hours agoparentprevRidiculous is also that they say this when Polymarket gave Trump only 60%-40% odds. They're falling for the same logical fallacy as everyone who knows nothing about prediction markets. reply tachash1 9 hours agorootparentPolymarket also had Harris at 70% to win the popular vote right up to election day, which has transpired to be wrong.

Watch what Ben and Marc have to say about them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4jWb-0nj44 They talk about how Biden has spent the last four years going beyond the law to destroy all the a16z crypto startups. So it doesn't surprise me that they'd use all their power to go after prediction markets too. I'm really glad I'm not working in upstart finance. reply cperkins 19 hours agoprevIf this were aimed at Polymarket and their betting activities, then their lawyers would be getting subpoenas and the like, and a raid on their president would most likely be in concert with raids on their offices. AFAICT, it was only his person targeted. That the FBI raided the home of an individual most likely means a criminal investigation of that person, for a federal crime or a crime that crosses state boundaries. reply nl 17 hours agoparentBloomberg explicitly says it is part of an investigation of Polymarket allowing US users[1]. I guess it follows the pattern of the Binance investigation where they were able to show the Binance CEO instructed people to make sure the technical measures they implemented to ensure only non-US people were on their exchange were easy to bypass.

A supervisory special agent can push an investigation very far and has a lot to gain from it in terms of credibility among peers and career gains. Investigations into low profile targets are heavily deprioritized in favor of high profile targets. The same pattern extends through to the US Attorney’s Office. Prosecutors are highly motivated to target high profile individuals and organizations. reply TacticalCoder 17 hours agorootparentprev> The FBI is NOT an organization that’s dedicated to keeping Americans safe. The new Attorney General just said that if the FBI doesn't now begin to serve the interest of the american people, he'd get rid of the FBI altogether. So using the FBI for political targeting may very well soon. reply legitster 21 hours agoprevObviously there are no details yet, but I suspect it's as simple as: - Polymarket is still very illegal in the US - Lol.

And if there was evidence he was encouraging it, he could be in big trouble reply orblivion 19 hours agoparentKalshi got the goahead from an appeals court to list election bets.

The CFTC had previously said that prediction markets are not futures (they claimed they are illegal gaming), and Kalshi sued to get a ruling that they are futures. Polymarket has avoided coming under regulation by the CFTC by avoiding US users. For their markets to be legal under current regulations they'd have to have all their markets approved by CFTC. [1] https://kalshi.com/blog/article/how-is-kalshi-regulated reply caeril 5 hours agorootparentprevYes, because Polymarket offers sports markets, which are still illegal in the US (for US users, anyway). Kalshi has been careful to offer markets in basically everything except sports. It should be obvious what happened here: Polymarket has been offering grey or black markets to users, using only IP address as the discriminator, which is very easy to work around. They've operated under the Feds' radar for quite some time, and the Feds noticed them after they started getting significant press regarding the election. The election is the reason they got noticed, but the likely crime itself is sports, not elections. reply orblivion 19 hours agorootparentprevWhat rake did I just step on?

There's nothing that stipulates that US companies must sell to other US companies, and it's a great place for investments & startups, so even if Polymarket isn't licensed to operate in the US it still makes sense for them to be there. reply Sebb767 17 hours agorootparent> and it's a great place for investments & startups, so even if Polymarket isn't licensed to operate in the US it still makes sense for them to be there.

I most receently used the site yesterday to see what the incumbent Australian government’s reelection chances are after they tabled ‘ID and age requirements to use social media’ laws, but polymarket didn’t seem to have Australian politics odds, so I was left using oddschecker, which is inferior due to the annoying way it displays odds and it not storing historical data. reply Terr_ 18 hours agoparent> letting people learn what's happening in the world around us I think that phrasing is a bit too optimistic. Even in cases where the \"prediction\" cannot influence the outcome, the primary \"learning about the world\" involves the imputed opinions of bettors. Betting at horse-races doesn't teach you nearly as much about horses as actually going to the stables. :P reply Tenoke 17 hours agorootparentErr, checking the line on a horse race is a much more reliable way to tell who has what chance of winning than going to the stables as a random person, and most likely for a professional as well. reply seizethecheese 17 hours agorootparentExcellent point.

However, on election night it wasn’t just about being right it was about digesting information in real time and promulgating information faster.

The objective of prediction markets is to improve the collective cognitive capacity of humankind (see Earthweb for a science-fiction exposition of this by way of a rather heavy-handed plot device). Certain people are willing to take great risks to achieve things like that, maybe including Coplan, who I'm not personally acquainted with. See Alex Tabarrok's triumphant take from before the raid: https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/11/pr... Here's an interesting question. We know that if a bettor in a prediction market wants to manipulate the market's prediction, it's likely to be extremely costly for them (though Théo's big bet on Polymarket seems to have shifted it a lot, so maybe we should doubt this theory). Does the operator of a prediction market have less-costly ways to manipulate the prediction? Other than just shutting down the market permanently on Election Day, Mt.

Ten trillion dollars might be too much to lose in a prediction market on how long it will take for Moscow to conquer Kiev, if it happens at all, conditional on Russia invading Ukraine; but is it too much to lose in a prediction market that could swing the US election? Observably, so far, political spammers do not obtain ten trillion dollars per US election to spend on influencing it. Arguably this is only because they haven't found an effective way to spend that much money, and we should be very concerned that a mere 50 million dollars seems to have been enough to influence the prediction market results quite seriously in this case. But that's not necessarily inherent to markets, even prediction markets. Foreign exchange rates were a major issue in our last election, because our rate of inflation was top in the world last year, but it isn't plausible for political parties to bet enough in forex futures markets to influence their predictions of those exchange rates—because banks bet almost 8 trillion dollars per day in the forex markets, so to intentionally maintain an irrational prediction in the market over the several months of the campaign, you'd need to be rich enough to expend roughly the entire world yearly GDP, and willing to lose it. If sending spam required posting a bond set by the receiver, to be paid to the receiver if they decided the email was unwanted, I think you'd find that even political spammers did start to care a great deal about the cost. Until they cared, I'd set up domains with billions of potential receivers, each setting a ten-dollar bond.

By your yardstick, humanity is learning the outcome of sports events ahead of them happening and this is a profound world wide tool for the advancement of humanity.

And people will still kill themselves when they are at the end of the gambling spiral. reply kragen 7 hours agorootparentYour comment is significantly higher quality, and I appreciate that. It still has three problems: 1. I didn't make any claims about prediction markets†. I made claims about what prediction-market advocates like Shayne Coplan and Alex Tabarrok believe, because the question was what could motivate someone to operate an unprofitable one. Since I am not not currently operating a prediction market or working on a prediction-market project of any kind, it is wholly irrelevant which shit I do or don't believe about prediction markets. Analogously, if I were to claim that the Nazis killed ten million people in death camps because they believed that Jews and Roma were subhuman, you could not validly argue that, in fact, Jews and Roma are not subhuman, and therefore the Holocaust could not have happened. 2. You do not present any arguments that the worthless comment by \"FactKnower69\" (!!) was itself worth posting, or even correct; you only present an argument about why you think prediction markets are not worthwhile. Presenting any argument at all puts your comment head or shoulders above the comment I was criticizing. But \"FactKnower69\"'s claim was not that prediction markets were harmful; it was that advocates of prediction markets were both insincere and highly profitable, in particular the people operating PMs like Polymarket and Kalshi, and also that I am a fucking idiot. I concede that I am a fucking idiot; \"FactKnower69\" nailed that one entirely by chance. But, with respect to the rest of their comment, it is not only possible but actually common for people to sincerely advocate policies that are, unbeknownst to them, harmful, as well as to profit from those policies. So, even if prediction markets are not worthwhile, their advocates may be sincere and/or unprofitable. Moreover, even if prediction-market advocates are insincere and/or profitable, \"FactKnower69\"'s comment contains no information tending to show that; it's just an unsupported assertion. Worthless unsupported assertions of both true and false claims are also common, so even if you were to show that prediction-market advocates were insincere and/or profitable (a task you did not attempt), that still doesn't rescue \"FactKnower69\"'s comment from the sewer it was born in. 3. Your argument is at least equally applicable to stock, commodities, and forex markets; \"knowing\" how much hard red winter wheat or aluminum will cost a year from now, or how profitable PPG Industries will be over the next few years, is even less of a \"profound world wide tool for the advancement of humanity\" than \"knowing\" who will win the US election, and those markets are also well known to cause suicide. So your argument is not a very strong argument; it would entail that those markets are also net harmful and should be eliminated if possible, which I am sure you will concede is a position far out on the fringes of extremism. ______ † Well, except that I did claim that it would be very profitable for an unethical prediction-market operator to disappear with everyone's money on the eve of a major event like an election, but that seems to be irrelevant to the rest of the discussion. reply koolba 21 hours agoprevAccording to the NY Post they came in at 6am this morning and seized his phone and other electronics: https://nypost.com/2024/11/13/business/fbi-seizes-polymarket... reply ianhawes 17 hours agoparentHeavily armed agents of the Federal Government. reply kccoder 9 hours agorootparentThat’s generally how it works. reply WiSaGaN 19 hours agoprevI thought thid would happen when I see Kalshi launched an almost exact copy of Polymarket but claiming following US laws.

I think these are the (tenuous) claims: - Many in the \"crypto community\" have perceive the Biden administration as hostile to it (Polymarket uses Polygon crypto). - Peter Thiel is an investor in Polymarket. Thiel backed Trump in '16 and is often Republican aligned. Additionally, JD Vance once worked for Thiel. Thiel was a (very) major funder of Vance's senate election campaign. - Polymarket's markets predicted Trump to win. This, to me, is the biggest stretch of all the conspiracy type stuff. But I guess it goes, \"You put your thumb on the scales to show Trump was going to win.We lost. Now we're going to punish you.\" My guess is that it's as straightforward as: many bettors on Polymarket are U.S. citizens. Polymarket knows this and in all likelihood facilitates this, maintaining the thinnest possible veneer of plausible deniability. While betting on U.S. elections by U.S. bettors is apparently legal [1], it still requires market makers to submit to some registration process. That requirement has not been fulfilled by Polymarket. Also, in 2022 Polymarket settled a case with the CFTC for operating an unregistered derivatives market [2]. Who knows, it might just be related to a violation of that settlement?

An insurance company sells options contracts. We call it healthcare. It is , aside from a few small differences, the same as a put or a call. An insurance company's day-to-day operation is indistinguishable from a derivatives hedge desk. Insurance companies absolutely take massive bets. These are managed by re-insurers. reply jsyang00 18 hours agorootparentprevyou do not think there are legitimate hedges which can be made with events trading on prediction markets? I think, indeed, a lot of people are effectively using the markets to gamble, but the same can be said for equities/futures. I see no reason they shouldn't be allowed, since there are proxies that people can trade as well reply beejiu 18 hours agorootparentI don't see anything in Polymarket's marketing material that suggests it be used for hedging. They describe it as \"profit from your knowledge by betting on future events across various topics\" on their own website. Betfair Exchange can be used to make predictions, too. They call it \"implied probability\" and it's always been a feature of their product. My concern is the use of terminology to describe a gambling product as something else entirely. Is it a prediction market than can be used to gamble? Or is it a gambling exchange that can be used to make predictions? reply Invictus0 17 hours agorootparentprevInsurance is not a prediction market whatsoever, not even a little bit.

Many 'sportsbooks' are referred to as 'betting exchanges', but that has become something of a term of art, much like the term 'prediction market'. In any case, attempting to use a derogatory or denigrating euphemism to refer to something is usually less productive than simply exposing (what you perceive to be) its faults. What specific issues do you have with these markets/exchanges? reply troad 20 hours agorootparentNot GP, but I suspect it's the gambling part? Hence the name? Gambling is a destructive addition that the vast majority of participants cannot manage well. It harms not only them, but their children and their spouses. How many a kid's college fund has gone up in smoke? A lot of harm is done to very innocent people in pursuit of a ten second rush. (Much like all other addictions.) I also very respectfully disagree that inventing a name for something is not productive - it's incredible effective, in fact. That's why political campaigns often favour duelling names over hot button issues: it's easier to win broad based support from soccer moms and football dads for 'marriage equality', whereas 'homosexual marriage' may be a harder sell. See also 'medicare for all' versus 'socialized medicine', 'pro-choice' v 'pro-life' etc. reply caeril 5 hours agorootparentThese markets are no more \"gambling\" than other markets are. A traditional sportsbook maintains a house vig anywhere from 5 to 15%, which is, indeed, a pretty fast path to ruin. They typically don't allow you to exit your position once you're committed. Polymarket's sports markets, in contrast, have comparable bid/ask spreads to financial markets (maybe slightly wider), and the market is liquid such that you can sell your contract to someone else whenever you want. reply mrcode007 20 hours agorootparentprevIIRC There is only one prediction market with a single regulatory exemption granted for the University of Iowa and the bets are limited to $500. The rest of what we see are (binary) event contracts (options) Based on my understanding, which may be incorrect, they seem to be basically a rebranding of binary options which were illegal in the US for the longest time.

Indeed, the IEM has received two no-action letters that extend no‑action relief. A speculator may put at risk in the IEM only between $5 and $500. You raise an interesting point in your final paragraph: Binary options look very similar to sports betting. I was unaware that they are so strictly regulated. I found this info: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/061114/... > They are banned across Europe, Australia, the U.K., and many other jurisdictions because of their volatility and are often seen as wagers more akin to gambling than sound investing. The weird part: In all of these jurisdictions, there is a large \"structured products\" market, where large investment banks structure complex derivs with (often multiple) embedded binary options (called knock-out or knock-in), and sell them to high-net-worth people via private banks. I guess the \"embedded\" part makes them legal? To be clear, this market is over 20 years old at this point, so if regulators did not allow, they would have stopped it by now. reply mrcode007 11 hours agorootparentThe structured part is because these options are most likely replicated with existing option products. A binary call can similarly be replicated with other options and packaged reply beejiu 20 hours agorootparentprevBut it is not derogatory or euphemistic, it is descriptive.

Another could be concern of doing anything visibly election related prior to the election, in case the winner didn’t like the action. reply inglor_cz 21 hours agorootparentWhile I understand that logic, I also find it a bit distasteful. Law enforcement shouldn't tolerate crimes being committed on its watch any longer than necessary. Of course, the exact meaning of \"necessary\" is the problem. We can probably all agree that letting a serial murderer kill more people in order to have more evidence against him would be an absolute abomination. But the situation is not that clear with white-collar crime, especially the sort of crime where the harm is not immediately obvious. Maybe the fact that the FBI could wait that long before pouncing indicates that this sort of betting is, in fact, a victimless crime. reply dopamean 20 hours agorootparentThey probably have a different definition of what is \"necessary\" than you. If waiting for further crimes to be committed makes the case more of a sure thing in their eyes) then it's necessary. Or if it gives them more serious crimes to prosecute or a higher up person to prosecute. I believe this is common in organized crime investigations. reply standardUser 18 hours agorootparentprev> Law enforcement shouldn't tolerate crimes being committed on its watch any longer than necessary. That is simply not how it works and for good reason. If it were, imagine the consequences. Most charges would never lead to a trial or a conviction because law enforcement would have acted on the very first sign of criminal action instead of investigating further or working their way up the chain. We'd only end up arresting low level foot soldiers and the higher ups would get away every single time. reply _DeadFred_ 19 hours agorootparentprevThe wheels of justice move slowly, and for good reason. I'm confused what your point is? Is it when cops/prosecutors build cases that take time they are tacitly saying the crime is victimless?

I've heard of a couple others too, so I think that laws were created and funded by competitors, and they defined what was legal in a way that excluded polymarket. I think in this case, polymarket allows betting on anything, competitors got betting on the election legalized (https://www.barrons.com/news/last-minute-legal-ruling-allows...), so they get the cash from polymarket's idea then get them banned/stopped long enough to take their market share. VC's call it Regulatory Capture, politicians call it corruption. reply aiforecastthway 19 hours agorootparentPolymarket could've easily registered as an exchange at any point in the last 4+ years, and then itself filed the suit that its competitors filed. Instead they chose to just ignore the law. > VC's call it Regulatory Capture This isn't regulatory capture. You can disagree with the regulation, but the barrier to entry here is not that high. Kalshi is like 5 years old. \"Capture\" is a thing, and it does not just mean \"any regulation that I happen to disagree with\". You do need capital to stand up a regulated exchange, but, then, you also need capital to stand up an unregulated exchange. And the difference between those two numbers is not nearly big enough to come anywhere close to creating capture. reply scottyah 19 hours agorootparentYou're right, I had been using a definition of regulatory capture that doesn't really fit what I'm seeing when I look it up. I learned it to mean capture of market share through regulation, either by getting your competitors banned, forced creation of consumers through law (like car seats/helmets/paper straws). Maybe someone knows what that is called? Instead, it means regulatory agencies become dominated by the interests of those they were originally charged to regulate. I still speculate this raid to be Kalshi/Robinhood/whomever to be going after polymarket at a prime time- the concept of betting on events got huge and the industry of event-hedging directly (avoiding the stock market proxy) no longer needs to band together to get the idea out- now it's a matter of getting all the consumers to choose your particular product vs a competitors. reply aiforecastthway 19 hours agorootparentThe Prediction Market industry got out ahead of regulation and effectively chose their own (weak and hands-off) regulator in the CFTC. The requirements involved are not onerous. There are certainly jurisdictions where actual gambling is more tightly regulated. I am not exaggerating when I say that any pair of a good programmer and a decent lawyer could do the technical work to stand up a compliant exchange (they'd need capital, but, again, nothing insane compared to the capital you'd need for an unregulated exchange anyways). I don't think you are at all correct about the relationship between Polymarket and other event trading venues. For one thing, Kalshi and polymarket are basically contemporaneous. For another, Polymarket plays at these games too (Polymarket has a former Commissioner of the CFTC on their board). To the extent that Polymarket is playing in the legal grey zone, it's an active choice on their part, not a result of competitors' regulatory advantage or Polymarket's lack of access to regulatory leverage. reply scottyah 39 minutes agorootparentYou seem to be anti-polymarket. I'm speculating that one or more of their competitors are behind the timing on this raid, and not offering any opinion on whether polymarket made a wise choice in not seeking regulation or whether or not they would also pull the same move on competitors. IMO, the counters to my speculations would be that the raid was because they got too popular and the gov didn't want a million people starting up their own exchanges, or they reached a monetary tipping point the gov set to warrant a raid. reply JumpCrisscross 21 hours agoparentprev> Which I still don't quite understand, the FBI waiting until after the election for this.

We think that the benefits of being on X are now outweighed by the negatives and that resources could be better used promoting our journalism elsewhere. This is something we have been considering for a while given the often disturbing content promoted or found on the platform, including far-right conspiracy theories and racism. The US presidential election campaign served only to underline what we have considered for a long time: that X is a toxic media platform and that its owner, Elon Musk, has been able to use its influence to shape political discourse. X users will still be able to share our articles, and the nature of live news reporting means we will still occasionally embed content from X within our article pages. Our reporters will also be able to carry on using the site for news-gathering purposes, just as they use other social networks in which we do not officially engage. Social media can be an important tool for news organisations and help us to reach new audiences but, at this point, X now plays a diminished role in promoting our work. Our journalism is available and open to all on our website and we would prefer people to come to theguardian.com and support our work there.

Also that community note just says they have been consistently saying the same thing for decades which sounds okay to me. reply ImJamal 19 hours agorootparentThe community note is saying that they have not been consistent. In the past they seemed to be saying it is real and in the post they are calling it a myth. reply dools 16 hours agorootparentAh okay. So I searched for the article which is here: https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/06/engl... The myth it is referring to is that there is a two-tiered system targeting white people. That's obviously a myth -- the notes are probably referring to instances where the Guardian has claimed that police treat racial minorities differently which is quite probably the case (happens everywhere else in the old British Empire so not sure why Britain would be any different). I found the post on ex-Twitter: https://x.com/guardian/status/1820788959095529653 But that's from 6 August, not 8 August as per the screenshot and there is no community note on it. I can't find a post by the Guardian about this on 8 August, maybe they deleted it? Does seem weird that they would delete one and not the other. It also seems that one would get community noted and not the other (especially since the 6 August post has 1.6m views and the 8 August post screenshotted has 60k views). I tried to find the articles shown in the community note in the screenshot, and I can find some about two-tier policing that don't really seem directly related to this. Maybe I can't find the one that's screenshotted because I don't have an account, maybe they deleted that one but not the 6 August one, maybe the screenshot is fabricated. Either way, I'm quite sure that this \"two-tier policing\" claim is of the same ilk that equates rejecting racism with being racist; ie. the \"leftist bullies\" idea. That violent right-wing protests are being \"treated differently\" because they're white, rather than treated differently because they're a bunch of psychos being whipped into a frenzy by lies spread on ex-Twitter by influencers, including Elon Musk. I wouldn't say that's the same as claims that, for example, black people are more likely to be subject to police brutality. But right-wingers love to make claims about \"reverse racism\". reply ywvcbk 8 hours agorootparent> there is a two-tiered system targeting white people. That's obviously a myth Except… That’s obviously not what Farage et al are saying. The claim is that white nationalists (verging on fringe(?) neo-nazi) protestors and rioters were treated more harshly than protestors and rioters belonging to other races or subscribing to other (also violent and radical) political (or religious) ideologies. It does not seem obvious at all to me that this is clearly a myth. reply defrost 8 hours agorootparentIt seems clear that the current crop of \"white nationalists (verging on fringe(?) neo-nazi) protestors and rioters\" were treated with kid gloves in comparison to the treatment of \"other race\" protestors in the Brixton riots.

Taking time to consider what to say next and how to reply, especially if you are wrong, is very important. That also applies to when you should stop commenting, even if you are wrong. Eventually every story needs to end because the resources needed to constantly follow up on old stories, and comments on them, need to be balanced with keeping up with new things. Basically, I am saying that comments sections, even if they occasionally point out important things, can be detrimental to keeping a higher level, slower paced and more thoughtful approach to journalism. reply drewcoo 11 hours agorootparentLower periodicity does not mean taking more time to say things.

Stop and search laws and multiple incidents of innocent people being framed for crimes. The rights which to pretend this is targeted at the white majority, simply because multiply convicted criminals like Tommy Robinson are being jailed, is a myth. No British policeman can stop you on the street by psychically intuiting your political views. They can stop you if you are breaking windows, chanting slogans, or have a different skin color.

It's more or less undisputed that tariffs will hurt the GDP and overall economy of the US. However, Donald Trump claims tariffs will help the US economy. Or, perhaps what the GOP has treasured most of all these past few years, the culture war. For example, gender-neutral bathrooms.

The media was largely passive except for the letters pages, which mostly featured real people, and the likes of \"Readers's Wives\" which was mostly bollocks (quite literally). If we look at the newspapers back then: they all had a clear and well known set of biases - political and otherwise. The Times was Conservative, so was the Torygraph (Telegraph). The Grauniad (Guardian - yes, that one) was unable to employ editors capable of effective proof-reading. The Independent was not really independent and the Sun and Mirror published pictures of young ladies alongside their biting political satire. The Sunday Sport had even more piccies of scantily clad young ladies and was barking mad - \"Elvis piloted Lancaster bomber found on Moon\". We also had and still have titles such as \"Private Eye\", who are generally acknowledged to be proper journo outlets. The media has always had a bias and it was always accepted that you took multiple papers, and watched the BBC and ITN News, if you wanted to appear to have a balanced view and at least appear to be well informed. Note that we forked out dosh for those papers and the UK TV license fee is not trivial. Back in the day, I didn't have a bunch of Russians trying to spin crap at my front door, pretending to be Jehovah's Witnesses or double glazing salesmen or my work colleague.

The American election is special, in that it's the \"leader of the free world\". What we do here affects everybody, in a way that even the leadership of Germany, France, and England doesn't. Perhaps we'd have an opinion about the leadership in Russia or China, but they don't have free elections.

Many media companies are owned by very few billionaires and they explicitly see them as propaganda. That said, I'd always marked the Guardian as one of the remaining old schoolers.

Now you can (correctly) argue that there is bias on the reporting side in how they choose to cover certain stories, how they choose what stories to cover, etc but there are still minimum standards they adhere to, like they won't knowingly print anything objectively false. They'll issue corrections and retractions if necessary. The editorial side is quite literally opinion. The Guardian, like any publication, can issue their opinion on a given political race. But you know that's opinion. They'll argue why for their position. You can agree or disagree with their reasoning or conclusions. But it's intellectually honest. Now compare that to Elon and Twitter. It's not even remotely the same. Twitter has an algorithm to decide what to show people. He's used it to push his own posts [1]. His own posts have openly pushed conspiracy theories [2], things that are provably false. This can go as far as pushing literal Nazi conspiracy theories (aka the Great Replacement [3]) and make sure as many people as possible see it. It is utterly disingenuous to conflate the two.

We will have the world’s “most free social network” actually OWNED AND CONTROLLED by one guy, who happens to also work for the government, in fact head up a new government agency tasked with defunding others, and is a super-Fed. People on the left will start to question the optics and unusualness of all this. Will the MAGA party (the acronym GOP seems very outdated) in good faith encourage speech against themselves, and will the owner of X, while heading up a major new agency in the federal government, also encourage loud criticism of their own activities? Or will their algorithms — which one man will continue to ultimately control — silently (and maybe only as an emergent behavior) prioritize what they want and suppress what they don’t? As long as Zuck controls Facebook (sorry, “Meta”), Elon controls Twitter (sorry, “X”), and a few on the top control Google, YouTube, TikTok etc. I do not see true power for the people. “Freedom of speech” is just another expression the owners and corporations co-opted and hijacked to mean “controlling a platform” and “owning an audience”. Why do we simply donate our audience and content to these platforms? Because they have the backend software infrastructure and we don’t.

Twitter is not the community that it used to be. Twitter used to provide me with new updates and cool communities of people. Since the platform got repurposed to become X, the feeds became a negative in my day— so much ragebait, violence and other negative content that pushed me away. Apart from the fact that the algorithm was tweaked to become Elon and Trump biased [1] and that link load times to “undesired” websites got artificially increased [2], the whole monetisation strategy attracted cheap, ragebait content [3]. The platform started paying out for 5M+ impressions. This incudes negative and positive impressions and essentially drives up polarising content more than anything. I believe the issue isn’t about community notes at all, as some suggest, that is such a small thing and critical replies were always a thing. In contrast I believe the real problem is: 1) there’s no point engaging on a platform where every feature can and will be manipulated to serve personal agendas that you do not have control over. 2) Maintaining a presence on X has become a liability– it’s damaging to a set of brands both now and likely in the future. I’m glad the Guardian and other accounts are moving away from X. [1] https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/elon-musk-trump-x-algorit...

Stanley continued: “Trump and the people behind him have already promised to replace the government at all levels with loyalists. [LGBTQ+] citizens, particularly trans citizens and their families, will have to leave the country. Political opponents will be targeted in some way ranging from financial penalties to prison.” Dear Guardian: Hitler got to power in large part because of Ernst Röhm, the leader of the paramilitary SA organization who was openly gay. Hitler supported Röhm's LGBTQ membership until 1934, when the size of the SA surged to 4,000,000 and Röhm became too powerful. Himmler and others intrigued against Röhm, purged him and then suddenly LGBTQ was persecuted. Selectively persecuted, since well-known gay people like Reichsminister Rudolf Hess, who was known gay, stayed in power. reply UltraSane 19 hours agoparentThat seems largely irrelevant to the core thesis of the article. reply thinkingemote 20 hours agoprevThe traditional news in their assessments on why the Democrats lost and Trump won seem to be focusing on platforms and sites.

Many people believed that's what he said, and they spread that information around - this is called misinformation. This isn't the only misinformation around Covid.

There were people saying the Covid vaccine makes you more likely to get Covid (false). There were people saying there are microchips in the Covid vaccine (false). And on and on. Nobody is trying to censor conservatives. It's just that, well, 99% of the people saying this stuff are conservative. So where does that leave us? > It's not playing stupid, you're just not getting a free pass with this sort of rhetoric. No, it's playing stupid.

I'm merely demonstrating why private companies chose to censor. Misinformation during a health crisis isn't free - it costs lives. They don't want to be responsible; they don't want that on their shoulders. So they just silenced the \"vaccines cause autism!\" crowd and moved on. The reason conservatives are \"targeted\" is not because they're conservative, but rather because their platform is being based on lies more and more as time goes on. Science denial, conspiracy theories, a lack of care for human life - these tendencies are rampant in some conservative communities. This isn't fixed going forward, it's only getting worse. It's gotten so bad that a lot of conservatives won't even listen to Trump. Seriously, they think quoting Trump is misinformation. This abject detachment from reality is very concerning to me.

Gwern is an anonymous researcher and writer. He’s deeply influenced the people building AGI. He was one of the first people to see LLM scaling coming. If you’ve read his blog, you’ll know he’s one of the most interesting polymathic thinkers alive. We recorded this conversation in person. In order to protect Gwern’s anonymity, we created this avatar. This isn’t his voice. This isn’t his face. But these are his words. What is the most underrated benefit of anonymity? Gwern The most underrated benefit of anonymity is that people don't project onto you as much. They can't slot you into any particular niche or identity and write you off in advance. They have to at least read you a little bit to even begin to dismiss you. It's great that people cannot retaliate against you. I have derived a lot of benefit from people not being able to mail heroin to my home and call the police to SWAT me. But I always feel that the biggest benefit is just that you get a hearing at all. You don't get immediately written off by the context. (00:01:09) - Automating Steve Jobs Dwarkesh Patel Do you expect companies to be automated top-down (starting with the CEO) or bottom-up (starting with all the workers)? Gwern All of the pressures are to go bottom-up. From existing things, it's just much more palatable in every way to start at the bottom and replace there and work your way up, to eventually where you just have human executives overseeing a firm of AIs. Also from a RL perspective, if we are in fact better than AIs in some way, it should be in the long-term vision thing. The AI will be too myopic to execute any kind of novel long-term strategy and seize new opportunities. That would presumably give you this paradigm where you have a human CEO who does the vision thing. And then the AI corporation scurries around doing his bidding. They don't have the taste that the CEO has. You have one Steve Jobs-type at the helm, and then maybe a whole pyramid of AIs out there executing it and bringing him new proposals. He looks at every individual thing and says, “No, that proposal is bad. This one is good.” That may be hard to quantify, but the human-led firms should, under this view, then outcompete the entirely AI firms, which would keep making myopic choices that just don't quite work out in the long term. Dwarkesh Patel What is the last thing you’d be personally doing? What is the last keystroke that gets automated for you? Gwern The last thing that I see myself still doing right before the nanobots start eating me from the bottom up and I start screaming, “No, I specifically requested the opposite of this….” Right before that, I think what I'm still doing is the Steve Jobs-thing of choosing. My AI minions are bringing me wonderful essays. I'm saying, “This one is better. This is the one that I like,” and possibly building on that and saying, “That's almost right, but you know what would make it really good? If you pushed it to 11 in this way.” Dwarkesh Patel If we do have firms that are made up of AIs, what do you expect the unit of selection to be? Will it be individual models? Will it be the firm as a whole? With humans, we have these debates about whether it’s kin-level selection, individual-level selection, or gene-level selection. What will it be for the AIs? Gwern Once you can replicate individual models perfectly, the unit of selection can move way up and you can do much larger groups and packages of minds. That would be an obvious place to start. You can train individual minds in a differentiable fashion, but then you can't really train the interaction between them. You will have groups of models or minds of people who just work together really well in a global sense, even if you can't attribute it to any particular aspect of their interactions. There are some places you go and people just work well together. There's nothing specific about it, but for whatever reason they all just click in just the right way. That seems like the most obvious unit of selection. You would have packages—I guess possibly department units—where you have a programmer and a manager type, then you have maybe a secretary type, maybe a financial type, a legal type. This is the default package where you just copy everywhere you need a new unit. At this level, you can start evolving them and making random variations to each and then keep the one that performs best. (00:04:38) - Isaac Newton’s theory of progress Dwarkesh Patel By when could one have foreseen the Singularity? Obviously, Moravec and others are talking about it in the eighties and nineties. You could have done it decades earlier. When was the earliest you could have seen where things were headed? Gwern If you want to trace the genealogy there, you'd have to at least go back as far as Samuel Butler's Erewhon in 1872 or his essay before that. In 1863, he describes explicitly his vision of a machine life becoming ever more developed until eventually it’s autonomous. At which point, that's a threat to the human race. This is why he concluded, “war to the death should be instantly proclaimed against them.” That’s prescient for 1863! I'm not sure that anyone has given a clear Singularity scenario earlier than that. The idea of technological progress was still relatively new at that point. I love the example of Isaac Newton looking at the rates of progress in Newton's time and going, “Wow, there's something strange here. Stuff is being invented now. We're making progress. How is that possible?” And then coming up with the answer, “Well, progress is possible now because civilization gets destroyed every couple of thousand years, and all we're doing is we're rediscovering the old stuff.” That's Newton's explanation for technological acceleration. We can't actually have any kind of real technological acceleration. It must be because the world gets destroyed periodically and we just can't see past the last reset. Dwarkesh Patel It’s almost like Fermi's paradox, but for different civilizations across time with respect to each other instead of aliens across space. Gwern Yeah. It turns out even Lucretius, around 1,700 years before that, is writing the same argument. “Look at all these wonderful innovations and arts and sciences that we Romans have compiled together in the Roman empire! This is amazing, but it can't actually be a recent acceleration in technology. Could that be real? No, that’s crazy. Obviously, the world was recently destroyed.” Dwarkesh Patel Interesting. Gwern It is, it is. (00:06:36) - Grand theory of intelligence Dwarkesh Patel What is the grand parsimonious theory of intelligence going to look like? It seems like you have all of these trends across different fields—like scaling laws in AI, like the scaling of the human brain when we went from primates to humans, the uniformity of the neocortex—and basically many other things which seem to be pointing towards some grand theory that should exist which explains what intelligence is. What do you think that will look like? Gwern The 10,000 foot view of intelligence, that I think the success of scaling points to, is that all intelligence is is search over Turing machines. Anything that happens can be described by Turing machines of various lengths. All we are doing when we are doing “learning,” or when we are doing “scaling,” is that we're searching over more and longer Turing machines, and we are applying them in each specific case. Otherwise, there is no general master algorithm. There is no special intelligence fluid. It's just a tremendous number of special cases that we learn and we encode into our brains. Dwarkesh Patel I don’t know. When I look at the ways in which my smart friends are smart, it just feels more like a general horsepower kind of thing. They've just got more juice. That seems more compatible with this master algorithm perspective rather than this Turing machine perspective. It doesn’t really feel like they’ve got this long tail of Turing machines that they’ve learned. How does this picture account for variation in human intelligence? Gwern Well, yeah. When we talk about more or less intelligence, it's just that they have more compute in order to do search over more Turing machines for longer. I don’t think there's anything else other than that. So from any learned brain you could extract small solutions to specific problems, because all the large brain is doing with the compute is finding it. That's why you never find any “IQ gland”. There is nowhere in the brain where, if you hit it, you eliminate fluid intelligence. This doesn’t exist. Because what your brain is doing is a lot of learning of individual specialized problems. Once those individual problems are learned, then they get recombined for fluid intelligence. And that's just, you know… intelligence. Typically with a large neural network model, you can always pull out a small model which does a specific task equally well. Because that's all the large model is. It's just a gigantic ensemble of small models tailored to the ever-escalating number of tiny problems you have been feeding them. Dwarkesh Patel If intelligence is just search over Turing machines—and of course intelligence is tremendously valuable and useful—doesn't that make it more surprising that intelligence took this long to evolve in humans? Gwern Not really, I would actually say that it helps explain why human-level intelligence is not such a great idea and so rare to evolve. Because any small Turing machine could always be encoded more directly by your genes, with sufficient evolution. You have these organisms where their entire neural network is just hard-coded by the genes. So if you could do that, obviously that's way better than some sort of colossally expensive, unreliable, glitchy search process—like what humans implement—which takes whole days, in some cases, to learn. Whereas you could be hardwired right from birth. For many creatures, it just doesn't pay to be intelligent because that's not actually adaptive. There are better ways to solve the problem than a general purpose intelligence. In any kind of niche where it's static, or where intelligence will be super expensive, or where you don't have much time because you're a short-lived organism, it's going to be hard to evolve a general purpose learning mechanism when you could instead evolve one that's tailored to the specific problem that you encounter. (00:10:39) - Seeing scaling early Dwarkesh Patel You're one of the only people outside OpenAI in 2020 who had a picture of the way in which AI was progressing and had a very detailed theory, an empirical theory of scaling in particular. I’m curious what processes you were using at the time which allowed you to see the picture you painted in the “Scaling Hypothesis” post that you wrote at the time. Gwern If I had to give an intellectual history of that for me, it would start in the mid-2000s when I’m reading Moravec and Ray Kurzweil. At the time, they're making this kind of fundamental connectionist argument that if you had enough computing power, that could result in discovering the neural network architecture that matches the human brain. And that until that happens, until that amount of computing power is available, AI is basically futile. To me, I found this argument very unlikely, because it’s very much a “build it and they will come” view of progress, which at the time I just did not think was correct. I thought it was ludicrous to suggest that simply because there’s some supercomputer out there which matches the human brain, then that would just summon out of nonexistence the correct algorithm. Algorithms are really complex and hard! They require deep insight—or at least I thought they did. It seemed like really difficult mathematics. You can't just buy a bunch of computers and expect to get this advanced AI out of it! It just seemed like magical thinking. So I knew the argument, but I was super skeptical. I didn't pay too much attention, but Shane Legg and some others were very big on this in the years following. And as part of my interest in transhumanism and LessWrong and AI risk, I was paying close attention to Legg’s blog posts where he's extrapolating out the trend with updated numbers from Kurzweil and Moravec. And he's giving very precise predictions about how we’re going to get the first generalist system around 2019, as Moore's law keeps going. And then around 2025, we'll get the first human-ish agents with generalist capabilities. Then by 2030, we should have AGI. Along the way, DanNet and AlexNet came out. When those came out I was like, “Wow, that's a very impressive success story of connectionism. But is it just an isolated success story? Or is this what Kurzweil and Moravec and Legg were predicting— that we would get GPUs and then better algorithms would just show up?” So I started thinking to myself that this is something to keep an eye on. Maybe this is not quite as stupid an idea as I had originally thought. I just keep reading deep learning literature and noticing again and again that the dataset size keeps getting bigger. The models keep getting bigger. The GPUs slowly crept up from one GPU—the cheapest consumer GPU—to two, and then they were eventually training on eight. And you can just see the fact that the neural networks keep expanding from these incredibly niche use cases that do next to nothing. The use just kept getting broader and broader and broader. I would say to myself, “Wow, is there anything CNNs can't do?” I would just see people apply CNN to something else every individual day on arXiv. So for me it was this gradual trickle of drops hitting me in the background as I was going along with my life. Every few days, another drop would fall. I’d go, “Huh? Maybe intelligence really is just a lot of compute applied to a lot of data, applied to a lot of parameters. Maybe Moravec and Legg and Kurzweil were right.” I’d just note that, and continue on, thinking to myself, “Huh, if that was true, it would have a lot of implications.” So there was no real eureka moment there. It was just continually watching this trend that no one else seemed to see, except possibly a handful of people like Ilya Sutskever, or Schmidhuber. I would just pay attention and notice that the world over time looked more like their world than it looked like my world, where algorithms are super important and you need like deep insight to do stuff. Their world just kept happening. And then GPT-1 comes out and I was like, “Wow, this unsupervised sentiment neuron is just learning on its own. That's pretty amazing.” It was also a very compute-centric view. You just build the Transformer and the intelligence will come. And then GPT-2 comes out and I had this “holy shit!” moment. You look at the prompting and the summarization: “Holy shit, do we live in their world? And then GPT-3 comes out and that was the crucial test. It's a big, big scale-up. It's one of the biggest scale-ups in all neural network history. Going from GPT-2 to GPT-3, that's not a super narrow specific task like Go. It really seemed like it was the crucial test. If scaling was bogus, then the GPT-3 paper should just be unimpressive and wouldn't show anything important. Whereas if scaling was true, you would just automatically be guaranteed to get so much more impressive results out of it than GPT-2. I opened up the first page, maybe the second page, and I saw the few-shot learning chart. And I'm like, “Holy shit, we are living in the scaling world. Legg and Moravec and Kurzweil were right!” And then I turned to Twitter and everyone else was like, “Oh, you know, this shows that scaling works so badly. Why, it's not even state-of-the-art!” That made me so angry I had to write all this up. Someone was wrong on the Internet. Dwarkesh Patel I remember in 2020, people were writing bestselling books about AI. It was definitely a thing people were talking about, but people were not noticing the most salient things in retrospect: LLMs, GPT-3, scaling laws. All these people who are talking about AI but missing this crucial crux, what were they getting wrong? Gwern I think for the most part they were suffering from two issues. First, they had not been paying attention to all of the scaling results before that which were relevant. They had not really appreciated the fact that, for example, AlphaZero was discovered in part by DeepMind doing Bayesian optimization on the hyperparameters and noticing that you could just get rid of more and more of the tree search as you went and you got better models. That was a critical insight, which could only have been gained by having so much compute power that you could afford to train many, many versions and see the difference that that made. Similarly, those people simply did not know about the Baidu paper on scaling laws in 2017, which showed that the scaling laws just keep going and going forever, practically. It should have been the most important paper of the year, but a lot of people just did not prioritize it. It didn't have any immediate implication, and so it sort of got forgotten. People were too busy discussing Transformers or AlphaZero or something to really notice it. So that was one issue. Another issue is that they shared the basic error I was making about algorithms being more important than compute. This was, in part, due to a systematic falsification of the actual origins of ideas in the research literature. Papers do not tell you where the ideas come from in a truthful manner. They just tell you a nice sounding story about how it was discovered. They don’t tell you how it’s actually discovered. So even if you appreciate the role of trial and error and compute power in your own experiment as a researcher, you probably just think, “Oh, I got lucky that way. My experience is unrepresentative. Over in the next lab, there they do things by the power of thought and deep insight.” Then it turns out that everywhere you go, compute and data, trial and error, and serendipity play enormous roles in how things actually happened. Once you understand that, then you understand why compute comes first. You can't do trial and error and serendipity without it. You can write down all these beautiful ideas, but you just can't test them out. Even a small difference in hyperparameters, or a small choice of architecture, can make a huge difference to the results. When you only can do a few instances, you would typically find that it doesn't work, and you would give up and you would go away and do something else. Whereas if you had more compute power, you could keep trying. Eventually, you hit something that works great. Once you have a working solution, you can simplify it and improve it and figure out why it worked and get a nice, robust solution that would work no matter what you did to it. But until then, you're stuck. You're just flailing around in this regime where nothing works. So you have this horrible experience going through the old deep learning literature and seeing all sorts of contemporary ideas people had back then, which were completely correct. But they didn't have the compute to train what you know would have worked. It’s just tremendously tragic. You can look at things like ResNets being published back in 1988, instead of 2015. And it would have worked! It did work, but at such a small scale that it was irrelevant. You couldn't use it for anything real. It just got forgotten, so you had to wait until 2015 for ResNets to actually come along and be a revolution in deep learning. So that’s kind of the double bias of why you would believe that scaling was not going to work. You did not notice the results that were key, in retrospect, like the BigGAN scaling to 300 million images. There are still people today who would tell you with a straight face that GANs cannot scale past millions of images. They just don't know that BigGAN handled 300 million images without a sweat. If you don't know that, well you probably would easily think, “Oh, GANs are broken.” But if you do know that, then you think to yourself, “How can algorithms be so important when all these different generative architectures all work so well—as long as you have lots and lots of GPUs?” That's the common ingredient. You have to have lots and lots of GPUs. (00:21:04) - AGI Timelines Dwarkesh Patel What do your timelines look like over the last 20 years? Is AI just monotonically getting closer over time? Gwern I would say it was very far away, from like 2005 to 2010. It was somewhere well past like 2050. It was close enough that I thought I might live to see it, but I was not actually sure if there was any reasonable chance. But once AlexNet and DanNet came out, then it just kept dropping at a rate of like 2 years per year, every year until now. We just kept on hitting barriers to deep learning and doing better. Regardless of how it was doing it, it was obviously getting way better. It just seemed none of the alternative paradigms were doing well. This one was doing super well. Dwarkesh Patel Was there a time that you felt you had updated too far? Gwern Yeah, there were a few times I thought I had overshot. I thought people over-updated on AlphaGo. They went too far on AI hype with AlphaGo. Afterwards, when pushes into big reinforcement learning efforts kind of all fizzled out—like post-Dota, as the reinforcement learning wasn't working out for solving those hard problems outside of the simulated game universes—then I started thinking, “Okay, maybe we kinda overshot there…” But then GPT came out of nowhere and basically erased all that. It was like, \"Oh, shit. Here's how RL is going to work. It's going to be the cherry on the cake. We're just going to focus on the cake for a while.” Now we have actually figured out a good recipe for baking a cake, which was not true before. Before, it seemed like you were going to have to brute-force it end-to-end from the rewards. But now you can do the LeCun thing, of learning fast on generative models and then just doing a little bit of RL on top to make it do something specific. (00:22:54) - What to do in remaining 3 years until AGI Dwarkesh Patel Now that you know that AGI is a thing that's coming, what’s your thinking around how you see your role in this timeline? How are you thinking about how to spend these next few years? Gwern I have been thinking about that quite a lot. What do I want to do? What would be useful to do? I'm doing things now because I want to do them, regardless of whether it will be possible for an AI to do them in like 3 years. I do something because I want to. Because I like it, I find it funny or whatever. Or I think carefully about doing just the human part of it, like laying out a proposal for something. If you take seriously the idea of getting AGI in a few years, you don't necessarily have to implement stuff and do it yourself. You can sketch out clearly what you want, and why it would be good and how to do it. And then just wait for the better AGI to come along and actually do it then. Unless there's some really compelling reason to do it right now and pay that cost of your scarce time. But otherwise, I’m trying to write more about what is not recorded. Things like preferences and desires and evaluations and judgments. Things that an AI could not replace even in principle. The way I like to put it is that “the AI cannot eat ice cream for you”. It cannot decide for you which kind of ice cream you like. Only you can do that. And if anything else did, it would be worthless, because it's not your particular preference. That's kind of the rubric. Is this something I want to do regardless of any future AI, because I enjoy it? Or is this something where I'm doing only the human part of it and the AGI can later on do it? Or is this writing down something that is unwritten and thus helping the future AI versions of me? So if it doesn't fall under those 3, I have been trying to not do it. If you look at it that way, many of the projects that people do now have basically no lasting value. They’re doing things that they don't enjoy, which record nothing ephemeral of value that could not be inferred or generated later on. They are, at best, getting 2 or 3 years of utility out of it before it could have been done by an AI system. Dwarkesh Patel Wait, your timeline for when an AI could write a Gwern-quality essay is two to three years? Gwern Ehmm… I have ideas about how to make it possible, which might not require AGI if it combined my entire corpus. Many potential essay ideas are already mostly done in my corpus. So you don't need to be super intelligent to pull it out. So let’s talk about AGI in general: the Anthropic timeline of 2028 seems like a good personal planning starting point. Even if you're wrong, you probably weren't going to do a lot of projects within the next 3 years anyway. It's not like you really lost much by instead just writing down the description. You can always go back and do it yourself if you're wrong. (00:26:29) - Influencing the shoggoth with writing Dwarkesh Patel You wrote an interesting comment about getting your work into the LLM training corpus: \"there has never been a more vital hinge-y time to write.\" Do you mean that in the sense that you will be this drop in the bucket that’s steering the Shoggoth one way or the other? Or do you mean it in the sense of making sure your values and persona persist somewhere in latent space? Gwern I mean both. By writing, you are voting on the future of the Shoggoth using one of the few currencies it acknowledges: tokens it has to predict. If you aren't writing, you are abdicating the future or your role in it. If you think it's enough to just be a good citizen, to vote for your favorite politician, to pick up litter and recycle, the future doesn't care about you. There are ways to influence the Shoggoth more, but not many. If you don't already occupy a handful of key roles or work at a frontier lab, your influence rounds off to 0, far more than ever before. If there are values you have which are not expressed yet in text, if there are things you like or want, if they aren't reflected online, then to the AI they don't exist. That is dangerously close to won't exist. But yes, you are also creating a sort of immortality for yourself personally. You aren't just creating a persona, you are creating your future self too. What self are you showing the LLMs, and how will they treat you in the future? I give the example of Kevin Roose discovering that current LLMs—all of them, not just GPT-4—now mistreat him because of his interactions with Sydney, which \"revealed\" him to be a privacy-invading liar, and they know this whenever they interact with him or discuss him. Usually, when you use a LLM chatbot, it doesn't dislike you personally! On the flip side, it also means that you can try to write for the persona you would like to become, to mold yourself in the eyes of AI, and thereby help bootstrap yourself. Dwarkesh Patel Things like the Vesuvius Challenge show us that we can learn more about the past than we thought possible. They’ve leaked more bits of information that we can recover with new techniques. Apply that to the present and think about what the future superhuman intelligences will be trying to uncover about the current present. What kinds of information do you think are going to be totally inaccessible to the transhumanist historians of the future? Gwern Any kind of stable, long-term characteristics, the sort of thing you would still have even if you were hit on the head and had amnesia… Anything like that will be definitely recoverable from all the traces of your writing, assuming you're not pathologically private and destroy everything possible. That should all be recoverable. What won't be recoverable will be everything that you could forget ordinarily: autobiographical information, how you felt at a particular time, what you thought of some movie. All of that is the sort of thing that vanishes and can't be recovered from traces afterwards. If it wasn't written down, it wasn't written down. (00:30:50) - Human vs artificial intelligence Dwarkesh Patel What is the biggest unresolved tension in your worldview? Gwern The thing I swing back and forth the most on is the relationship between human intelligence and neural network intelligence. It's not clear in what sense they are two sides of the same coin, or one is an inferior version of the other. This is something that I constantly go back and forth on: “Humans are awesome.” “No, neural networks are awesome.” Or, “No, both suck.” Or, “Both are awesome, just in different ways.” So every day I argue with myself a little bit about why each one is good or bad or how. What is the whole deal there with things like GPT-4 and memorization, but not being creative? Why do humans not remember anything, but we still seem to be so smart? One day I'll argue that language models are sample efficient compared to humans. The next day I'll be arguing the opposite. Dwarkesh Patel One of the interesting points you made to me last year was that AI might be the most polymathic topic to think about because there’s no field or discipline that is not relevant to thinking about AI. Obviously you need computer science and hardware. But you also need things like primatology and understanding what changed between chimp and human brains, or the ultimate laws of physics that will constrain future AI civilizations. That’s all relevant to understanding AI. I wonder if it’s because of this polymathic nature of thinking about AI. that you’ve been especially productive at it. Gwern I'm not sure it was necessary. When I think about others who were correct, like Shane Legg or Dario Amodei, they don't seem to be all that polymathic. They just have broad intellectual curiosity, broad general understanding, absolutely. But they’re not absurdly polymathic. Clearly you could get to the correct view without being polymathic. That's just how I happen to come to it at this point and the connection I’m making post hoc. It wasn’t like I was using primatology to justify scaling to myself. It's more like I'm now using scaling to think about primatology. Because, obviously, if scaling is true, it has to tell us something about humans and monkeys and all other forms of intelligence. It just has to. If that works, it can't be a coincidence and totally unrelated. I refuse to believe that there are two totally unrelated kinds of intelligence, or paths to intelligence—where humans, monkeys, guppies, dogs are all one thing, and then neural networks and computers are another thing—and they have absolutely nothing to do with each other. That's obviously wrong. They can be two sides of the same coin. They can obviously have obscure connections. Maybe one could be a better form or whatever. They can't just be completely unrelated. As if humans finally got to Mars and then simultaneously a bunch of space aliens landed on Mars for the first time and that's how we met. You would never believe that. It would be just too absurd. (00:33:52) - Rabbit holes Dwarkesh Patel What is it that you are trying to maximize in your life? Gwern I maximize rabbit holes. I love more than anything else, falling into a new rabbit hole. That's what I really look forward to. Like this sudden new idea or area that I had no idea about, where I can suddenly fall into a rabbit hole for a while. Even things that might seem bad are a great excuse for falling into a rabbit hole. Here’s one example. I buy some catnip for my cat and I waste $10 when I find out that he's catnip-immune. I can now fall into a rabbit hole of the question of “well, why are some cats catnip-immune? Is this a common thing in other countries? How does it differ in other countries? What alternative catnip drugs are there?” (It turned out to be quite a few.) I was wondering, “How can I possibly predict which drug my cat would respond to? Why are they reacting in these different ways?”... Just a wonderful rabbit hole of new questions and topics I can master and get answers to, or create new ones, and exhaust my interest until I find the next rabbit hole I can dig and dive into. Dwarkesh Patel What is the longest rabbit hole you've gone on which didn't lead anywhere satisfying? Gwern That was my very old work on the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion, which I was very fond of when I was younger. I put a ludicrous amount of work into reading everything ever written about Evangelion in English and trying to understand its development and why it is the way it is. I never really got a solid answer on that before I burned out on it. I actually do understand it now by sheer chance many years later. But at this point, I no longer care enough to write about it or try to redo it or finish it. In the end, it all wound up being basically a complete waste. I have not used it in any of my other essays much at all. That was really one deep rabbit hole that I almost got to the end of, but I couldn't clinch it. Dwarkesh Patel How do you determine when to quit a rabbit hole? And how many rabbit holes do you concurrently have going on at the same time? Gwern You can only really explore two or three rabbit holes simultaneously. Otherwise, you aren't putting real effort into each one. You’re not really digging the hole, it's not really a rabbit hole. It's just something you are somewhat interested in. A rabbit hole is really obsessive. If you aren't obsessed with it and continually driven by it, it's not a rabbit hole. That’s my view. I’d say two or three max, if you're spending a lot of time and effort on each one and neglecting everything else. As for when you exit a rabbit hole, you usually hit a very natural terminus where getting any further answers requires data that do not exist or you have questions that people don't know the answer to. You reach a point where everything dies out and you see no obvious next step. One example would be when I was interested in analogs to nicotine that might be better than nicotine. That was a bit of a rabbit hole, but I quickly hit the dead end that there are none. That was a pretty definitive dead end. I couldn't get my hands on the metabolites of nicotine as an alternative. So if there are no analogs and you can't get your hands on the one interesting chemical you find, well that's that. That's a pretty definitive end to that rabbit hole. Dwarkesh Patel Have you always been the kind of person who falls into rabbit holes? When did this start? Gwern Oh, yeah. My parents could tell you all about that. I was very much your stereotypical nerdy little kid having the dinosaur phase and the construction equipment phase and the submarine and tank phase. Dwarkesh Patel Many kids are into “those things,” but they don't rabbit hole to the extent that they’re forming taxonomies about the different submarines and flora and fauna and dinosaurs, and developing theories of why they came to be and so forth. Gwern Well, I think it's more that people grow out of being very into rabbit holes as a kid. For me, it was not so much that I was all that exceptional in having obsessions as a kid. It’s more that they never really stopped. The tank phase would be replaced by my Alcatraz phase where I would go to the public library and check out everything they had about Alcatraz. That would be replaced by another phase where I was obsessed with ancient Japanese literature. I would check out everything that the library had about Japanese literature before the haiku era. The process of falling into these obsessions kept going for me. (00:38:48) - Hearing impairment Dwarkesh Patel By the way, do you mind if I ask how long you’ve been hearing impaired? Gwern Since birth. I've always been hearing impaired. Dwarkesh Patel And I assume that impacted you through your childhood and at school? Gwern Oh, yeah, absolutely, hugely. I went to a special ed school before kindergarten for hearing impaired and other handicapped kids. During school it was very rough because at the time, we had to use pairs of hearing aids hooked up to the teacher. Every class I would have to go up to the teacher with a big brown box with the hearing aids so she could use it. I always felt very humiliated by that, how it marked me out as different from other kids, not being able to hear. The effects on socializing with other kids is terrible because you're always a second behind in conversation if you're trying to understand what the other person is saying. The hearing aids back then were pretty terrible. They've gotten a lot better but back then they were pretty terrible. You would always be behind. You'd always be feeling like the odd person out. Even if you could have been a wonderful conversationalist, you can't be if you're always a second behind and jumping in late. When you are hearing impaired, you understand acutely how quickly conversation moves. Milliseconds separate the moment between jumping in and everyone letting you talk, and someone else talking over you. That's just an awful experience if you're a kid who's already kind of introverted. It’s not like I was very extroverted as a kid, or now. So that was always a barrier. Then you had a lot of minor distortions. I still have a weird fear of rain and water because it was drilled into me that I could not get the hearing aids wet because they were very expensive. I would always feel a kind of low-grade, stressful anxiety around anywhere like a pool, a body of water. Even now, I always feel weird about swimming, which I kind of enjoy. But I'm always thinking to myself, “Oh, wow, I won't be able to see because I'm nearsighted and I won't be able to hear because I had to take off my hearing aid to go in. I can't hear anything that anyone says to me in the pool, which takes a lot of the fun out of it.” Dwarkesh Patel You have a list of open questions on your website and one of them is, “Why do the biographies of so many great people start off with traumatic childhoods?” I wonder if you have an answer for yourself. Was there something about the effect that hearing impairment had on your childhood, your inability to socialize, that was somehow important to you becoming Gwern? Gwern It definitely led to me being so much of a bookworm. That's one of the things you can do as a kid which is completely unaffected by any kind of hearing impairment. It was also just a way to get words and language. Even now, I still often speak words in an incorrect way because I only learned them from books. It's the classic thing where you mispronounce a word because you learn it from a book and not from hearing other people sound it out and say it. Dwarkesh Patel Is your speech connected to your hearing impairment? Gwern Yes. The deaf accent is from the hearing impairment. It's funny, at least three people on this trip to SF have already asked me where I am really from. It's very funny. You look at me and you’re like, “Oh, yes, he looks like a perfectly ordinary American.” Then I open my mouth and it’s, “Oh, gosh, he's Swedish. Wow. Or maybe possibly Norwegian. I'll ask him where he's actually from. How did he come to America?” I've been here the whole time! That's just how hearing impaired people sound. No matter how fluent you get, you still bear the scars of growing up hearing impaired. At least when you're born with it—or from very early childhood—your cognitive development of hearing and speech is always a little off, even with therapy. One reason I don't like doing podcasts is that I have no confidence that I sound good, or at least, sound nearly as good as I write. Maybe I'll put it that way. (00:43:00) - Wikipedia editing Dwarkesh Patel What were you doing with all these rabbit holes before you started blogging? Was there a place where you would compile them? Gwern Before I started blogging, I was editing Wikipedia. That was really gwern.net before gwern.net. Everything I do now with my site, I would have done on English Wikipedia. If you go and read some of the articles I am still very proud of—like the Wikipedia article on Fujiwara no Teika—and you would think pretty quickly to yourself, “Ah yes, Gwern wrote this, didn't he?” Dwarkesh Patel Is it fair to say that the training that required to make gwern.net happened on Wikipedia? Gwern Yeah. I think so. I have learned far more from editing Wikipedia than I learned from any of my school or college training. Everything I learned about writing I learned by editing Wikipedia. Dwarkesh Patel Honestly, it sounds like Wikipedia is a great training ground if you wanted to make a thousand more Gwerns. This is where we train them. Gwern Building something like an alternative to Wikipedia could be a good training ground. For me it was beneficial to combine rabbit-holing with Wikipedia, because Wikipedia would generally not have many good articles on the thing that I was rabbit-holing on. It was a very natural progression from the relatively passive experience of rabbit-holing—where you just read everything you can about a topic—to compiling that and synthesizing it on Wikipedia. You go from piecemeal, a little bit here and there, to writing full articles. Once you are able to write good full Wikipedia articles and summarize all your work, now you can go off on your own and pursue entirely different kinds of writing now that you have learned to complete things and get them across the finish line. It would be difficult to do that with the current English Wikipedia. It's objectively just a much larger Wikipedia than it was back in like 2004. But not only are there far more articles filled in at this point, the editing community is also much more hostile to content contribution, particularly very detailed, obsessive, rabbit hole-y kind of research projects. They would just delete it or tell you that this is not for original research or that you're not using approved sources. Possibly you’d have someone who just decided to get their jollies that day by deleting large swathes of your specific articles. That of course is going to make you very angry and make you probably want to quit and leave before you get going. So I don't quite know how you would figure out this alternative to Wikipedia, one that empowers the rabbit holer as much as the old Wikipedia did. When you are an editor with Wikipedia, you have a very empowered attitude because you know that anything in it could be wrong and you could be the one to fix it. If you see something that doesn't make sense to you, that could be an opportunity for an edit. That was, at least, the Wiki attitude: anyone could fix it, and “anyone” includes you. Dwarkesh Patel When you were an editor on Wikipedia, was that your full-time occupation? Gwern It would eat as much time as I let it. I could easily spend 8 hours a day reviewing edits and improving articles while I was rabbit-holing. But otherwise I would just neglect it and only review the most suspicious diffs on articles that I was particularly interested in on my watchlist. I might only spend like 20 minutes a day. It was sort of like going through morning email. Dwarkesh Patel Was this while you were at university or after? Gwern I got started on Wikipedia in late middle school or possibly early high school. It was kind of funny. I started skipping lunch in the cafeteria and just going to the computer lab in the library and alternating between Neopets and Wikipedia. I had Neopets in one tab and my Wikipedia watch lists in the other. Dwarkesh Patel Were there other kids in middle school or high school who were into this kind of stuff? Gwern No, I think I was the only editor there, except for the occasional jerks who would vandalize Wikipedia. I would know that because I would check the IP to see what edits were coming from the school library IP addresses. Kids being kids thought they would be jerks and vandalize Wikipedia. For a while it was kind of trendy. Early on, Wikipedia was breaking through to mass awareness and controversy. It’s like the way LLMs are now. A teacher might say, “My student keeps reading Wikipedia and relying on it. How can it be trusted?” So in that period, it was kind of trendy to vandalize Wikipedia and show your friends. There were other Wikipedia editors at my school in that sense, but as far as I knew I was the only one building it, rather than wrecking it. (00:47:43) - Gwern.net Dwarkesh Patel When did you start blogging on gwern.net? I assume this was after the Wikipedia editor phase. Was that after university? Gwern It was afterwards. I had graduated and the Wikipedia community had been very slowly moving in a direction I did not like. It was triggered by the Siegenthaler incident which I feel was really the defining moment in the trend toward deletionism on Wikipedia. It just became ever more obvious that Wikipedia was not the site I had joined and loved to edit and rabbit hole on and fill in, and that if I continued contributing I was often just wasting my effort. I began thinking about writing more on my own account and moving into non-Wikipedia sorts of writings: persuasive essays, nonfiction, commenting, or possibly even fiction. I began gently moving beyond things like Reddit and LessWrong comments to start something longform. Dwarkesh Patel What was your first big hit? Gwern Silk Road. I had been a little bit interested in Bitcoin, but not too seriously interested in it because it was not obvious to me that it was going to work out, or even was technologically feasible. But when Adrian Chen wrote his Gawker article about buying LSD off Silk Road, all of a sudden I did a complete 180. I had this moment of, “Holy shit, this is so real that you can buy drugs off the Internet with it!” I looked into the Chen article and it was very obvious to me that people wanted to know what the ordering process was like. They wanted more details about what it’s like, because the article was very brief about that. It didn't go into any real detail about the process. So I thought, “Okay, I'm interested in nootropics. I'm interested in drugs. I will go and use Silk Road. I will document it for everyone, instead of everyone pussyfooting around it online and saying, ‘Oh, a friend of mine ordered off Silk Road and it worked.’ None of that bullshit. I will just document it straightforwardly.” I ordered some Adderall, I think it was, and documented the entire process with screenshots. I wrote it up and wrote some more on the intellectual background. That was a huge hit when I published it. It was hundreds of thousands of hits. It's crazy. Even today when I go to the Google Analytics charts, you can still see “Silk Road” spiking vertically like crazy and then falling back down. Nothing else really comes near it in terms of traffic. That was really quite something, to see things go viral like that. (00:50:20) - Counterfactual careers Dwarkesh Patel What are the counterfactual career trajectories and life paths that could have been for you if you didn’t become an online writer? What might you be doing instead that seems plausible? Gwern I could definitely have been an AI researcher, or possibly in management at one of the big AI companies. I would have regretted not being able to write about stuff, but I would’ve taken satisfaction in making it happen and putting my thumbprint on it. Those are totally plausible counterfactuals. Dwarkesh Patel Why didn't you? Gwern I kind of fell off that track very early on in my career when I found the curriculum of Java to be excruciatingly boring and painful. So I dropped out of computer science. That kind of put me off that track early on. And then various early writing topics made it hard to transition in any other way than starting a startup, which I'm not really temperamentally suited for. Things like writing about the darknet markets or behavioral genetics, these are topics which don't exactly scream “great hire.” Dwarkesh Patel Has agency turned out to be harder than you might have thought initially? We have models that seem like they should be able to do all of the individual things that a software engineer does. For example, all the code they might write, all the individual pull requests. But it seems like a really hard problem to get them to act as a coherent, autonomous, software engineer that puts in his eight hours a day. Gwern I think agency is, in many senses, actually easier to learn than we would have thought ten years ago. But we actually aren't learning agency at all in current systems. There’s no selection for that. All the agency there is is an accidental byproduct of somebody training on data. So from that perspective, it's miraculous that you can ask an LLM to try to do all these things and they have a non-trivial success rate. If you told people ten years ago—that you could just behavior-clone on individual letters following one by one, and you could get coherent action out of it and control robots and write entire programs—their jaws would drop and they would say that you've been huffing too many fumes from DeepMind or something. The reason that agency doesn't work is that we do so little actual agency training at all. An example of how you would do agency directly would be like Gato from DeepMind. There they’re actually training agents. Instead we train them on Internet scrapes which merely encode the outputs of agents or occasional descriptions of agents doing things. There’s no actual logging of state/action/result/reward sequences like a proper reinforcement learning setup would have. I would say that what's more interesting is that nobody wants to train agents in a proper reinforcement learning way. Instead, everyone wants to train LLMs and do everything with as little RL as possible in the backend. (00:54:30) - Borges & literature Dwarkesh Patel What would a person like you be doing before the Internet existed? Gwern If the Internet did not exist, I would have to have tried to make it in regular academia and maybe narrow my interests a lot more, something I could publish on regularly. Or I could possibly have tried to opt out and become a librarian like one of my favorite writers, Jorge Luis Borges. He was a librarian until he succeeded as a writer. Of course, I've always agreed with him about imagining paradise as a kind of library. I love libraries. I regret that all the reading I do is now on the computer and I don't get to spend much time in physical libraries. I do genuinely love them, just pouring through the stacks and looking for random stuff. Some of the best times for me in university was being able to go through these gigantic stacks of all sorts of obscure books and just looking at a random spine, pulling stuff off the shelf and reading obscure, old technical journals to see all the strange and wonderful things they were doing back then, which now have been forgotten. Dwarkesh Patel If you could ask Borges one question, what would it be? Gwern Oh. He's a real hero of mine. This is not something I want to give a bad answer to. [“Would it have been worth living if you could never write, only read, like the people in ‘The Library of Babel’?”] Dwarkesh Patel Can I ask why he's a hero of yours? Gwern When I was younger, one of the science fiction books that really impressed me was Dan Simmons' Hyperion, especially The Fall of Hyperion. In there, he alludes to Kevin Kelly's Out of Control book, which strongly features the parable of “The Library of Babel.” From there, I got the collected editions of Borges’ fiction and nonfiction. I just read through them again and again. I was blown away by the fact that you could be so creative, with all this polymathic knowledge and erudition, and write these wonderful, entertaining, provocative short stories and essays. I thought to myself, “If I could be like any writer, any writer at all, I would not mind being Borges.” Dwarkesh Patel Borges has a short poem called \"Borges and I\" where he talks about how he doesn’t identify with the version of himself that is actually doing the writing and publishing all of this great work. I don’t know if you identify with that at all. Gwern When I was a kid, I did not understand that essay, but I think I understand it now. Dwarkesh Patel What are other pieces of either literature that you encountered where now you really understand what they were getting at but you didn’t when you first came across them? Gwern Ted Chiang's \"Story of Your Life.\" I completely blew [it] understanding it the first time I read it. I had to get a lot more context where I could actually go back and understand what his point was. Gene Wolfe's \"Suzanne Delage\" story was a complete mystery to me. It took like 14 years to actually understand it. But I'm very proud of that one. Dwarkesh Patel What did you figure out about Suzanne Delage? Gwern Gene Wolfe's \"Suzanne Delage\" is a very, very short story about a guy remembering not meeting a woman in his local town and thinking, “Oh, that's kind of strange.” That's the whole story. Nobody has any idea what it means, even though we're told that it means something. Gene Wolfe is a genius writer, but nobody could figure it out for like 40 years. Last year I figured it out. It turns out it's actually a subtle retelling of Dracula, where Dracula invades the town and steals the woman from him. He's been brainwashed by Dracula—in a very Bram Stoker way—to forget it all. Every single part of the story is told by what's not said in the narrator's recollection. It's incredible. It's the only story I know which is so convincingly written by what's not in it. Dwarkesh Patel That’s crazy that you figured that out. The Ted Chiang story, the “Story of Your Life,” can you remind me what that one’s about? Gwern The surface story is just about a bunch of weird aliens who came to Earth. Dwarkesh Patel Oh, that's right, yeah. It’s the same plot as Arrival. Gwern They had a weird language which didn't have a sense of time. The narrator learned to see the future, and then the aliens left. Dwarkesh Patel What is it that you realized about that story? Gwern The first time I read it, it struck me as just a kind of stupid ESP story about seeing the future, very stupid, boring, standard conventional, verbose, and dragging in much irrelevant physics. Only a while after that did I understand that it was not about time travel or being able to see the future. It was instead about a totally alien kind of mind that’s equally valid in its own way, in which you see everything as part of an already determined story heading to a predestined end. This turned out to be mathematically equivalent and equally powerful as our conventional view of the world—events marching one by one to an unknown and changing future. That was a case where Chiang was just writing at too high a level for me to understand. I pattern-matched it to some much more common, stupid story. Dwarkesh Patel How do you think about the value of reading fiction versus nonfiction? Gwern You could definitely spend the rest of your life reading fiction and not benefit whatsoever from it other than having memorized a lot of trivia about things that people made up. I tend to be pretty cynical about the benefits of fiction. Most fiction is not written to make you better in any way. It's written just to entertain you, or to exist and to fill up time. Dwarkesh Patel But it sounds like your own ideas have benefited a lot from the sci-fi that you read. Gwern Yeah, but it’s extremely little sci-fi. Easily 99% of the sci-fi I read was completely useless to me. I could have easily cut it down to 20 novels or short stories which actually were good enough and insightful enough to actually change my view. One volume of Blindsight by Peter Watts is worth all hundred Xanth novels, or all 500 Expanded Universe novels of Star Wars. Dwarkesh Patel The ones that you did find insightful, the top 20 or so, what did they have in common? Gwern I would say that the characteristic they have is taking non-human intelligence seriously. It doesn't have to be artificial intelligence necessarily. It’s taking the idea of non-human intelligence seriously and not imagining your classic sci-fi scenario of humans going out into the galaxy with rayguns—the sort of thing where you have rockets and rayguns but you don't have cell phones. People complain that the Singularity is a sort of boring, overused sci-fi trope. But if you went out and actually grabbed random books of science fiction, you would find that less than 1% contain anything remotely like that, or have any kind of relevance to the current context that we actually face with AI. (01:01:32) - Gwern’s intelligence and process Dwarkesh Patel Do people tend to underestimate or overestimate your intelligence? Gwern I would say they overestimate it. They mistake for intelligence the fact that I remember many things, that I have written many things over many years. They imagine that if they sat me down, I could do it all spontaneously at the moment that they’re talking to me. But with many things I have thought about, I have the advantage of having looked at things before. So I’m cheating. When I talk to people, I may just be quoting something I've already written, or at least thought about. So I come off as a lot smarter than I actually am. I would say I'm not really all that smart, compared to many people I've known, who update very fast on the fly. But in the end, it's the output that matters, right? Dwarkesh Patel I guess there is an on-the-fly intelligence. But there's another kind too which is this ability to synthesize things over a long period of time, and then come up with grand theories as a result of these different things that you’re seeing. I don’t think that’s just crystallized intelligence, right? Gwern It's not just crystallized intelligence, but if you could see all the individual steps in my process, you'd be a lot less impressed. If you could see all of the times I just note down something like, “Hmm, that's funny.” Or, \"Huh, another example of that,\" and if you just saw each particular step, you would say that what I was doing was reasonable and not some huge sign of brilliance. It would make sense to you in that moment. It's only when that happens over a decade, and you don't see the individual stuff, that my output at the end looks like magic. One of my favorite quotes about this process is from the magicians Penn & Teller. Teller says “magic is putting in more effort than any reasonable person would expect you to.” He tells a story about how they make cockroaches appear from a top hat. The trick is that they researched and found special cockroaches, and then found special styrofoam to trap the cockroaches, and arranged all that, for just a single trick. No reasonable person would do that, but they did because they wanted the trick to really pay off. The result is cockroaches somehow appearing from an empty hat. If you could see each step, it would make sense on its own, it would just look effortful. But when you see only the final trick, then that whole process and its output becomes magic. Dwarkesh Patel That’s one of the interesting things about your process. There are a couple of writers like Matt Levine or Byrne Hobart who write an article every day. I think of them almost like autoregressive models. For you, on some of the blog posts you can see the start date and end date that you list on your website of when you’ve been working on a piece. Sometimes it’s like 2009 to 2024. I feel like that’s much more like diffusion. You just keep iterating on the same image again and again. One of my favorite blog posts of yours is “Evolution as Backstop for RL,” where you talk about evolution as basically a mechanism to learn a better learning process. And that explains why corporations don’t improve over time but biological organisms do. I’m curious if you can walk me through the years that it took to write that. What was that process like, step by step? Gwern So the “Backstop” essay that you're referring to is the synthesis of seeing the same pattern show up again and again: a stupid, inefficient way of learning, which you use to learn something smarter, but where you still can’t get rid of the original one entirely. Sometimes examples would just connect to each other when I was thinking about this. Other times —when I started watching for this pattern—I would say, \"Oh yes, ‘pain’ is a good example of this. Maybe this explains why we have pain in the very specific way that we have, when you can logically imagine other kinds of pain, and those other pains would be smarter, but nothing keeps them honest.” So you just chain them one by one, these individual examples of the pattern, and just keep clarifying the central idea as you go. Wittgenstein says that you can look at an idea from many directions and then go in spirals around it. In an essay like “Backstop,” it’s me spiraling around this idea of having many layers of “learning” all the way down. Dwarkesh Patel Once you notice one example of this pattern, like this pain example, do you just keep adding examples to that? Walk me through the process over time. Gwern For that specific essay, the first versions were about corporations not evolving. Then, as I read more and more of the meta reinforcement learning literature, from DeepMind especially, I added in material about neural networks. I kept reading and thinking about the philosophy of mind papers that I had read. I eventually nailed down the idea that pain might be another instance of this: “Pain makes us learn. We can’t get rid of it, because we need it to keep us honest.” At that point you have more or less the structure of the current essay. Dwarkesh Patel Are there examples where it’s not a matter of accumulating different instances of what you later realize is one bigger pattern? Rather, you just have to have the full thesis at once. Gwern For those essays where there is an individual eureka moment, there's usually a bunch of disparate things that I have been making notes on that I don't even realize are connected. They just bother me for a long time. They sit there bothering me. I keep looking for explanations for each one and not finding them. It keeps bothering me and bothering me. One day, I hit something that suddenly makes me go, “Bam, eureka. These are all connected!” Then I just have to sit down and write a single gigantic essay that pours out about it and then it's done. That particular essay will be done at that point—right in one go. I might add in many links to it or references later on, but it will not fundamentally change. Dwarkesh Patel What's an example of an essay that had this process? Gwern Someone asked about how I came up with one yesterday, as a matter of fact. It’s one of my oldest essays, “The Melancholy of Subculture Society.” For that one, I had been reading miscellaneous things like David Foster Wallace on tennis, people on Internet media like video games. One day it just hit me: it's incredibly sad that we have all these subcultures and tribes online that can find community together, but they are still incredibly isolated from the larger society. One day, a flash just hit me about how beautiful and yet also sad this is. I sat down and wrote down the entire thing more or less. I've not really changed it all that much. I've added more links and quotes and examples over time, but nothing important. The essence was just a flash and I wrote it down while it was there. Dwarkesh Patel One of the interesting quotes you have in the essay is from David Foster Wallace when he’s talkinag about the tennis player Michael Joyce. He’s talking about the sacrifices Michael Joyce has had to make in order to be top ten in the world at tennis. He’s functionally illiterate because he’s been playing tennis every single day since he was seven or something, and not really having any life outside of tennis. What are the Michael Joyce-type sacrifices that you have had to make to be Gwern? Gwern That's a hard hitting question, Dwarkesh! “How have I amputated my life in order to write?”... I think I've amputated my life in many respects professionally and personally, especially in terms of travel. There are many people I envy for their ability to travel and socialize, or for their power and their positions in places like Anthropic where they are the insiders. I have sacrificed whatever career I could have had, or whatever fun lifestyle: a digital nomad lifestyle and going outdoors, being a Buddhist monk, or maybe a fancy trader. All those have had to be sacrificed for the patient work of sitting down every day and reading papers until my eyes bleed, and hoping that something good comes out of it someday. Dwarkesh Patel Why does it feel like there's a trade off between the two? There are obviously many writers who travel a lot like Tyler Cowen. There are writers who have a lot of influence such as Jack Clark at Anthropic. Why does it feel like you can’t do both at the same time? Gwern I can't be or be compared to Tyler Cowen. Tyler Cowen is a one-man industry. Dwarkesh Patel So is Gwern. Gwern Yeah, but he cannot be replicated. I just cannot be Tyler Cowen. Jack Clark, he is also his own thing. He's able to write the stories in his issues very well while also being a policy person. I respect them and admire them. But none of those quite hit my particular interest and niche at following weird topics for a long period of time, and then collating and sorting through information. That requires a large commitment to reading vast masses of things in the hopes that some tiny detail perhaps will turn out to one day be important. (01:11:03) - A day in the life of Gwern Dwarkesh Patel So walk me through this process. You talked about reading papers until your eyes bleed at the end of the day. You wake up in the morning and you go straight to the papers? What does your day look like? Gwern The workflow right now is more like: I wake up, I do normal morning things, and then I clean up the previous day's work on the website. I deal with various issues, like formatting or spelling errors. I review it and think if I properly collated everything and put it in the right places. Sometimes I might have an extra thought that I need to add in or make a comment that I realize was important. That's the first step. After that, I often will shamelessly go to Twitter or my RSS feed and just read a large amount until perhaps I get distracted by a comment or a question from someone and maybe do some writing on that. After that, I take a break for lunch or whatever, and then go back to that and just keep going at it. Somewhere around evening, I will often get exhausted from all that, and try to do a real project or contribution to something. I’ll actually sit down and work on whatever I'm supposed to be working on that day. After that, I would typically go to the gym. By that point, I really am burned out from everything. Yes, I like going to the gym—not because I'm any kind of meathead or athlete or even really enjoy weightlifting—but because it's the most diametrically opposite thing I can do to sitting in front of a computer. Dwarkesh Patel This is your theory of burnout, right? That you have to do the exact opposite? Gwern Yes, when people experience burnout, you just feel a lack of reward for what you're doing or what you’re working on. You just need to do something different. Something as different as possible. Maybe you could do better than weightlifting, but it does feel very different from anything I do in front of a computer. Dwarkesh Patel I want to go back to your process. Everyday, you’re loading up all this context. You’re reading all the RSS feeds and all these papers. Are you basically making contributions to all your essays, adding a little bit here and there every single day? Or are you building up some potential which will manifest itself later on as a full essay, a fully formed thesis? Gwern I would say it’s the latter one. All the minor low-level additions and pruning and fixing I do is really not that important. It's more just a way to make nicer essays. It’s a purely aesthetic goal, to make as nice an essay as I possibly can. I'm really waiting to see what happens next. What will be the next thing I'll be provoked to write about? It's just passing the time in between sudden eruptions. I feel that for many writers, you can't neglect the gardening process. You don't harvest every day. You have to tend the garden for a long time in between harvests. If you start to neglect the gardening because you're gallivanting around the world… Let's say you're going to book signing events and doing all the publicity stuff. Then you're not doing the work of being in there and tending your garden. That's undermining your future harvest, even if you can't see it right now. If you ask what is Tyler Cowen's secret to being Tyler Cowen, my guess would be that he's just really good at tending his garden, even as he travels a crazy amount. That would be his secret, that he's able to read books on a plane. I can't read books on a plane. He's able to write everything in the airport. I can do a little bit of writing in the airport but not very much. He's just very robust to the wear and tear of traveling. I'll be collapsing in the hotel room after talking to people for eight hours. He's able to talk to people for eight hours and then go do podcasts and talk to someone for another four hours! That's extremely admirable, but I just can't do that. Dwarkesh Patel How often do you get bored? It sounds like you’re spending your whole day reading different things. Are they all just inherently interesting to you? Or do you just trudge through it even when it’s not compelling to you in the moment? Gwern I don't think I get bored too easily because I switch between so many different topics. Even if I'm kind of sick of deep learning papers, well, I have tons of other things I can read or argue with people about. So I don't really get bored. I just get exhausted. I have to go off and do something else, like lift weights. Dwarkesh Patel What is your most unusual but successful work habit? Gwern I think I get a lot more mileage out of arguing with people online than… pretty much any other writer does. [Patel laughs] Hey, I'm trying to give a genuine answer here, not some stupid thing about note-taking—a real answer! I get a lot more out of arguing with people than most people do. You need motivation to write and actually sit down, and crystallize something and do the harvest. After you tend your garden, you do have to do the harvest, and the harvest can be hard work. It's very tedious. There are many people I talk to who have many great ideas. But they don't want to harvest because it's tedious and boring. And it's very hot out there in the fields, reaping. You're getting dusty and sweaty. Why wouldn't you just be inside having lemonade? But motivation from arguing and being angry at people online is in plentiful supply. So I get a lot of mileage out of people being wrong on the Internet. Dwarkesh Patel What are the pitfalls of an isolated working process? Gwern There’s the obvious one: you could be arbitrarily wrong when writing by yourself and just become a crazy loony by having a ‘big take’. Aside from that, you also have the issue of the emotional toll of not having colleagues that you can convince. You often just have the experience of shouting onto the internet that continues to be wrong despite your shouting. One thing I observe is that very often independent writers are overcome by resentment and anger and disappointment. They sort of spiral out into bitterness and crankdom from there. That's kind of what kills them. They could have continued if they’d only been able to let go of the ideas and arguments and move on to the next topic. So I say that ‘spite can be a great motivation to write, but you have to use it skillfully and let it go afterwards’. You can only have it while you need motivation to write. If you keep going and hold on to it, you're poisoning yourself. (01:17:50) - Gwern’s finances Dwarkesh Patel I'm sure you're aware that many people comment on the fact that ‘if Gwern put the effort he spends optimizing the CSS on his website towards more projects and more writing, the benefits to society could be measured in the nearest million dollars’. What's your reaction to people who say you're spending too much time on site design? Gwern I have no defense at all there in terms of objective benefits to society. I do it because I'm selfish and I like it. That is my defense. I like the aesthetics of my website and it is a hobby. Dwarkesh Patel Does the design help you think? Gwern It does because I like rereading my stuff more when I can appreciate the aesthetics of it and the beauty of the website. It’s easier for me to tolerate reading something for the hundredth time when I would otherwise be sick to death of it. Site maintenance for the author is inherently this kind of spaced repetition. If I go over pages to check that some new formatting feature worked, I am getting spaced repetition there. More than once, I’ve gone to check some stupid CSS issue and looked at something and thought, “Oh, I should change something,” or, “Oh, that means something.” So in a way, it's not as much of a waste as it looks, but I can't defend it entirely. If someone wants to make their own website, they should not invest that much for the aesthetic value. I just want a really nice website. There's so many bad websites out there that it depresses me. There's at least one website I love. Dwarkesh Patel By the way, I’m going to mention this since you never mentioned it yourself. But I think the main way you fund your research is through your Patreon, right? You never advertise it but I feel—with the kind of thing you’re doing—if it were financially viable and got adequate funding, not only would you be able to keep doing it but other people who wanted to be independent researchers could see it’s a thing you can do. It’s a viable thing you can do. More Gwerns would exist. Gwern Well, I don't necessarily want more Gwerns to exist. I just want more writers and more activeness and more agency in general. I would be perfectly happy if someone simply wrote more Reddit comments and never took a dollar for their writings and just wrote better Reddit comments. I'd be perfectly happy if someone had a blog and they kept writing, but they just put a little more thought into the design. I'd be perfectly happy if no one ever wrote something, but they hosted PDFs so that links didn't rot. In general, you don't have to be a writer delivering longform essays. That's just one of many ways to write. It happened to be the one that I personally kind of prefer. But it'd be totally valid to be a Twitter thread writer. Dwarkesh Patel How do you sustain yourself while writing full time? Gwern Patreon and savings. I have a Patreon which does around $900-$1000/month, and then I cover the rest with my savings. I got lucky with having some early Bitcoins and made enough to write for a long time, but not forever. So I try to spend as little as possible to make it last. I should probably advertise the Patreon more, but I'm too proud to shill it harder. It's also awkward trying to come up with some good rewards which don't entail a paywall. Patreon and Substack work well for a lot of people like Scott Alexander, because they like writing regular newsletter-style updates but I don't like to. I just let it run and hope it works. Dwarkesh Patel Wait if you’re doing $900-1000/month and you’re sustaining yourself on that, that must mean you’re sustaining yourself on less than $12,000 a year. What is your lifestyle like at $12K? Gwern I live in the middle of nowhere. I don't travel much, or eat out, or have health insurance, or anything like that. I cook my own food. I use a free gym. There was this time when the floor of my bedroom began collapsing. It was so old that the humidity had decayed the wood. We just got a bunch of scrap wood and a joist and propped it up. If it lets in some bugs, oh well! I live like a grad student, but with better ramen. I don't mind it much since I spend all my time reading anyway. Dwarkesh Patel It's still surprising to me that you can make rent, take care of your cat, deal with any emergencies, all of that on $12K a year. Gwern I'm lucky enough to be in excellent health and to have had no real emergencies to date. This can't last forever, and so it won't. I'm definitely not trying to claim that this is any kind of ideal lifestyle, or that anyone else could or should try to replicate my approach! I got lucky with Bitcoin and with being satisfied with living like a monk and with my health. Anyone who would like to take up a career as a writer or blogger should understand that this is not an example they can imitate. I’m not trying to be a role model. Every writer will have to figure it out a different way. Maybe it can be something like a Substack, or just writing on the side while slinging Javascript for a tech company. I don’t know. Dwarkesh Patel It seems like you’ve enjoyed this recent trip to San Francisco? What would it take to get you to move here? Gwern Yeah, it is mostly just money stopping me at this point. I probably should bite the bullet and move anyway. But I'm a miser at heart and I hate thinking of how many months of writing runway I'd have to give up for each month in San Francisco. If someone wanted to give me, I don’t know, $50–100K/year to move to SF and continue writing full-time like I do now, I'd take it in a heartbeat. Until then, I'm still trying to psych myself up into a move. Dwarkesh Patel That sounds very doable. If somebody did want to contribute to making this move, and your research more generally, possible, how would they get in touch with you? Gwern I have a Stripe donation page, or they could just email me at gwern@gwern.net. (01:25:05) - The diversity of AI minds Dwarkesh Patel By when will AI models be more diverse than the human population? Gwern I'm going to say that if you exclude capability from that, AI models are already much more diverse cognitively than humans are. Different LLMs think in very distinct ways that you can tell right away from a sample of them. An LLM operates nothing like a GAN. A GAN also is totally different from VAEs. They have totally different latent spaces, especially in the lower end, where they’re small or bad models. They have wildly different artifacts and errors in a way that we would not see with humans. Humans are really very quite similar in writing and attitude compared to these absurd outputs of different kinds of models. Dwarkesh Patel Really? If you look at Chatbot Arena and you see side-by-side comparisons of the outputs of different models, it's often very hard to tell which ones comes from which model. Gwern Yeah but this is all very heavily tuned. Now you're restricting it to relatively recent LLMs, with everyone riding each other's coattails and often training on the same exact data. This is a situation much closer to if they were identical twins. If I don't restrict myself to just LLMs and I compare the wide diversity of say image generation models, they often have totally different ways. Some of them seem as similar to each other as ants do to beavers. Within LLMs, I would agree that there has been a massive loss of diversity. Things used to be way more diverse among LLMs. But across deep learning in general, we’ve seen a whole range of minds and ways to think that you won't find in any philosophy of mind paper. Dwarkesh Patel What's an example of two models that have these sorts of cognitive differences? Gwern I’ll give one example I was telling someone the other day. GAN models have incentives to hide things because it's an adversarial loss, whereas diffusion models have no such thing. So GAN models are ‘scared’. They put ‘hands’ off the screen. They just can't think about hands. Whereas diffusion models think about hands, but in their gigantic, monstrous, Cthulhu-esque abortions. (01:27:24) - GLP drugs and obesity Dwarkesh Patel People weren't paying attention to scaling in 2020. Is there some trend today where people aren’t really comprehending the full implications of where this is headed? Gwern I'm excited by the weight-loss drugs, the GLP drugs. Their effects in general on health and addiction across all sorts of behaviors really surprised me. No one predicted that as far as I know. While the results are still very preliminary, it does seem like it's real. I think that’s going to tell us something important about human willpower and dysfunctionality. What's going wrong broadly in the modern environment? Dwarkesh Patel Do GLP drugs break the Algernon argument—the one you listed in your blog post—that if there are any simple and useful interventions without bad side effects, then evolution should have already found them? Gwern It's too soon to say because we haven't actually figured out what's going on with the GLPs to even understand what they are doing at all, what has the off target. It's kind of crazy that activating and deactivating both work. It's a completely crazy situation. I don't really know what to think about the Algernon argument there. It could be that the benefits actually decrease fitness in the fertility sense because you're going out and having a happy life instead of having kids. No offense to parents. Or it could just be that it's hitting the body in a way that's really, really hard to replicate in any kind of genetic way. Or it could be that it's just too soon. When I think back, I see that the obesity crisis only became obvious around the 1990s. It's quite recent. I look back at photos and today is completely unrecognizable from 1990. You look at photos and people are still thin. You look at photos now and everyone is like a blimp. So you can't possibly have any kind of Algernon argument over 20 or 30 years. Dwarkesh Patel When you look back at the Romans and you see how lead was constantly poisoning the entire city, what credence do you give to the possibility that something in our environment is having an effect on us on a similar magnitude of what lead was doing to the ancient Romans? Gwern I think the odds of there being something as bad as lead is almost 100%. We have so many things out there. Chemists are always cooking up new stuff. There are all sorts of things with microbiomes. Plastics are trendy, but maybe it's not plastics. Maybe it’s something else entirely. But there's almost no way that everything we have put out there is totally benign and safe and has no harmful effects at any concentration—that seems like a really strong claim to be making. I don't believe in any particular one, but I do believe in like, “1% here, 1% here, 1% here.” There's something out there. There's something out there where we're going to look back at and say, “Oh, wow, those people were really poisoning themselves just like with leaded gasoline. If only they had known x, y, and z. It’s so obvious now!” Dwarkesh Patel Do you think this would manifest itself most likely in cognitive impairments or obesity or something else? Gwern A priori, I would possibly expect intelligence to be the most fragile thing and most harmed by it. But when we look at the time series there, intelligence is pretty stable overall. So I have to say that whatever the harmful thing is, it’s probably not going to be on intelligence. Whereas obesity is a much better candidate because you do see obesity go crazy over the last 30 years. (01:31:08) - Drug experimentation Dwarkesh Patel I was surprised to hear you say yesterday that you are skeptical of Bay Area-type experimentation with psychedelics. I sort of associate you very much with experimentation with different substances and seeing if they are helpful to you. I’m curious why you draw Chesterton's fence here when it comes to psychedelics. Gwern The cleanest way to divide that would just be to point out that the effects of psychedelics can be acute and permanent. The things I was looking at are much more controlled in the sense that they are relatively manageable in effect. None of them affect your judgment permanently about whether to take more nootropics. Whereas something like LSD permanently changes how you see things such as taking LSD, or permanently changes your psychiatric state. There's a cumulative effect with psychedelics that you don't see much with nootropics, which makes nootropics inherently a heck of a lot safer and much more easy to quantify the effects of. With nootropics, you don't see people spinning off into the crazy outcomes psychedelics have. They get crazier and crazier each time they take another dose, which makes them crazy enough to want to take another dose. Psychedelics have what you might call a “self-recommending problem” where they always make you want to take more of them. It’s similar to meditation. What is the most visible sign of having done a lot of meditation? It's that you seem compelled to tell people that they ought to meditate. This kind of spiral leads to bad outcomes for psychedelics that you just don't see with nootropics. The standard failure case for nootropics is that you spent a few hundred or $1,000 and then you got no real benefit out of it. You went on with your life. You did some weird drugs for a while and that was all. That's not so bad. It's a weird way to get your entertainment... But in principle, it's not really all that worse than going to the movie theater for a while and spending $1,000 on movie theater tickets. With psychedelics, you're changing yourself permanently, irrevocably in a way you don't understand and exposing yourself to all sorts of malicious outside influences: whatever happens to occur to you while you're very impressionable. Okay, yeah, a few uses can be good. I have gotten good out of my few uses. But if you are doing it more than that, you should really have a hard look in the mirror about what benefit you think you are getting and how you are changing. (01:33:40) - Parasocial relationships Dwarkesh Patel People don’t know your voice. People don’t know your face. As a result, they have this interesting parasocial relationship with you. I wonder if you have a theory of what kind of role you fill in people’s life. Gwern What role do I actually fill, or what role would I want to fill? Dwarkesh Patel Let's do both. Gwern The role I want to fill is actually sort of like how LLMs see me, oddly enough. If you play around with LLMs like Claude-3, a character named “Gwern” sometimes will show up. He plays the role of a mentor or old wizard, offering insight into the situation, and exhorting them with a call to adventure. “You too can write stuff and do stuff and think stuff!” I would like people to go away having not just been entertained or gotten some useful information, but be better people, in however slight a sense. To have an aspiration that web pages could be better, that the Internet could be better: “You too could go out and read stuff! You too could have your thoughts and compile your thoughts into essays, too! You could do all this!” But I fear that the way it actually works for quite a few people is that I wind up as either a guru or trickster devil. Depending on whether you like me or hate me, either I am the god of statistics & referencing who can do no wrong—”Just take everything on the site as gospel!”, which I really dislike—or I'm just some sort of horrible, covert, malicious, neo-Nazi, eugenicist, totalitarian, communist, anti-Chinese devil figure lurking in the background trying to bring down Western society. (01:35:23) - Open rabbit holes Dwarkesh Patel Final question, what are the open rabbit holes you have—things you’re curious about but don't have an answer to—that you hope to have an answer to by 2050? Gwern By 2050, I really hope we can finally answer some of the big questions about ourselves that have just reliably resisted definitive answers. A lot of them might not matter any more, but I'd still like to know. Why do we sleep or dream? Why do humans age? Why does sexual reproduction exist? Why do humans differ so much, from each other and day to day? Why did humans take so long to develop technological civilization? Where are all the aliens? Why didn't China have the Industrial Revolution instead? How should we have predicted the deep learning revolution? Why are our brains so oversized compared to artificial neural networks? Those are some of the questions that I really hope we’ve answered by 2050. Dwarkesh Patel Alright Gwern, this has been excellent.

If you aren't writing, you are abdicating the future or your role in it. If you think it's enough to just be a good citizen, to vote for your favorite politician, to pick up litter and recycle, the future doesn't care about you. These AI predictions never, ever seem to factor in how actual humans will determine what AI-generated media is successful in replacing human-ones, or if it will even be successful at all. It is all very theoretical and to me, shows a fundamental flaw in this style of \"sit in a room reading papers/books and make supposedly rational conclusions about the future of the world.\" A good example is: today, right now, it is a negative thing for your project to be known as AI-generated. The window of time when it was trendy and cool has largely passed. Having an obviously AI-generated header image on your blog post was cool two years ago, but now it is passé and marks you as behind the trends. And so for the prediction that everything get swept up by an ultra-intelligent AI that subsequently replaces human-made creations, essays, writings, videos, etc., I am doubtful. Just because it will have the ability to do so doesn't mean that it will be done, or that anyone is going to care. It seems vastly more likely to me that we'll end up with a solid way of verifying humanity – and thus an economy of attention still focused on real people – and a graveyard of AI-generated junk that no one interacts with at all. reply motohagiography 2 hours agoparentI've been writing for decades with the belief I was training a future AI and used to say that the Turing test wasn't mysterious at all because it was a solved problem in economics in the form of an indifference curve that showed where peoeple cared whether or not they were dealing with a person or a machine. the argument against AI taking over is we organize around symbols and narratives and are hypersensitive to waning or inferior memes, thereofre AI would need to reinvent itself as \"not-AI\" every time so we don't learn to categorize it as slop. I might agree, but if there were an analogy in music, some limited variations are dominant for decades, and there are precedents where you can generate dominant memes from slop that entrains millions of minds for entire lifetimes. Pop stars are slop from an industry machine that is indistinguishable from AI, and as evidence, current AI can simulate their entire catalogs of meaning. the TV Tropes website even identifies all the elements of cultural slop people should be immune to, but there are still millions of people walking around living out characters and narratives they received from pop-slop. there will absolutely be a long tail of people whose ontology is shaped by AI slop, just like there is a long tail of people whose ontology is shaped by music, tv, and movies today. that's as close to being swept up in an AI simulation as anything, and perhaps a lot more subtle. or maybe we'll just shake it off. reply keiferski 1 hour agorootparentThat is a good point, and fundamentally I agree that these big budget pop star machines do function in a way analogous to an AI, and that we're arguing metaphysics here. But even if a future AI becomes like this, that doesn't prevent independent writers (like gwern) from still having a unique, non-assimilated voice where they write original content. The arguments tend to be \"AI will eat everything, therefore get your writing out there now\" and not \"this will be a big thing, but not everything.\" reply mapt 5 hours agoparentprevWith AI you need to think, long and hard, about the concept (borrowed from cryptography), \"Today, the state of the art in is the worst it will ever be\". Humanity is pinning its future on the thought that we will hit intractable information-theoretic limitations which provide some sort of diminishing returns on performance before a hard takeoff, but the idea that the currently demonstrated methods are high up on some sigmoid curve does not seem at this point credible. AI models are dramatically higher performance this year than last year, and were dramatically better last year than the year before, and will probably continue to get better for the next few years. That's sufficient to dramatically change a lot of social & economic processes, for better and for worse. reply cle 5 hours agorootparentThere's a good chance you're right, but I think there's also a chance that things could get worse at some point (with some hand-wavy definition of \"a while\"). Currently the state-of-the-art is propped up with speculative investments, if those speculations turn out to be wrong enough, or social/economic changes force the capital to get allocated somewhere else, then there could be a significant period of time where access to it goes away for most of us. We can already see small examples of this from the major model providers. They launch a mind-blowing model, get great benchmarks and press, and then either throttle access or diminish quality to control costs / resources (like Claude Sonnet 3.5 pretty quickly shifted to short, terse responses). Access to SOTA is very resource-constrained and there are a lot of scenarios I can imagine where that could get worse, not better. Even \"Today, the state of the art in is the worst it will ever be\" in cryptography isn't always true, like post-spectre/meltdown. You could argue that security improved but perf definitely did not. reply keiferski 3 hours agorootparentprevI don’t disagree that it’ll change a lot of things in society. But that isn’t the claim being made, which is that some sort of AI god is being constructed which will develop entirely without the influence of how real human beings actually act. This to me is basically just sci-fi, and it’s frankly kind of embarrassing that it’s taken so seriously. reply MichaelZuo 6 hours agoparentprevO1-preview is already indistinguishable from the 50th percentile HN commentator with the right prompts… no editing at all needed of the output. reply notahacker 6 hours agoparentprevI think the wider question mark about that sentence is that even if LLMs that ingest the internet and turn it into different words are the future of humanity, there's an awful lot of stuff in an AI corpus and a comparatively small number intensively researched blogs probably aren't going to shift the needle very much I mean, you'd probably get more of a vote using generative AI to spam stuff that aligns with your opinions or moving to Kenya to do low wage RHLF stuff... reply Quinzel 8 hours agoprevI don’t believe Gwern lives as frugally as he’s described in this (if this even actually is the real Gwern). I’m 100% sure that he has a persona he likes to portray and being perceived as frugal is a part of that persona. When it comes to answering the question “who is gwern?” I reckon Gwern’s a plant a seed in people’s mind type of guy, and let them come up with the rest of the story. Still, I like a lot of his writing. Especially the weird and niche stuff that most people don’t even stop to think about. And thanks to Gwern’s essay on the sunk costs fallacy, I ended up not getting a tattoo that I had changed my mind about. I almost got it because I had paid a deposit, but I genuinely decided I hated the idea of what I was going to get… and almost got it, but the week before I went to get the tattoo, I read that essay, and decided if small children and animals don’t fall victim to sunk costs, then neither should I! Literally - Gwern saved the skin on my back with his writing. Haha. reply endtime 2 hours agoparentI met Gwern once, when he came to the NYC Less Wrong meetup. I don't think he was internet-famous yet. It was probably 12 years ago or so, but based on my recollection, I'm totally willing to believe that he lives very frugally. FWIW he wouldn't have looked out of place at an anime convention. reply Quinzel 12 minutes agorootparentWhat did he look like? reply nuz 12 minutes agoparentprevI believe him. reply Quinzel 2 minutes agorootparentYou believe that someone who has the capacity and resources to do all this fancy computer and AI stuff lives on $12k USD a year?

But I do know he created an enormous dataset of anime images used to train machine learning and generative AI models [1]. Hosting large datasets is moderately expensive - and it's full of NSFW stuff, so he's probably not having his employer or his college host it. Easy for someone on a six-figure salary, difficult for a person on $12k/year. Also, I thought these lesswrong folks were all about \"effective altruism\" and \"earning to give\" and that stuff. [1] https://gwern.net/danbooru2021 reply esdf 2 hours agorootparentHosting large datasets can be expensive but the hosting for the danbooru datasets was not. It's \"only\" a few terabytes in size.

Stuff is being invented now. We're making progress. How is that possible?” And then coming up with the answer, “Well, progress is possible now because civilization gets destroyed every couple of thousand years, and all we're doing is we're rediscovering the old stuff.” The link in this paragraph goes to a post on gwern website. This post contains various links, both internal and external. But I still failed to find one that supports claims about Newton's views on \"progress\". > This offers a little twist on the “Singularity” idea: apparently people have always been able to see progress as rapid in the right time periods, and they are not wrong to! We would not be too impressed at several centuries with merely some shipbuilding improvements or a long philosophy poem written in Latin, and we are only modestly impressed by needles or printing presses. We absolutely _are_ impressed. The concept of \"rapid progress\" is relative. There was rapid progress then, and there is even more rapid progress now. There is no contradiction.

Stagnation is kinda the default state of mankind. Look at places like Afghanistan. Other than imported western tech, it's basically a medieval society. Between the fall of the Roman Empire and the middle medieval era, technology didn't progress all that much. Many parts of the world were essentially still peasant societies at the start of the 20th century. All you really need is a government or society that isn't conducive to technological development, either because they persecute it or because they just don't do anything to protect and encourage it (e.g. no patent system or enforceable trade secrets). Even today, what we see is that technological progress isn't evenly distributed. Most of it comes out of the USA at the moment, a bit from Europe and China. In the past there's usually been one or two places that were clearly ahead and driving things forward, and it moves around over time. The other thing that inspires the idea of a permanent medieval society is archaeological narratives about ancient Egypt. If you believe their chronologies (which you may not), then Egyptian society was frozen in time for thousands of years with little or no change in any respect. Not linguistic, not religious, not technological. This is unthinkable today but is what academics would have us believe really happened not so long ago. reply fallingsquirrel 4 hours agorootparentprevThey're probably doing the same thing humans on our earth were doing for centuries until ~1600.

What’s wrong with Bitcoin is that it’s ugly. … It’s ugly to make your network’s security depend solely on having more brute-force computing power than your opponents, ugly to need now and in perpetuity at least half the processing power just to avoid double-spending … It’s ugly to have a hash tree that just keeps growing … It’s ugly to have a system which can’t be used offline without proxies and workarounds … It’s ugly to have a system that has to track all transactions, publicly … And even if the money supply has to be fixed (a bizarre choice and more questionable than the irreversibility of transactions), what’s with that arbitrary-looking 21 million bitcoin limit? Couldn’t it have been a rounder number or at least a power of 2? (Not that the bitcoin mining is much better, as it’s a massive give-away to early adopters. Coase’s theorem may claim it doesn’t matter how bitcoins are allocated in the long run, but such a blatant bribe to early adopters rubs against the grain. Again, ugly and inelegant.)

For me that's just a great example of how basically the vast majority of AI influencers (who vie for influence on social media, rather than research) are basically clueless about AI and CS and only have second-hand knowledge, which I guess they're good at organising and popularising, but not more than that.

It's impossible to know 100% of of such a wide area as \"AI and CS\". I think, engineers, yes, especially those who don't have a background in academic CS. But scientists, no, I don't think so. I don't think it's possible to be a computer scientist without knowing the difference between a regular and a super-regular language. As to knowing that a^nb^n specifically is context-free, as I suggest in the sibling comment, computer scientists who are also AI specialists would recognise a^nb^n immediately, as they would Dyck languages and Reber grammars, because those are standard tests of learnability used to demonstrate various principles, from the good old days of purely symbolic AI, to the brave new world of modern deep learning. For example, I learned about Reber grammars for the first time when I was trying to understand LSTMs, when they were all the hype in Deep Learning, at the time I was doing my MSc in 2014. Online tutorials on coding LSTMs used Reber grammars as the dataset (because, as with other formal grammars it's easy to generate tons of strings from them and that's awfully convenient for big data approaches). Btw that's really the difference between a computer scientist and a computer engineer: the scientist knows the theory. That's what they do to you in CS school, they drill that stuff in your head with extreme prejudice; at least the good schools do. I see this with my partner who is 10 times a better engineer than me and yet hasn't got a clue what all this Chomsky hierarhcy stuff is.

In truth, I'm organising things in my head because I started out thinking of myself as an engineer, because I like to make stuff, and at some point I started thinking of myself as a scientist, malgré moi, because I also like to know how stuff works and why. I multiclassed, you see, so I am trying to understand exactly what changed, when, and why. I mean obviously it happened when I moved from industry to academia, but it's still the case there's a lot of overlap between the two areas, at least in CS and AI. In CS and AI the best engineers make the best scientists and vv. I think. Btw, \"gatekeeping\" I think assumes that I somehow think of one category less than the other? Is that right?

Well, maybe it does. I don't know if that can be avoided. I think most people don't take criticism well. I've learned for example that there are some conversations I can't have with certain members of my extended family because they're not used to being challenged about things they don't know and they react angrily. I'm specifically remember a conversation where I was trying to explain the concept of latent hypoxia and ascent blackout [1] (I free dive recreationally) to an older family member who is an experienced scuba diver, and they not only didn't believe me, they called me an ignoramus. Because I told them something they didn't know about. Eh well. _____________ [1] It can happen that while you're diving deep, the pressure of the water keeps the pressure of oxygen in your blood sufficient that you don't pass out, but then when you start coming up, the pressure drops and the oxygen in your blood thins out so much that you pass out. In my lay terms. My relative didn't believe that the water pressure affects the pressure of the air in your vessels. I absolutely can feel that when I'm diving- the deeper I go the easier it gets to hold my breath and it's so noticeable because it's so counter-intuitive. My relative wouldn't have experienced that during scuba diving (since they breathe pressurised air, I think) and maybe it helps he's a smoker. Anyway I never managed to convince him. As I never managed to convince him that we eat urchins' genitals, not their eggs. After a certain point I stopped trying to convince him of anything. I mean I felt like a know-it-all anyway, even if I knew what I was talking about. reply Vecr 1 hour agorootparentI actually either didn't know about that pressure thing [0], or I forgot. I suspect I read about it at some point because at some level I knew ascending could have bad effects even if you don't need decompression stops.

[0]: though I've seen videos of the exact same effect on a plastic water bottle, but my brain didn't make the connection reply YeGoblynQueenne 2 hours agorootparentprevCan I say a bit more about criticism on the side? I've learned to embrace it as a necessary step to self-improvement. My formative experience as a PhD student was when a senior colleague attacked my work. That was after I asked for his feedback for a paper I was writing where I showed that my system beat his system. He didn't deal with it well, sent me a furiously critical response (with obvious misunderstandings of my work) and then proceeded to tell my PhD advisor and everyone else in a conference we were attending that my work is premature and shouldn't be submitted. My advisor, trusting his ex-student (him) more than his brand new one (me), agreed and suggested I should sit on the paper a bit longer. Later on the same colleague attacked my system again, but this time he gave me a concrete reason why: he gave me an example of a task that my system could not complete (learn a recursive logic program to return the last element in a list from a single example that is not an example of the base-case of the recursion; it's a lot harder than it may sound). Now, I had been able to dismiss the earlier criticism as sour grapes, but this one I couldn't get over because my system really couldn't deal with it. So I tried to figure out why- where was the error I was making in my theories? Because my theoretical results said that my system should be able to learn that. Long story short, I did figure it out and I got that example to work, plus a bunch of other hard tests that people had thrown at me in the meanwhile. So I improved. I still think my colleague's behaviour was immature and not becoming of a senior academic- attacking a PhD student because she did what you 've always done, beat your own system, is childish. In my current post-doc I just published a paper with one of our PhD students where we report his system trouncing mine (in speed; still some meat on those old bones otherwise). I think criticism is a good thing overall, if you can learn to use it to improve your work. It doesn't mean that you'll learn to like it, or that you'll be best friends with the person criticising you, it doesn't even mean that they're not out to get you; they probably are... but if the criticism is pointing out a real weakness you have, you can still use it to your advantage no matter what. reply mitthrowaway2 1 hour agorootparentConstructive criticism is a good thing, but in this thread you aren't speaking to Gwern directly, you're badmouthing him to his peers. I'm sure you would have felt different if your colleague had done that. reply YeGoblynQueenne 1 hour agorootparentHe did and I did feel very angry about it and it hurt our professional relationship irreparably. But above I'm only discussing my experience of criticism as an aside, unrelated to Gwern. To be clear, my original comment was not meant as constructive criticism. Like I think my colleague was at the time, I am out to get Gwern because I think, like I say, that he is a clueless AI influencer, a cheer-leader of deep learning who is piggy-backing on the excitement about AI that he had nothing to do with creating. I wouldn't find it so annoying if he, like many others who engage in the same parasitism, did not sound so cock-sure that he knows what he's talking about. I do not under any circumstances claim that my original comment is meant to be nice. Btw, I remember now that Gwern has in other times accused me , here on HN, of being confidently wrong about things I don't know as well as I think I do (deep learning stuff). I think it was in a comment about Mu Zero (the DeepMind system). I don't think Gwern likes me much, either. But, then, he's a famous influencer and I'm not and I bet he finds solace in that so my criticism is not going to hurt him in the end. reply achierius 2 hours agorootparentprev\"not even wrong\" is supposed to refer to a specific category of flawed argument, but of course like many other terms it's come to really mean \"low status belief\" reply nocobot 5 hours agorootparentprevis it really? this is the most common example for context free languages and something most first year CS students will be familiar with. totally agree that you can be a great engineer and not be familiar with it, but seems weird for an expert in the field to confidently make wrong statements about this. reply YeGoblynQueenne 4 hours agorootparentThanks, that's what I meant. a^nb^n is a standard test of learnability. That stuff is still absolutely relevant, btw. Some DL people like to dismiss it as irrelevant but that's just because they lack the background to appreciate why it matters. Also: the arrogance of youth (hey I've already been a postdoc for a year, I'm ancient). Here's a recent paper on Neural Networks and the Chomsky Hierarchy that tests RNNs and Transformers on formal languages (I think it doesn't test on a^nb^n directly but tests similar a-b based CF languages): https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02098 And btw that's a good paper. Probably one of the most satisfying DL papers I've read in recent years. You know when you read a paper and you get this feeling of satiation, like \"aaah, that hit the spot\"? That's the kind of paper. reply GistNoesis 3 hours agorootparenta^nb^n can definitely be expressed and recognized with a transformer. A transformer (with relative invariant positional embedding) has full context so can see the whole sequence. It just has to count and compare. To convince yourself, construct the weights manually. First layer : zeros the character which are equal to the previous character. Second layer : Build a feature to detect and extract the position embedding of the first a. a second feature to detect and extract the position embedding of the last a, a third feature to detect and extract the position embedding of the first b, a fourth feature to detect and extract the position embedding of the last b, Third layer : on top that check whether (second feature - first feature) == (fourth feature - third feature). The paper doesn't distinguish between what is the expressive capability of the model, and the finding the optimum of the model, aka the training procedure. If you train by only showing example with varying n, there probably isn't inductive bias to make it converge naturally towards the optimal solution you can construct by hand. But you can probably train multiple formal languages simultaneously, to make the counting feature emerge from the data. You can't deduce much from negative results in research beside it requiring more work. reply YeGoblynQueenne 3 hours agorootparent>> The paper doesn't distinguish between what is the expressive capability of the model, and the finding the optimum of the model, aka the training procedure. They do. That's the whole point of the paper: you can set a bunch of weights manually like you suggest, but can you learn them instead; and how? See the Introduction. They make it very clear that they are investigating whether certain concepts can be learned by gradient descent, specifically. They point out that earlier work doesn't do that and that gradient descent is an obvious bit of bias that should affect the ability of different architectures to learn different concepts. Like I say, good work. >> But you can probably train multiple formal languages simultaneously, to make the counting feature emerge from the data. You could always try it out yourself, you know.

I'm a falsificationist. The only time we learn anything useful is when stuff fails. reply GistNoesis 24 minutes agorootparentGradient descent usually get stuck in local minimum, it depends on the shape of the energy landscape, that's expected behavior. The current wisdom is that by optimizing for multiple tasks simultaneously, it makes the energy landscape smoother. One task allow to discover features which can be used to solve other tasks. Useful features that are used by many tasks can more easily emerge from the sea of useless features. If you don't have sufficiently many distinct tasks the signal doesn't get above the noise and is much harder to observe. That the whole point of \"Generalist\" intelligence in the scaling hypothesis. For problems where you can write a solution manually you can also help the training procedure by regularising your problem by adding the auxiliary task of predicting some custom feature. Alternatively you can \"Generatively Pretrain\" to obtain useful feature, replacing custom loss function by custom data. The paper is a useful characterisation of the energy landscape of various formal tasks in isolation, but doesn't investigate the more general simpler problem that occur in practice. reply aubanel 47 minutes agorootparentprevIn my country (France), I think most last-year CS students will not have heard of it (pls anyone correct me if I'm wrong). reply dilap 4 hours agoparentprevRegarding your linked comment, my takeaway is that the very theoretical task of being able to recognize an infinite language isn't very relevent to the non-formal, intuitive idea of \"intelligence\" Transformers can easily intellectually understand a^nb^n, even though they couldn't recognize whether an arbitrarily long string is a member of the language -- a restriction humans share!, since eventually a human, too, would lose track of the count, for a long enough string. reply YeGoblynQueenne 3 hours agorootparentI don't know what \"intellectually understand\" means in the context of Transformers. My older comment was about the ability of neural nets to learn automata from examples, a standard measure of the learning ability of a machine learning system. I link to a paper below where Transformers and RNNs are compared on their ability to learn automata along the entire Chomsky hierarchy and as other work has also shown, they don't do that well (although there are some surprising surprises). >> Regarding your linked comment, my takeaway is that the very theoretical task of being able to recognize an infinite language isn't very relevent to the non-formal, intuitive idea of \"intelligence\" That depends on who you ask. My view is that automata are relevant to computation and that's why we study them in computer science. If we were biologists, we would study beetles. The question is whether computation , as we understand it on the basis of computer science, has anything to do with intelligence. I think it does, but that it's not the whole shebang. There is a long debate on that in AI and the cognitive sciences and the jury is still out, despite what many of the people working on LLMs seem to believe. reply dilap 3 hours agorootparentBy intellectually understand, I just mean you can ask Claude or ChatGPT or whatever, \"how can I recognize if a string is in a^n b^n? what is the language being described?\" and it can easily tell you; if you were giving it an exam, it would pass. (Of course, maybe you could argue that's a famous example in its training set and it's just regurgitating, but then you could try making modifications, asking other questions, etc, and the LLM would continue to respond sensibly. So to me it seems to understand...) Or going back to the original Hofstadter article, \"simple tests show that [machine translation is] a long way from real understanding\"; I tried rerunning the first two of these simple tests today w/ Claude 3.5 Sonnet (new), and it absolutely nails them. So it seems to understand the text quite well. Regarding computation and understanding: I just though it was interesting that you presented a true fact about the computational limitations of NNs, which could easily/naturally/temptingingly -- yet incorrectly (I think!) -- be extended into a statement about the limitations of understanding of NNs (whatever understanding means -- no technical definition that I know of, but still, it does mean something, right?). reply YeGoblynQueenne 2 hours agorootparent>> (Of course, maybe you could argue that's a famous example in its training set and it's just regurgitating, but then you could try making modifications, asking other questions, etc, and the LLM would continue to respond sensibly.

They've seen so much stuff in training that it's very hard to know what they're simply reproducing from their corpus and what not. My opinion is that LLMs are statistical models of text and we can expect them to learn the surface statistical regularities of text in their corpus, which can be very powerful, but that's all. I don't see how they can learn \"understanding\" from text. The null hypothesis should be that they can't and, Sagan-like, we should expect to see extraordinary evidence before accepting they can. I do. >> Regarding computation and understanding: I just though it was interesting that you presented a true fact about the computational limitations of NNs, which could easily/naturally/temptingingly -- yet incorrectly (I think!) -- be extended into a statement about the limitations of understanding of NNs (whatever understanding means -- no technical definition that I know of, but still, it does mean something, right?). For humans it means something- because understanding is a property we assume humans have. Sometimes we use it metaphorically (\"my program understands when the customer wants to change their pants\") but in terms of computation... again I have no clue. I generally have very few clues :) reply Vecr 3 hours agorootparentprevHow do you do intelligence without computation though? Brains are semi-distributed analog computers with terrible interconnect speeds and latencies. Unless you think they're magic, any infinite language is still just a limit to them. Edit: and technically you're describing what is more or less backprop learning, neural networks, by themselves, don't learn at all. reply YeGoblynQueenne 3 hours agorootparentYes, I'm talking about learning neural nets with gradient descent. See also the nice paper I linked below. >> How do you do intelligence without computation though? Beats me! Unlike everyone else in this space, it seems, I haven't got a clue how to do intelligence at all, with or without computation. Edit: re infinite languages, I liked something Walid Saba (RIP) pointed out on Machine Learning Street Talk, that sure you can't generate infinite strings but if you have an infinite language every string accepted by the language has a uniform probability of one over infinity, so there's no way to learn the entire language by learning the distribution of strings within it. But e.g. the Python compiler must be able to recognise an infinite number of Python programs as valid (or reject those that aren't) because of the same reason, that it's impossible to predict which string is going to come out of a source generating strings in an infinite language. So you have to able to deal with infinite possibilities, with only finite resources. Now, I think there's a problem with that. Assuming a language L has a finite alphabet, even if L is infinite (i.e. it includes an infinite number of strings) the subset of L where strings only go up to some length n is going to be finite. If that n is large enough that it is just beyond the computational resources of any system that has to recognise strings in L (like a compiler) then any system that can recognise, or generate, all strings in L up to n length, will be, for all intents and purposes, complete with respect to L, up to n etc. In plain English, the Python compiler doesn't need to be able to deal with Python programs of infinite length, so it doesn't need to deal with an infinite number of Python programs. Same for natural language. The informal proof of the infinity of natural language I know of is based on the observation that we can embed an arbitrary number of sentences in other sentences: \"Mary, whom we met in the summer, in Fred's house, when we went there with George... \" etc. But, in practice, that ability too will be limited by time and human linguistic resources, so not even the human linguistic ability really-really needs to be able to deal with an infinite number of strings. That's assuming that natural language has a finite alphabet, or I guess lexicon is the right word. That may or may not be the case: we seem to be able to come up with new rods all the time. Anyway some of this may explain why LLMs can still convincingly reproduce the structure of natural language without having to train on infinite examples. reply Vecr 3 hours agorootparentWhat I don't know how to do is bounded rationality.

To be clear, the Chomskky Hierarchy of formal languages goes like this: Finite ⊆ Regular ⊆ Context-Free ⊆ Context-Sensitive ⊆ Recursively Enumerable That's because formal languages are identified with the automata that accept them and when an automaton accepts e.g. the Recursively Enumerable languages, then it also accepts the context-sensitive languages, and so on all the way down to the finite languages.

To people who live ordinary western lifestyles, everything outside of that sounds weird. - ramen =/= cheap pot noodle type things. Ramen restaurants in Japan attest to this. It'll depend on context what that actually means in this case. - 12k/year =/= no money, numbers like that make no sense outside of context. It depends on how much of it is disposable. You live in a hut with no rent, you grow food, you've no kids, no mortgage, no car, etc, these all matter. - no healthcare =/= bad health. How many of the growing numbers of people dying from heart-related diseases in their 50s and 60s had healthcare? Didn't do much for them, in the end. - collapsing floor =/= bad hygiene or something else actually potentially dangerous, as I said above, the nuisance this causes or doesn't cause depends on lots of actual real factors, it's not some absolute thing.

First: actual visionary CEOs are a niche of a niche. Second: that is not how most companies work. The existence of the workforce is as important as what the company produces Third: who will buy or rent those services or products in a society where the most common economy driver (salaried work) is suddenly wiped out? I am really bothered by these systematic thinkers whose main assumption is that the system can just be changed and morphed willy nilly as if you could completely disregard all of the societal implications. We are surrounded by “thinkers” who are actually just glorified siloed-thinking engineers high on their own supply. reply kryptiskt 7 hours agoparentI don't get it, why have a human visionary CEO? Even the strongest critics of AI agree that LLMs excel at producing bold visions. reply Philpax 7 hours agorootparentGwern's (paraphrased) argument is that an AI is unlikely to be able to construct an extended bold vision where the effects won't be seen for several years, because that requires a significant amount of forecasting and heuristics that are difficult to optimise for. I haven't decided whether I agree with it, but I can see the thought behind it: the more mechanical work will be automated, but long-term direction setting will require more of a thoughtful hand. That being said, in a full-automation economy like this, I imagine \"AI companies\" will behave very differently to human companies: they can react instantly to events, so that a change in direction can be affected in hours or days, not months or years. reply whiplash451 8 hours agoparentprevSomeone probably said the exact same thing when the first cars appeared. Where is the data showing that more jobs get destroyed than created by technological disruption? reply satvikpendem 7 hours agorootparent> Someone probably said the exact same thing when the first cars appeared. Without saying anything regarding the arguments for or against AI, I will address this one sentence. This quote is an example of an appeal to hypocrisy in history fallacy, a form of the tu quoque fallacy. Just because someone criticizes X and you compare it to something else (Y) from another time does not mean that the criticism of X is false. There is survivorship bias as well because we now have cars, but in reality, you could've said this same criticism against some other thing that failed, but you don't, because, well, it failed and thus we don't remember it anymore. The core flaw in this reasoning is that just because people were wrong about one technology in the past doesn't mean current critics are wrong about a different technology now. Each technology needs to be evaluated on its own merits and risks. It's actually a form of dismissing criticism without engaging with its substance. Valid concerns about X should be evaluated based on current evidence and reasoning, not on how people historically reacted to Y or any other technology. reply notahacker 5 hours agorootparentIn this case, there isn't much substance to engage with . The original argument made in passing in an interview covering a range of subjects is essentially [answering your question which presupposes that AI takes over all jobs] I think it'll be bottom up because [in my opinion] being a visionary CEO is the hardest thing to automate The fact that similar, often more detailed assertions of the imminent disappearance of work has been a consistent trope since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (as acknowledged in literally the next question in the interview, complete with an interestingly wrong example) and we've actually ended up with more jobs seems far more like a relevant counterargument than ad hominem tu quoque... reply satvikpendem 5 hours agorootparentAgain, my comment is not about AI, it is about the faulty construction of the argument in the sentence I quoted. X and Y could be anything, that is not my point. reply notahacker 3 hours agorootparentMy point is also not really about AI, my point is that pointing out that the same arguments that X implies Y could (and have been) applied to virtually every V, W, Z (where X and V/W/Z are both in the same category, in this case the category of \"disruptive inventions\") and yet Y didn't happen as predicted isn't ad hominem tu quoque fallacy or anything to do with hypocrisy, it's an observation that arguments about the category resulting in Y have tended to be consistently wrong so we probably should treat claims about Y happening because of something else in the category with scepticism... reply grues-dinner 7 hours agorootparentprevCar and motor vehicles in general get you to work and help you do your work. They don't do the work. I guess that's the difference in thinking. I'm not sure that it's acrually correct: I don't think we'll actually see \"AI\" actually replace work in general as a concept. Unless it can quite literally do everything and anything, there will always be something that people can do to auction their time and/or health to acquire some token of social value. It might taken generations to settle out who is the farrier who had their industry annihilated and who is the programmer who had it created. But as long as there's scarcity and ambition in the world, there'll be something there, whether it's \"good work\" or demeaning toil under the bootheel of a fabulously wealthy cadre of AI mill owners. And there will be scarcity as long as there's a speed of light. Even if I'm wrong and there isn't, that's why it's called the singularity. There's no way to \"see\" across such an event in order to make predictions. We could equally all be in permanent infinite bliss, be tortured playthings of a mad God, extinct, or transmuted into virtually immortal energy beings or anything in between. You might as well ask the dinosaurs whether they thought the ultimate result of the meteor would be pumpkin spice latte or an ASML machine for all the sense it makes. Anyone claiming to be worrying over what happens after a hypothetical singularity is either engaging in intellectual self-gratification, posing or selling something somehow. reply robertlagrant 7 hours agorootparentCompilers also do the work. As do tractors. That doesn't mean there's no work left to do. reply grues-dinner 2 hours agorootparentThey don't do the work, they help you do the work. The work isn't compiling or ploughing, it's writing software and farming, respectively. Both of which are actually just means to the ends of providing some service that someone will pay \"human life tokens\" for. AI maximalists are talking about breaking that pattern and having AI literally do the job and provide the service, cutting out the need for workers entirely. Services being provided entirely autonomously and calories being generated without human input in the two analogies. I'm not convinced by that at all: if services can be fully automated, who are you going to sell ERP or accounting software to, say? What are people going to use as barter for those calories if their time and bodies are worthless? But I can see why that is a saleable concept to those who consider the idea of needing to pay workers to be a cruel injustice. Though even if it works at all, which, as I said, I dont believe, the actual follow-on consequences of such a shift are impossible to make any sensible inferences about. reply passwordoops 8 hours agorootparentprevThere is no data, just hyperbole from those same \"visionaries\" who keep claiming their stochastic parrots will replace everyone's jobs and we therefore need UBI reply jeffreygoesto 6 hours agorootparentprevhttps://www.theregister.com/2024/11/08/robots_crush_career_l... reply camillomiller 8 hours agorootparentprevDidn’t say that.

Gwern is an effective altruist and his influence is largely limited to that community. It would be an exaggeration to claim that he influenced the mainstream of AI and ML researchers -- certainly Hinton, LeCun, Ng, Bengio didn't need him to do their work. He influences the AI safety crowd, who have ironically been trying to build AGI to test their AI safety ideas. Those people are largely concentrated at Anthropic now, since the purge at OpenAI. They are poorly represented at major corporate AI labs, and cluster around places like Oxford and Cal. The EAs' safety concerns are a major reason why Anthropic has moved so much slower than its competitors, and why Dario is having trouble raising the billions he needs to keep going, despite his media blitz. They will get to AGI last, despite trying to be the good guys who are first to invent god in a bottle. By the same token, Dwarkesh is either EA or EA adjacent. His main advertiser for this episode is Jane Street, the former employer of the world's most notorious EA, Sam Bankman-Fried as well as Caroline Ellison. Dwarkesh previously platformed his friend Leopold Aschenbrenner, who spent a year at OAI before he wrote the scare piece \"Situation Report\" made the rounds. Leopold is also semi-technical at best. A wordcel who gravitated to the AI narrative, which could describe many EAs. People outside of AI and ML, please put Dwarkesh in context. He is a partisan and largely non-technical. The way he interfaces with AI is in fantasizing about how it will destroy us all, just as he and Gwern do in this interview. It's sad to see people who are obviously above average intelligent waste so much time on this. reply Vecr 6 hours agoparent\"Wordcel\" is roon terminology, right?

    "originBody": "About us Leadership News & Views Innovation Hub Investors Responsible Business Fraud • 14 November 2024 O2 unveils Daisy, the AI granny wasting scammers’ time It’s a bad day to be a phone scammer. Video Player 00:00 00:00 00:00 Use Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume. O2 has created human-like AI ‘Granny’ to answer calls in real time from fraudsters, keeping them on the phone and away from customers for as long as possible Trained using cutting-edge technology and real scambaiter content, lifelike ‘Daisy’ is indistinguishable from a real person, fooling scammers into thinking they’ve found a perfect target when really, she’s beating them at their own horrible game Former Love Islander and scam victim, Amy Hart, is working with ‘Daisy’ and has made a shocking new video to expose fraudsters’ crooked tactics and help O2 customers swerve the scammers With Daisy revealing how you’re not always speaking to the person you think you are, O2 is urging customers to remain vigilant, leave ‘scambaiting’ to the AI experts and report suspected fraudulent calls and texts for free to 7726 O2 has today unveiled the newest member of its fraud prevention team, ‘Daisy’. As ‘Head of Scammer Relations’, this state-of-the-art AI Granny’s mission is to talk with fraudsters and waste as much of their time as possible with human-like rambling chat to keep them away from real people, while highlighting the need for consumers to stay vigilant as the UK faces a fraud epidemic. Created using a range of cutting-edge AI technology and trained with the help of one of YouTube’s best known scambaiters, Jim Browning, Daisy is a lifelike AI Granny completely indistinguishable from a real person. Able to interact with scammers in real time without any input from her creators, O2 has put Daisy to work around the clock answering dodgy calls. Daisy combines various AI models which work together to listen and respond to fraudulent calls instantaneously and is so lifelike it has successfully kept numerous fraudsters on calls for 40 minutes at a time. As part of Virgin Media O2’s ongoing “Swerve the Scammers” campaign, Scambaiter Daisy has been created in response to new research from O2 revealing 7 in 10 (71%) of Brits would like to get their own back against scammers that have tried to trick them or their loved ones. However, not wanting to waste their own time ranked as the top reason why the public wouldn’t bait scammers themselves (53%). With more than two thirds of Brits (67%) concerned about being the target of fraud and one in five (22%) experiencing a fraud attempt every single week, O2 is fighting back. After several weeks of taking calls in the run up to International Fraud Awareness Week (November 17-23), the AI Scambaiter has told frustrated scammers meandering stories of her family, talked at length about her passion for knitting and provided exasperated callers with false personal information including made-up bank details. By tricking the criminals into thinking they were defrauding a real person and playing on scammers biases about older people, Daisy has prevented them from targeting real victims and, most importantly, has exposed the common tactics used so customers can better protect themselves Influencer and reality TV star, Amy Hart, has worked with Daisy to produce a shocking video to show how she’s taking on phoney fraudsters like the one who targeted her. After receiving a call from someone who said they were calling from her bank on the morning of her friend’s wedding, Amy fell victim to a scam which saw more than £5,000 drained from her bank account in a matter of minutes. The harrowing experience has left Amy passionate about spreading the word on scams and exposing their tactics to help keep others safe. Watch the video here. Amy Hart said “I know first-hand just how sophisticated nasty fraudsters can be, that’s why I’ve teamed up with O2 and AI Scambaiter Daisy to take the fight back to them, keeping them busy with calls going nowhere. “But whilst I love a wind up, it’s scary to see the lengths scammers go to steal everything from passwords to bank details regardless of who they’re speaking to. Whether you’re young or old, anyone can be a victim of a scam that’s why we can never be too careful when it comes to unexpected calls or texts. “If you have even the tiniest doubt about who you’re speaking to, the best thing to do is to hang up the phone and call back on a trusted number.” Murray Mackenzie, Director of Fraud at Virgin Media O2, said: “We’re committed to playing our part in stopping the scammers, investing in everything from firewall technology to block out scam texts to AI-powered spam call detection to keep our customers safe. “The newest member of our fraud-prevention team, Daisy, is turning the tables on scammers – outsmarting and outmanoeuvring them at their own cruel game simply by keeping them on the line. “But crucially, Daisy is also a reminder that no matter how persuasive someone on the other end of the phone may be, they aren’t always who you think they are. With scammers operating fulltime call centres specifically to target Brits, we’re urging everyone to remain vigilant and help play their part in stopping fraud by forwarding on dodgy calls and texts to 7726 for free.” Swerve the Scammers O2 has invested heavily in the fight against fraud, rolling out AI-powered spam fighting tools and new caller identification services free to all mobile customers to help protect them. The operator also blocks millions of fraudulent texts and calls from reaching customers phones every month. However, with scammers constantly evolving their processes and using increasingly sophisticated methods, the business is encouraging Brits to leave scambaiting to the AI experts. Instead, the public can help block scammers by forwarding suspected scam calls and text messages to 7726. By reporting dodgy calls and messages, the telecoms company is able to investigate and block the mobile numbers used by fraudsters and can also use scam texts to help refine its blocking services, making it easier to identify and stop new trends faster in future. Last year alone, Virgin Media O2 blocked 89 million texts, in part thanks to 7726. To help make life easier for customers, O2 has pulled together a new webpage offering tips, tricks and advice so they know what to look out for. Head to our Swerve the Scammers page for more information. Virgin Media O2 is calling for wider action to prevent fraud The company recently exposed the scale of the UK’s fraud problem after finding that nearly seven in ten Brits (69%)1 reported that they’ve been targeted by scammers. Last year alone, Virgin Media O2 intercepted and blocked over £250 million in suspected fraudulent transactions — equivalent to stopping one every two minutes. Warning that not enough is being done to protect consumers, Virgin Media O2 is calling on the government to take accountability for stopping fraud at its source by appointing a dedicated fraud minister and creating a single centralised, specialised and properly resourced national policing body responsible for investigating all instances of fraud. Notes to Eds About Daisy Daisy is a human-like AI that has been developed to hold autonomous conversations with scam callers and keep them on the line for as long as possible. The custom-built AI scambaiter has been answering calls from scammers and having lifelike but meandering conversations with no input required from her creators. Daisy combines various AI models which work together to first listen to the caller and transcribe their voice into text. Appropriate responses are then generated through a custom large language model complete with a character ‘personality’ layer, and then fed back through a custom AI text-to-speech model to generate a voice answer. This takes place in real time, allowing the tool to hold a human-like conversation with a caller. O2’s top tips to stay safe from fraudsters O2 has pulled together three simple steps on what to do when called by a scammer or upon receiving a suspicious message: STOP: If you receive a call out of the blue for someone claiming to be from O2, think about what you’re being asked to do. Does it feel right? Are you being asked for personal data or a code over the phone? If you have any suspicion that you might be speaking to a scammer, the best thing to do is hang up and call us back by dialling 202 from your O2 phone. SEND to 7726: Worked out you might have spoken to or received a text from a scammer? Don’t just ignore it, take a few seconds to forward on to 7726. It spells SPAM on your phone’s keypad and is the free number to use to report to us so we can investigate. It helps keep you safe and allows us to block fraudsters numbers and prevent or shut down similar scams faster in future. SPEAK OUT: Let your friends and family know about the scam. By telling others, you can help keep them safe and ensure they’re never caught off guard. Read more about Virgin Media O2’s call for structural reform to address the UK’s fraud epidemic here. Strand Partners’ specialist research team conducted an online survey of 5,247 members of the UK public between 07.06.24 – 19.06.24.

When a big telecom does it, the second thing they do with it is to fuck up the spam detection so bad that every third phone call I make gets answered by \"Daisy\". And just think about it - why would a telecom need this tech? They can already drop the spam calls and stop routing calls from the bad actor telecoms who enable the spammers. They don't do that because they prefer to collect a few cents a call from them rather than serve their customers better. It's everyone else who needs this. reply waiwai933 1 hour agoparentThey're not intercepting calls over their network from suspected bad actors; rather, they've created some phone numbers that always go to Daisy - see https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2024/11/virgin-media-o... reply axus 1 hour agorootparentAh! So step 2 is wait for the spammers to automate blacklisting of Daisy phone numbers, and only then start rolling out a (paid) Daisy option to customers. Not connecting calls doesn't waste spammer money, but maybe Daisy does. If the big telco can find 10 righteous callers from a a bad actor telecom, they should keep routing the calls. reply ensignavenger 39 minutes agorootparentThen, once the spammers have blacklisted the Daisy numbers, cycle those spam-free numbers to their customers and start a new batch of Daisy numbers. This way, there is a constant flow of spammer free numbers being cycled into the pool. Of course, everyone and their dog wants your phone number, so you will have to be careful who you give it to if you want it to stay spam-free. reply ttul 1 hour agorootparentprevMy friend works for a big telco and is the guy fixing this problem for them. They have amazing powers of deception when they need it. New numbers can be conjured up at any time. reply simfree 57 minutes agorootparentThe new fad among wireless carriers here in the US is to route what they think are spam calls to a fake voicemail box. Voicemail that is left in this generic voice mail box never makes it to their customer and the customer is completely unaware that some of their calls have been diverted. reply jollyllama 51 minutes agorootparentWow. There should be a way to opt out of this, at least. Isn't this a violation of common carrier laws? reply immibis 50 minutes agorootparentprevThen suddenly, calls from consenting callers to consenting receivers are labeled as spam and blocked. What can you do about it? Nothing. Switch to email, I guess. Oh wait, same problem. reply kabdib 15 minutes agorootparentreductio ad absurdum: we're back to Pony Express reply neilalexander 55 minutes agorootparentprevBetter yet, route all calls for all disconnected/unassigned numbers in their part of the numbering plan to it.

Strangely, I looked at OpenAI's offering. Despite it being crazy expensive, they also didn't offer a reference implementation anywhere close to the functionality that is demo'ed in the regular ChatGPT app. Nobody seems to get the interruptions correct - people are doing all sorts of weak workarounds like push-to-talk, etc. reply xnx 1 hour agoprevSeems like the logical endpoint of a lot of this is people getting paid directly for their attention. Want to call me? I've set a price of $5/call that I answer, and an additional $10/minute of listen time after the first 10 seconds. Want to send me an email? $1/email and $5/100 words. Anyone I have emailed is automatically on my allow-list, which I can also adjust manually. reply tokioyoyo 53 minutes agoparentAnd maybe like a temporary hold of the money, so you get it back if I’m convinced it’s not spam. Probably would resolve 99% of spam issues in the real world and create a chain of trust. Add some temporary disabling feature as well if you’re expecting a call from a random number too, so you’re set. reply swores 10 minutes agorootparentSounds like a great solution to the minority of people like you and me who wouldn't mind the added steps of approving every real phone call as not spam after, having to remember how to set that you're expecting a call from a random number, etc. I can't see it being acceptable to enough people for any network to go down this road unless spam levels get way worse. reply speerer 6 minutes agoparentprevSatoshi Nakamoto's first visionfor Bitcoin was just this - pay-to-send email. reply guidoism 25 minutes agoparentprevThat's similar to the idea I had for combating texting spam: - If your number is in my address book then texts are free for you - If this is the first time you are contacting me then you pay me $1 There are probably downsides and ways this will screw up real relationships but it will certainly increase the cost of spam. reply Nition 18 minutes agorootparentOne issue I can forsee: - Every contractor (plumber etc) you hire will ask you to please add them to your contact list first so that they can message you. - After a while of half their clients not doing that and lots of fees on their end, contractors stop providing a phone number at all, asking you to please install ContractorApp to communicate with them. reply crummy 3 minutes agorootparentMaybe when you first receive a text you see: This message is from an unknown number. (Accept / Block / Charge sender $1) reply thejazzman 5 minutes agorootparentprevI love every part of this. Not having things in writing is one of the most common tactics with bad contractors. And I miss their call backs because I have unknowns goto spam, so I have to remember to disable that feature... reply bawolff 24 minutes agoparentprevIf you have already sorted the world between people you want to take calls from and people you don't, why wouldn't you just block the people you don't want instead of charging them money? reply dotancohen 16 minutes agorootparentBecause there's a middle ground of people who we have not yet categorized. I don't know every phone number my doctor might call me from. reply xnx 5 minutes agorootparentprevMy attention is valuable. I should be able to sell it on my terms. reply wzsddtc 54 minutes agoparentprevI think you have just described LinkedIn's business model, minus the fact that you don't get the money but the filter provider does. reply xnx 7 minutes agorootparentYes. There are all kind or brokers selling the attention of their audiences: Google, TV Networks, podcasts, LinkedIn, etc. I'd like to see another attempt at disintermediation in the space. reply ddtaylor 4 minutes agoprevI love that they are weaponizing the perceived kindness of senior citizens in this way. Many of the victims of scams are some of the nicest people ever that were taken advantage of in some capacity - usually while trying to help someone. It's the digital age equivalent of staging a broken down cart and then robbing some old folks. I think most of us hate the idea of the \"solution\" being to not go near anyone with a broken down cart out of fear. I'm not saying this fixes everything, but I would rather a world where scammers odds at making a living at this are so poor they won't bother versus a world where everyone has to block every number by default and live in metaphorical bunkers to never interact because you might be a scammer. reply watusername 1 hour agoprevIf you use a VoIP service like Twilio and voip.ms, you can set up a very simple IVR menu that just asks unknown callers to press 1 to be connected to you. No AI involved. For me, this has been surprisingly effective against robocalls. Obviously this isn’t going to work against scammers who call directly, but most of the spam calls I receive start with some pre-recorded message which isn’t going to pass the menu. Edit: s/auto/pre reply Ronnie76er 36 minutes agoparentMy Pixel 8 (not sure what other Android phones do this) can screen calls using their AI assistant. It asks what the call is about. If they answer, it displays the text to you as it rings through. It sounds surprisingly human-like, even saying \"Hello?\" in a slightly annoyed tone when the other person doesn't respond in time. reply thfuran 45 minutes agoparentprevI think I've gotten exactly one spam call since I set up an IVR like that a few years ago, and it was probably not quite daily before that. reply morkalork 54 minutes agoparentprevIf they ever get clever enough to automate the menu selection, it would be funny to have an infinitely deep IVR sort of like the tar pits people build on websites to trap web crawlers. reply darkr 7 minutes agoprevGreat PR move, but surely better to invest in more basic security measures supported by their app (chain of trust, verified callers/messaging etc). Instead their app is primarily a react native sales tool. Part of the reason that o2 was so affected by scammers calling from south Asian call centres with “the latest offers” was because they used to do exactly this with their customers. reply ddtaylor 2 minutes agoparentTo be clear while I don't enjoy the idea of receiving low-effort sales calls, I do think that real scammers are different. Real scammers don't have a business, aren't willing to go to court, etc. reply alexjplant 9 minutes agoprevSo it's just an AI re-implementation of the Telecrapper 2000 [1]? The original site is down but there are plenty of YouTube videos [2] of it still available.

It's like corporate avatars for hiring or cold call bots for sales. I'd say stick to white listed numbers, but pro phones can't do that, and they are the most prone to spam. reply jalk 38 minutes agoparentSo some time in the future, the Telcos will report, that 30%-50% of calls are Scammer AIs talking to Granny AIs reply seabass-labrax 1 hour agoprevI'm imagining this is just a publicity stunt, and I'll say it's a very good one. However I can't see it being very practical. There are lots of scam calls to keep up with and LLMs and text-to-speech models are expensive to run. If they do run this in production, the costs of running hundreds of 'Daisies' will inevitably be passed onto the consumer, and worse still, if the scammers are calling in through PSTN lines or cellular this will use up our already scarce bandwidth. I've frequently had difficulty connecting through trunk lines from Belgium and Germany to numbers in Britain, and that's without a legion of AI grannies sitting on the phone! reply wepple 50 minutes agoparentEvery type of defensive tech is nothing more than driving up the cost of attack. Doubling the dwell time for a scammer will halve their profits. That could have interesting second-order effects. Perhaps it makes it not worth it for some subset? reply huac 1 hour agoparentprevreal-time full duplex like OpenAI GPT-4o is pretty expensive. cascaded approaches (usually about 800ms - 1 second delay) are slower and worse, but very very cheap. when I built this a year ago, I estimated the LLM + TTS + other serving costs to be less than the Twilio costs. reply milleramp 26 minutes agoprevJolly Roger has been doing this for a while, the example phone calls are hilarious. https://youtube.com/@jollyrogertelephone?si=sB3Tiql0wsUlXldo reply cedws 53 minutes agoprevVery nice to see, my grandmother was recently scammed out of a large amount of money. Luckily the bank reimbursed her. Scammers are a stain on the reputation of India. You could argue it's unfair to tar an entire country with the same brush, but quite clearly rule of law isn't properly functioning over there and there's complicity in letting them do this.

All I know is half the time I call I get a dialup sound as my call gets routed to the fax machine. reply LlamaTrauma 1 hour agoprevInstating an AI model as \"Head of Scammer Relations\" is hilarious. I think the point here is to collect the phone numbers of scam call centers and have Daisy call them so that scammers waste time talking to it rather than a victim. reply jonplackett 1 hour agoprevI wish they would have a number I can cal to speak to her.

You’ve invented or learned a caricature to rail at which may have once been based in truth, and from time to time again approximates it, though never with the fidelity you ascribe to the original. It’s commonly done by sides in partisan polarisation, the most common being a two-mode system that pillories its picture of the other. If you picture the person writing the totem comment, you probably have a clear idea of what they do for a living, how they dress, et cetera. Totems are why both deification and demonisation work; they’re a hack of the human ability to visualise and project. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

This would have left us with limited options of creating safe-by-default HTTP servers. NG3: Features That Are Not Security Critical Go Safe Web aims to help you create a secure-by-default Go HTTP server and nothing more. Features that are not security critical will not be added. Focusing solely on security allows us to maintain high compatibility with the standard library and makes adoption easier. Security Vulnerabilities and Mitigations On a high level, we plan to address, or provide the needed infrastructure to address, following issues (not an exhaustive list): XSS (cross-site scripting) and XSSI (cross-site script inclusion) - e.g. by controlling how responses are generated XSRF (cross-site request forgery) - e.g. by using Fetch Metadata policies, supporting token-based XSRF protection CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) - e.g. by taking control of CORS response headers and handling CORS preflight requests CSP (content security policy) - e.g. by automatically adding script nonces to HTML responses, adding relevant security headers Transport Security - e.g. by enforcing HSTS support IFraming - e.g. by setting relevant HTTP headers to restrict framing or providing server-side support for origin selection Auth (access control) - e.g. by providing infrastructure for plugging in access control logic in an uniform, auditable way HTTP Request Parsing Bugs - e.g. by implementing strict and well documented parsing behavior Error responses - e.g. by providing infrastructure for uniform error handling (e.g. to prevent accidental leaks or XSS from error responses) Enforcement of other security specific HTTP headers - here Appendix Evolving Security Requirements (example) Imagine an API for configuring access control. It features three types of rules: ALLOW(user) - allows a given user DENY(user) - denies a given user (has priority over ALLOW) REPORT(user) - reports that it has seen a request from a given user Imagine now that at some point, security standards need to be increased and user = \"frombulator\" has been determined to not meet the desired bar. How do we, for all the services running in our company, address this? For existing services, we add a LegacyFrombulatorAccess option like so: security.AccessControl(rules, unsafe.LegacyFrombulatorAccess()). We change the security.AccessControl() call to add by default a DENY(\"frombulator\") rule. This rule is not added if unsafe.LegacyFrombulatorAccess is applied. Instead, unsafe.LegacyFrombulatorAccess adds a REPORT(\"frombulator\") rule. This way, we have: Ensured that all new callers of security.AccessControl use the safe setting by default. Can monitor existing services dependence on calls from the frombulator. After a period of observation (let’s say, 30 days): If the service doesn’t receive requests from the frombulator: prune the unsafe.LegacyFrombulatorAccess option. If the service does receive requests from the frombulator: inform the service owners and plan a fix. Crucially, only the last case (dependence on unsafe configuration) requires engineering work per service. The rest can be automated. This approach is possible due to careful API design. A missing DENY or REPORT rule, or a single sink in the form of security.AccessControl would make this infeasible.

These days anything I write in Go uses plain HTTP, and the TLS is done by a reverse proxy of some variety that does some other stuff with the traffic too including security headers, routing for different paths to different services, etc. I never run a go web application \"bare\", public facing, and manually supplying cert files. reply ongy 12 hours agoparentI suspect this is partially from google's internal 0 trust cluster networking. I.e. even if the communication is entirely between components inside a k8s (or borg) cluster, it should be authenticated and encrypted. In this model, there may be a reverse proxy at the edge of the cluster, but the communication between this service and the internal services wouls still be https. With systems like cert-manager it's also incredibly easy to supply every in-cluster process with a certificate form the cluster-internal CA. -- Googler, not related to this project reply kevinmgranger 4 hours agorootparentThe policy(?) change came ever since \"SSL added and removed here ;-)\", right? That's when I remember seeing a broader shift towards app-terminated TLS. reply cyberpunk 12 hours agorootparentprevWhy wouldn’t you use istio or cilium for this? reply ongy 9 hours agorootparentThis might be me being daft, but I never quite understood the appeal of doing this with istio. OR also partially just due to the timing of when I started to care about things in k8s world. (Rather recently) My understanding of that model is that the services themselves still just do unauthenticated HTTP, this gets picked up on the client side by a sidecar, packed into mTLS/HTTPS, authed+unpacked on the server sidecar, then passed as plain HTTP to the server itself. This is great when we have intra-host vulnerabilities I guess. But doesn't allow to e.g. have code sanitizers that are strict on using TLS properly (google does this). And while it is a real gain over simple unauthed with untrusted network between nodes, with cilium taking care of the intra-node networking being secure, I don't quite see how the added layer is more useful than using network policies strictly. (besides some edge cases where it's used to further apply internal authorization based on the identity. Though that trusts the \"network\" (istio) again.) reply liveoneggs 4 hours agorootparentin the modern world extra network hops, novel userland network stacks, and additional cycles of decrypted/re-encrypting traffic make your apps go faster, not slower. reply grogenaut 12 hours agorootparentprevWhy add another layer if you aren't already using istio or cilium? reply cyberpunk 11 hours agorootparentBecause it’s zero configuration auto mtls between all the services in your cluster (or intra-node if cillium) instead of managing a tls cert for every service? reply sofixa 11 hours agorootparentZero to little configuration at point of use, but a lot of upfront configuration, maintenance, fun issues when you need something slightly less traditional (e.g. something that needs raw TCP or heavens forbid, UDP). Different trade offs for different situations. reply cyberpunk 10 hours agorootparentI still think it’s far less than managing tls per service. Every component needs a different tls configuration, vs one time installing istio. Raw TCP is supported by istio even with mtls, you just have to match in your VirtualServices on SNI instead of Host header. We routinely mix tcp and http services on the same external ports, with mtls for both. UDP I don’t really see how is relevant to a conversation on tls reply sofixa 9 hours agorootparent> one time installing istio And never update it afterwards? > UDP I don’t really see how is relevant to a conversation on tls You might have UDP services alongside your TCP/HTTP behind TLS. reply cyberpunk 8 hours agorootparentAt least in our org security let us know when it's time to patch various components and it's typically just a devops chore to bump a helm chart version and merge.. I don't really understand your point; You're trying to say managing a single helm release for istio is more effort than (in my case, for example) manually managing around 40 TLS certificates (and yes, we have an in-house PKI with our own CA that issues via ACME/certbot etc also) and the services that use them? It's clearly not? Just templating out the config files for e.g Cassandra or ES, or Redis or whatever component takes multiple x the effort of ./helm install istio. reply sofixa 6 hours agorootparentIstio is a notorious pain to maintain, because it has a bunch of dependencies around Kube clusters, so you can't just helm install istio every time there's a new release. reply cyberpunk 5 hours agorootparentThat’s not my experience at all and I’ve run hundreds of clusters across multiple cloud providers and on bare metal. You absolutely can helm upgrade istio, why not? Can you give any actual examples of this? reply karmarepellent 10 hours agoparentprevI have use cases for both approaches (letting a reverse proxy handle TLS, letting the application listen on an external socket and handling TLS in the application). I find is is easier to configure an application with a reverse proxy in front when different paths require e.g. different cache-control response headers. At the end of the day I do not want to replicate all the logic that nginx (and others) already provide when it integrates well with the application at the back. Other commenters suggest that both ways (with or without additional reverse proxy) add \"tons of complexity\". I don't see why. Using a reverse proxy is what we have done for a while now. Installation and configuration (with a reasonable amount of hardening) is not complex and there exist a lot of resources to make it easier. And leaving the reverse proxy out and handling TLS in the application itself should not be \"complex\" either. Just parse a certificate and private key and supply them to whatever web framework you happen to use. reply eptcyka 6 hours agorootparentAnd implement cert reloading if your application reaches any kind of respectable uptime. reply effdee 12 hours agoparentprevThe phrase \"SSL added and removed here\" from an NSA slide comes to mind. reply pushupentry1219 7 hours agorootparentTo be clear I meant something like Caddy, or nginx not a solution like cloudflare or GCP doing my TLS reply arccy 6 hours agorootparentonce you outgrow a single machine, unsecured network connections become an issue again reply Thorrez 5 hours agoparentprevWhat HTTPS/TLS related bits are you talking about?

A big project not handling HTTPS themselves (like docmost), adds tons of complexity on the server side. Now, I have to install that service as a container to isolate that, then need to add a reverse proxy on top, etc. That leads to resource inflation when I just want to use a small VM for that single task. Now, instead I deploy a whole infrastructure to run that small thing. reply NhanH 13 hours agorootparentHandling https in the project also adds tons of complexity in the long run though: tls/ssl library versions, cert handling. Instead of having one way to deal with all of them (at the proxy layer, or sometimes at network layer), I have to deal with individual software way of managing those reply kortilla 13 hours agorootparentI think you’re vastly overestimating the complexity of pointing a TLS library to a CA. reply 9dev 2 hours agorootparentDo that for a bunch of different applications and you hit interesting issues. For example the Java TLS stack, which doesn’t accept a PEM certificate on its own, but needs the full certificate chain. Kibana, however, requires the full certificate chain including the root certificate, which isn’t usually a part of the certificate itself, and Elasticsearch complains about an invalid certificate if you point it to the same one. So even for two apps from the same vendor, which are commonly deployed together, you need bespoke TLS file variants. Scale that to more applications, and you’ll find out the hard way that you are vastly underestimating the complexity of operating a software ecosystem. reply hnlmorg 11 hours agorootparentprevTheir point isn’t about the complexity of installing a certificate. It’s doing it successfully and securely at scale. Everything is easy until you have to do it at scale. reply thayne 11 hours agorootparentprevFor a single application, it's not too bad. When you have dozens of applications that all have different mechanisms to install a CA, rotate certs, etc. And some of those don't have a good way to automate rotating the certs, then it becomes a pain. reply bayindirh 10 hours agorootparentI don't think so. We run a horde of machines, and run plethora of services, which are custom and/or has a very narrow install base due to the niche they serve. 99% of them use system-wide PKI store for CA and their certificates, which is under /etc. All of them have configuration options for these folders, and have short certificate lives because of the operational regulations we have in place. At worst case, we distribute them with saltstack. Otherwise we just use scp, maybe a small wrapper script. Managing them doesn't take any measurable time for us. ...and we have our own CA on top of it. reply thayne 2 hours agorootparent> 99% of them use system-wide PKI store for CA and their certificates, which is under /etc. Consider yourself lucky then. For self-hosted third party software, I've seen requirements to provide it in an environment variable, upload it to a web form over plain http on localhost, specify an AWS secret service secret that contains it, put it in a specific location that is bind mounted into a container, create a custom image (both VM and container), etc. reply ptman 11 hours agorootparentprevhttps://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/acme/autocert reply bayindirh 12 hours agorootparentprevI mean, tons of \"old-school\" services handle these things fine for the last two decades, at least. It can't be that hard. It's just a TLS library, and some files in a specific format at the end of the day. reply redundantly 11 hours agorootparentIn my experience, most people have an extremely hard time wrapping their minds around how to configure TLS/HTTPS services and fail completely at understanding how it works. reply yjftsjthsd-h 12 hours agorootparentprev> Now, I have to install that service as a container to isolate that, then need to add a reverse proxy on top, etc. Why? I've run plenty of normal non-containerized apps that bind localhost:1234 and then are reverse proxied by nginx or caddy or whatever. (I agree that you would need a reverse proxy, I think that's kinda the point, it's the container thing I don't get) reply bayindirh 12 hours agorootparentBecause some of the applications are \"container native\" and do not support configuration of IP/Port binding. Why? UNIX philosophy and working traditions be damned. Exhibit A: Docmost: https://docmost.com/docs/self-hosting/environment-variables I can understand the reverse proxy, but I want to run thing on a small VPS or a Raspberry Pi, etc. I want to use minimum resources so I can run more things per server. If this thing was being installed at work, I can build a great wall in front of it, but for personal things, I rather have less moving parts, and just deploy and forget the thing. reply sofixa 11 hours agorootparent> Because some of the applications are \"container native\" and do not support configuration of IP/Port binding. Why? UNIX philosophy and working traditions be damned. I'm not sure I follow. Docmost runs in a container, on a port which is configurable. By default, as all containers, that port is local to the container. The container orchestrator (be it docker CLI, docker-compose, Swarm, Nomad, Kubernetes, Podman) is the one who you instruct to expose a port from the container network to your host network. Docker tries to be smart and easy and will expose it on all networks by default, but even on it it's configurable, let alone on the more advanced options. reply bayindirh 9 hours agorootparentLet me try to explain myself clearer. First, any enterprise/homelab installation with significant resources is outside of my scope. I don't care about them. When you don't pay for the infra/power cost, all bets are off. You can install quadruple redundant 300 node K8S cluster sitting on two different data centers in different cities connected to their own power generation equipment for a simple docmost instance. I'm talking about small fry installations, for personal reasons, on small equipment. Think Raspi5/N100 NUC boxes as the target hardware. I have limited resources, want no heat/noise at my home or want to pay as small as possible for a good VPS. Now, for something like docmost, I need a container runtime, and ingress controller/a reverse proxy, because I want to open this service to a VPN or web somehow. I don't have much qualms with containers, as long as there are no cut corners. We'll talk about two examples here. First is Wiki.js. Comes with 3 containers. DB, Wiki, Updater. OK. They are not much resource heavy, so acceptable. On top, Wiki container handles its own HTTPS, TLS certificates via Let's Encrypt (and allows custom ones, as well). It's the nice one. I can expose it, or hide it, I can handle my certificates or it can handle itself. Nice, batteries included. Install in 10 seconds, update occasionally, enjoy. Second is docmost. It's a nice tool. Allows me to create a space and put a bunch of people in to collaborate. Install for desktop in 10 seconds & Works. Nice. I want to open it to outside. Forward a couple of ports? No. There's no HTTPS. Now I need to terminate it. Traefik? Too big for the job. Apache, doable but needs half an hour from get go. Can I limit it to localhost for local installations, for myself? No. As long as I run it, it binds to 0.0.0.0. So, if I want to install it locally to my desktop, I still need to add a firewall in front of it, because whole LAN can see it, and no, I don't trust any devices on my network (not people, but the apps). This is my problem. I want batteries included solutions, which can adapt to my circumstances. I don't have the desire to run n servers for m services, because they are too lazy to be flexible to adapt their environments. It's not I can't do it, it's the contrary, but I don't want to, because I want to live my life and have time for people and things I care. The services I use must be able to adaptable to my environment. This is how bare-metal services, daemons in UNIX world work. I can fit a whole rack of services in a powerful enough server and isolate them if required. It saves space, power, time and sanity. Littering services with services in boxes and putting more boxes on top of that because their developers are lazy makes my blood boil. reply gr4vityWall 7 hours agorootparent> Think Raspi5/N100 NUC boxes as the target hardware. I don't think those would be negatively impacted by running Docker or Caddy. Isn't the performance cost of containers minimal these days? I had similar thoughts in the past, but when I looked up performance comparisons between running something on docker vs without a container, the resulting performance was practically identical. reply bayindirh 6 hours agorootparentThe problem is not containerization per se, I run containers both in my personal systems and at work. If you extremely optimize for compilers, the performance difference can be trimmed down to 2%. I think for most of us, it's 5%-6% band, and it's OK for non-loaded servers. My qualm is about trimming fairly standard features and offloading it to somewhere else. A single HTTP service + traefik (or Apache/NGINX reverse proxy) is heavier than a single HTTPS service. Plus adds more moving parts for smaller installations. f I was running an API farm, I can add all kinds of bells and whistles, and it'll be lighter overall, but this is not a valid reason for stripping fairly simple features from applications which will be used by small teams on small hardware. Plus, this additional layers can sometimes conflict (A requires B, C required D, where B & D are same thing but either one can't accommodate A & C at the same time), requiring a completely new system to run the service, which is wasteful, from my perspective. reply gr4vityWall 28 minutes agorootparent> A single HTTP service + traefik (or Apache/NGINX reverse proxy) is heavier than a single HTTPS service. How heavy are talking, and what would be the measured impact? I have worked on small teams (3~4 people) where we had to use our own infrastructure for regulatory reasons. I also self-host a few things as a hobby. I don't think Nginx or Caddy were ever a bottleneck, and at the human level, they saved more resources than not using them. I don't remember the last time I exposed something to a network using their bundled http server directly rather than a reverse proxy. I don't like wasting computational resources of course, but % wise, 'optimizing' them by not using containers or a reverse proxy wouldn't net any visible gains - there's usually other low hanging fruit that gives you more for your time. reply sofixa 6 hours agorootparentprevIO performance is the most severely impacted, but it's still fine for most uses. reply sofixa 7 hours agorootparentprev> Traefik? Too big for the job. Apache, doable but needs half an hour from get go. What do you think Traefik is if you think Apache is OK?

This is how bare-metal services, daemons in UNIX world work Ah, so you don't need systemd/an init and service system? Or libc? Or iptables/firewall? You just plop an app and everything magically works how you want it to? I think you have fundamental knowledge gaps, and instead of trying to address them, or think about why would a project prefer to not reinvent the wheel everyone already has anyway, you prefer to rant that it wasn't like this in the good old days. Good old days with cgi-bin and php-fpm that needed a reverse proxy in front anyways, so nothing has changed other than an abundance of documentation and examples and flexibility. reply rjh29 12 hours agorootparentprevGlobal vs local variables. reply nirui 12 hours agorootparentprev> Now, I have to install that service as a container to isolate that, then need to add a reverse proxy on top, etc. You can setup a Traefik (or some other ingress service) instance in a container and let it handle all the reverse proxying thingies for you. And if you do it right, the services should automatically register to the ingress service as they start up, and a port/HTTP route should be automatically assigned to them. Do it in the old bare is harder and probably will always be harder, since you will be directly interact with OS facilities that was probably designed for something else than what you might try to run. Container management service such as Docker and Kubernetes abstracted away a lot of these complexities. Funny enough, Traefik is written in Go... guess we've gone some (maybe not full) cycle on this one. reply bayindirh 12 hours agorootparentHonestly, doing things on bare server and interacting with OS is easier because it involves less moving parts and everything is in a more accessible state. Containers are not bad per se, but cutting corners just because \"this will run in a container, so they can just add another HTTPS terminator\" is just carelessness IMHO. Because not all of us have homelabs at home to install an onion of services to run a simple service open to outside. A good example of this is Wiki.js. It's desinged as container native, but handles its own ingress, HTTPS and Let's Encrypt certificates. I have no qualms to it, but when another tool just cuts corners and tells you that \"It's easy to install, but bring your own secure ingress layer on top\", it gets ugly. Because it adds moving parts, most importantly wastes resources for a 3 person installation on small hardware, etc. Keep in mind, these are tools designed for small user-bases. They're not enterprise software. On my day job, we call 80 machine clusters \"small\". But this is not about things I install/manage at my job. reply treflop 11 hours agorootparentWhile I am not ready to recommend that everyone install Traefik, this is false. You can get a single node Docker “cluster” going with Traefik in 15 seconds. There is no maintenance except updating occasionally. It doesn’t use much more resources. You do not need to install any third party tools. There is no onion of services. You literally just boot up Traefik plus your app. This has been doable since at least 2019 by just installing Docker via your OS’ package manager. I’ve started using containers before 99% of people and so got to see the fundamentals build up. You do not need to skip directly to “Kubernetes.” That’s like needing to wash your clothes so you skip directly to buying an industrial washing machine and then lamenting how all washing machines are overkill. reply bayindirh 9 hours agorootparentTraefik plus my service is two layers. My service has a DB hidden behind it, it's three layers. I put a VPN in front of it, and now it's four. My service doesn't take much resources, also the DB I use is light by itself. I added traefik, which is also light, and the VPN daemon which is also light. However, these four layers are not light. They're heavier. I'd rather don't have Traefik in front and have a lighter stack, because for that much resources, I can run another server at another port, which can save me another VPS (money, maintenance time, documentation and interconnection). I mean, we were using jails before Linux had containers. I'm not new to system administration or computers in general. I don't get angry because things are complicated/hard. I get angry because we waste resources and write bad software because we somehow think \"worst is the best\". Things add up. Light becomes heavy, easy becomes meaninglessly complex.

No one is trying to solve a problem by wrapping HTTPS terminator with \"another HTTPS terminator\". Also, for real, how can you terminate HTTPS twice? Also, from your another post: > Traefik plus my service is two layers. My service has a DB hidden behind it, it's three layers. I put a VPN in front of it, and now it's four. Why stop there, if you start from user's keyboard as a layer, then there's 5, and screen 6, then countless Internet cable and routers. Man! so many layers, it's crazy! Also, that's not how you structure things. You have a reverse proxy, and then a service, 2 layers total. And VPN?

Yes, any of those could be defunded at any moment if it was no longer advantageous for Google to support it, but for now, they are getting support and new releases. reply jonathanoliver 14 hours agoparentprevThey should put it on all of their officially supported ones too! https://killedbygoogle.com/ reply sofixa 11 hours agoparentprev> Should google put this on all their products They have a few products you pay for and are thus supported (for consumers YouTube Premium, Google One which is Drive storage+support, for organisations Google Cloud, Google Workspace), but for everything else, yeah. Unless you pay for One, you get no support from them on the random free stuff like Keep or Maps - you get what you pay for (in reality much more than that, something like Maps is a massive effort everyone can use for free). reply denysvitali 11 hours agorootparentAs a Google One customer, I can guarantee that you get no support from them either. The real support comes from talking with someone who works at Google and can direct you to the right team... reply warkdarrior 14 hours agoparentprev [–] It's an open-source library (or collection of libraries) for Go HTTP servers. Apache license, so it does not matter if Google supports it or not. reply HumanOstrich 11 hours agorootparent [–] Until you have an equivalent team of volunteers ready to maintain the project, I think it does matter. reply jerf 5 hours agorootparentIt's not really that sort of project. In principle, this is all stuff you should already be doing. But, statistically speaking, $YOU aren't. Even if they disappear today, you're probably still better off picking this up and starting with it as-is than you are with your current server. While I'm sure this is the sort of project that could benefit from ongoing improvements, it is also not going to decay away into utter uselessness if nobody commits to it in a week or two. I understand the need for projects to be maintained, but I think some people have been badly burned by the Javascript world, or possibly some other language environments, and don't realize that those environments aren't the norm, but one of the extrema. Go is quite possibly on the other extrema. It does not generally decay. Again, I'm not saying that means it's totes cool to pick up a security-based project with a last commit from seven years ago and just assume it's still cutting edge, but this sort of Go code doesn't require a dozen commits a month just to tread water. reply HumanOstrich 3 hours agorootparentAs someone stuck in JavaScript hell, I think you have a great point. How nice it would be to not touch a project for a year, come back, and not have to rewrite it just to upgrade dependencies. reply azornathogron 6 hours agorootparentprev [–] A team of 1 volunteer would already be equivalent to the resources that Google puts into this particular project. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
