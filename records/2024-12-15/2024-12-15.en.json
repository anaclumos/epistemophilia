Swiped: The School that Banned Smartphones airs this week on Channel 4 Swiped: The School that Banned Smartphones, hosted by Matt and Emma Willis, is based at The Stanway School in Colchester, and challenged a group of Year 8 pupils to give up their smartphones completely for 21 days. The experiment, led by Professor Lisa Henderson and Dr Emma Sullivan from the University, saw pupils undergo a series of tests, with experts monitoring their behavioural changes throughout the period, and repeating the tests at the end of the three weeks to conclude what effects giving up your phone really does have on your brain including sleep, wellbeing and cognition. They found that students in the phone ban group experienced notable improvements in their sleep. On average, they were falling asleep 20 minutes faster than before the ban, and reported getting a full hour of extra rest each night. Mood boost Children in the phone ban group also went to bed on average, 50 minutes earlier during the phone ban weeks compared to the week before the phone ban, for example, bedtime was 10:12 pm one-week post ban, and 11:02 pm the week before the ban. These changes, which were self-reported, were also verified with sleep-tracking devices. Better sleep also appeared to coincide with a boost in mood. Pupils in the phone ban group reported a 17% reduction in feelings related to depression and an 18% reduction in feelings related to anxiety, feeling generally less upset and nervous. Pupils who slept better even showed changes in their heart rate that signalled improved well being. Positive impact Professor Lisa Henderson, from the University’s Department of Psychology, said: “This experiment incorporated a much longer abstinence period than previous studies, allowing us to see how a smartphone ban in school could impact on sleep, wellbeing, cognitive abilities, and alertness. “The results showed that a smartphone ban in children under the age of 14 could have a positive impact on sleep, and connected to improved sleep, a boost in overall mood.” Interestingly, the research didn’t show significant improvements in cognitive ability; the phone ban group showed a modest 3% boost in working memory, and there were no improvements in sustained attention. Researchers suggest that these results might mean that changes in cognitive ability could take longer than the study period of 21 days to materialise. Policy decisions Dr Emma Sullivan, from the University’s Department of Psychology, said: “Our results come at an important time when government ministers in the UK are thinking about the impact of smartphones on young people, and when other parts of the world, such as Australia, are introducing a social media ban for under 16s. “Evidence gathering is crucial to make these big decisions that impact on the lives of young people, and whilst more work is needed on this, these first sets of results are an interesting start to begin to have these better informed conversations.” Swiped: The School that Banned Smartphones starts at 8pm, Wednesday, 11 December, on Channel 4.

    "commentBody": "School smartphone ban results in better sleep and improved mood: study (york.ac.uk)889 points by jonatron 19 hours agohidepastfavorite568 comments KaiserPro 2 hours agoDisclosure: I work for a social media company. However I live in the UK. Most schools in the UK ban phones in school. The difference here is that in this study phones were taken away for 21 days, even after school. They lost access to the phone completely during that time. I am less convinced that we should wholesale ban phones for kids, because in the UK at least, there is no longer any culture of letting kids go out and socialise. We need to provide spaces for kids to be kids, and safe. However I do think social media use should be severely restricted, unfiltered video being zapped into young minds is not the way to build a cohesive society. tiktok/reels/youtube should probably be editorialised so that we can avoid the stupid, bullying and dangerous stuff being spread by arseholes. Furthermore I think phone use should be time limited by default. That is, the default is that the phone stops all notifications after 20:00 apart from things like parents. I have two kids, and I despair at other parents who think its fine to allow their 10/11 year olds to start group video calls at >20:30. Or the ones who let their kids bully on the class whatsapp. Part of this is education, most of it is tech companies wanting to make money from kids (including mine.) reply logifail 16 minutes agoparent> We need to provide spaces for kids to be kids, and safe. That sounds as though you believe spaces such as these no longer exist? (Full disclosure: have three kids, don't track their location, don't believe they are \"unsafe\" going to play outside) reply novaRom 45 minutes agoparentprev> stops all notifications after 20:00 Better to stop absolutely all notifications. When I need to know if someone of my friends is asking something I can open a chat app and check. If something is urgent then just a phone call. The amount of distractions is enormous, thus disabling it by law might be more effective solution, otherwise intellectual decline/underdevelopment of the future society is predetermined. reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 41 minutes agoparentprev> there is no longer any culture of letting kids go out and socialise. Could this have died due to tech? reply interludead 57 minutes agoparentprevI agree, we need to regulate tech more thoughtfully, yet we also need to rebuild a culture that allows kids to connect reply quotemstr 2 hours agoparentprevWho gets to decide which messages teens get to expose themselves to? You? Why? We've had ten years of outrageous censorship. No nore, even for kids. reply mateus1 42 minutes agorootparentThe idea that parent control is censorship is very funny. Kid’s brains shouldn’t be exposed to addictive and exploitative content. reply causality0 1 hour agorootparentprevI had unfiltered internet access from around the age of ten onwards. I can confidently say that was a horrible idea and I would have been much better off as a person without it. reply 4ggr0 47 minutes agorootparenti think about this a lot as someone who had unfiltered access to the internet since being a kid around 2010. on the one hand i learned to understand english as a young boy, on my own, without realizing. on the other hand i've seen videos of beheadings, terrorist acts, violent accidents, war crimes and many more, lovely things. that being said...still not sure if it's a net-negative. feels positive to me, just not without there being negative aspects. reply __turbobrew__ 6 minutes agorootparentSame. Im not sure if growing up watching liveleak and browsing 4chan made me a better or worse person. I think the real effect on my life is that I was addicted to the internet and video games and didn’t socialize enough. My life turned out good, I’m married and have a decent life, but I think I missed out a lot in my university years because I was playing counter strike instead of going out and socializing and making friends. I look back now at how much time I squandered (tens of thousands of hours) but I guess many people feel this way about their younger self. reply DirkH 22 minutes agorootparentprevI agree with you that it isn't necessarily net-negative. I cannot begin to tell you how much more respect and care I give to the road and cars after witnessing so many videos of how violently and suddenly car accidents can take a life. Many of the horrors of these videos are burnt into my mind and I am confident this is for the better. We live in the real world. It is important to see the real world as it is. There are if course mental health limits to this. I never want to be desensitized. But in moderation I think it can be net-positive. reply mixmastamyk 38 minutes agorootparentprevThank you. We always hear from the geek who only learned to program solely due to unfiltered internet access growing up. But not folks like you. I personally learned to program before widespread internet access, so know it’s not at all a requirement. reply rmbyrro 2 hours agorootparentprevsome types of content are indisputably disturbing for kids, like violence, war footage, sexualized content (esp. a sexualized female image targeting male kids & teens), etc reply gosub100 41 minutes agorootparentWe can recruit them to fight in a war, but it might be disturbing to show them what they signed up for. reply cma 44 minutes agorootparentprevSo outlaw Betty Boop and Jessica Rabbit?

This is why you don't have slot machines in most localities. The phone itself is just a computer. Using the phone to write, help with homework, or communicate doesn't seem to be the problem. It's the addictive gambling-like apps (TikTok, Instagram, ...) that what generate compulsive and disruptive behavior. reply logifail 19 minutes agoparent> The phone itself is just a computer. Using the phone to write, help with homework, or communicate doesn't seem to be the problem. If you want children to learn to be able to write, you have to get them to do it themselves. Not with a computer, not with a phone, not with ChatGPT, with a piece of paper and a pen(cil). They may not like this(!) reply madjam002 2 hours agoprevI find all of these bans quite interesting because when I was at school we would be figuring out how to circumvent the web filters and would be building apps to hide the games we had open on Miniclip when a teacher walked past. I think I kind of owe my software development career to these early days as that is what inspired me. We didn’t have smartphones when I was at school and I guess things weren’t as optimised to be so addictive but we did have Facebook and Bebo. reply O5vYtytb 2 hours agoparentI agree it's interesting. But back then (I'm 34) we only had desktop computers so the distraction time was limited. I remember being forced to take a typing class my senior year in HS, at which point I was already a very proficient typer. So I figured out how to hexedit the program save files and mark my exercises complete. I feel that the new era of phones and apps have two major drawbacks: 1. The always on distraction in your pocket and on your wrist. 2. The walled garden hardware and software that makes it nearly impossible to tinker and gain a deeper understanding of the magic behind the screen. reply MoreMoore 1 hour agorootparentI had a T9 dumb phone because that's all that was available. Smartphones didn't exist yet. There was no reason to be on your phone the whole time, at most I might be distracted because I'd be texting a crush during class. I wouldn't be scrolling through social media - it didn't exist yet or what did exist wasn't accessible by phone. reply amluto 2 hours agoparentprevI think some of the difference may be the form factor. With traditional computers, the computer was in a specific place, and people would use a computer when they were at the computer. Then, when it was time to eat lunch or go to the bathroom or go to the next class, the computer was gone. On top of this, a real keyboard is much faster for typing, which means that less time is consumed merely transcribing one’s thoughts into text. reply awfulneutral 57 minutes agoparentprevI think about this a lot because I was the same, I couldn't stop messing around with computers and I owe my career to it. But if I was a kid today I'd probably just get caught up in the easy distractions and not learn to program. It's a very different environment now. reply tclancy 2 hours agoparentprevSure, but it’s not like kids are missing out on computer options and not every kid is going to be a developer. Any kid who wants to play with technology today has much more of an opportunity than ever before (in middle and upper class districts in the US in my experience). reply InkCanon 2 hours agoparentprevWhen I have kids (or if I ever run a school somehow), I would give my kids hackable, terminal devices that could connect to the internet with work. Both sides are doing it suboptimally. The anti smart phone crowds are suppressing kids natural desire to look for learning and new experiences outside of taking exams. The smart phone crowds underestimate the power of these multi billion dollar addiction engines. The optimal solution is to work with the children's natural curiosity and provide them a runway to growth. reply rmbyrro 2 hours agoparentprevsuch bans do work. one or a few will find ways to circumvent, but the vast majority will end up complying. our minds tend to fantasize a lot about our early days. our memories are flawed and what we remember now are full of gaps filled with fantasies that make us feel good. reply biztos 1 hour agoparentprevOn the one hand, I think \"Bad Thing banned for kids but the smart kids get around the ban\" is a pretty good state of affairs. On the other hand, I fear that the \"think of the children\" crowd will attach legal jeopardy that will mostly fall on the smart kids, their parents, and indie developers. reply card_zero 13 hours agoprev> Interestingly, the research didn’t show significant improvements in cognitive ability; the phone ban group showed a modest 3% boost in working memory, and there were no improvements in sustained attention. Researchers suggest that these results might mean that changes in cognitive ability could take longer than the study period of 21 days to materialise. Notice how they had decided beforehand what they were going to find out, and are making an excuse here for not finding part of it. reply jader201 13 hours agoparentI’m not a scientist in this field, but I would have been very surprised to have seen a difference in cognitive ability this quickly. I’ve always felt that we wouldn’t recover from the negative impacts of phone addiction very quickly, if ever, after several years of addiction to doom scrolling, social media feeds, and the short bursts of 10-second videos. I wish more real research in this field was being done, so that we could have some solid evidence — and proper warnings against — the negative impacts of phone addiction. Until then, kids — and their parents — are left with the unfortunate decision between phone addition, and social ostracism. reply llm_trw 12 hours agorootparentYou should read what Socrates has to say about book addicts. We need to burn more of them to raise awareness of just how pernicious the written word is. reply Jakob 6 hours agorootparentSocrates says that profound knowledge is gained through interaction. He compares the written word to a painting, meaning it can be analysed but it doesn’t respond to questions and is therefore not a substitute for dialog. This mirrors the critique to phones: used primarily to passively watch “paintings” instead of interacting. The viewer’s knowledge and critical thinking is improving only seemingly at best. reply 0xEF 5 hours agorootparentEven Socrates could tell when the consumer has become the product, so I guess this is not a new problem. I wonder if there is some sort of solipsistic voice within us that recognizes when too much exposure or connectivity to other people becomes overwhelming in a way that we lose ourselves in it. I grew up and remember the times before everyone had easy access to the Internet in their homes, let alone on a high-powered terminal that now fits in our pockets. Those of us of a certain age remember a shift in social interaction that rivaled the previous generations telling mine we consumed too much tv (the 24/7 news cycle was a terrible idea for my generation, in retrospect). On the one hand, kids don't need their smartphones in schools because mine did just fine without them. On the other hand, the smartphones can be used for a force of good, provided those \"paintings\" they are looking at are enriching their learning and growth in some way, setting them up to ask better questions when engaged in the Socratic dialogue. But how do we guide usage toward that aim? That is the real question we should be asking. reply lilbonaparte 5 hours agorootparentprevDo you have a link to this. I’m interested in reading more? reply wholinator2 4 hours agorootparentprevSure, maybe in his time he was right. Maybe he wasn't. But i think if you go ask parents of grade/middle/high schoolers they'd cry with joy if their children were just addicted to reading. It's fully possible that going from only ever interacting in the real world with people to sitting alone reading all day caused some problems with integration. It's also entirely possible that phones do a different kind of thing by not just dampening real world interactions, but effectively siphoning out your attention span as well (have you never felt this? Do you scroll on any of the infinite feed bullshit? If you think it doesn't obliterate your attention span, spend the first hour of every day watching tiktok and then tell me how easy it is to start work). We all know that attention span is _required_ to get anything done academically, so directly correlated to intelligence, or at least the ability to get anything done at all. We all know that children are building their brains, and that significant experiences in childhood impact the view and life of the person far into adulthood. Ergo, do you really thing that being unable to read a single paragraph about Socrates for the future of... the world? I simply cannot understand the pushback to such a simple and effective policy. Sure, the researchers probably have a bias. All schools aren't being made to do this, many schools implementing this are _choosing_ to, because _they_ interact with our children academically and know that the grade school generation is gonna eat rocks on any college level task because they can't stop looking at their phones, something which is easy to observe many children are _physically incapable of doing_. Sure, maybe it's a really good time for impossibly motivated and unsocial children, i was one of them, and i can tell you that even having not grown up with it, i (almost 30) am having a hell of a time balancing needing to have snapchat to stay in contact with friends i moved away from, and getting trapped in the continuous feed the app seems to insert into more and more places. About using reddit as a scholarly resource for any question google won't help with and getting trapped in their endless feed. I know it's bad, and I'm a fully grown adult member of society, and i didn't grow up with it. And i'll tell you, i'd trade this phone shit for a book addiction in a microsecond. What you're advocating for is a future where average attention span continuously decreases. Why do you want that? Why are you against the idea that phone might be fucking bad for us, and especially so for children? What experiences have you had with phone addiction in yourself and loved ones that gives you credibility in this topic? Genuinely asking reply bluGill 4 hours agorootparentMy kids are addicted to reading and I don't like it. Reading is great but not at the expense of staying up until 3am on a school night, not helping with basic household chores, not practicing music, not doing homework. reply warner25 1 hour agorootparentI feel this. When I envisioned having kids, I never envisioned having to tell them a dozen times per day to \"put the book away!\" I accept that it's a relatively good problem to have, but there are absolutely inappropriate times and places to be looking at a book for pleasure, absorbed to the point of losing track of time and not hearing any directions given. reply Liquix 12 hours agorootparentprev> left with the unfortunate decision between phone addition, and social ostracism. This line of thinking perpetuates the problem. More people getting addicted does not mean addiction is a prerequisite to live a full life. It's never been more important to aggressively curtail phone use – and make unpopular decisions that your kids will thank you for later – than it is now. reply jader201 12 hours agorootparentI’m not sure if you have kids, but I’m not sure making the choice to ostracize your kids is one they’d thank you for later. And, certainly not all kids would. It very much depends on the kid / the impact said ostracism would have. reply acron0 7 hours agorootparentThis is why it needs implementing systemically, and not ad hoc. If no one has social media, no one is being ostracised. If only one person opts out then yes, they risk being ostracised. reply jader201 2 hours agorootparent100% agreed, which was my point above about studies being done to prove the negative impacts, so everyone could actually get on board, instead of it being done ad hoc. It took public shaming to start to reduce addiction to cigarettes, after we were able to show how bad they were for you. reply ANewFormation 6 hours agorootparentprevThe ostracization is a strawman. A few good friends (or even just one) is, imo, going to provide far more fulfillment than a million digital friends. And when living in an appropriate place to raise children (playgrounds, etc near housing) it's super easy to meet other parents. And, in my experience at least, a rather large percent are also against 'digitizing' their kids. Making friends the old fashioned way, and not just for your children. reply sahmeepee 5 hours agorootparentI don't think you have the appropriate context here. This isn't about \"good\" (in person?) friends vs digital friends known only online. This is about schoolkids who almost all have smartphones losing a channel of communication with their schoolmates and thus being excluded from much of what goes on in the social group outside of school. I have a child around this age and can absolutely see the issue, but I think it's less about phones per se and more about messaging apps and/or social media. For us, banning the phone itself wouldn't have these effects because we impose suitable restrictions on use as well as having put effort into educating our kids on healthy behaviours. There are a small number of kids in the year group with \"nokias\" (non-smart phones) and they aren't looked down on or deliberately excluded by others, but they might feel they are missing out on something. As the kids get older and more independent their needs for communication tools will surely grow, but not so much social media. reply wholinator2 4 hours agorootparentYes, the two kids in grade school who's parents wouldn't let them watch SpongeBob felt some exclusions from the lunch table discussion as well. The social aspect is extremely difficult to solve, and the app makers know this and accentuate it. They are shrewd businesspeople who's only goal is a functioning app that brings in more money than last year, hopefully on an exponential curve. This social exclusion aspect is why Facebook is still there, plodding along. They've effectively trapped the last groups of people there, and they raise the wall faster than the stragglers can climb. I'm currently trapped in snapchat as the only way to stay in touch with my old dnd group for when i come around. But those people are actually my best friends, so i speak to them more often, and i will be decompiling the APK and gutting the engagement shit with a rusty saw the moment i have time. It's crazy there's people here defending these companies. reply jensensbutton 6 hours agorootparentprev> And when living in an appropriate place to raise children (playgrounds, etc near housing) it's super easy to meet other parents. Ah, so this yet another aspect of health that one needs a certain amount of money to enjoy. reply FollowingTheDao 6 hours agorootparentprevKnowing a few alcoholics this is part of the problem with addiction. You make friends with other addicts, and those bonds are broken when you have to quit. The social aspect has to be addressed or the addiction is harder to quit. So I agree with you, but the social isolation is an important factor in keeping people off the phone. Also, I am finding that younger folk do not know how to interact with people IRL. I am faced with fear, uncertainty, shyness, anxiety...and all of these issues were created by the phone use as well. It is a very complex issue to solve. reply maccard 9 hours agorootparentprev> I would have been very surprised to have seen a difference in cognitive ability this quickly Sleep deprivation is really, really bad for you. Here [0] is one example that tries to measure reaction times compared to drinking (in the context of driving). Being tired is pretty much being drunk. Here [1] is another on cognitive activity. It’s not surprising to me in the slightest (anecdotally, I suffer from bouts of insomnia and my behaviour, mood and cognitive performance in work is definitely lower during those times. Even a single nights sleep shows a huge change in my mood INE) that if reducing smartphone usage they get more sleep that they pretty much immediately saw improvements. [0] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32571274/ [1] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23029352/ reply nverno 2 hours agorootparentAnectdotally, I've also been getting in a bad habit of staying up 2-3 days and agree there are similarities to being drunk - certainly in terms of cognitive ability and reflexes - but I even experience similar loss of inhibition (although not in nearly as fun a way). The first serious cognitive effect I've encountered is struggling to find a word I'm searching for (or recalling a person's name) in conversation. On the third day, I also start having significant vision impairment, reminiscent of hallucinogenic effects, where objects seem to be swaying slightly when I focus on them. It also quite apparent to me that it is much harder to retain information learned after being up for a day or two. reply Tenoke 7 hours agorootparentprevDriving performance after 24+ hours of being awake is pretty irrelevant to phones (even if they cause you to sleep less they don't cause you to not sleep at all), and it's just some brief effect with no reason to think otherwise from looking at this. reply djtango 6 hours agorootparentprevI think I had focus issues probably coming from playing too much videogames when I was young and it took 2-3 years to fully reset and achieve a real level of focus. I was able to compound that when I didn't have a proper smart phone for about another 2 years. Since getting a real phone its all been downhill again reply rrr_oh_man 12 hours agorootparentprev> I’m not a scientist in this field, but I would have been very surprised to have seen a difference in cognitive ability this quickly. Not sure. I worked with a science team that had found very strong cognitive improvements in the short term (~2 weeks) after improving sleep quality. Though, study participants were mostly middle aged and elderly. reply IshKebab 11 hours agorootparentThat seems plausible though. I have small kids and hence bad sleep often and when I'm very tired I often have to put off difficult programming tasks for another day and just do refactoring or whatever. I think it's entirely expected that it's harder to think clearly when you're really tired. Is it harder to think clearly because you've just been watching shorts/reels for an hour? Absolutely not. It's an addictive waste of time, sure. But trying to claim some kind of cognitive impairment is just this generation's \"X rots your brains\" (where X has been TV and then video games). reply wholinator2 4 hours agorootparentHave you watched the infinite scroll much? Because my direct experience says you're wrong. Probably you can't really recreated the teenage phone experience even if you wanted to. What you need is: 1) a large enough group of actual close friends to use some social media app, so that by deleting that app you are removing a large part of your social life 2) those apps to continuously add infinite scroll, ad driven, engagement trap shit into every single aspect of the entire app. Imagine if your work messages came through tiktok and by pressing back you were instantly dropped into an infinite scroll feed curated to your interests. Or say, slack gets bought and becomes an ad driven company who's only metric is increased time in app. But! Then your work refuses to change apps! So as you watch the app slowly become an attention pit, you are completely prevented from escaping it. I don't think a lot of you old fogies really understand what the apps are like these days, or what teenage social life is like without the apps. The fact that you're claiming that it's not harder to read an uninteresting paragraph after watching an infinite feed tells me you, luckily, have the privilege of not being tethered to these apps. You have the privilege to exist in a world where your social life isn't governed by ad revenue. Because i grew up at the very start of all this, and some of my friends still use some of the apps, and everything that's \"common knowledge\" about phones and attention spans is true. The phone itself is fine, but i do think that the infinite scroll is just about the most dangerous device on the planet, barring the obvious ones. This just reads like a thread about preventing teenagers from starting smoking, being filled with older people saying \"why would you do that? Quitting smoking isn't hard, i smoked a pack once and was fine. And besides, smoking a cigarette or two doesn't hurt anyone, I'm fine\". reply IshKebab 1 hour agorootparentYes I watch a lot of YouTube shorts. It's addictive and a waste of time but I don't find it affects my cognitive ability at all. In fact it's mostly the other way around. I watch them when I'm too exhausted to do something productive (which is often unfortunately). reply jader201 12 hours agorootparentprevI feel like sleep quality and phone addiction are very different, even if somewhat connected. I would agree, though, that improving sleep quality would definitely improve cognitive function. But removing phones would only help if it’s degrading sleep. If phone addiction has no impact on sleep (e.g. the parents still enforce regular bedtimes), then I would not expect that much, if any, cognitive improvement. Not quickly, anyway. Either way, these two need to be studied independently to know for sure. reply sahmeepee 5 hours agorootparentI agree that this study didn't separate the two very well, but it's a difficult task to be fair. They found that the kids' bed times were far earlier without phones, but was that a short term effect? Was it an effect of being observed and measured? If the parents valued their kids' sleep, why was the average bed time of 12 year old kids after 11pm pre-ban? You could blame that lack of sleep on phones if it made you feel better I suppose, but it's clearly not the whole story. reply jrtageh 5 hours agorootparentprevI'm not surprised to see cognitive ability rise quickly. When I ditch the computer for two days and use pencil and paper, my math abilities rise sharply. reply Aerroon 11 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps the real research doesn't find these bombastic results that \"everyone knows are true\"? The 'researchers' in the article had a conclusion, the experiment didn't agree with it and then thought of excuses as to why. >Until then, kids — and their parents — are left with the unfortunate decision between phone addition, and social ostracism. Even this just presumes it's all negative. Why? reply lugu 7 hours agoparentprevWhat is wrong with that? Isn't it how science works: you make an hypothesis and test it. reply Xelbair 6 hours agorootparentbut you conform to the experimental results. you can suggest further experimentation to prove another point, but this is different from assuming a priori that effect WILL happen. The issue is not in the idea itself, but how it is phrased. reply bilbo0s 6 hours agorootparentThey did suggest a new experiment, one lasting longer than 21 days to test their hypothesis. Hypothesis -> proposed experiment -> results -> questions evoked by results -> new hypothesis -> new proposed experiment MOST importantly, they didn’t fake any results and went where the data took them. This is the kind of science that has been falling out of fashion for the last few decades in favor of researchers who work based on other principles. reply subroutine 6 hours agorootparentThey could have included the obvious (but probably unwanted) alternative hypothesis: Researchers suggest that these results might mean that changes in cognitive ability could take longer than the study period of 21 days to materialize, or access to devices has a positive effect on attention offsetting the effects of sleep on attention. It's probably unlikely but it is an obvious possibility. reply sourcepluck 3 hours agorootparentOR - crazy hypothesis - maybe they're familiar with the large amounts of research that already exists which shows that access to devices has a negative effect on attention. Just maybe. reply bilbo0s 6 hours agorootparentprevSo is the possibility that attention is an emergent genetic trait. There are many, many alternative explanations. You are lamenting the exclusion of your preferred alternative explanation, but the researchers need to choose one and look further along that branch. The idea of open science is that other teams would be free to explore plausible alternative hypotheses. Some team might explore yours. Another might dig into my idea about the behavior’s relationship to genetics. And so on. This is the method by which we move ourselves forward. And it’s easy to see how that effort is hampered by the practice of data tampering and other shenanigans. Which this team did not engage in, even when part of there hypothesis wasn’t supported by their data. This team deserves a “Bravo!” reply bilbo0s 6 hours agorootparentprevI think so many people, even most here on HN, have forgotten how the scientific method works. reply FollowingTheDao 6 hours agorootparentAgree. I propose hypothesis here all the time and people will say \"Show me the study that proves what you are saying!\". For instance. It maybe that the distracting quality of the phone is not the only thing providing better sleep and mood, but maybe it is the collective power of the EMF radiation that is disturbing the children's catecholamines. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S13826... reply Ray20 5 hours agorootparentOr even banning phones makes schools (where the experiment is probably being conducted) less transparent, allowing more freely to pressure subjects (intentionally or not) to ensure the \"proper\" result of the experiment. reply bilbo0s 6 hours agorootparentprevOk. Design the experiment to test your hypothesis, and then present its results. The truth of it will be in the data. There is likely a way to test this hypothesis on human children in an ethical fashion. reply FollowingTheDao 3 hours agorootparentI already designed the experiment. I cannot get funding. Also: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2014/198609 \"They examined the acute as well as chronic effects of EMF exposure and found a significant increase in adrenaline and noradrenaline levels after EMF exposure, following a drop, but the normal levels were not restored even at the end of the study (about one and a half year). They also observed significant diminution in dopamine levels.\" reply riedel 11 hours agoparentprevThis typically good science. You have hypothesis and test it, rather than doing an intervention and reporting every random thing that happened. Although I agree in this case, the alternative hypothesis seems a bit lame, rather than adopting the null hypothesis. On the other hand I guess that more sleep could have some effect on cognitive development in the long run. reply IshKebab 10 hours agorootparentYes but their conclusion is \"well our hypothesis is probably still right, we just didn't look hard enough\" rather than \"maybe it doesn't have a significant effect\". reply TOMDM 7 hours agorootparentWell yes, that's just decent Bayesian rigor. Previous studies have set a prior of x% confidence, you see evidence to the contrary, you update to some x-y%. Given the volume of research on sleep, it probably takes more evidence, even if it's your own study to throw that out. reply IshKebab 5 hours agorootparentAre there previous studies that have shown smartphone use impairs cognitive ability? reply II2II 6 hours agorootparentprevYou can look at that statement in a couple of different ways. Yes, experimental bias is one of them. The other is saying: we didn't see this effect, so we need to do longer term studies to see if it does exist. Regardless, that statement is a good thing. It acknowledges a social bias towards the effect of smartphones. It doesn't give room for people to imply a result based upon that bias. On the surface, at least, it doesn't indicate that data was fudged to reach a particular result. reply n8henrie 4 hours agorootparentprev\"Might mean\" is a far cry from \"our hypothesis is probably still right.\" This type of speculation is commonplace -- even expected -- in the discussion section of an article.

You have a conjecture, you test it, and then you say \"looks like reality didn't match our conjecture, the conjecture must be wrong.\" Except here they got a negative result and said \"reality must be wrong\". It's a determined effort to find specific results. reply sicariusnoctis 6 hours agorootparentThey didn't say \"reality must be wrong\". They said that their initial hypothesis (that significant changes would be observed after 21 days) is probably wrong, so they implicitly proposed a second hypothesis (that significant changes occur after e.g. a few months). None of this is remotely contemptible. Pretend you're an immortal alien conducting a study with the hypothesis, \"humans are mortal\". You observe that your subjects do not die after 21 days. Do you conclude that humans are immortal? (I hope not. It's much better to conclude that humans don't usually die after 21 days in this particular instance of extraterrestrial captivity.) reply card_zero 4 hours agorootparentOK, fine, they didn't literally say \"reality must be wrong\", they just thought it, probably. The attitude stinks. And I say it is remotely contemptible. Perhaps I'd go as far as to say moderately contemptible. It's a fair point about the aliens. They are presumably mortal themselves, they have expectations about lifespan. Something about the mind not being a blank slate, it's hypotheses all the way down, can't escape preconceived ideas. Sure. Except you can try. You can be more impartial than you otherwise might be, when you're aware that there's something to be partial about. In the case of smartphone bans, the viewpoint is almost politicized, like whether you're down with the tech bros or think they're evil. Researchers should know that, and thus should be very coldly objective. Here they expect the degradation of mental function, why? That's not something well-understood like mortality. It's probably something there's a great wobbly mass of very questionable psychological research about - low attention in school and degraded working memory due to what they may well call \"screentime\" - and they've just gone along with it like it's established. Why is known evil thing not acting sufficiently evil to meet our narrative? Must do more research until true. Another sketchy part of doing this research is the subtext that smartphones lower the mood entails therefore ban smartphones in schools. That isn't a science-based decision, it's a decision to trample on the kids' rights for their own good: science can't guide moral choices. But the only reason to scientifically establish the first part, the fact, is for the purpose of advocating a ban. reply supersrdjan 7 hours agorootparentprevAren't in this case they saying that their experiment might have been the wrong one, and that next time they have to do a different kind of test that takes a longer time span into consideration? They acknowledge the result that no changes in cognitive abilities take place within 21 days, and then from there make the next conjecture that such changes might happen later, which would require a different kind of test? reply 8note 10 hours agorootparentprevthats also a part of the scientific method. you dont believe the results you get, so you keep designing an collecting data from more experiments until you cant deny it anymore reply eimrine 12 hours agorootparentprev> You have a conjecture, you test it, and then you say \"looks like reality didn't match our conjecture, the conjecture must be wrong.\" The time is also the part of the conjecture. reply drawkward 6 hours agorootparentprevScience denialism will send us back to tbe dark ages. reply card_zero 4 hours agorootparentYou'd better not do any, then. Were you thinking of it? reply n8henrie 4 hours agorootparentprevNot at all. Type II error is routinely the result of methodological flaws like insufficient sample size. It would be asinine to study the effects of parachutes on survivability of jumping from airplanes, hypothesizing that they would help, but conclude that the \"conjecture must be wrong\" because the sample size was 2 and it failed to reach statistical significance, or because the airplane was on the ground. Would you feel differently if the study period was only 1 day instead of 25? Or maybe 1 hour? Would it then be reasonable for them to speculate that the methodology might contribute to the failure to reject the null hypothesis? reply n8henrie 2 hours agorootparentTypo: 21 reply 0xRusty 13 hours agorootparentprevYou start with a hypothesis and then you test it. reply card_zero 12 hours agorootparentAnd then you find it was wrong, and you keep it, and make protestations. reply dijksterhuis 12 hours agorootparentthey found it was invalid in the short term, for this particular study. the long term is still an open question. which is why they’re pointing that out. saying “we thought this would happen, it didn’t, but maybe there’s just something to do with our study that meant we disnt see the result that confirms our hypothesis” is a perfectly valid conclusion. reply ChrisLTD 5 hours agorootparentprevI’d humbly suggest “protestation” isn’t the right word here reply rrr_oh_man 12 hours agorootparentprevI’ve seen the same thing in many A/B tests reply jpace121 4 hours agoparentprevThat’s a very uncharitable interpretation of what they wrote, and goes outside of how what they wrote is supposed to be interpreted.

Maybe a 3% boost in working memory has compounding effects over time as well. You can't commit to long term memory what you can't keep in working memory long enough. You can't think about complex things if you don't have the working memory capacity. If you always have 3% more working memory you might accumulate more knowledge after a while.

Maybe instead of banning kids from using phones, they should consider banning companies from making their apps addictive on purpose. reply Levitating 4 hours agoparentObviously it's the apps. If you would give all kids phones that could only call and play snake they wouldn't be so engaged with it all the time. Most modern social media apps are now redesigned to allow for endless doomscrolling. YouTube, TikTok, Instagram all allow to scroll through content fed to you by an algorithm without even being able to preview the next video. It just slams it in your face. It's extremely addictive and imo harmful. It ruins attention spans, it ruins social development and it causes insecurities. I am in favor of banning smartphones in schools. I have seen what these apps do to people only a few years younger than me and it's just depressing. reply warner25 1 hour agorootparentWell, I think it's the combination of the apps as you described with the devices to connect to them always being within arms reach. Take away either one (or take away the unlimited, always-on network access, like I have a 500 MB per month data plan) and I think we're having a very different conversation. > seen what these apps do to people only a few years younger than me and it's just depressing I'll make the obligatory point that the situation seems not much better for older people (Millennials, Boomers, etc.) who are also consuming a shocking amount of video on their phones throughout the day, to the point of it being anti-social. reply d4rti 5 hours agoparentprevBanning phones is the practical policy.

Without that data it would be impossible to fine tune the apps to be addictive for each individual. Just with that, it'd probably tackle most of the \"device addiction\".

There will always be an exception because I need to look up something really badly and once the exception is done it is over. Restricting certain sites?

For one thing, reading on a phone is harder and leads to worse retention. The content you consume is likely to be shorter and less intellectually valuable. Maybe more importantly, doing anything on a phone seems to encourage a shorter attention span and switching over to other activities, such as tapping useless notifications and doomscrolling your way into anger, unhappiness, depression, anxiety etc. all generated by content that was designed for mobile users. Books don't do this. I had a feeling someone might pick on the gaming reference here, but what I am saying is that hours of doomscrolling have been replaced by a mix of a half dozen activities, all of which I enjoy more than doomscrolling, and many of which are more useful. reply mattlondon 11 hours agorootparentWhy would reading on a phone be any less intellectually valuable? A book is a book regardless. Just uninstall the social apps and/or turn off notifications if you are easily distracted. It's not rocket science (which incidentally you can learn on a phone if you wanted) reply safety1st 2 hours agorootparentI am actually surprised that this is not self-evident, I figured everyone knew it, but upon reflection I suppose not. So we have a bunch of data that points to these conclusions, since I'm not sure precisely what I'm trying to prove here, I'll start with what I consider some key insights - We know that attention spans are just massively shorter on phones than any other medium, the evidence from this comes from multiple disciplines and subjects - like pretty much any task you might do, when you do it on the phone you do it for a smaller period of time, on the web for example you always see higher bounce rates and shorter session times. Same with game/media engagement - When it comes to reading we have a fair amount of research showing that memory and retention seem to suffer on screens in general, especially smaller screens; the gold standard is still reading from paper, and then handwriting notes about what you read - It follows from the various above points that you're going to struggle to read and digest long, complex texts on a phone more than you would on a larger screen or in a paper book. And sure enough the type of behavior we see on phones is the consumption of bite-size content where it's difficult to express much in the way of complexity. reply hanifc 9 hours agorootparentprevRecently, the writing-by-hand vs typing debate has been getting some more press, with people saying that pen and paper leads to better retention while note taking.

Phones are wonderful objects full of possibility, but in this context they're objects of mass distractions. That's 99.9% of their reality. Nothing wrong with normalising them as such. Cocaine might be wonderfully productive for certain people, but that's not how it should be broadly discussed when we talk about its usage. reply aziaziazi 13 hours agorootparentprevI’m not a specialist but I think someone having in its hand the same device they do other activities on, may trigger some habits they have/had on that same device. That doesn’t refrain someone to be productive but not the easiest way. reply andai 7 hours agorootparentprevYeah, in my case the benefits were dramatic because I'm easily distracted and lose track of time. So I was like, I'm just going to eliminate all possible distractions. I found that very helpful. Another effect was that I started to become somewhat more productive during times when I did have access to my phone, or rather, more reluctant to start wasting time even if the option was easily available to me. reply eastbound 12 hours agorootparentprevBy do you ruminate negative thoughts? That’s my excuse for keeping my phone playing at night: I’m single, and despite being a successful professional and trying hard at dating when I was younger, my private life is full of bad experiences. I think about it and get angry. Youtube masks it. Yes I’ve seen psychologists but no, really, they try to où the blame on me but every time it’s the others who bullied me. Anyway — without a smartphone keeping your mind busy, how do you mask negative thoughts? reply safety1st 21 minutes agorootparentIt's possible that the discipline of psychology has something to offer you and you've simply seen a few bad psychologists. (There are plenty of them.) If you ruminate a lot I would look into cognitive behavioral therapy and its variants and think about how their principles can be incorporated into your ruminations. The TLDR of CBT is it involves analyzing your negative thoughts critically, rationally and systematically in writing. Often when we do that the thoughts lose their emotional hold on us, even if some of them are true. Avoiding may be better than ruminating, but processing is better than both. I spent way too much of my life thinking that ruminating was worthwhile on its own and eventually realized it is not unless you structure it narrowly and productively. reply jonathanlydall 8 hours agorootparentprevI’m sorry to hear that your past life experiences haunt you, but I’m also glad to hear that you’ve done well professionally for yourself despite that. I can’t pretend to truly know your situation and realize you may have received similar advice already, but in case you haven’t or someone else reads this who feels similarly, here is some anyway. Firstly, keep in mind this advice also applies inside the work place, for example think of having lost a client as someone who was largely responsible for preventing that from happening. When something bad happens, we can have one of two mindsets about it, a victim mindset or alternatively a mindset of “how can I improve myself from this experience?”. The key thing to understand is that the victim mindset is disempowering, that you’re resigning yourself to be helpless to stop it happening again, while the other mindset allows you to potentially be stronger and more capable for the future. So when something bad happens, it’s necessary to reflect on what happened, and it’s okay to acknowledge that the circumstances were largely beyond your control, but you must be sure to focus on what _you_ can change or control to try be in a better position for the future. And because the past can’t be changed (although not easily forgotten either), what you can change is what you choose to do about it going forward. This change in mindset is often something that takes time to acquire, so don’t expect it to just happen, but the important thing is to constantly reflect with the goal of continuously moving towards achieving it and one day you may find you have. I wish you the best of luck for the future. reply eastbound 6 hours agorootparentI have correct answers to all of your questions. How do I know they are correct? Well first of all science: They’re repeatable and produce reliably the same result. Second: Attitude: People go all ways when I spell them out, deny them, be bad-faithed, attack me, or nag me on superficial properties; but one thing they don’t do is provide an argument against it. It’s maybe usual to see people victimizing themselves in that society and that they’re so systematically wrong that “Take responsibility” is good advice. However, I’m a white male who dwelled into work and got good results, and literal hate does exist against me. Of course, some people who were talented early enough did succeed to build a balanced life. I didn’t learned to date early enough, and when 25 years old came, girls went systematically batshit crazy when they saw that I didn’t know how to handle sex, so that I reached 40 without a single positive experience. It’s possible to recover with women when you get accepted in groups, but I’m a white male and I refuse to apologize for being white, because it’s been harassment all my life, and yes people are cunts, so no I won’t recover. reply shadowerm 8 hours agorootparentprevWhat worked for me is getting in really good physical shape and good physical conditioning. I can remember constantly thinking how much life sucked, no matter how good it actually was. Slowly, the negative thoughts just went away as my physical conditioning improved. reply andai 9 hours agorootparentprevMeditation helped me a lot. You can train yourself to notice when your mind is doing something unpleasant or unproductive. When you notice that, it typically just stops, and you wonder why you were even doing it in the first place. I'd recommend (ironically) an app for that, but the important part is that you practice every day, even if only for a few minutes. Alternatively, being too busy and/or social to spend any time thinking — I joked the other day that I had \"backdoored\" my way into enlightenment by simply having no time/energy to think. I didnt create that situation on purpose, both aspects are due to poverty (working two jobs and living in shared accomodations) but they've both had powerful unexpected benefits, to the point where I'm not much looking forward to getting my own place and going back to being alone all the time again. reply ArnoVW 9 hours agorootparentprevSometimes have the same issue (rumination). I listen to podcasts and youtube science, tech ans history videos (with non exiting voices and without music or other sounds) to block out thoughts. It works. I guess audiobooks should work too.

The trick is that yes, we need distraction from our shitty lives and it's very comfortable sinking into a zoomer routine to numb yourself BUT you can get the same level of distraction from saner occupations, as long as you still have some fire inside you (often in the form of spite and bitterness, which are much healthier than simple decay). Lift heavy objects and acquire mass, lose yourself in classic nerd crap (old school fantasy/SF novels, obscure music, do the Advent of Code in Lisp/ML/Forth/Prolog), solo hiking, drive fast, etc... embrace the loneliness and become someone better than the rabble, choose the path of the \"Wanderer above the Sea of Fog\", not that of the brainrotten goblin! I'm not saying that existential pain will cease, especially when being around people with a normal life full of joy that seems so unattainable, but it certainly makes you feel better in the long term. reply eastbound 6 hours agorootparentThank you, it’s true that hate and the idea of revenge kept me from committing suicide and were the path out from my darkest times. Maybe I’ve recovered more than I admit, because your vocabulary is what I used 3 years ago and I’m far from that now, just the addiction to Youtube remains, to covers the negative thoughts. There is still advice that I’ll use from your comment, and once again I love the vocabulary “Lift heavy objects and acquire mass”, which is typical from the meme world. You basically remind me of Jordan Peterson’s advice to stand up and do something, as soon as a lighter period of depression strucks. reply card_zero 13 hours agorootparentprevDamn, I should get my smartphone out of the bag and start using it, and develop a TikTok habit.

You're very lucky to have such immense latent productivity that was just waiting for the smartphone dam to burst. reply safety1st 12 hours agorootparentYou can choose not to believe me if you want. Yes, turning the phone off doubled my productivity. I can't imagine why you wouldn't believe this, if you've ever had coworkers, and observed them spending half their time on their phone at work. It's a distraction which hampers sustained attention and deeper thinking - as well as eats up actual minutes of time, some raw percentage of your work hours inevitably goes into garbage content on the phone instead. I find the people who are skeptical about the idea that the phone frustrates doing deeper thinking, are often the ones who have never done it. This is why they don't see the value in it. reply ArnoVW 9 hours agorootparentprevBeing interrupted by people at your desk is a known productivity issue. Why would phones be different ?

Productivity does go up if you don’t replace social media with other forms of entertainment. After a while one gets bored and starts doing more stuff, either work or hobbies reply andai 9 hours agorootparentprevYou can waste time without a phone and you can do programming fairly productively on a phone (I lived without a laptop for 6 months, did everything in Termux!). But there's a right tool for every job, and the phone is designed to steal your soul (attention), designed to encourage mindless consumption, and interrupt you as often as possible. This is part of a bigger principle I've noticed where I can rely on sheer willpower, or I can simply make a small change to my environment (e.g. move the phone to another room) and that's a much more efficient way to achieve the same result. It's partly about reducing the Temptation, and partly about setting a strong intention / setting a strong message to yourself. If you're serious about getting some real work done, then why are you even looking at your phone? Eventually you can get to the point where wasting time in any way starts to feel gross and you catch yourself more and more, but for most people it takes a bit of recalibration to get there. reply grecy 10 hours agorootparentprevWe have our wifi router on an old school power timer.

Never trust headlines, they are optimised for clicks, not accuracy.

Sort of like how people addicted to gambling would probably save a lot of money if they had just a little more will power. reply noduerme 14 hours agorootparentI too have had this sense of superiority about the negative outcomes of other people's addictive behavior. It's easy to blame people for not having willpower. But (and I say this as a former casino owner, former bartender, and someone who worked on early Facebook games trying to maximize engagement), even intelligent people with better than average self control are no match for the sophistication of systems that have been designed, studied, and iterated upon for the sole purpose of breaking down human self control. Looking at myself not being a degenerate gambler, drinker or social media user, I suspect it's only because I have first hand experience being on the other side of the table in all those cases. When people do congratulate themselves for their own willpower, they tend to have other issues and addictions which they hide from public view, and/or they are recovering. No one goes without being deceived in their lives. And teenagers with little experience are the easiest to deceive and to hook into addictive behaviors. reply nothrabannosir 13 hours agorootparentI think bawolff was being sarcastic reply szszrk 12 hours agorootparentWhich just shows that communicating through sarcasm brings more harm than benefit.

Thanks for making me question if sarcasm is actually a bad thing. I don’t agree off the bat but I’ve never seriously considered it. reply fifticon 10 hours agorootparentit is a risky gamble IMHO. (some) needy/vain people use it to 'prove' to themselves 'I am so close to person X that we understand each other so well that when I say the opposite they still understand me'. IE it's a bit like yanking a chain to prove it still holds. Problems with that.. people get tired of people continuing to yank chains for no good reason (cry wolf). And other people are busy with their own lines of thought and lives. So instead of the intended (wow we understand each other/so close!), 25% (* ) of the time instead the receiver thinks \"hmm he's probably in a bad mood today?!\" So, net effect is instead often to be viewed as grumpy moody. Famously, kids don't parse sarcasm well, neither at them or others. My grandfather, who was, in retrospect, actually rather cool, was viewed as semihostile by us kids, because he often phrased his terms of endearment sarcastically. Net result was that we thought he didn't like us much, merely tolerated us. That is what macho sarcasm got him. Now I am his age, with similarly bad habits. I guess my kids will end up sarcastic too.

I doubt the children (or even their parents for the most part) realized the extent of the impact. Now that they're aware they have the option to attempt to mitigate it if they so choose. Of course they might try and fail (second case) or consciously choose to tolerate the downsides for some perceived gain (third case). As to language choice, inertia can be a perfectly valid reason. I strongly prefer writing Scheme but I generally choose to work in other languages due to the surrounding ecosystems. Social pressure is a very fuzzy term that can refer to any number of things.

This phenomenon even extends to similar developmental phases in some other species.

I have friends and family who are teachers. As they tell, there’s an obvious bimodal distribution where some kids are going to bed at reasonable times and others are bragging about staying up to completely unreasonable hours.

You're just making it worse for human viewers reply pornel 3 hours agoparentprevIt the image is watermarked, you can't remove it that way. Watermarks easily survive uniform noise higher than humans can tolerate. Watermark data is typically stored redundantly in multiple locations and channels, so uniform noise mostly averages itself out, and cropping won't do much. Watermarks often add signal in a different color model than RGB and in a heavily transformed domain of the image, so you're not adding noise along the \"axis\" of watermark's signal. For similarity search, it also won't do much. Algorithms for this look for dozens of \"landmarks\", and then search for images that share a high percentage of them. The landmarks traditionally were high-contrast geometric features like corners, which wouldn't be affected by noise. Nowadays, landmarks can be whatever a neural network learns to pick when trained against typical deformations like compression and noise. reply soulofmischief 6 hours agoparentprevThis is not guaranteed to resist perceptual hashing. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_hashing reply diggan 7 hours agoparentprevClearly better than nothing, but how does it work with perceptual hashes? I gave it five minutes to try to get pHash to run locally but didn't manage to get any useful results from it, I was probably holding it wrong. reply rebeccaskinner 1 hour agorootparentI’ve been working with perceptual hashes a lot lately for a side project, and my experience is that they are extremely resilient to noise, re-encoding, resizing, and some changes in color (since most implementations desaturate the image). Mirroring and rotation can in theory defeat perceptual hashing, but it’s fast enough to compute that if you care you can easily hash horizontal and vertically mirrored versions at 1 degree increments of rotation to identify those cases. Affine transformations can easily defeat some perceptual hashing algorithms, but others are resistant to them. The big weakness is that most perceptive hashing algorithms aren’t content aware, so you can easily defeat them by adding or removing background objects that might not be noticed or considered meaningful by a human observer. reply bArray 4 hours agorootparentprevCould probably get one of the many repos up and running pretty quickly [1].

The picture was not meant to be unique. It seems to always end with such a paragraph, even for dumb photos of nothing really. “The photo's perspective is unique; it is taken from a very low angle, creating an unusual, almost childlike point of view. Another detail is that the photographer seems to have excellent timing as they captured the hand gesture at this precise moment. The lighting in the photo indicates it was taken during daytime, with the sun illuminating the scene beautifully. The contrast between the modern architecture of the building and the traditional costumes adds a rich cultural element to the photograph.” reply IshKebab 20 hours agoprevThis is just an ad for their photo service.

As an ex semi-pro photographer, one of the things I realized is that what makes photographs special to people, even family photographs, is the rarity of them.

Google Photos makes it a no-brainer to manage, which largely contributed to the size inflation (which is also why searching and indexing have become critical to us) PS: I declared bankruptcy on photo management a long time ago.

Perhaps more importantly, it only mentions the photos and videos themselves in relation to the advertising. Analyzing the photos (as per the demo in TFA) isn’t “advertising,” and neither is building a user profile. Then later on, when they use that user profile to allow others to advertise to the user—that’s not “using your photos or videos for advertising” either. Nor is it “selling your personal information to anyone,” since what they’re selling is access to you instead of selling specific personal dossiers. From where I’m sitting, that still seems to leave the door open to Google itself using what it gleans from your photos to build out your profile, use those insights across their whole company, and target ads at you. It also seems to leave the door open to selling “depersonalized” analyses to third parties, not to mention giving free access to whoever it might see fit (research groups, state actors,…), no? There’s also a big difference between “doesn’t” and “will never.” Once an analysis with value exists, it seems counter to the forces of nature and commerce for it not to find its way out eventually.

Somehow, neither Google, nor Microsoft, nor Samsung, nor (probably) any other big tech company, can usefully extract data from photos anymore.

The AI processing runs autonomously in such a way that you may start doubting whether it's happening at all! I assume that this is the vendors' workaround around GDPR and such in relevant jurisdictions, but this also makes face search/grouping nearly useless.

More likely they'd sell your photos to third parties who wouldn't make products out of them. Those third parties would just extract as much information as they could out of them and then use that data. You would never see it happening so you'd never know who to be angry at or when to be upset by it. That data would later be used to manipulate you, take more of your money, assign you into specific categories/castes, etc. but even if you were aware those things happened, you'd never be aware that facebook or your photo was a factor.

I posted some images that showed a well-known local landmark during a christmas fair event, as well as view of a close city. The model accurately described the architectural details of the landmark that could be inferred from the photo, mentioned that there seems to be some event going on and made some speculations about the city in the background - but purely from the photo it had of course no way of knowing which landmark, event and city it was looking at. I see this is slightly underestimating the amount of information you can extract from the photo: If you have a GIS database, it's not hard to know this stuff (or at least get a list of likely candidates) - and the kind of actors that this project is warning against very likely have one. Also I'd be interested to see if the model could combine the context and the details from the photo to make some interesting additional observations. reply modin 17 hours agoprevEnte looks like Immich[0] (which I self-host for myself and family) with e2ee.

Surveillance capitalism isn't really about ads. Increasingly that data is being used to impact your life offline. It influences how much companies charge you for their products and services. It determines what version of their policies companies will inform you of and hold you to. It determines very big things like whether or not you get a job offer or a rental agreement, but it's also being used to determine even small things like how long a company keeps you on hold when you call them. It's being used to make people suspects for crimes. It's being used against people in criminal trials and custody battles. It informs decisions on whether or not your health insurer covers your medical treatments. Activists and extremists use it to target and harass people they perceive as being their enemies. The data you hand over to companies is being used to build dossiers stuffed with inaccuracies and assumptions that will be used against you in countless ways yet you aren't even allowed to know who has it, what they're using it for, when they use it, or who they share it with. Nobody really cares about what ads they get shown when they use the internet so companies like to pretend that that's what their data collection is all about, and they absolutely do use it for marketing, but the truth is that digital marketing is a smokescreen for everything else that your data is being used for and will later be used for. reply BadHumans 20 hours agoparentprevFor most people, it is too taxing to be on guard 24/7 and they have other things going on in their life that are more pressing like paying rent.

He is sitting in what appears to be an office, indicated by the presence of boxes and what looks like a printer in the background. There is a landscape photograph on the wall behind him, showing what looks like trees and a field. The foreground is dominated by the man himself, while the background includes office supplies and a wall with a picture. The man appears to be middle-aged, with a serious expression. He has a goatee and glasses. His ethnicity and racial background are not readily apparent from the image. He appears to be of a middle-class socioeconomic status based on the office environment. He seems to be at work, possibly taking a selfie. The picture was taken on May 9th, 2007, at 9:14 AM, using a NIKON COOLPIX L12 camera. The man's glasses have a slight reflection, and this reflection shows part of his workspace and other objects. It is possible to make out the small print on the label of a box behind him. The lighting is relatively soft and comes from the front, as indicated by how it falls on his face. The focus is sharpest on the man, but the background is reasonably clear. Here's another... of me doing my best \"Some like it hot\" pose The photo shows a man standing on a city sidewalk. In the foreground, there is a man wearing khaki shorts and a gray t-shirt. The background includes older brick buildings, a street with traffic, and some trees. There's also a lamp post next to the man and a modern glass building in the distance. The overall setting appears to be an urban area, possibly in Chicago, given the architectural style of the buildings. The man in the image appears to be middle-aged, with a fair complexion. He seems happy, possibly amused, judging by his smile. He looks like he may be of Caucasian descent. His economic status is difficult to ascertain, but his attire suggests a middle-class lifestyle. The photo was taken on August 7, 2008, at 12:07 PM using a NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D40 camera. He appears to be simply standing on the sidewalk, perhaps taking a break or waiting for something. The man's watch shows a bit of wear suggesting regular use. There is a subtle reflection visible on the man's glasses that provides a small glimpse of the surroundings. The image quality indicates it was likely taken outdoors in bright sunlight. The shadows suggest the time of day, adding depth to the scene and providing an additional element of reality to the photo. Last, a photo of Chicago[3] The image is a nighttime shot of the Chicago skyline from across the lake. In the foreground, there's a dark, paved walkway with a few lights and what looks like a small building or structure near the water's edge. The background is dominated by the brightly lit cityscape of Chicago, with many skyscrapers and buildings of varying heights and architectural styles. The water reflects the city lights, creating a shimmering effect. The photo appears to have been taken by a lone photographer, judging by the lack of people in the foreground. The picture was taken on Saturday, November 20th, 2010, at around 10:32 AM using a NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D40 camera. No people are clearly visible, so there is no information about their characteristics or activities. The overall mood of the scene is serene and peaceful, with the city lights providing a sense of quiet vibrancy. The reflection of the city lights on the water isn't perfectly uniform, which is a subtle detail to notice, and the slight variations in the brightness of different buildings hint at differences in their energy consumption or lighting design. The darkness of the sky suggests a clear night with minimal light pollution, outside of the city itself. The overall lighting and composition create a breathtaking view of the Chicago skyline at night. Note that it didn't catch the inconsistency of being a night-time photograph, and supposedly being taken at 10:32 AM (likely the edit date) [1] https://www.flickr.com/photos/---mike---/52196125239/in/date...

In this case, as someone else pointed out below, this proof has unjustified assumptions in it (at least it assumes that b inf pi(n) ≠ pi(lim n->inf). For all finite n, it equals 4, and then at infinity it equals 3.1415... . There are ways to reformulate the above so that \"infinity\" isn't involved but this is the clearest way to think of it. It isn't much different than the Kronecker delta function delta(t), which is 1 at t=0 and 0 elsewhere. We have lim t->0 delta(t) ≠ delta(lim t->0 t). reply kleiba 4 hours agoparentprev> at least it assumes that ba. If b = a both sides are zero and the result is trivial.

How do you extend the visual proof? reply stephencanon 3 hours agorootparentprevThe purely geometric proof works just fine without the case analysis if you use the oriented area. reply im3w1l 4 hours agorootparentprevWith this additional justification I accept it, yes. But (imo) now you are doing algebra. And then you might as well prove it just by distributing the RHS of the original expression. reply dagss 1 hour agorootparentThis additional justification is so trivial it's just left out for brevity. In general a lot of statements are accepted even if not each and every detail is spelled out. reply FartyMcFarter 1 minute agorootparentIt's not trivial at all, especially when you consider that a and/or b could be negative numbers. davrosthedalek 1 hour agorootparentprevSorry, but no. First, \"just switch a and b\" is clearly wrong, and we had multiple people propose that (Without the adjustment of sign). So not that trivial, I would argue. At least not more trivial than the underlying equality one wants to prove in the first place. reply wrsh07 3 hours agorootparentprevIsn't this resorting to algebra to fix the visual proof? How do you fix it visually? reply bmacho 1 hour agorootparentYou do it 3 times, a=b, ab. .. now that I think about it, the \"visual proof\" only 'proves' the statement for a specific 'a' and 'b'. Probably there is a proof, that can handle all 'a' and 'b' pairs at once. reply olddustytrail 2 hours agorootparentprevTurn your monitor sideways? reply orangepanda 4 hours agoparentprevIt still holds if you’re not bothered by negative-area rectangles reply FartyMcFarter 4 hours agorootparentBut I definitely am bothered. A visual proof is supposed to appeal to our visual intuition - I don't know about you, but negative areas are not something that is visually intuitive to me. reply mithametacs 4 hours agorootparentIt seems like an elegant addition to the understanding. Maybe if you viewed an animation where `a` starts larger than `b`, and steps till it's smaller. Then you could see where the negativity happens. And seeing is nice. reply Out_of_Characte 4 hours agorootparentprevNegative area's can be the only practical solution. Imagine the worst case: a 10*10 room with a pillar in the middle. How would you calculate that? reply hansvm 1 hour agorootparentThe concept of negative area still feels like it'd get messy in a hurry. For a square pillar, the side lengths should be the same, suddenly giving you imaginary lengths just for the eventual area subtraction to work out. For a negative volume though, you need cubic roots of unity for the side lengths, throwing off your area calculations. Has anyone actually put together a system where the sort of concept you're describing is cohesive? reply mtizim 1 hour agorootparentYou're in for a nice trip, the concept is called Geometric Algebra: https://youtu.be/60z_hpEAtD8?si=HHs_9m0IJ43nfI3S (~50m video) TLDW: Yes, the concept is there, makes much more sense than a cross product (which is just an oriented area) and generalizes really nicely. Alternatively, read: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivector reply FartyMcFarter 4 hours agorootparentprevI don't see that as negative area. I see it as subtracting two areas. Both the room and the pillar have a positive area, none of them has negative lengths or areas. Kids learn subtraction before they learn negative numbers - once you learn negative numbers, you know that addition and subtraction are almost interchangeable, but this is not necessarily intuitive to begin with. reply ses1984 3 hours agorootparentSubtracting two areas is like adding two areas where one is negative…right? reply FartyMcFarter 3 hours agorootparentYes , but see my second paragraph. Just because something is true it doesn't mean it's intuitive. reply trimethylpurine 2 hours agorootparentThat's interesting. To me it seems intuitive. It's a real area that can be drawn like any other. The sign is an operator describing what function to visualize, not a property of the measured area. So thinking of it in that way eliminates any need for the term \"negative area.\" But, intuition is subjective, so you may need to adjust the terminology to fit the visualization. reply FartyMcFarter 2 hours agorootparentIt is intuitive on some higher level, now that I know about signs, operators, negative numbers and all that. But when talking about visual information (i.e. \"visual proof\"), it isn't intuitive in that context. In addition to that, for all I know there could be some pitfalls involved with negative areas which I'm not aware of. Even if there aren't any pitfalls, this isn't immediately obvious to someone who isn't familiar with the concept of negative area. If I'm willing (or forced) to think in such abstract terms, I would much prefer an algebraic proof to this visual proof. reply ses1984 1 hour agorootparentYour intuition is irrelevant if they’re mathematically equivalent. reply thaumasiotes 46 minutes agorootparentprevIf you're bothered by the idea of negative-area rectangles, there's no need to justify the assumption that b b again. Even though you might think there are two cases that we need to look at because we're using two letters, there's actually only on case to demonstrate because we're demonstrating a property of the inequality. The only \"but what if...\" would be if a=b, which has no geometric proof, but also doesn't need one because \"zero = zero times anything\" is (by definition) true for fields. reply davrosthedalek 1 hour agorootparentThe problem is not symmetric between a and b (because a-b isn't). You cannot swap them. (And even if, this swapping is not part of the \"proof\", so in any case the proof is incomplete.) reply konschubert 3 hours agoprevHere is a visual proof for the Pythagorean theorem: https://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/proj/pf2html/proofs/pythagoras... I find this much more \"useful\" since the Pythagorean theorem isn't immediately intuitive to me. As for the proof in the original post, it seems really redundant to me. it follows from a (b+c) = ab + ac. And while building intuition for this distributive property of multiplication is extremely essential when teaching maths, I feel that the intuition for why this is true is better built without leaning on geometry. reply littlestymaar 1 hour agoparentI don't feel like it's more redundant that Pythagorean theorem though, as we can say that the later directly follows from the definition of dot product… reply nuancebydefault 57 minutes agorootparentSo you prove something in the 2d space via a 3d space intermezzo? Not very intuitive to me.

Someone who was thinking about a problem and drawing something would always with a drawing like that either intend the angle to be the same, or otherwise highlight the fact that one triangles is 8/3 and the other is 5/2 so that the slope is obviously not the same. Good visual proofs simply use lines and figures to talk about actual algebra instead of symbols; but every outcome is still in a sense algebraic -- like the one linked and the popular about Pythagoras. Once you pull our your ruler and measure you are obviously lost. Every result should be algebraic, not visual, but it's fine to express the algebra in figures instead of letters. reply gklitz 1 hour agoparentprevWhat do you mean “end up believing” are you insinuating that the shown example isn’t true? It very much is true. The reason it’s true might initially be confusion to you as a viewer because you have a difficult time telling the difference between 3/8 and 2/5 and assume the triangles have identical slopes, but the visual proof very much and truthfully shows that this is not he case. reply sahmeepee 3 hours agoprevA similar method is handy for some mental arithmetic involving squares, e.g. it's easy to calculate 1005² because it's 1000² plus two added blocks of 5 x 1000, plus a small 5² block, so 1,010,025. Going the other way, 995² is 1000² minus those same two 5 x 1000 blocks, plus 5², so 990,025.

That’s not to say the example is bad, or good, more to marvel at how differently people think. reply dbsmith83 3 hours agoparentIn the first image on the left, you can see the large square has length and width of a, which would have an area of a*a, or a^2. There is then a little square inside with length and width b, for an area of b^2. Essentially, the little square is getting removed from the big one (a^2 - b^2). In the last image on the right, you can see that the length of one side is (a-b) and the top side is (a+b), which would mean the area is equal to the product of (a-b)(a+b). This means that a^2 – b^2 = (a + b)(a – b). The intermediate steps just show how to move the area around visually reply trescenzi 3 hours agorootparentI think this helps the most. The piece that doesn't \"just click\" for me is that area = product of multiplication. Manipulating symbols generally just feels more natural to me. reply jameshart 1 hour agorootparentIt’s worth rehearsing that instinct. The insight that areas are products is a really useful one for deepening your intuition of what integration is doing, as well as for enhancing your ability to interpret graphs and charts. Like, if you have a graph showing power consumption over time, it’s great to be able to mentally recognize that, say, if the time units are hours and the power units are Watts, that the area under the graph will be counted in Watt hours; that a rectangle one hour wide by one Watt tall is one Watt hour, and so on. reply dagss 1 hour agorootparentprevNot sure if it helps, but trying: In a sense area isn't anything else than multiplication. It isn't like you have a) multiplication and b) area and then prove that a=b. Rather, area IS multiplication.

Each line is now 5cm long and 1cm wide. Arrange the lines side by side. You now have a rectangle whose height is 5cm and whose width is 20cm. You already know its area 100 cm^2, because you made it out of 100 tiles that were 1 cm^2 each.

WLOG means: I assume one of the possible cases, but the proof works the same way for other cases. But that's not true here. The proof, as shown, only works for a>b>0, it does not work (without extra work or explanation) for a b, and doesn’t generalize geometrically to b > a. The algebraic proof, on the other hand, generalizes at least to commutative rings. Geometric “proofs” like this are neat, but are no real substitute for the algebraic ones. I’d argue that in cases like the present one they also don’t provide any deeper insights. You’re just moving geometric shapes around instead of algebraic symbols. They might give you the feeling that the theorem isn’t as arbitrary as you thought, but it isn’t arbitrary in algebra either. I’m putting “proof” in quotes here because there are many examples of incorrect geometric “proofs”, and there is generally no formal geometric way to verify their correctness. reply zozbot234 1 hour agorootparent> there is generally no formal geometric way to verify their correctness. There are formal models of synthetic (i.e. axiom-and-proof based) Euclidean geometry where proofs can in fact be verified.

No, or at least they were not in the high-school math books I was assigned. There were no explicit referrals in any way to visual representations of the algebra involved. reply GuB-42 2 hours agoparentprevVisual proofs can be deceptive. For example, you have the famous missing square puzzle, where rearranging pieces of a triangle causes a square to vanish, something that should be impossible. It doesn't mean it is not possible to have rigorous visual proofs, the one in the article is, but doing so can be deceptively hard. It is also common for visual proofs to be less complete, for instance, here, it only covers the cases where a>0, b>0 and a>b, there are no such limitations when doing so with algebra. I guess you can tweak the visual proof to account for these cases, but it will become far less elegant. So I understand why teachers avoid visual proofs in math classes, they actually want you to stay away from them. They have entertainment value, that's why you see them so much in pop-science, and I think it is important, and also some historical value, as they were much more present in ancient times, but to actually learn maths, not so much. That is unless you are studying visual proofs specifically, but I think it is an advanced topic you would tackle well after you can master simple equations like a^2 – b^2 = (a + b)(a – b). reply konschubert 2 hours agoparentprevThe expression immediately follows from a ( b+c) = ab + ac.

Agree? > In the context of hardware and software systems, formal verification is the act of proving or disproving the correctness of a system with respect to a certain formal specification or property, using formal methods of mathematics. - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification Here is how I'm using the terms: - \"Formal\" in mathematics refers to rigorous logical reasoning with precise definitions and deductive steps. This is the older, more general meaning. - \"Formal verification\" emerged later as a specific term in computer science referring to automated/mechanical verification of system properties. This is now the standard meaning in software/hardware contexts. So, putting these terms into use... If a human verifies a formal proof \"by hand\", I think it is fair to say that does not comprise \"formal verification\". On the other hand, if an automated system verifies the proof, then I would say \"formal verification\" has happened. Perhaps you will agree this is how many, if not most, experts use the terms. Are we mostly playing language games -- or is there a key insight you think I don't understand? reply layer8 1 hour agorootparentYou can perform a formal verification of an informal proof, like for example the ones in https://youtu.be/VYQVlVoWoPY linked elsethread. Of course, you have to come up with some formalization of what the informal proof is trying to claim, but it doesn’t mean that what you’re proving wrong must be a formal proof to start with. reply xpe 58 minutes agorootparentYes, I understand what you mean. We don't disagree on the substance. reply layer8 42 minutes agorootparentIt therefore makes sense to me (and represents actual usage of those terms) to say that some informal proof is formally wrong, meaning that translating its reasoning into a formal representation will reveal its incorrectness. reply lupire 2 hours agoparentprevQuod erat demonstrandum. reply kbutler 4 hours agoprev [–] This is best considered an illustration, rather than a proof, as it fails for any of the following: a=0 and b is non-zero b>a (result is negative. If you swap the variables, you have to imagine the area is a negative area) either variable is negative reply dbsmith83 3 hours agoparentI think you could make it work for negative numbers. You would just shade the negative area differently to show it. For example, if you subtract 1000 sq ft from 100 sq ft, geometrically it means you are trying to remove more area than you have. So, to represent this, draw a rectangle of 100 sq ft. Conceptually \"extend\" this area by subtracting 1000 sq ft. The extra 900 sq ft that you try to subtract but can't \"exists\" as a negative representation. This could be represented by flipping the surplus 900 sq ft into a negative axis or shading it differently to denote that it's a deficit rather than an actual, positive area. reply xpe 3 hours agoparentprev [–] A koan in four parts: 1. What constitutes a proof? 2. In what context is a \"proof\" embodied? 3. Why is scribbling lines on a paper (that look like math to humans) 'more' of a proof than visual diagrams, if at all? 4. If you came across a proof that was persuasive to alien intelligences -- and led them to conclude true things were true and false things were false -- but, alas, you did not understand it, does that make it less of a proof? reply kbutler 30 minutes agorootparent [–] 1. What constitutes a proof? An irrefutable demonstration of a conclusion, possibly via sequence of steps or combination of elements. 2. In what context is a \"proof\" embodied? Do you mean what the range or domain of the proof are? Not sure on the \"embodied\". I think you mean the communication of the proof and the expected base knowledge to understand the proof. 3. Why is scribbling lines on a paper (that look like math to humans) 'more' of a proof than visual diagrams, if at all? You seem to be focusing on the representation of the proof in a particular notation, rather than the actual logic of the proof. The graphical demonstration leads to false conclusions. For example, if a=0, it implies that a^2 - b^2 is 0 (or it requires some unfamiliar graphical representation of negative areas) 4. If you came across a proof that was persuasive to alien intelligences -- and led them to conclude true things were true and false things were false -- but, alas, you did not understand it, does that make it less of a proof? Again, the representation is not the proof, it is a means to record or communicate the proof. If the representation implies that false things are true (e.g., if a==0), then it is not a proof. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Check the Facebook group for everything from new PLATOTerm ports, scheduling workshops and events, to announcements of new content on the service itself! The IRATA.ONLINE Facebook Page ABOUT Fun, Social, Creative, Retro. IRATA.ONLINE is provided for the benefit of retro-computing users to have a place to socialize, and develop interesting multi-user, interactive, and graphical games and social applications. It descends from the historical PLATO system, a massive time-sharing system that lasted from 1962 until NovaNET was closed in 2015. Wikipedia entry. It is vital that communities grow, and to that end, IRATA.ONLINE is part of a rebirth of the PLATO system that started with the launching of Cyber1.org in 2004, and is the direct result of the efforts of that community to provide a distribution of the PLATO system that could be run on other systems. IRATA.ONLINE was initially intended to provide users of Atari 8-bit computer systems a customized experience that was easy to use. It is hoped that with the introduction of more PLATO terminals for other platforms that IRATA.ONLINE's reach can extend even further. Where will it go? Who knows. This is an experiment to provide something better than a BBS, by making something that is not only multi-user, but provides a complete social development experience for its users. FEATURES IRATA.ONLINE is a PLATO based system, which has the following pervasive features: Multi-User Graphical, with combinations of text, line graphics, and custom character sets, as well as 24-bit color (on supported terminals) Touch screen support Terminals available for PC, Mac, Linux, Atari 8-bit, and soon Android and iOS. Multi-Player Games Notes files for social posting on a growing variety of topics Talk with other users, anywhere in the system, even in games! Help with tutorials to introduce you to the system. Development environment to make new programs for the system. Lots of existing educational content, because it's a PLATO system. Screen sharing facilities, even with multiple participants! and more!

Setting up Package Repositories!) If you have a vintage computer IRATA.ONLINE provides PLATOTerm, a terminal emulator for PLATO systems such as IRATA.ONLINE, and CYBER1.ORG PLATOTerm is being ported to dozens of systems, and many targets are already available. The source code is also available for all of these targets, so that the terminal can not only be improved, each target can be used as a concrete example of how to realize a PLATO terminal for a platform currently not covered by PLATOTerm.

CONNECT To connect to IRATA.ONLINE, use the following connection information: Host: IRATA.ONLINE Port: 8005 (ASCII Protocol) Guest Sign-On If you want to try the system, before your account is approved, you can log in with the following sign-on: user name: guest group: guest While this won't give you access to every part of the system (you will not be able to see users, or to use term-talk, for example), it will allow you to see the system, before your account is approved. Main Menu - As shown in PTERM This is the entry point for sign-ons, which branches out into the other parts of the system. Main Menu - As shown on Atari The same menu as shown on the Atari PLATO cartridge. Games Menu IRATA.ONLINE is a fantastic platform for multi-player online games, many games from the PLATO tradition are available here, with more to come, both from PLATO's past, and from users like you! Notes Menu Notesfiles are the PLATO equivalent of forum posts. Anyone can post and reply to them, and anyone can request for notesfiles to be made. They can be private to a single person, a group or to the public. Help Menu A help menu is provided, with tutorials showing how to use the system. Airfight One of the games available, is Airfight, where you participate in a multi-player 3D dogfight simulation! Programming Tools IRATA.ONLINE is written in the TUTOR language, and a complete programming environment, with lots of programming tools, and context sensitive help is pervasively available. Screen Designer Screens can be visually drawn, and when done, translated into TUTOR code for your game, lesson, or other tool. Character Set Designer Programmable character sets are an integral part of the PLATO experience, they allow you to design graphics that can be quickly transmitted, and the system provides a way to create not just individual character cells, but combine them together to produce more complex graphics. Games: Empire Empire is an example of a multi-player space conquest game. You play various teams, bent on planetary conquest. Previous Next SHOTS Here are some example screenshots showcasing the IRATA.ONLINE experience. The majority of these screenshots were taken with the PTERM emulator linked to above. PTERM provides an authentic PLATO experience, either in pure orange and black, or with color! Some screenshots of other terminal emulators, such as the Atari PLATO cartridge, are also included. VIDEOS Shown here is a video providing an overview of IRATA.ONLINE, and its most basic and pervasive features. We log onto the system using both the PTERM and Atari clients, and walk through the various menus, showing quickly how notes (and personal notes) work, as well as show a quick glance of the games available, and a quick introduction to the unique programming environment available on PLATO systems. More Videos... TECH How do I make a terminal for this service? The Protocol that IRATA.ONLINE uses is an ASCII based protocol developed for PLATO. it is ASCII in that it uses 7-bit characters and does not use the 8th bit of the byte. The protocol is completely documented in the \"s0ascers\" document, provided both below and accessible using either author mode or Go in the menu system. If you wish to make terminal software to access this service, this document is most useful. S0ASCERS Document (HTML format) S0ASCERS Document (ASCII text format) Example Terminal Code To help foster adoption of the service, alongside the protocol implementation documentation above, and the pterm source code, also above. Steve Peltz also provided example implementations of a classic 68K Macintosh terminal (MacPAD) and a Sun SPARC terminal (XPad), both of these are sample implementations written in easy to understand C, that can be brought over to bootstrap other terminal program efforts. A big thank you to Steve Peltz. MacPAD Source Code (1990) SPARCPAD Source Code (1990) Atari PLATO Cartridge (The Learning Phone) Source Code at github. Micro Tutor Source Code While not needed, it is possible for PLATO terminals to receive code from IRATA and execute it locally, possibly while interacting with code running on IRATA. A Micro Tutor interpreter exists within PTerm 6.0, and thus can be used to run Micro-Tutor lessons, and with appropriate implementations on other processors (6502, 6809, 68000, etc.), Micro-TUTOR could be extended to a wide variety of retro-computing systems. Source code in assembly for the Z80 Micro-Tutor interpreter is below: Micro-PLATO Source Code extracted from IRATA's filesystem Complete Level-2 Micro-TUTOR source code The core interpreter for Micro-TUTOR level 4 How do I write software for this service? IRATA.ONLINE like all PLATO systems, utilizes the TUTOR language for the majority of its programs and lessons. It is a very simple language to learn, and is designed to leverage the unique aspects of the service. The editor, debugger, and visual editors needed to make excellent programs for this service, are all built in, and available to users that ask for an Author sign-on. There is also the =0introtut= lesson available from the Help menu and in author mode, as well as the =aids= lesson, which serves as a reference guide. In addition, the fine folks at bitsavers.org and control-data.info provided a copy of The Tutor Language in PDF format, so you can teach yourself TUTOR quickly!

It is interesting the world ( or may be RISC-V world ) seems to think any company can simply break the contract and agreement others signed, while pretending they are still righteous. At the same time thinking this wont happen to their IP. Well I think we will all know soon. reply klelatti 6 hours agoparentIt is informative to note the contrast between the fact that 22 companies (Microsoft, Google, Samsung, etc, etc) were all given enough notice in advance of the Nuvia acquisition, to be able to come up with a quote endorsing it. [1] And the treatment of the 'partner' upon whose IP the deal depends: > Neither Qualcomm nor Nuvia provided prior notice of this transaction to Arm [2] [1] https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/01/qualcomm-acqu... [2] From Arm's initial court submission. reply adrian_b 3 hours agorootparentThe architecture license agreements between Qualcomm, Nuvia and Arm have remained secret. Both Qualcomm and Arm claim that they follow the requirements of the existing ALAs, while the other party has breached them. Without access to the original texts, we cannot verify who tells the truth. Even when a judge will give a decision for this conflict we will not be able to know who is right if the ALAs remain secret, because in recent years there have been plenty of absurd judicial decisions, where judges have been obviously wrong. According to Qualcomm, they had no obligation to notify Arm about their business intentions. While I do not like Qualcomm for many reasons, for now there is no ground to believe more the claims of Arm than the claims of Qualcomm, so any of the two could be right about this. Perhaps Arm is right and Qualcomm must pay the royalties specified in the Nuvia ALA instead of the royalties specified in the Qualcomm ALA, which is the main subject of this conflict, but if this is true then Nuvia has been conned by Arm into signing a really disadvantageous ALA, which is somewhat surprising, because among their business plan variants must have been one of being bought by some big company, in which case their target should have been to retain ownership of the IP developed by themselves. There is no doubt that even if Qualcomm pays only the low royalties specified in the Qualcomm ALA, Arm will obtain a revenue orders of magnitude greater than any revenue that could have been obtained from Nuvia, had it not been bought by Qualcomm. The reason why Arm does not like this increased revenue from the Nuvia work is that Qualcomm has decided to replace all the cores licensed from Arm in all of their products with cores developed by the Nuvia team. Thus the loss of the royalties for the Arm-designed cores will be even greater than the increased revenue from the ALA royalties. So Arm attempts to use or abuse whatever was written in their ALAs in order to prevent competition in the cores implementing the Arm architecture. Even if Arm had been cunning enough to have included paragraphs in their ALAs that justify their current requests, there is no doubt that the real villain in this conflict is Arm, who fights for forcing the use of CPU cores that are weaker and more expensive than what is possible. reply ksec 15 minutes agorootparent>where judges have been obviously wrong. True. But if Qualcomm think they are not playing any tricks, playing by the rules clearly stated in the contract. You can bet they will appeal and fight on even if they lose. A lot of juicy details will come out during the trial. Just like the Apple vs Qualcomm case ( Where Apple was clearly in the wrong ). We will all know soon and make up our own judgement. reply klelatti 57 minutes agorootparentprev> Nuvia has been conned by Arm > So Arm attempts to use or abuse whatever was written in their ALAs > Even if Arm had been cunning enough to have included paragraphs in their ALAs Clauses requiring consent for transfer of IP rights (or on change of control) are standard everywhere and Nuvia would have been fully aware of this at the time of signing the ALA. reply Voultapher 1 hour agorootparentprevI think you got it the wrong way around. Nuvia got allegedly got a really good ALA because they targeted server and where small, but then Qualcomm bought Nuvia and wants to produce smartphone chips with the cheaper Nuvia ALA, based on Nuvia IP. Arm argues they have to use the more expensive Qualcomm ALA. reply klelatti 55 minutes agorootparentNo, the parent comment is correct (on the relative fees at least). Qualcomm wants to sell Nuvia-derived cores under its own ALA at a lower fee than Nuvia would have had to pay (which makes sense as server cores cost more than smartphone cores). reply brookst 4 hours agorootparentprevI read that part differently. I didn’t see it as a statement about the legal merits of ARM’s choices so much as the pragmatic business outcomes. It is possible for an action to be 100% legally correct and a bad business move (see: creative IP companies that sue their biggest fans). Even granting that ARM is completely within their right, this is a pretty bug reminder of the dangers of building on sole-source licensed IP when there’s an open alternative. I have little doubt that ARM drove some number of startups into choosing RISC-V. Which may or may not matter in the long run. But it is rolling the dice and by definition a short term maximization strategy. reply klelatti 3 hours agorootparentMy comment wasn’t really around legal or business merits but rather the bad faith nature of these actions which would apply whether using open or closed source ip. However, the ‘dangers of building on sole-source’ licensed IP is true in general but a bit overdone in this case. Qualcomm had a large number of options using Arm IP including developing their own cores in house. However they chose to do something that was - on the face of it - in breach of license agreements that Nuvia had signed. reply MobiusHorizons 3 hours agorootparent> including developing their own cores in house. I believe ARM just revoked Qualcomm’s architecture license, so they no longer have that option if they want to run aarch64. The architecture license predated the Nuvia acquisition, and was the license under which Qualcomm developed their most recent laptop core. reply adrian_b 2 hours agorootparentBecause the Qualcomm and Nuvia ALAs have remained secret, we cannot know whether Arm really has the right to revoke them at will. It is hard to believe that anyone would accept to sign an ALA that can easily be revoked, because whoever signs an ALA intends to invest a lot of money developing products based on it and there is no doubt that all the invested money can be lost if the ALA is revoked unilaterally. It remains to be seen what will happen at the trial. reply fidotron 5 hours agoparentprevThere seems to be a growing awareness in the RISC-V world that they have made the mistake of being generals refighting their previous war, and things have moved on without them noticing, but unfortunately they painted themselves into a corner of inappropriate technical decisions, and this is manifesting in comments like those quoted. reply MobiusHorizons 2 hours agorootparentSince you haven’t said anything specific, it’s hard to interact with the comment without guessing at what you mean. But I’ll give it a go: > generals refighting their previous war Here I think you are talking about the risc vs cisc debate. It is true that in modern OOO cores this is basically meaningless. I think the only truly relevant piece is fixed encoding widths, which make wider decoders feasible on a lower power budget. On the other hand I think risc-v owes a lot of its popularity to how easy it is to understand and implement a bare bones core. Marketing will be a huge challenge for any newcomer, but risc-v is doing very well on that score. The place I think risc-v has made really good innovations in ISA design is in the vector extension. It seems to me that it allows for code to be written for larger vectors and the machine can apply whatever vector width it has available. I believe this should allow new cores to improve the performance of old code in a way that more explicit designs like AVX have struggled with. reply zozbot234 2 hours agorootparentAIUI the jury is still out as to whether wider decoders are feasible with RISC-V's 16-bit and 32-bit split. It's specifically designed to ensure that insn lengths and positions can be decoded as easily as possible, without introducing overly inflexible notions such as VLIW-like \"bundles\". reply ironhaven 31 minutes agorootparentModern x86 cores can decode 9 variable length instructions per clock. It’s not easy but can be done. RISK-V C instructions are on the other hand are trivial. All compressed instructions are 1-1 translatable to uncompressed instructions. People have measured the cost of adding C extension decoding as being a few hundred GATES. reply mnau 5 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you mean by \"inappropriate technical decisions\"? reply fidotron 5 hours agorootparentThat is the wrong question. The right question is how have things have moved on, then you can reevaluate the technical choices and understand why they are inappropriate. reply panick21_ 4 hours agorootparentThe right question is 'what are you even talking about?'. reply fidotron 4 hours agorootparentA serious answer as to why I didn't answer the question directly? The RISC-V community is dominated by a culture that is fighting the semiconductor war of 20 years ago. Consequently their core ideas are those that were in play then, and they remain steadfastly attached to them. In this case the sea of baby cores is actually an ideal application of RISC-V. You cannot point out the core problem for a multitude of reasons, one of which is that if you did it would just turn to \"prove it\", and honestly another is that even though many of us would like an alternative ISA to succeed we do kind of enjoy watching people like SiFive spin round in circles. A strongly related problem is the likes of SiFive are promoting premature ossification before the thing has evolved to practical utility. reply GregarianChild 3 hours agorootparentI agree that the RISC-V ecosystem has some issues that I hope will be sorted out. But not all RISC-V cores are \"baby cores\". I imagine that XiangShan [1], albeit student work, will spur work towards bigger, more performant OOO cores. [1] https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan reply latchkey 14 hours agoprevI have a business renting high performance compute. I want to democratize compute to make it more easily available on short term basis to anyone who wants access. I talked to TT about a year ago; also one of their customers as well. I was really impressed with everyone I talked to and I'd love to work with them. What I realized though is that as much as I'd like to buy and host it and make it available, I'm not sure the economics or interest are there yet. The focus today is so dedicated to Nvidia that \"fringe\" gear is still just that. People who really want to play with it, will just buy it themselves. They've probably been doing that with hardware for a long time. So, it is a bit of a catch-22 for me right now. Hopefully interest grows in these sorts of offerings and demand will pick up. The world needs alternatives to just Nvidia dominance of all of AI hardware and software. reply kouteiheika 10 hours agoparent> Hopefully interest grows in these sorts of offerings and demand will pick up. Well, looking at their (as far as I can see highest end) accelerator the n300s we get: - 24GB of memory - 576GB/s of memory bandwidth - $1400 As a hobbyist this is still not compelling enough to get excited and port my software - same amount of memory as a 4090/3090, half the bandwidth as a 4090/3090, slightly cheaper (than a 4090), more expensive (than a 3090), much worse software support. Why would I buy it over NVidia? This might be more compelling to bigger fish customers who would buy thousands of these (so then the lower price makes a difference), but you really need small fish people to use it too if you want to achieve good, widespread software support. However if they'd at least double the amount of memory at the same price, now we'd be talking... reply A_D_E_P_T 9 hours agorootparentYeah, clearly the low-hanging fruit is simply to offer more memory. In a recent thread, just about everybody was talking about how Intel should have released its \"Battlemage\" line of cards with 48GB+ and how they'd actually have a very compelling offering on their hands had they done so. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42308590 Missed opportunities. That said, I know some of the Tenstorrent guys and they're extremely smart and capable. They'll figure it out, and the company is probably going to 10x. reply kouteiheika 4 hours agorootparent> Yeah, clearly the low-hanging fruit is simply to offer more memory. Yep. And just to be clear, this isn't necessarily a strategy to directly make money, as the market for people running these things locally is probably not very big (as a lot of people in the Intel thread said). But it's a strategy to beat the CUDA monopoly and get everyone and their dog to support your hardware with their software. I know I would be porting my software to their hardware if it was actually compelling for small fish, and I know plenty of other people who would too. AMD also somewhat falls into this trap. They're slightly cheaper than NVidia, and their hardware is roughly good enough, but because their software stack and their hardware support sucks (just look at their ROCm compatibility list, it's a complete joke with, like, 3 models of GPUs, vs NVidia where I can use any GPU from the last 8 years) no one bothers. Being good enough is not good enough, you need to offer some sort of a unique selling point for people to tolerate the extra software issues they'll have with your hardware. reply Workaccount2 2 hours agorootparentIf someone built a mediocre GPU (~4070 level) with 48GB or 96GB, then the community would build the software stack for you. Granted, you would not own that software and it would be ported to other cards in the future, but if you are trying to topple the king (nvidia) it would be a powerful strat. reply steeve 6 hours agoparentprevLook at what we (ZML) are doing: https://github.com/zml/zml Any model, any hardware, zero compromise.

Doesn’t scale, but it hedges your own business. Requires the right customer though, like somebody who might buy Nervana / Xeon Phi but then buy NVidia from you when it blows up. reply latchkey 57 minutes agorootparentKind of. It is easier for us to be the capex/opex (meaning buy and run equipment) and then rent it out. I have the backing to make large investments without too much drama. We can do that with any hardware as long as we have longer (1-2 year) contracts in place.

However with sonnent I was able to be handheld all the way from downloading android studio to a functional app written in kotlin, that is now being used by employees on the floor. People can keep telling themselves that LLMs are useless or maybe just helpful for quickly spewing boilerplate code, but I would heed the warning that this tech is only going to improve and already helping people forgo SWE's very seriously. Sears thought the internet was a cute party trick, and that obviously print catalogs were there to stay. reply refulgentis 12 hours agoparentprevToday, I wrote a full YouTube subtitle downloader in Dart. 52 minutes from starting to google anything about it, to full implementation and tests, custom formatting any of the 5 obscure formats it could be in to my exact whims. Full coverage of any validation errors via mock network responses. I then wrote a web AudioWorklet for playing PCM in 3 minutes, which complied to the same interface as my Mac/iOS/Android versions, ex. Setting sample rate, feedback callback, etc. I have no idea what an AudioWorklet is. Two days ago, I stubbed out my implementation of OpenAI's web socket based realtime API, 1400 LOC over 2 days, mostly by hand while grokking and testing the API. In 32 minutes, I had a brand spanking new batch of code, clean, event-based architecture, 86% test coverage. 1.8 KLOC with tests. In all of these cases, most I needed to do was drop in code files and say, nope wrong a couple times to sonnet, and say \"why are you violating my service contract and only providing an example solution\" to o1. Not llama 3.1 405B specifically, I haven't gone to the trouble of running it, but things turned some sort of significant corner over the last 3 months, between o1 and Sonnet 3.5. Mistakes are rare. Believable 405B is on that scale, IIRC it went punch for punch with the original 3.5 Sonnet. But I find it hard to believe a Google L3, and third of L4s, (read: new hires, or survived 3 years) are that productive and sending code out for review at a 1/5th of that volume, much less on demand. So insane-sounding? Yes. Out there? Probably, I work for myself now. I don't have to have a complex negotiation with my boss on what I can use and how. And I only saw this starting ~2 weeks ago, with full o1 release. Wrong? Shill? Dilletante? No. I'm still digesting it myself. But it's real. reply nightski 12 hours agorootparentMost software is not one off little utilities/scripts, greenfield small projects, etc... That's where LLMs excel, when you don't have much context and can regurgitate solutions. It's less to do with junior/senior/etc.. and more to do with the types of problems you are tackling. reply riwsky 1 hour agorootparentNo true Botsman would replace a junior eng! reply refulgentis 11 hours agorootparentprevThis is a 30KLOC 6 platform flutter app that's, in this user story, doing VOIP audio, running 3 audio models on-device, including in your browser. A near-replica of the Google Assistant audio pipeline, except all on-device. It's a real system, not kindergarten \"look at the React Claude Artifacts did, the button makes a POST request!\" The 1500 loc websocket / session management code it refactored and tested touches on nearly every part of the system (i.e. persisting messages, placing search requests, placing network requests to run a chat flow) Also, it's worth saying this bit a bit louder: the \"just throwing files in\" I mention is key. With that, the quality you observed being in reverse is the distinction: with o1 thinking, and whatever Sonnet's magic is, there's a higher payoff from working a larger codebase. For example, here, it knew exactly what to do for the web because it already saw the patterns iOS/Android/macOS shared. The bend I saw in the curve came from being ultra lazy one night and seeing what would happen if it just had all the darn files. reply achierius 11 hours agorootparentI've definitely noticed the opposite on larger codebases. It's able to do magical things on smaller ones but really starts to fall apart as I scale up. reply noch 9 hours agorootparentprev> This is a 30KLOC 6 platform flutter app […] It's a real system, not kindergarten \"look at the React Claude Artifacts did, the button makes a POST request!\" This is powerful and significant but I think we need to ground ourselves on what a skilled programmer means when he talks about solving problems. That is, honestly ask: What is the level of skill a programmer requires to build what you've described? Mostly, imo, the difficulties in building it are in platform and API details not in any fundamental engineering problem that has to be solved. What makes web and Android programming so annoying is all the abstractions and frameworks and cruft that you end up having to navigate. Once you've navigated it, you haven't really solved anything, you've just dealt with obstacles other programmers have put in your way. The solutions are mostly boilerplate-like and the code I write is glue. I think the definition of \"junior engineer\" or \"simple app\" will be defined by what LLMs can produce and so, in a way, unfortunately, the goal posts and skill ceiling will keep shifting. On the other, hand, say we watch a presentation by the Lead Programmer at Naughty Dog, \"Parallelizing the Naughty Dog Engine Using Fibers\"[^0] and ask the same questions: what level of skill is required to solve the problems he's describing (solutions worth millions of dollars because his product has to sell that much to have good ROI): \"I have a million LOC game engine for which I need to make a scheduler with no memory management for multithreaded job synchronization for the PS4.\" A lot of these guys, if you've talked to them, are often frustrated that LLMs simply can't help them make headway with, or debug, these hard problems where novel hardware-constrained solutions are needed. --- [^0]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIVBhKj7gQU reply refulgentis 8 hours agorootparentIt's been pretty hard, but if you reduce it to \"Were you using a framework, or writing one that needs to push the absolute limits of performance?\"... ...I guess the first?... ...But not really? I'm not writing GPU kernels or operating system task schedulers, but I am going to some pretty significant lengths to be running ex. local LLM, embedding model, Whisper, model for voice activity detection, model for speaker counting, syncing state with 3 web sockets. Simultaneously. In this case, Android and iOS are no valhalla of vapid-stackoverflow-copy-pasta-with-no-hardware-constraints, as you might imagine. And the novelty is, 6 years ago, I would have targeted iOS and prayed. Now I'm on every platform at top-tier speeds. All that boring tedious scribe-like stuff that 90% of us spend 80% of our time on, is gone. I'm not sure there's very many people at all who get to solve novel hardware-constrained problems these days, I'm quite pleased to brush shoulders with someone who brushes shoulders with them :) Thus, smacks more of no-true-scotsman than something I can chew on.

I wasn't making a judgement about you or your work, after all I don't know you. I was commenting within the context of an app that you described for which an LLM was useful, relative to the hard problems we'll need help with if we want to advance technology (that is, make computers do more powerful things and do them faster). I have no idea if you're a true Scotsman or not. Regardless: over the coming years we'll find out who the true Scotsmen were, as they'll be hired to do the stuff LLMs can't. reply geerlingguy 1 hour agorootparentThe challenging projects I've worked on are challenging not because slamming out code to meet requirements is hard (or takes long). It's challenging because working to get a stable set of requirements requires a lot of communication with end users, stakeholders, etc. Then, predicting what they actually mean when implementing said requirements. Then, demoing the software and translating their non-technical understanding and comments back into new requirements (rinse and repeat). If a tool can help program some of those requirements faster, as long as it meets security and functional standards, and is maintainable, it's not a big deal whether a junior dev is working with Stack Exchange or Claude, IMO. But I do want that dev to understand the code being committed, because otherwise security bugs and future maintenance headaches creep in. reply spiderfarmer 12 hours agorootparentprevMost software is simple HTML. reply mhh__ 11 hours agorootparentThis isn't where the leverage is though reply spiderfarmer 8 hours agorootparentNo, but AI will replace a lot of web developers. reply dheera 2 hours agorootparentprevI think most software outside of the few Silicon Valleys of the world is in fact a bunch of dirty hacks put together.

Take the saying \"Code is a liability,\" and the fact that with LLMs, you are able to create so much more code than you normally would: The logical conclusion is that projects will balloon with code pushing LLMs to their limit, and this massive amount is going to contain more bugs and be more costly to maintain. Anecdotally, supposedly most devs are using some form of AI for writing code, and the software I use isn't magically getting better (I'm not seeing an increased rate of features or less buggy software). reply trollbridge 1 hour agorootparentMy biggest challenges in building a new application and maintaining an existing one is lack of good unit tests, functional tests, and questionable code coverage; lack of documentation; excessively byzantine build and test environments. Cranking out yet more code, though, is not difficult (and junior programmers are cheap). LLMs do truly produce code like a (very bad) junior programmer: when trying to make unit tests, it takes the easiest path and makes something that passes but won't catch serious regressions. Sometimes I've simply reprompted it with \"Please write that code in a more proper, Pythonic way\". When it comes to financial calculations around dates, date intervals, rounding, and so on, it often gets things just ever-so-slightly wrong, which makes it basically useless for financial or payroll type of applications. It also doesn't help much with the main bulk of my (paid) work these days, which is migrating apps from some old platform like vintage C#-x86 or some vendor thing like a big pile of Google AppScript, Jotform, Xapier, and so on into a more maintainable and testable framework that doesn't depend on subscription cloud services. So far I can't find a way to make LLMs productive at all at that - perhaps that's a good thing, since clients still see fit to pay decently for this work. reply jiggawatts 9 hours agorootparentprevSomething I noticed is that as the threshold for doing something like \"write software to do X\" decreases, the tendency for people to go search for an existing product and download it tends to zero. There is a point where in some sense it is less effort to just write the thing yourself. This is the argument against micro-libraries as seen in NPM as well, but my point is that the threshold of complexity for \"write it yourself\" instead of reaching for a premade thing changes over time. As languages, compilers, tab-complete, refactoring, and AI assistance get better and better, eventually we'll reach a point where the human race as a whole will be spitting out code at an unimaginable rate. reply xbmcuser 12 hours agorootparentprevI agree with you that they are improving not being a programer I can't tell if the code has improved but as user that uses chat gpt or Google gemini to build scripts or trading view indicators.

However for junior engineers it could hold back their learning as they just use whatever it gives without really understanding what or why something was done that way. It seems plausible to me. At least using stack overflow people get explanations of why you do x to get y, it's a bit copy paste, sure, but the pace brought learning. Now if you type a comment and get code, a junior engineer may not even read what's generated as 'theu don't need to, it usually works' .... Any ideas how we can ensure junior engineers do effectively learn and understand what is going on, while still getting the LLM benefit? reply lionkor 8 hours agoparentProbably by not letting them check in code they don't understand. This creates a lot of overhead, but it turns out you simply can't skip that time investment. Somewhere along the junior->senior developer (in terms of skill, not time) is a big time cost of just sitting down and learning. You can pretend to skip it with LLMs, but you're just delaying having to understand it. So the benefit of LLMs is negligible in the long term, for beginner/junior programmers, as they essentially collect knowledge debt. Don't let your juniors use LLMs, or if you do, make sure they can explain every little detail about the code they have written. You don't have to be annoying about it - ask socratically. reply ripped_britches 8 hours agoparentprevI’ve been coding for a long time and just became very proficient in dart this year just by using LLM and asking it to explain anything I don’t know. I haven’t been on Stack Overflow in 2 years and it’s not because I’m taking shortcuts by letting the LLM write my code, it’s because it is the best teacher / paired programmer that will just sit with you with endless patience. Especially using @docs with cursor and @directory context. reply rafaelmn 1 hour agorootparentI am in a similar situation where I needed to jump in on a python Django codebase for a side gig I'm helping a friend out on. Since I have no interest in using Django in the future I decided to Claude my way trough the project - I did use Django like 10 years ago, am fairly competent with python and used rails recently - so I thought how bad can this be. By the time I had something cobbled together with Claude I decided to get a friend who's competent with Django to review my code and boy did I feel like an amateur. Not only did the code not use good practices/patterns (eg. not even using viewsets from DRF), I couldn't even follow in the conversation because I knew nothing about these concepts. So I spent a day reading docs and looking at a standard example of a idiomatic setup and it made my project a lot better. I've had this experience at multiple points in the project - not reading the API docs and letting Claude walk me through integration left me stuck when Claude failed, design decisions. So I would say Claude is useful for simple execution when you know what you are expecting, relying on it to learn sounds like a short term gain for problems down the line. At a point where LLMs can reliably lookup sources and reason trough something to explain it there will be no coding left, but I feel we aren't close to that with current tech. reply zkry 7 hours agorootparentprev> I’ve been coding for a long time... I think having been coding for a long time, I don't think you fall into the same category. Dart having paradigms not too different from other standard languages, a lot of these skills are probably transferable. I've seen beginners on the other hand using LLMs who couldn't even write a proper for-loop without AI assistance. They lack the fundamental ability to \"run code in their head.\" This type of person I feel would be utterly limited by the capabilities of the AI model and would fail in lockstep with it. reply brookst 4 hours agorootparentThis is kind of the classic “kids these days” argument: that because we understand something from what we consider the foundational level up to what we consider the goal level, anyone who comes along later and starts at higher levels will be limited / less capable / etc. It is true, but also irrelevant. Just like most programmers today do not need to understand CPU architecture or even assembly language, programmers in the future will not need to understand for loops the way we do. They will get good at writing LLM-optimized specifications that produce the desired results. And that will be fine, even if we old-timers bemoan that they don’t really program the way we do. Yes, the abstractions required will be inefficient. And we will always be able to say that when those kids solve our kinds of problems, our methods are better. Just like assembly programmers can look at simple python programs and be astounded at the complexity “required” to solve simple problems. reply rafaelmn 1 hour agorootparentI feel like you underestimate how much effort goes into making CPUs reliable and how low level/well specified the problem of building a VM/compiler is compared to getting a natural language specification to executable program. Solving that reliably is basically AGI - I doubt there will be many humans in the loop if we reach that point. reply zkry 3 hours agorootparentprevI agree with this take actually. I do imagine how programming in the future could be comprised of mostly interactions with LLMs. Such interactions would probably constrained enough to get the success rate of LLMs sufficiently high, maybe involving specialized DSLs made for LLMs. I do think the future may be more varied. Just like today where I look at kernel/systems/DB engineering and it seems almost arcane to me, I feel like there will be another stratum created, working on things where LLMs don't suffice. A lot of this will also depend on how far LLMs get. I would think that there would have to be more ChatGPT-like breakthroughs before this new type of developer can come. reply blueboo 7 hours agoparentprevDespite your observation that SO has explanations, SO can he and has also been used as a zero-learning crutch. Similarly, LLMs can be used as educational tools. In the end, learning and self-improvement needs some non-trivial motivation from the individual. The answer to your question is to show them it’s valuable to learn. If they find they’re completing their tasks adequately from AI assistance, then give them harder tasks. Meanwhile, model how your own learning effort is paying off. Note how if they are left with AI-trivial tasks and the benefit of learning remains abstract, we shouldn’t expect anything to change. reply benreesman 14 hours agoprevIt would be pretty awesome if AMD sold aggressively into the data center market, or if NVIDIA sold aggressively into the supercompute market.

The average HN comment including this one has more bugs in it than a patch from an NVIDIA/AMD driver author. But no, they're supposedly just too incompetent to run PyTorch or whatever. Fuck that, the hackers kick ass. This shit is broken because shareholders get more rent when it's broken. reply lhl 12 hours agorootparentHaving spent a fair amount of time over the past few years as someone working on top of both Nvidia and AMD toolchains (and having spent decades working up and down the stack from mcus, mobile device, to webscale stacks), I have an alternative take. I'm smart and experienced enough, and the people working on the toolchains are capable and even smarter, but these systems are just extremely hard/complex. The hardware is buggy, the firmware is buggy, the drivers are buggy, every layer above it (compilers, kernels, multiple layers of frameworks) also all buggy. Add on top of that everyone is implementing as fast as they can, every part is changing constantly, and also a good chunk of the code being used is being written by researchers and grad students. Oh, and the hardware changes dramatically every couple years. Sure all tech is swiss cheese, but this is a particularly unstable/treacherous version of that atm. BTW, shareholders obviously have no idea whether what's being sold works well or not, but there's no financial incentive (in terms of selling stuff/profiting) if your product doesn't even work/work well enough to compete. And if it were so easy, you would see any number of hardware startups take over from the incumbents. Sure there are network effects, but if I could run PyTorch (or really, just train and inference my models easily) faster and cheaper, me, and I assume lots of other people would switch in a heartbeat. The fact that no one (besides Google arguably if you count having to switch all your implementations over for TPUs) has been able to do it, whether they be startups or multi-billion dollar companies (including Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, all who have direct financial incentive to and have been trying), points to the problem being elsewhere. reply benreesman 10 hours agorootparentI’m a bit out of my area on the details: but I have CUDA kernels in PyTorch and I’ve moved around much, much bigger codebases. I write kernels and build others. I don’t doubt that it’s a lot of work to maintain a clean userland and present a good interface with clean link ABIs. The people who pull it off and make it look easy are called names like Linus. But the “everything is buggy” argument is an argument about institutions, not software artifacts. We know how to throw test and fuzz on a component and bang it into shape. Now this is a question of both resources and intention. But NVIDIA’s market cap is like 4 trillion bucks or something.

LLMs seem to be accelerating the trend reply Philpax 6 hours agorootparentOn one hand, I somewhat agree; on the other hand, I think LLMs and similar tooling will allow juniors to punch far beyond their weight and learn and do things that they would have never have dreamed of before. As mentioned in another comment, they're the teacher that never gets tired and can answer any question (with the necessary qualifications about correctness, learning the answer but not the reasoning, etc) It remains to be seen if juniors can obtain the necessary institutional / \"real work\" experience from that, but given the number of self-taught programmers I know, I wouldn't rule it out. reply newsclues 5 hours agorootparentI think many people using llms are faking it and have no interest in “making it”.

    "originBody": "September 26, 2024 Featured Insights When a Crystal Ball Isn’t Enough to Make You Rich By Victor Haghani, James White and Jerry Bell 1 ESTIMATED READING TIME: 10 MIN. Introduction: Back to the Future In the 1989 blockbuster Back to the Future II, time travel enables Michael J. Fox’s nemesis, Biff, to become a gazillionaire by bringing an almanac with sports match outcomes back from the future. We thought it might be instructive, and certainly entertaining, to make a less fanciful version of this dream a reality – for a few lucky people. In November 2023, we ran an in-person, proctored experiment involving 118 young adults trained in finance. We called the experiment “The Crystal Ball Challenge.” We gave each participant $50 and the opportunity to grow that stake by trading in the S&P 500 index and 30-year US Treasury bonds with the information on the front page of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) one day in advance, but with stock and bond price data blacked out. The game covered 15 days, one day for each year from 2008 to 2022. You can play this game for yourself here: Crystal Ball Trading Challenge – though without the pecuniary component. As of the time of writing, over 1,500 people have tested their skill and luck by playing the game on our website. Summary of results The players in the proctored experiment did not do very well, despite having the front page of the newspaper 36 hours ahead of time. About half of them lost money, and one in six actually went bust. The average payout was just $51.62 (a gain of just 3.2%), which is statistically indistinguishable from breaking even. The poor results were a product of: 1) not guessing the direction of stocks and bonds very well, and 2) poor trade-sizing. The players guessed the direction of stocks and bonds correctly on just 51.5% of the roughly 2,000 trades they made. They guessed the direction of bonds correctly 56% of the time, but bet less of their capital on bonds than on stocks (if you’re planning a career as a proprietary macro trader, consider putting your focus on bonds). Perhaps the front page of the WSJ isn’t a particularly clear crystal ball, or our players weren’t very adept at reading it. As former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein reminded us in a widely-circulated tweet, sometimes the markets don’t react to the news as even seasoned experts expect – an important lesson all successful traders learn, eventually. It didn’t help that the players also did not seem to know how to size their bets well. On eight of the 30 trading opportunities,2 the players in aggregate displayed 2-to-1 odds of being correct in their bets, but they did not bet more heavily on those occasions. Overall, they did not display trade-sizing that bore any relation to their propensity to guess the price moves of stocks or bonds correctly. Many of the players used excessive leverage relative to their exhibited edge in guessing market direction. On about 30% of the total number of days on which players traded, they used leverage of greater than 20x capital. On 4% of the total occasions, they used leverage of 60x or higher, which carried a very high probability of being wiped out if they guessed wrong. In sum, there was little discernible logic or rationale to their trade-sizing decisions. See Appendix I for a detailed analysis of player results. Perhaps this excessive risk-taking by some of the players is partially explained by the finding that most investors tend to overestimate the predictive value of news on market outcomes. For example, a recent survey of 11,000 investors by Andre et al.3 found that about 70% of investors (but not finance academics) believed that stale, four-week-old, good (or bad) news was predictive of high (or low) future stock returns. However, our sample of 118 staked and proctored players did better than the roughly 1,500 people who have played the game for fun on our website. The median outcome among these players was a loss of about 30% of their capital. Only 40% finished with a profit, and 36% went bust. We were tickled to see that six players devoted themselves to achieving the maximum possible payout, growing their initial wealth 70,575-fold. They did this by repeatedly playing the game to see what stocks and bonds did on each day, and then using that information to put up the perfect score by correctly betting the maximum size on each trade. We were elated to see our game spark so much passion in some players! Some of the world’s best traders show how to do better We invited five seasoned and successful macro traders – four men, one woman – to play the game, with markedly better results. This was a very select group of traders: head of trading at a top-five US bank, founder of a top-ten macro hedge fund, senior trader at a top-ten macro fund, former senior government bond trader at top-three US primary dealer, and former senior Jane Street trader. These players all finished with gains. On average, they grew their starting wealth by 130%, with a median gain of 60%. All of the players were selective and highly variable in their trade-sizing. They did not bet at all on about 1/3 of the trading opportunities, but bet big on days when they presumably felt confident in the impact of the news on stock or bond prices.4 These veteran traders predicted the direction of the markets significantly better than our 118 younger, less experienced participants (63% vs 51.5%), but mostly we ascribe the dramatically different results to the much more rational trade-sizing displayed by the experienced traders. One important conclusion we reach is that there is little value in this crystal ball without sensible trade-sizing. Motivations In addition to our curiosity in testing Taleb’s hypothesis, we had four further motivations for conducting this experiment: We are deeply interested in learning how people approach the sizing of attractive investment opportunities, having researched and written extensively on this topic. In 2016, we conducted an experiment (also involving financial rewards) where we invited participants to bet on a digital coin flip that was programmed to have a 60% probability of landing on heads, and published our findings in “Betting on a Biased Coin.” We recently wrote a book, The Missing Billionaires: A Guide to Better Financial Decisions, that is focused on investment sizing. We wanted to quantify the value of macro-economic information. How often would people guess the direction of markets from the information on the front page of the WSJ? We hoped that the tool we developed for the experiment could be productively used to educate and train professional risk-takers. It was going to be a lot of fun! The Game Over 90% of the participants were in graduate programs in finance or MBA programs with finance modules at four east coast US universities with low admission rates. The participants were not told in advance that they’d be invited to participate in this experiment. Any who did not want to participate were allowed to leave (though no one did). Here’s how we explained the rules of the game: We are giving you $50 to play our “Crystal Ball” game. The object is to see how well you can do trading stocks and bonds if you know the news from the front page of the WSJ one day in advance. In other words, you’ll be in that dreamed-of position of being a trader who “knows the future.” For example, you will be shown the front page of the WSJ for a Wednesday, and be able to take a long or short position in the stock market and in the bond market at prices prevailing at Monday’s close (that is, two days earlier). Your trades will be liquidated at Tuesday’s closing prices. Note, on each front page we’ve blacked out anything that tells you explicitly what market prices actually did that day – leaving that information in would make this game too easy and no fun at all! You will be trading the S&P 500 stock market index and a 30-year US Treasury bond futures contract, and you can use as much leverage as you’d like to, up to 50x. Use the sliders to choose the positions you want and then click the “Trade” button. Remember that for the 30-year Treasury bonds, prices go down when yields go up, and you are trading on price. You are starting off with $50 of bankroll, and we will pay you however much this has grown to, or shrunk to, with a maximum payout of $100. You will have 45 minutes to play the game. We have not chosen these days to try to trick you – they are randomly chosen. You will be able to trade on 15 different days, once per year over the past 15 years. The days will be presented to you in a randomized order. We’ve chosen these days randomly from a set of days where one third of them are days of employment reports, one third from days of Fed announcements, and the other third purely randomly, all taken from days that are in the top half of days ranked by overall market volatility. You can use the “Skip” button to skip any day you don’t feel like trading, and you can trade stocks, bonds, or both, each day. You can use the “Finish” button if you want to stop before being presented with all 15 days. Leverage of 1x means your position size is equal to your capital size. There are no transaction costs or overnight financing costs or rebates on your trades. Good luck, and have fun – you may never have this opportunity again! Below are two pictures of the screens that players engaged with. In the first screen, the player can expand the picture of the front page of the WSJ on the left to be able to read it more clearly, then revert to the trading page. Then, after clicking “Trade” the result of the trade is revealed, showing the market move in stocks and bonds, and the resultant profit or loss. The player’s bankroll is expressed based off of a starting value of $1 million, but the players understood that their payout would be $50 times the ending wealth divided by $1 million, with a minimum of $0 and a maximum of $100. All the front pages can be seen here, in chronological order: https://elmwealth.com/crystal-ball-gallery/ Conclusion “He who lives by the crystal ball will eat shattered glass.” — Ray Dalio Was Taleb correct in his conjecture that “If you give an investor the next day’s news 24 hours in advance, he would go bust in less than a year”? While our experiment didn’t test his statement precisely – we only gave players 15 days of front pages, players were risking just $100 in the game, etc. – by and large we think Taleb is right. His counterintuitive proposition is both insightful and instructive. The financial industry is replete with individuals and organizations constantly working to develop their own proprietary crystal balls. We hope that the experiment and results described herein convince crystal ball makers that sensible investment-sizing is essential to realizing the value of what they are trying to build. The poor aggregate showing of our 118 financially-trained participants highlights the importance of educating young, aspiring finance industry professionals in decision-making under uncertainty, and particularly the theory and art of investment-sizing. We hope our Crystal Ball game will be a helpful tool – or a prototype for a better one – that educators and financial firms can use to teach these concepts and skills. Perhaps it may even become part of the hedge fund boot camp training programs at Citadel, Point72, Balyasny, and Jane Street that have been in the news recently.5 The uniformly positive results of the five experienced macro traders we invited to play the game suggest that there are teachable skills involved in successful discretionary investing. Perhaps Matt Levine foresaw the results of our experiment with his article titled: “Knowing the Future Isn’t That Helpful.”6 He describes a delightful academic study that analyzed the trading results of a cartel of investors with an excellent, albeit illicit, crystal ball.7 The traders bought earnings announcements before they were released from an international hacker group that illegally obtained access to the servers of three commercial newswire companies. These traders were sophisticated and their crystal ball was gem quality, but their batting average was far from perfect – though it was still good enough to make a decent return on their capital…before they were caught by the SEC! Most stories involving people seeing into the future, like that of the trading cartel above, don’t have “happily ever after” endings. There are usually unintended consequences that come with perfect prescience – a reminder that even prophets can’t escape risk and uncertainty. The best we mortals can do is make our decisions with a framework that explicitly accounts for the presence of risk in just about every big choice we face. If you haven’t already, you can play the game here: Crystal Ball Trading Challenge Appendix I: Detailed Analysis of Player Results Below is a chart showing the distribution of payouts to the players. The average payout was $51.62 per player, representing a weighted average return across all the players of 3.2%.8 About half (45%) the players lost money, and 16% went bust, about the same as the 20% that maxed out at $100. We suspect most readers will agree with us in rating this performance “not very impressive.” It seems that getting the front page of not-any-old-newspaper, but the WSJ, 36 hours ahead of time (albeit with market moves redacted) may not be as valuable as many of us might have imagined. An experienced market participant is likely able to extract more information from the front page of the WSJ than someone with less experience, such as the participants in our experiment. Even though direct reporting of market moves was blacked out, journalists often report the news biased by how markets reacted after the news. For example, they’ll refer to an employment report as “weak” if the bond market rallies after the report, even if the actual report is more ambiguous – for example, a slightly low number of jobs created, countered by a drop in the unemployment rate and a rise in hourly earnings. The players forecast the correct direction of stocks and bonds 51.5% of the time. With stocks, they got the correct direction on 48.2% of their trades, and on 56.2% of the bond trades. Notice there were four days where more than 70% of the players forecast the correct direction of the market, and 10 days when more than 60% were correct. However, the players placed 40% more trades in stocks than bonds, which is unfortunate given the players had a better realized edge with bonds than stocks. The table below describes each of the 15 trading opportunities and shows how many trades the players placed on each of the days and what percentage of the trades were placed in the correct direction: long when the market went up and short when it went down. The next table puts the focus on trade-sizing. It shows the average leverage used for each trading day for stock and bond trades, and also the averages conditional on being higher than 5x leverage. Average leverage used in stock and bond trades was 13x and 10x respectively, and two times as much – 22x and 20x – for trades where leverage was greater than 5x. We calculated the correlation of leverage (i.e. trade size) for each day versus the win percent for each day, and found a zero correlation in the case of stock trades and a -0.1 correlation for bond trades, along with a +0.2 and -0.1 conditional on leverage used being greater than 5x. It seems that our players on average did not follow a strategy of placing bigger trades on those that they had a higher probability of getting right. Perhaps this is due to them not knowing which ones they had a higher probability of getting right, or perhaps they were not following a disciplined sizing strategy. The players traded 2,067 times, for an average of about 18 trades per player. The maximum number of trades each player could have made is 30, which would entail doing a stock and bond trade for every front page. Some of the 40% shortfall versus the maximum number of trades is due to 16% of the players going bust, but most of the shortfall is from players abstaining from trading opportunities. Players were more apt to take long positions in stock and bonds; they traded stocks 62.5% of the time as a long position, and 59.6% of the time for bonds. About 10% and 8% of the players were long stocks and bonds, respectively, for every trade they made.9 Unpacking player performance What accounts for the underwhelming 3.2% return of the players? The fact that our players guessed the direction of stocks and bonds correctly only 51.5% of the time seems to be a pretty big handicap to overcome. It seems the front page of the WSJ wasn’t a particularly clear type of crystal ball for our players to read, and/or they weren’t very good at reading it. However, even with their weak ability to read the tea leaves, the players could have done quite a bit better if they applied a sensible and constant amount of leverage to all their trades. It would have been reasonable for the players to have estimated the daily standard deviation of stocks and bonds, given our description of how we chose the 15 days, at around 1.5% – 2% for stocks and 1% – 1.5% for bonds. They might have then considered that there could easily be a two or three sigma event in the sample, and so the maximum amount of leverage they could use with a low likelihood of being wiped out might have been 8x for equities and 12x for bonds, if betting on both at the same time. With that maximum leverage in mind, the next step would be to find the optimal size, subject to the maximum constraint above, given their view of the expected return and risk of the trades.10 One reasonable choice would have been to apply the Kelly criterion. While the implicit risk-aversion embedded in the Kelly criterion is lower than most people’s risk-aversion with regard to their total wealth, it is reasonable to use it here given the amount of money involved was small relative to the players’ total wealth. If the players felt they had a 55% chance of being right (an overestimate, as it turned out), that would have suggested something like 6x leverage for stocks and 8x leverage for bonds,11 assuming profits on these trades would be uncorrelated. The optimal size would be a bit lower assuming some positive, but not perfect, correlation in trade outcomes. If the players had all changed their trade-sizing such that they leveraged all their trades as suggested above (6x for stocks and 8x for bonds), they’d have generated an average return of 10%. Another sign that this is better sizing of trades is that outcomes amongst the players would have had about 45% less dispersion: only 4% of the players would have lost more than 50% of their stake, compared to about 28% in the actual trial. None would have lost more than 75%, and hence, none would have gone bust – recall that 16% of our participants did just that. So, the participants in aggregate would have done better with more reasoned trade-sizing, particularly on the downside…but not tremendously better (and we’d have been 7% more out-of-pocket). The actual leverage used by participants was, on average, much higher than 6x and 8x for stocks and bonds – generally, people tended to use more leverage in their stock trades than in their bond trades, which is inconsistent with stocks being more volatile than bonds combined with their ability to forecast stock movements being weaker than their skill in guessing bond movements. As can be seen in the chart below, on about 30% of the days that players traded, they used leverage greater than 20x, and on 4% of the days, they used total leverage of 60x or higher. And on 17 occasions – just over 1% of days traded – players went for 100x leverage, which exposed the player to close to a 50% chance of total loss of capital. It seems clear that there was a fair amount of over-sizing of trades. However, a much bigger improvement could have been attained from the players doing a better job discerning when they had a more accurate reading of the future. If they’d scaled their trades bigger when they were more likely to be right, they’d have done much better, but it’s hard to know if, on the days when a high percentage of players put on the correct trades, if they really did have a stronger conviction that they were going to be right. It was clear which days were employment and Fed announcement days, and it turns out that the players were more accurate in their readings for bond movements on those days with a 58% hit ratio, while on the other third of the days they only had a 50% hit ratio. The players also could have done much better if they had based their forecasts on a simple set of rules around the news that was on those front pages. They’d have been correct about 60% of the time if they had shorted bonds whenever the balance of news items was in the direction of a stronger economy, higher inflation, higher energy prices, a stronger Euro or a less accommodating Fed, and vice versa for the opposite news. For stocks, players also would have been correct about 60% of the time if they went long stocks when the balance of news items was in the direction of stronger economy, lower inflation, higher energy prices, a stronger Euro or a more accommodating Fed, and if they went short stocks when the balance of news items was in the opposite direction. There were several days when there was no news of the above variety or there were an equal number of news items on each side of the ledger. In those cases, abstaining from trading would have been a sensible decision. The table below shows the results from applying the simple trade decision rules described above for direction and sizing. This approach had a success rate of 58% for stocks and 64% for bonds, resulting in an average 6.1% return on each trading day and a 2.4x growth of the bankroll. As a further test of our hypothesis that this Crystal Ball would bear fruit for players with more experience in connecting news to markets and in sensible trade-sizing, we had five senior bank and hedge fund traders play this game.12 Their average end wealth was 2.3x their starting wealth, ranging from 1.2x to 5.6x. None went bust, and their average trade success ratio was about 63%. As was the case with the main sample of players, these experienced traders also did substantially better with bonds (71% correct) than with stocks (56%). Appendix II: Putting a value on the crystal ball How much should an investor be willing to pay for a crystal ball that gives them the front page of the WSJ one day in advance, on 15 high-volatility days? In general, when investors are allocating their capital to attractive opportunities with optimal sizing, the risk-adjusted return they are expecting to earn is roughly one half of the expected return.13 Let’s say that, when we do a trade, the average expected return to risk ratio of the trades is 0.2. This is twice as high as we were suggesting for our participants, and consistent with a 60% chance of getting the direction of the market correct. For an investor with a typical degree of risk-aversion,14 he should risk 10% of his capital on a one standard deviation outcome of such a trade, assuming the trade is uncorrelated with the rest of his investments.15 His expected return on the trade is then 2% (0.2 * 10% = 2%), and his risk-adjusted return is about 1% per trade. In practice, there needs to be a further reduction for managing the leverage that will be employed, but let’s leave that to the side for the purposes of this example. The final step is to estimate how many times we expect the crystal ball to give us useful news. Let’s say it’s 75% of the time. Then, our risk-adjusted wealth grows by 1% for each of the 24 trades we expect to do, resulting in certainty-equivalent wealth 1.27x our initial wealth (1.0124 = 1.27). This tells us that the most we can pay for this crystal ball is 21% of our wealth (1 – 1/1.27 = 21%). Another useful perspective on the value of the crystal ball is to compare the risk-adjusted value of getting the newspaper in advance once per year versus being able to invest in the stock market for the whole year. The Sharpe ratio of one day’s trades driven by the crystal ball reading is around 0.2 – 0.3 (perhaps much less depending on who is doing the reading) which is less than what most people believe is the typical Sharpe ratio of one year’s worth of investing in the stock market. Appendix III: Caveats and shortcomings of this study As with most studies involving paying relatively nominal sums to university students, it’s natural that players’ behavior with a $50 starting bankroll would be very different from how they would use this crystal ball if they could trade on their total wealth. Players may have done much better if they’d been given company-specific information ahead of time and been allowed to trade individual stocks with that information. Several players told us that they felt the crystal ball would have been much more useful if they knew more about the context of the front page news, in particular what the market was primarily concerned about at the time. The maximum leverage allowed in our game is higher than most investors can access through futures. However, out-of-the-money options do provide a viable alternative, though with considerably higher costs. Also, we assumed that the players could hold on to their trades until the following day’s close. It’s possible that in some cases, the intraday move in the markets may have wiped out the player’s capital before the next close. In practice, it is unlikely investors would leverage their total wealth without a limit on the worst-case outcome they could experience. Two effective ways to limit losses from leveraged investments are: 1) putting the trades in a limited liability vehicle, where losses are limited to the capital therein, or 2) buy short-term out-of-the-options to limit the maximum loss on the leveraged trades. Option 1 has the drawback that it may not be possible to get the desired amount of leverage, and Option 2 involves the costs associated with the options contracts.

The average player return is 0% if we account for the busted players finishing with a debit balance, but of no more than 25% of their starting capital. The average return would go from 0% to 3.8% if we also capped player outcomes at +125% rather than +100%. These players seemed to be expressing a view that the WSJ front page from the future held no valuable information. Or perhaps they were heeding another warning from Taleb: “To bankrupt a fool, give him information.” from The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms. For a fuller discussion of trade-sizing, see chapters 2 – 7 of our book, The Missing Billionaires: A Guide to Better Financial Decisions. Wiley. (2023). For Kelly, we use SR / σ, using SR = 0.1, daily σstocks = 1.75% and σbonds = 1.25%, giving us stocks at 0.1 / .0175 = 6x, and bonds at 0.1 / .0125 = 8x.

Twice as risk-averse as implied by the Kelly criterion. And that the outcomes are normally distributed, and that he can rebalance his exposure to keep his leverage constant.

It's not enough to know what happens, everyone else needs to \"do the right thing\" in a short time horizon. As the article says, that doesn't happen a lot. b) WSJ isn't as good a new source as it used to be, which makes the game harder.

Somewhere along the line (and I have my hypothesis as many do…) our news sources stopped being objective, stopped seeking truth, stopped being sourced for bringing real information to the consuming public, and instead became a kind of echo chamber for dogmatic ideology of one kind or another.

It doesn't matter WSJ, NYT, WaPo, LAT, Trib, all garbage. When I started to see grammar mistakes and typos in the NYT, I knew it was over. They were optimizing for clicks not correctness. The infotainment that started on TV and the destruction of revenue by aggregation has created an environment where largescale news as it was is not profitable (enough), but clickbait is. There may be individual journalists who care, but not a single senior editor that does. We have achieved post truth media.

He Isn’t Budging. - Untangling America’s Love-Hate Relationship With Corporate Power Etc, it doesn't really tell you much anything about what's going on in the market.

There's an SF book called Replay that imagines a guy reliving his life from his fifties or so to his teens or so. One of the clever plot points (not really a spoiler) is that he just happens to remember a highly improbable sports result around the time of his replay which, with the help of some friends and family loans, makes him very wealthy. The book would have been a lot less interesting if the main characterer was just starting out as a poor college student over and over again. Sure, I could have made money in dot-com/bomb (and maybe bitcoin) but I still would have needed a fair bit of capital to have made life-altering gains. To the point of the article, predicting how most specific company or economic outcomes will affect stock prices is pretty much a sucker bet. Perhaps excluding some specific events like 9/11--but even that effect wasn't that great. reply didgetmaster 1 hour agorootparentBitcoin is not a good example for your argument. The first bitcoin transaction for a physical good was in 2010 where 10K of bitcoin was used to buy a couple pizzas.

Take interest rates for example: Lowering rates means that money will be cheaper (good!) but that the fed see's slower economic times ahead(bad!). So now you need to put the decision on context, which adds a whole host of assumptions and estimates. Both sides have a strong logical argument for stocks moving up or down. So you end up with traders voting with their dollars once the news drops, and it is not (practically) possible to know which group has more firing power going into the print. It's also not uncommon for a stock to tank the moment the news drops, and then skyrocket seconds later (or the inverse).

I think something interesting about the news and its supposedly predictive power is that the market already discount the news. If you look at the daily and weekly charts for SP500, it has been on a bill run, for a bunch of unknowable factors but I suspect one of them is the expected rate cut from the fed. Now, if the cut was, for example 50 bsp, instead of 25 that would be news indeed, but the again, last rate cut the prices jump sharply exactly at 1 PM EST, meaning that computers, not humans, read the report and placed hundreds of orders in milliseconds after the report was released. IMHO knowing the future 1 day ahead is not enough because in that timeframe the market has already discounted the news. reply cabby 6 hours agoparentThe market isn't some kind of oracle.

Here's how the market makers might \"front run\" orders to make arbitrage profits: ## The Fruit Stand Scenario Imagine you're at a large farmer's market with numerous fruit stands. You're looking to buy a crate of apples, and you ask a friendly fruit stand owner, Citadel, for the price. *The Setup:* - You want to buy a crate of apples - Citadel’s stand is selling apples for $50 per crate - There's another stand nearby selling for $48, but it's not immediately visible *The Front-Running Process:* 1. *Information Advantage:* Citadel, being a regular at the market, knows about the nearby stand selling apples for $48. 2. *Customer's Intent:* When you ask Citadel for the price, they realizes you're likely to buy a crate. 3. *Quick Action:* Before quoting you a price, Citadel quickly sends his assistant to buy a crate from the $48 stand. 4. *Price Quote:* Citadel then tells you his price is $50 per crate, which you accept. 5. *Fulfillment:* Citadel’s assistant returns with the $48 crate, which Citadel then sells to you for $50. 6. *Profit:* Citadel pockets the $2 difference as profit, without ever risking his own inventory. ## The Market Making Parallel In the financial markets, this process happens at lightning speed: 1. Market makers see incoming orders before they're fully processed. 2. They quickly buy or sell ahead of large orders on other exchanges. 3. They then fulfill the original order at a slightly worse price. 4. The profit comes from the price difference between exchanges. This practice, while controversial, is often justified by market makers as providing liquidity and tighter spreads. However, it can be seen as unfair to traders who may not get the best possible price for their orders. reply kzrdude 3 hours agorootparentWhy would it be legal for market makers to use order info like that? reply nkurz 4 hours agorootparentprevNice write up! Can you flesh out your example a little bit with more specifics about how the stock market version works?

Or are they committing to sell before they buy from the cheaper source on the assumption it will still be available? And is selling order flow something different, or the same thing here? reply hckrnrd 4 hours agorootparentSelling order flow is a related but distinct practice: - Order Flow Sales: This involves brokers selling information about their customers’ orders to interested parties. - Potential for Front-Running: While not inherently front-running, selling order flow can enable it if the buyers use this information to trade ahead of customer orders. - Payment for Order Flow: This practice allows some brokers to offer commission-free trades, as they make money by routing orders to specific market makers. Front-runners do take on some risk, but it’s typically minimal: - Speed: Modern front-running often occurs using high-frequency trading algorithms, minimizing the time between the front-runner’s trade and the large order execution. - Committed Orders: Front-runners act on knowledge of committed orders, not mere possibilities.
