No screen, no controller, and absolutely no sense, just a power button and a USB port. “ One of those terrible ideas that I am so glad someone tried ” Some guy on reddit But… Why? TL;DR Well, the Steam Deck didn’t fit in my backpack… The Steam Deck has been a game changer for travel, but I found myself leaving it behind more often than not, as it wouldn’t fit in my backpack, took up a huge amount of carry-on space, and was a hassle to bring down from the overhead compartment when I wanted to use it. When I did use the Deck, it was either plugged in to AR Glasses (XReal Air 2 Pro) or plugged in to a TV. So, I got to thinking: it could be so much smaller and lighter without the build in controller and screen, but that would be ridiculous, right? …right? ⚠ Disclaimer “I am not a smart man” This project was not approved or endorsed in any way by Valve and is generally a very bad idea. I’m honestly surprised it worked and have no idea how long the modified console will survive. The following is provided “as is” and without any expressed or implied warranty. If you choose to attempt this do so at your own risk. Be warned that are likely to “brick” (as in destroy, but pun intended) your console and you might get hurt in the process (lithium batteries and power tools are dangerous, among other things). This is not a guide, more of a “how I did it”. If there’s enough interest, I might expand this to a more step-by-step style write-up.

Getting Started First of all – huge shoutout to iFixIt for their great Steam Deck Repair Guides as well as to Valve for supporting the DIY repair and mod community! This mod was performed on a 1TB OLED Steam Deck, there are some differences between the OLED and LCD models. The first hurdle on this ridiculous road was figuring out if the Steam Deck would even boot without any peripherals or a screen attached. Working off the battery replacement and motherboard replacement tutorials was able disconnect everything from the motherboard other than the fan – success! In this state the Deck will boot output display over USB and accept peripherals via an external dock. Internals This initial teardown also revealed a useful aluminum(?) frame, unfortunately, you’ll have to remove the screen [link] to remove it from the shell. This shell had some unnecessary “wings” so of course they had to be removed with a rotary tool. With the excess metal removed, I had the perfect internal frame for the Brick. Note that some of the fan and motherboard cover screws are outer-shell screws which must be added back so everything is properly held in place. I probably should have removed or masked out the fan before grinding away the metal… Case Using my limited CAD abilities, I designed a rudimentary shell for the Brick. The shell has two pegs to align the board and you can add a dollop of PLA with a 3d printing pen to further secure the board to the case. There’s a cutout in the case to accommodate the original power button, and the air intake is sized to accept the metal grill from the original back shell. I printed out the case in Overture Polycarbonate Pro (PC) [link] which should be heat-resistant enough not to melt while the deck attempts to run Cyberpunk 2077. Color accents were added in PLA with a 3D printing pen. Note: The 3rd antenna is missing in this photo, which I reattached later. Result And there it is, in all its glory: the Steam Brick! About a 3rd of the size of the Deck, and about 4 times smaller than the Deck’s OEM case. As a bonus, it’s also 24% lighter! FAQ Why remove the screen? It wouldn’t have made the build larger! Keeping the screen would have significantly complicated the build, as you’d need something to keep in in place. More importantly – the brick was built to be tossed in a bag as-is. No case, no screen protector, just throw it in a backpack or suitcase and don’t worry about it! Why did you do this again? Because I was so preoccupied with whether or not I could that I didn’t stop to think if I should. Hardware The build includes: 4x 3M heat set inserts 4x 20mm 3M screws Known Issue Accessing the BIOS is currently impossible as it requires holding down the ‘+’ button while powering up, and that button isn’t included in the build. Haven’t found a workaround yet. It’s difficult to tell if the Brick is on or not – as the Deck’s indicator light doesn’t indicate on/off status Resources STL Files for case Affiliate Links Want to support this project?

May not work on other init systems, but SteamOS is based on Arch with systemd. reply jethro_tell 2 hours agoparentSystemd systems can still have grub as a boot loader. In that case, you can usually set the boot order with bootctl and reboot. reply andrewaylett 20 hours agoprevThis is brilliant. When I was in sixth-form, a friend built a portable case containing a micro-ATX motherboard. No battery, but he could sit down at any of the school computers, plug into the wall, and use its peripherals with his PC. That was more than 25 years ago, I feel old now. reply choult 18 hours agoparentFor the non-Brits, \"sixth-form\" means years 12 and 13 of school equivalent to junior and senior years of high school in the US. The first and second yearsof sixth form are referred to as \"lower sixth\" and \"upper sixth\" respectively. It's a hold-over term from when secondary education (ages 11 and up) started in \"first form\" and worked up. reply brookst 16 hours agorootparentThanks for the explanation but it shattered the narrative by mind was building about an alien intelligence that slipped up and posted about its memories of its sixth physical form, the result of its fifth metamorphosis. reply schwartzworld 3 hours agorootparentOp is a Pak Protector reply tommica 7 hours agorootparentprevI was thinking the poster was a JRPG boss reply xvector 14 hours agorootparentprevThis is pretty much exactly what was going through my mind as well. I was excited the aliens had started reading HN. Now I'm just sad. reply mgaunard 9 hours agorootparentprevInterestingly enough, the French do it the other way around, and start counting from the final year (they also start at 0 so it's offset by one). That's arguably a better system since you can keep adding earlier and earlier years (mandatory school starting age has drifted from 11 to 6 to 3 over the years) while keeping everything consistent. Unfortunately they messed it up in 1959 by renaming 12th to 7th and giving matching names to the new 13th/14th. reply olivierduval 8 hours agorootparentActually, it's more complex than this in France. There is 5 systems: depending of the Ministry of Eduction : for toddlers : maternelle (3-6 yo) Primary : CP (6 yo, primary), CE1 (elementary 1), CE2, CM1 (middle 1), CM2 Secondary : College (not the US one!) : 6th (~11 yo), 5th, 4th, 3th (with exam at the end) Lycée : 2nd (~15 yo), 1st, Terminal (with 'Baccalauréat' exam at the end) then depending of Ministry of Research : University or Post BAC schools However, I think that in some other french-talking countries (Belgium, Swissland) they did it simpler reply mgaunard 8 hours agorootparentMaternelle years also have names: PSM, MSM, GSM. GSM, PS, CE1, CE2, CM1, CM2 used to be called 12th to 7th, as I said. Your primary classification is incorrect maternelle is part of primary. Non-maternelle primary is called elementary. reply makapuf 4 hours agorootparentprevThat's for classic education (General, when you want to make longer studies), there are also professional or technical Lycée) reply eloisant 7 hours agorootparentprevThe P in CP doesn't stand for \"primary\" but for \"preparatory\" reply fhars 6 hours agorootparentprevNothing compared to the order I went through in Germany: 1, 2, 3, 4 (elementary school until here), then VI (read in Latin, sexta), V (quinta), IV (quarta), lower III (tertia), upper III, lower II (secunda), 11, 1st semester, 2nd semester, 3rd semester, 4th semester. reply ajmurmann 2 hours agorootparentDoes anyone still use these Latin terms? When I went to school in the 90s and early 00s we just counted from 1st to 12 and university just was it's own thing and how many semesters you were in didn't matter that much because there was no class structure. reply Fnoord 7 hours agorootparentprevFrench and Brits do a lot of things the other way around, like imperial system, ATON/NATO, driving on the other side of the road. Just mentioned the age bracket. Kids who are younger or older are outliers. reply smorrow 6 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you mean \"hold-over\"? In NI we still say \"first year\" through \"fifth year\". Is that not done in Britain? reply esskay 6 hours agorootparentTypically no. In secondary school its just said as \"Year 7\", \"Year 8\" etc to 11, then Sixth Form. reply virtualwhys 15 hours agorootparentprevIn the US, for schools that use this form of grading, it means your senior year; 3rd form is freshman year and so on. We tend not to have a 13th grade, and when that does exist, a PG (post grad) is generally there because they excel at a particular sport. reply jonp888 10 hours agorootparentIn Britain the first high school graduation happens after 11th grade; attending sixth form is optional and is primarily done by students intending to study at University. In these years you specialise in a couple of subjects relevant to your intended course of study, and for university you apply and are accepted for and study exclusively one subject from day 1. So arguably the US equalivalent is the freshman year of college. reply billyoyo 7 hours agorootparentJust to clarify this as well, while sixth form (17~18 years old) is optional in the UK, education is still compulsory until you're 18. you have the option to do this at an apprenticeship or skills based school but lots of people do just default to a levels. reply abanana 7 hours agorootparent> in the UK, education is still compulsory until you're 18 I've just looked it up because I hadn't heard this it was only compulsory until 16 \"in my day\"! Turns out it still is, here in Wales, and also Scotland and NI. Only England changed it to 18.

So I would say no. reply viciousvoxel 10 hours agorootparentI'm American and I have heard \"super senior\" and seen it used in print. Go figure. reply carb 10 hours agorootparentprevIt's certainly a real term. The context is often student athletes that intentionally didn't play their sport for a season (called redshirting) to maintain their 4-year eligibility so that they can stay for a fifth year and compete in their sport. reply kisonecat 5 hours agorootparentprevI'm a college prof in the US and know that term. reply NikkiA 16 hours agorootparentprevAnd should be noted that 25 years ago, was still optional. reply madaxe_again 5 hours agorootparentprevSixth form is hardly the oddest name for a year, though. Shell, remove, fifth, 6b, 6a at my school, and quite a few others. reply imoreno 16 hours agorootparentprevForm of what? reply swarnie 8 hours agorootparentAm educational form, an antiquated word for a bench. reply nlawalker 18 hours agoparentprevI did this for a while in college ~20 years ago with the original Mac Mini, it worked pretty well. A little clunky given multiple things to plug in but it was nice to have your entire environment with you locally. reply robertlagrant 33 minutes agoprevThere are two types of technical blog post. One explains to you from a great towering height of immense knowledge how good it felt to use to use npm install and here's why that's exciting, and this is the other type. Written with many apologies for barely being able to do anything while doing everything better than I ever could. reply spacemarine1 17 hours agoprevInterestingly, Steam’s first hardware product was a Steam Box: a little computer brick that could boot Steam on linux and let you play all your games on your TV (with a Steam controller or game controller of your choice). The cycle is now complete. reply geoffpado 16 hours agoparentThe history is a bit more complicated than that. Valve themselves never released a “Steam Box” that could run games on Linux. They partnered with a few different companies (Alienware, Gigabyte, etc.), who released co-branded “Steam Machines” which were just those companies’s normal hardware design, but with a common set of specs ideal for running SteamOS. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Machine_%28computer%29 You might instead be thinking of the Steam Link, which *was* produced by Valve, and *was* a tiny little brick that let you play games on your TV. But the Link wasn’t running the games itself, it was streaming them from a dedicated PC (which may itself have been a third-party Steam Machine) elsewhere in your home. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Link reply swores 15 hours agorootparent> \"which were just those companies’s normal hardware design\" For Alienware (not sure about the others, but AW was Valve's lead partner on it anyway) you're right in that it was a computer designed by Alienware not Valve, however it was a) very different to other Alienware PCs, and b) Valve were genuinely part of the development process, they didn't just say \"hey make a small computer\". They also shipped with the first gen of Steam controllers, which were created by Valve themselves. (Unfortunately, due to delays with SteamOS, the first version of the AW \"Steam Machine\" actually launched running Windows only, but with the Steam Controller, because Alienware weren't willing to delay their launch further and instead developed their own controller-based UI for Windows in a rush job...) (Source: me, I was in the loop on those goings on at the time.) To this day, I think the Alienware Alpha (as the Windows version got called) was one of the nicest machines Dell ever made and one of the best small PCs I've ever seen. reply ok_dad 10 hours agorootparent> first gen of Steam controllers, which were created by Valve themselves The best goddamn controllers ever made, too, I still have one in a box somewhere around here and I won't use it because it's so awesome I don't want it to break. Pretty dumb eh? The two touchpads were the absolute best, I've never had control like that in an FPS and to this day I can't play any FPS with a stick because I was ruined on the Steam Controller. reply alias_neo 2 hours agorootparentFunny how people differ in that regard. It's the absolute worst controller I've ever used (Joy-Cons are a close second). I didn't use it because I hated it so much, put it straight back in the box after a few days of trying to use it and eventually I sold it for as much as I paid, and I was glad to see the back of it. The size/shape of the controller as a whole was fantastic but I just really hated only having touchpads instead of sticks, and that made it unusable. reply swores 10 hours agorootparentprev100% agree. I still can't believe it didn't become a long running product that everyone uses. I've never been a console/controller gamer, but I remember the first time I saw it it was an early fake, that looked and felt very similar to the end product but inside it just had a metal weight and no actual electronics, and it seemed like such an exciting product, it was genuinely hard to keep that secret... (And come to think of it, I think I misremembered when writing my last comment I might be wrong, but I think the Alienware Alpha that launched with Windows actually shipped with an Xbox controller, and the steam controller was only available once the proper Steam Machine version was out. Not 100% sure, maybe we just needed the Xbox controllers for the press sessions before launch...) reply geoffpado 4 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps I am unfairly lumping Alienware in with some of the other Steam Machines, which very much did look almost identical to their manufacturer’s other PCs at the time. As someone who at the time was VERY into buying the “console-like” PC gaming experience that Valve was seemingly selling, I remember being pretty disappointed not just by the SteamOS delays, but also how much most of the Steam Machines still basically looked, to me as an uninformed buyer, at least, to basically just be a different SKU of their regular lines rather than the true “Steam experience” that I was hoping for (and which the Steam Deck eventually delivered). reply hinkley 52 minutes agorootparentprevI’m using the controller I got with my Steam link for the Steam deck. Had to find a friend with a Windows box to run a firmware update to make it entirely Bluetooth compatible. But it works. reply dynamite-ready 12 hours agorootparentprevI suppose the missing part of the story is why they held back on pursuing this market. At the time, the console market was wide open, with little innovation in terms of hardware, until Nintendo released the Switch. Even now, I'd be quite happy to own a Valve branded, small form PC that plugs into a TV. The Steam Link was a kop out to me. reply qwytw 1 hour agorootparentI guess Proton/Wine/Linux gaming wasn't mature enough back then. Also a handheld wasn't really an option because there weren't any powerful enough yet energy efficient and cheap x86 chips available either. reply genewitch 4 hours agorootparentprevI still use my steam link all the time. I have it fiber back hauled to the computer that it runs off of. I'm thinking of buying a couple more. Give one to my kid and one put on a projector so I don't have to keep moving it back and forth. Also, I think the device you're looking for is a deck because you can plug that into a television and use a wireless remote with it. The steam link is the best remote display device I've ever used. No frame drops or artifacting, even on scenes that make the 3090 chug. It forwards controllers to the PC. Now, the software, \"big picture mode\" and otherwise using a controller for PC input aren't the greatest, but you gotta figure it's me and like 2 other people still using this. BTW airscreen/miracaat/screen mirroring/\"wireless display\" all suck. If your TV has smart bullt in that supports miracast, that in my limited experience is the second lowest latency, then firetv devices, and then roku and everything else. Roku only usable for presentation or digital signage, unless first party built in. No idea why. reply catlikesshrimp 3 hours agorootparentI have used an old sony bravia tv to cast COD from an android phone. Every time I connected, latency varied from 100 200 ms to 10 seconds. I had to reconnect several times until the latency was satisfactory. Conclusion: it has been technically possible to cast to a tv for some years. reply SteveNuts 17 hours agoparentprevThey really did a good job slowly experimenting with hardware working their way up to the Deck. First the steam box then the controller, I’m sure they learned a lot from both of those before they released the deck. reply Jolter 7 hours agorootparentThere were many years between the Steam Controller (2015) and the Deck(2022). I’m not sure how much of those learnings could still be applied, considering changing technology as well as staff changes. Maybe Valve has such excellent staff retention that this would be a non-issue. At my previous employers, two years would have been enough to have to start over from 0. reply Fnoord 7 hours agoprevBefore performing a mod like this (or generally opening up your device) put your device in battery safe mode [1] [1] https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Enable+Steam+Deck+Batter... reply alias_neo 2 hours agoparentI've disassembled LOTS of devices in my time, and never knew this was a feature that could be used after the initial purchase. For some years now I've known certain devices like laptops won't power on when bought until first plugged in, but I didn't realise that it could be enabled intentionally after the fact. Typically the first thing I do when I open a device is remove the battery, so accidental button presses (like i-fixit lists) as the reason for it are a non-issue. reply SharpestBulb 5 hours agoparentprevNo reply ekimekim 19 hours agoprevThis isn't all that different to how I use my gaming PC it's off in another room, with a monitor that is plugged in but almost always off (I don't think Windows will boot without at least something plugged in?), Steam set to start on boot, and then I entirely use it via Steam Remote Play from my main PC. reply daemoens 18 hours agoparentYou could get a dummy HDMI plug for $3 on Amazon and free up that monitor if you need it. [1] [1] https://www.amazon.com/BKFK-HDMI-Dummy-Plug-3840x2160/dp/B0C... reply ekimekim 10 hours agorootparentI do use it occasionally mostly when Windows has thrown up some issue stopping Steam from working properly. eg. I need to dismiss a dialog that is invisible over remote play, or it won't finish logging in until I close a \"finish setting up your windows install\" screen. reply genewitch 4 hours agorootparentGo to the gaming machine and upgrade it to > home or edu version if needed. Enable remote desktop with auth on your network for that machine. As long as Windows is booted and able to be logged in to on the gaming machine you can go on your other machine: Win+R mstsc.exe and put in the gaming machine's name or IP and follow the instructions, checking all \"remember this\" boxes (there's 2, three if you count the certificate). RDP won't let you play games but it is functionally identical to sitting at the machine itself. reply distantsounds 4 hours agorootparentprevconsider a different remote access option i.e. sunshine + moonlight instead of using steam remote play reply alias_neo 2 hours agorootparentCan confirm, Sunshine + Moonlight are a killer combination. I run a Windows VM on one of my servers for some gaming because I don't run Window's otherwise, and with Sunshine on the VM, I can play with moonlight from my TV, laptop, desktop, phone, ROG Ally (Bazzite), tablet, basically anything that can support Moonlight. reply reddalo 18 hours agorootparentprevI still don't understand why operating systems can't properly work without a screen. I have a Linux \"home server\" and I haven't found a way to boot up a graphical session with everything working (there were bugs in some applications, like menus not showing up, you couldn't change resolution, etc.). A dummy HDMI plug fixed it, but still. It's 2025, come on. reply shepherdjerred 17 hours agorootparentYou can definitely run graphical environments without a screen in a virtual environment, e.g. https://github.com/selkies-project/docker-nvidia-egl-desktop which is even GPU accelerated reply Rohansi 17 hours agorootparentprevParsec has a driver which adds virtual monitors so you should be able to use that instead of a dummy HDMI plug. Another issue is not having a mouse plugged in will mean you have no mouse cursor when remoting in. reply packtreefly 15 hours agorootparent> not having a mouse plugged in will mean you have no mouse cursor when remoting in. Parsec has a setting to fix that too. Look in the host options. reply Fnoord 7 hours agorootparentprevBack in days (around twenty years ago) I used NoMachine on Debian/SPARC to do exactly this: run GNOME remotely.

But Steam Link mirrors your display, and so doesn’t work without one. reply gaudystead 17 hours agorootparentI built a NUC running Windows 11 into a tiny portable server for a project I was building and can confirm it boots and functions just fine without being plugged into a monitor. I just plug it into a power source and it does what I need it to do, but I can plug a monitor and keyboard (and sometimes a mouse because keyboard-only navigation seems to be getting less and less supported/intuitive...) if I need to perform troubleshooting. reply dicknuckle 13 hours agorootparentThe issue is usually with the graphics card itself in my experience. This is easily \"fixed\" on a DVI port by plugging a resistor of the correct value into two of the tiny pin sockets. The diagram is very easy to find online and you don't have to open the computer. That's become a thing of the past as far as I know. reply withinrafael 12 hours agorootparentNVIDIA GPUs still require \"dummy\" HDMI plugs. They won't be fully usable without something plugged in; it's not clear why. reply rincebrain 7 hours agorootparentThis always seemed to be a very deliberate design choice by them to avoid you being able to use their consumer cards headless versus paying them a large amount on the Quadro or DG cards, since the big problem we saw at $OLDJOB was always that you couldn't use CUDA on them headless. At said $OLDJOB, we ended up soldering dummy VGA plugs that had resistors across the right pins when we wanted to experiment with building a low-power cluster of NVIDIA Ion boards and seeing how it competed with big cards. Ah, memories. reply alias_neo 2 hours agorootparentWould bet that this is exactly why.

I've heard it has lower latency and better streaming quality. reply nottorp 10 hours agorootparentCan confirm that. Using both to connect to the same windows box and sunshine+moonlight is better latency wise for fast paced games. And for games bought from GoG unless you want to configure Steam to launch them :) Steam streaming is more convenient if the game is on steam and it's turn based or something like that. Also if the (mac) box you're streaming to has multiple monitors, Steam will continue to show the game if you cmd-tab out of it, while moonlight will minimize from the start. reply izacus 6 hours agorootparentprevYep, I found that combination to be better when it comes to lag, stability and quality as well. Especially now that they added a 4:4:4 chroma subsampling option which fixes things like text edges in some cases. reply papichulo2023 9 hours agorootparentprevA then you can use lossless scaling on moonlight for a real amazing distrubed gaming experience. reply genewitch 4 hours agorootparentOkay this all sounds great, what specs do I need on the machine connected to the TV? Will a Raspberry Pi 3 work? Pine64? Atomic Pi? (That's x86_64, intel Celeron) Anything more than that and the value proposition goes way down. For every 50 grams lighter I am willing to lose 1fps. For every fan removed I will drop an entire resolution (4k > 2k > FHD...) Change \"lighter\" to heavier if it makes sense. My comfort and aesthetic matters more than competition quality, pixel perfect yadda I keep starring these remote display projects but none have convinced me to provision a client machine for the purpose yet. reply alias_neo 1 hour agorootparentIt doesn't take too much compute, the networking is the key. I've run Moonlight on a bunch of things from my TV, crappy old Android TV box, phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, ROG Ally; don't recall if I ever tried a Pi, but I might give it a go. My advice is, whatever you use, make sure it has wired ethernet for a consistent experience. That said, a more powerful device on the receiving end (Moonlight) with good high-speed wifi should also work fine, but almost always try to keep the PC end (Sunshine) hard-wired. reply papichulo2023 25 minutes agorootparentLossless scaling requires some horsepower though reply nullify88 1 hour agorootparentprevAt a minimum anything with h264 hardware decoding. H265, and VC1 hardware decoding supported but optional. It depends on what your output is.

My old gaming rig was a Linux machine that would boot a Windows VM with GPU passthrough, and the control I had over the virtual hardware that Windows thought it was attached to was really helpful for working around a lot of Windows bullshit. Won't boot without a screen? Virtually attach a fake one. Recognizes a device and tries to auto-install the garbage manufacturer-provided driver? Run the better Linux driver (if one exists) and have qemu present Windows with a generic version of the device. Want to debug some issue that requires disconnecting a piece of hardware? Just take it out of the qemu command instead of needing to go physically disconnect it. Want some remote peripheral attached that Windows has no idea how to talk to? Proxy it over the network in Linux and just present it to the Windows VM as a USB device. Having full control over the world that Windows lives in makes it much more manageable. reply genewitch 4 hours agorootparentSame. I only stopped because managing storage became a problem three huge games came out that I wanted to play. Were I to do this again I wouldn't do ryzen I'd do at minimum a threadripper, so that the guest can get a USB pcie card and a GPU, so literally every device windows sees and talks to is virtualized.

The screen would be superfluous but it's probably the most powerful travel PC, at least for the price, that's available right now. I don't even need the battery that much. But all the options I've seen for SFF PCs that would fit in a backpack look fragile and I wouldn't feel confident carrying them around often.

Why don't us Linux/Windows folks have this option? reply vel0city 15 hours agorootparentPlenty of NUC hardware is pretty beefy, most more tough than most of those gaming handhelds. I've dropped a couple of Intel NUCs down concrete stairs and they only got a few scratches. They've also had really good Linux support for ages, and had Intel's Iris Pro GPUs for a while. Unsure they'd really fit your needs though. AMD sells a number of APU boards though, they've got modern GPUs. Still not breaking any benchmarks though. Also, those gaming handhelds are pretty power and temperature limited. They're often a good bit less powerful than a halfway decent gaming laptop, just a more convenient form factor for portable gaming. reply esperent 15 hours agorootparentNUCs are basically office machines though, I don't think any of them have the kind of graphics capabilities of a Legion Go, for example.

The only question is if they can ramp up manufacturing. I expect them to have shipped their preorders by March and then we'll find out if they can scale. HOWEVER my timeline suggests that you wait until the end of the year. The 4K per eye panel is now a commodity [1] and I expect a lot of VR glasses to show up in the next few months. Don't be tempted by the first few unless you have the budget for the cutting edge. Immersed is pushing their subscription software and requires a companion app on the host device. PFD is offering an Android Vision Pro clone. There are a couple PCVR (gaming) headsets coming. For coding though, the ideal is probably a simple headset with plug-and-play video input (i.e. like a high-res Slamglass [2] or GOOVIS art [3]). It's worth waiting in my opinion to see if anyone uses the panel for that.

So it is not a small device as such. reply eieio 2 hours agorootparentIt's larger than the switch! And the case for the Steamdeck is notably thicker than the Steamdeck, while the case for the switch is not. I think this is because the switch is almost flat, whereas the joysticks on the front of the Steamdeck and the handholds on the back stick out a lot farther, and the Steamdeck case doesn't conform to the Steamdeck; it's just as large as the largest dimension in any direction. My experience is that chucking the Steamdeck in my backpack for a flight is doable if I don't put it in the case, but if I put it in the case it takes up enough space that it's annoying to fit my laptop / other stuff too.

      "The Steam Brick Mod is a custom project that modifies a Steam Deck to be smaller and lighter by removing the screen and controller, leaving only essential components. The modification uses a 1TB OLED Steam Deck and involves creating a custom case with a 3D printer, resulting in a device about a third the size and 24% lighter than the original. Despite its portability benefits, the mod has limitations, such as no BIOS access and difficulty determining if the device is on, and it is not officially supported by Valve, posing risks of damage."

Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020, 2024 Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. It's not a crime if we do it with an app (permalink) Picks and Shovels is a new, standalone technothriller starring Marty Hench, my two-fisted, hard-fighting, tech-scam-busting forensic accountant. You have TWO DAYS LEFT to pre-order it on my latest Kickstarter, which features a brilliant audiobook read by Wil Wheaton. The core regulatory proposition of the tech industry is \"it's not a crime if we do it with an app.\" It's not an unlicensed taxi if we do it with an app. It's not an illegal hotel room if we do it with an app. It's not an unregistered security if we do it with an app. It's not wage theft if we do it with an app. Inflation is one of the most politically salient factors of this decade, and so much of inflation can be attributed to a crime, done with an app, with impunity for the criminals. The entire food supply has been sewn up by cartels of 2-5 giant companies, and they colluded to raise prices, and bragged about it, and got away with it, because neoclassical economists insist that it's impossible for this kind of price fixing to occur in an \"efficient market.\" Some of these cartels are well-known, like the Coke/Pepsi duopoly. Pepsi's bosses boasted to their shareholders about \"Pepsi pricing power,\" and how they were able to raise prices over the inflationary increases caused by covid and the Russian invasion of Ukraine: https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/11/price-over-volume/#pepsi-pricing-power You might know that pretty much every packaged good in your grocery store is made by one of two companies, Unilever and Procter and Gamble. Both CEOs boasted to their investors about their above-inflation price increases: https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering But other cartels are harder to spot. It may seem like your grocer's eggs department is filled with many different companies' products. In reality, a single company, Cal-Maine Foods, owns practically every brand of eggs in the case: Farmhouse Eggs, Sunups, Sunny Meadow, Egg-Land’s Best and Land O’ Lakes. They made record profits after the pandemic and through bird flu, a fact that CFO Max Bowman attributed to \"significantly higher selling prices\" and \"our ability to adapt to inflationary market pressures\": https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/23/cant-make-an-omelet/#keep-calm-and-crack-on But Cal-Maine is comparatively transparent. The other food cartels – especially those that serve the restaurant sector – are harder to spot. In The Lever, Katya Schwenk describes how four companies – Lamb Weston, JR Simplot, McCain Foods and Cavendish Farms – have captured the frozen potato market and all that comes with it (fries, tater tots, etc): https://www.levernews.com/the-rise-of-big-potato/ These companies have been hiking prices for years, but really started to turn the screws during the post-covid inflationary period. One of Schwenk's sources is Josh Saltzman, owner of the DC sports bar Ivy and Coney. Ten years ago, Saltzman charged $3 for fries; now it's $6 – and Saltzman's margins have declined. Saltzman has a limited number of suppliers, and they all get their potatoes from Big Potato, and they bundle those potato orders with their other supplies, making it effectively impossible for Saltzman to buy his potatoes from anyone else. Big Potato controls 97% of the frozen potato market, and any sector that large and concentrated is going to be pretty cozy. The execs at these companies all meet at industry associations, lobbying bodies, and as they job-hop between companies in the cartel. But they don't have to rely on personal connections to rig the price of potatoes: they do it through a third-party data-broker called Potatotrac. Each cartel member sends all their commercially sensitive data – supply costs, pricing, sales figures – to Potatotrac, and then Potatotrac uses that data to give \"advice\" to the cartel members about \"optimal pricing.\" This is just price-fixing, with an app. The fact that they don't sit around a table and openly discuss pricing doesn't keep this from being price-fixing. What's more, they admit it. A director at McCain said that \"higher ups\" forbade anyone in the company from competing on price. A Lamb Weston exec described the arrangement as everyone \"behaving themselves,\" chortling that they'd \"never seen margins this high in the history of the potato industry.\" Lamb Weston's CEO attributed a 111% increase in net income to \"pricing actions.\" Lamb Weston's execs understand that they're driving small restaurants out of business, and that the real beneficiaries are big chains that can pass the price increases onto their customers, like \"Chili’s and the Texas Roadhouses and Cheesecake Factory\": https://app.tegus.co/guest/document/view/67Hf3DiMGQ944SkfpRhLfNeiqekjA67sm2dxTCYtjoggUaJXk2chDg9wxMnZ This is by no means unique to the potato industry. A data-broker called Agri Stats works with America's largest meat-packers to rig the price of meat – packers send Agri Stats the same kind of data that Big Potato sends to Potatotrac, and Agri Stats sends back the same \"recommendations\" that allow them to raise meat prices across the board, in lockstep: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/04/dont-let-your-meat-loaf/#meaty-beaty-big-and-bouncy Lots of food categories are as inbred as meat and potatoes: \"four firms controlled nearly 80 percent of the almond milk market, for instance. Three companies controlled 83 percent of the canned tuna market, and four companies controlled more than 86 percent of the microwave popcorn market.\" The \"price fixing is legal if we do it with an app\" gambit is not just about food, either. Apps like Realpage let big corporate landlords – who've bought up a sizable fraction of all the available homes in America – collude to raise rents: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/27/ai-conspiracies/#epistemological-collapse And private equity companies have rolled up all the fire truck companies, hiking the price of trucks, creating backlogs and bottlenecks for parts and service, and starving the nation's municipalities (including Los Angeles) of fire-fighting equipment: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/did-a-private-equity-fire-truck-roll This kind of price-fixing was central to the enforcement actions of the Biden administration's trustbusters at the FTC, and their investigations and actions inspired state AGs and private parties to bring their own antitrust suits. The question is, will Trump's enforcers continue this agenda? And will Trump's judges – steeped in Heritage Foundation economics that insists that monopolies are \"efficient\" – find in their favor if they do? Inflation has lots of causes, it's true. But when an industry is consolidated enough to take advantage of a data brokerage or just engage in tacit collusion, any source of inflation – war, disease, weather – allows whole sectors to raise prices together, and keep them high, long after the shock has passed.

They get away with so much, and in those rare cases where a regulatory body does anything, it's often just a strongly worded letter, a warning, a threat to one day send a strongly worded letter, or, in really rare, extreme cases, a company official gets called in to say a few words in front of Congress. Nobody goes to jail, fines get whittled down to nothing in appeal after appeal, and the government usually finally just accepts a pinky-swear to never be bad again. Contrast that to how individuals get the hammer put down on them by the justice system if they so much as fart in the wrong room. The lesson from the last 50 years should be: If you want to commit a crime and get away with it, do it as a corporation. reply steveBK123 1 hour agoparentExactly theres a lot of stuff that if an individual/small business owner did, they'd be personally onerously fined or jailed.. but corporations get a pass. Corporations also have a lot of money to pay good lobbyists & lawyers such that laws are pretty forgiving, loopholes are found & exploited, and finally they are vigorously defended if the government ever does try to crack down. Ubers behavior during its growth phase, and even now is a good example of this. The latest letter of the law vs spirit of the law thing Uber did was circumvent the NYC law to try and ensure Uber drivers get a fair minimum wage. To avoid having to pay any difference to make up the hourly wage to drivers, Uber runs an algorithm which kicks drivers out of the app randomly if demand gets too low, without warning or indication of when they can get back in. It can be minutes or hours. So the drivers remain on the road, driving/idling, waiting to get back into the app. The \"work\" is still getting done, but it doesn't count against Uber. Imagine a small restaurant doing similar, deciding at random slow times instead of sending staff home for the day, they assign them no tables and mark them as off-the-clock. When demand picks up again, they get assigned some tables and resume making money. The whole independent contractor on-demand app market is an automated exploitation engine. reply gruez 1 hour agorootparent>To avoid having to pay any difference to make up the hourly wage to drivers, Uber runs an algorithm which kicks drivers out of the app randomly if demand gets too low, without warning or indication of when they can get back in. It can be minutes or hours. So the drivers remain on the road, driving/idling, waiting to get back into the app. The \"work\" is still getting done, but it doesn't count against Uber. I get legislators want uber drivers to earn a living wage, but expecting uber to continue allowing unlimited amount of drivers to be \"online\", when they have to pay for them is absurd. >Imagine a small restaurant doing similar, deciding at random slow times instead of sending staff home for the day, they assign them no tables and mark them as off-the-clock. When demand picks up again, they get assigned some tables and resume making money. You're trying to imply small businesses don't do this but this happens all the time. It's not even limited to minimum wage laws. After the ACA was passed, everyone started avoiding hiring people for more than 32 hours if they could, to skirt the \"you have to provide healthcare to all full time employees\" requirement. reply steveBK123 1 hour agorootparentIf Uber has let so many drivers on the app such that they cannot earn a minimum wage, they should stop aggressively enrolling new drivers. They could have also kicked people out for full days, rest of shift, or given an indicator of when they may try again. Something that leaves it more clear they are off and don't linger around to try and get back in. Restaurants/retail will reduce staffing due to demand, but they don't leave people hanging by an on-call thread the way this automated Uber model did. Tends to be more like cutting shifts off early or calling people not to come in. It is not this automated app-driven robo labor optimization. People aren't being told to go outside and maybe they'll get called back in 5 minutes, 1 hour, or 1 day. Agreed a lot of businesses moved people to 32 hour weeks to avoid ACA, which is a different issue.. how's all the on-demand faux contractor workforces healthcare though? reply AnthonyMouse 4 minutes agorootparent> If Uber has let so many drivers on the app such that they cannot earn a minimum wage, they should stop aggressively enrolling new drivers. The number of drivers needed at any given time is completely variable. It's obviously a larger number during peak travel periods. Suppose number of drivers needed off-peak is 100 and the number needed at the peak is 500 and they have 300 drivers. They need to sign up another 200 drivers to satisfy the peak demand, but they already have 200 more than they can use off-peak. What would you have them do? They effectively need a large proportion of the drivers to be working part time specifically during peak hours. Moreover, there are many people willing to do that. They're not sitting in their cars idling, they're at home doing chores or other contract work and they only get in their car if the app tells them they can get paid. This is not a problem for the people who are satisfied with it, and why are the people who are unsatisfied with it even doing it? If you don't like driving for Uber, don't do it. reply gruez 48 minutes agorootparentprev>If Uber has let so many drivers on the app such that they cannot earn a minimum wage, they should stop aggressively enrolling new drivers. Most of those drivers were presumably enrolled before that legislation was passed/came into force. Blaming uber for having those drivers seems like a stretch. > They could have also kicked people out for full days, rest of shift, or given an indicator of when they may try again. Something that leaves it more clear they are off and don't linger around to try and get back in. Is this a real concern? This seems like something that sucks for the first few days and then everyone realizes what's the new normal and adapts accordingly. I don't doubt uber could have done better here, but characterizing poor UI as \"circumvent the NYC law to try and ensure Uber drivers get a fair minimum wage\" is a stretch. It's also unclear how uber benefits from drivers being frustrated at the UI. >Restaurants/retail will reduce staffing due to demand, but they don't leave people hanging by an on-call thread the way this automated Uber model did. Uber driver are not \"on call\". They can sign off at any time. Sure, they might need the money, but in that respect I don't see how that's any different than 0 hour contracts that some restaurants have. >Agreed a lot of businesses moved people to 32 hour weeks to avoid ACA, which is a different issue.. how's all the on-demand faux contractor workforces healthcare though? The point isn't that being an uber driver is a dream job, it's that contrary to your rhetoric of \"Imagine a small restaurant doing similar\", small restaurants indeed will do something similar, if given the chance. reply RHSeeger 7 minutes agorootparent> I don't doubt uber could have done better here, but characterizing poor UI as \"circumvent the NYC law to try and ensure Uber drivers get a fair minimum wage\" is a stretch. Honestly, that's _exactly_ what it looks like to me. Law makes it so that they have to pay drivers that are available to drive but aren't actively involved in a fair... so they change the system so that, if they don't have fairs for you you're not considered available to drive. Everything about that reeks of trying to circumvent the law. Now, I don't know that there _is_ a better solution that works with their business model; but the answer to that isn't \"cheat\", it's \"your business model it's sustainable\". reply Volundr 43 minutes agorootparentprev> expecting uber to continue allowing unlimited amount of drivers to be \"online\", when they have to pay for them is absurd. I don't recall anyone demanding that. Maybe things have changed since then, but back when I worked in restaurants if things were slow I'd be sent home and know when I was expected to be back be that the next day or in time for the dinner rush. I wasn't randomly clocked off for 15-30 minutes, and expected to hang around, then suddenly told I'm back on. In fact we'd call that wage theft, (which is very common in the US). But suddenly for Uber such a thing is acceptable. reply gruez 32 minutes agorootparent>I don't recall anyone demanding that. That's seemingly what OP was demanding, given the displeasure he was expressing at uber for the practice. >but back when I worked in restaurants if things were slow I'd be sent home and know when I was expected to be back be that the next day or in time for the dinner rush.

No fare, no pay. >The tight margins of the hack trade can leave cabbies feeling frustrated. “Sometimes, I don’t like it, because I have the potential to lose money,” said M. D.

I wonder, would cabs be more competitive of Uber's alternative business model, if Uber had to be fairer? If so, then isn't Uber a sham? And shouldn't market forces see them go? Airbnb used to be cheap... at the start. Then people added insurance, people had to get permits, and so on, just as Hotels, and other do. Now it's not so cheap any more. One of the biggest disruptions is \"don't pay your fair share\". Or \"pay people dirt wages\". Companies carve out a new business model, and aren't taxed or forced to pay as incumbents are. Are people against people making a fair wage? Well guess what, you have to pay more for an Uber. And maybe Uber doesn't work as a business model unless it's too expensive. Too bad! Uber has to work in the same ecosystem as everyone else... or it's a farce. reply gruez 28 minutes agorootparent>A lot of jurisdictions require 4 hr minimum pay when called in to work. >I wonder, would cabs be more competitive of Uber's alternative business model, if Uber had to be fairer?

The lesson from the last 50 years should be: If you want to commit a crime and get away with it, do it as a corporation. That's because most crimes \"individuals\" do are straightforwardly illegal and easy to prosecute, whereas the \"crime if a corporation does it\" are not. It's not any different than say, simple property crimes (eg. stealing or vandalism) vs white collar crimes, both of which can be perpetrated by individuals but the latter are far harder to prosecute. Stealing a candy bar is an open and shut case, especially with surveillance footage. A long firm fraud[1] is far harder to prosecute. If you buy a truckload of candy bars on credit, fail to repay the vendor, and declare bankruptcy, prosecutors are going to have a hard time prosecuting the case. Having bad business acumen isn't a crime, so on the surface nothing illegal has happened. To prove wrongdoing they must prove that you intentionally acquired goods on credit without intending to pay it back, which is far harder.

Yes and no. Yes in the sense that you can make crimes very easy to prosecute, no in the sense that doing so usually makes unobjectionable or even good behavior illegal in the process. Take insider trading for example. It would be very easy to simply make selling the stock of a company you work for, or are in any other way party to, outright illegal. But this would be bad for a lot of reasons; it would make it harder for businesses to compensate employees, it would encourage employees of successful companies to leave early taking important business knowledge with them, etc. Some behavior is simply harder to make illegal because it's harder to identify by its nature, which subsequently makes it harder to enforce laws against it. reply AutistiCoder 1 hour agorootparentYou could just say employees get a blackout period each year where they can’t buy or sell company stock. reply derektank 1 hour agorootparentSure, there are always compromises that can be made and my point wasn't about insider trading specifically, it was that there are tradeoffs to consider. But let's take your example, how long is the blackout period and how long is the open period? I would contend that there is almost no open period short enough that a motivated insider couldn't trade on their non-public knowledge if they were \"lucky\" enough to have it during the open period, so you're kind of back at square one where you still need the SEC and DoJ to investigate and borderline cases will slip through the cracks.

Easy conviction for prosecutor, as there little question of who committed nor of what crime was committed. Contrast that with the GP's example \"business type\" crime. To prove the \"business\" committed a crime, they have to find a way to prove the business, when buying the truckload of candy bars, at the time of the purchase, intentionally never intended to pay back the loan taken out to buy the truckload.

The first stock exchange (\"bourse\") for this was actually French(?) (hazy here, possibly Belgian or Dutch, and probably roots in Hanseatic League financing if not beyond). FWIW there's a whole subset of the antiques world which deals in share notes promissory notes issued to people funding capital intensive ventures like new railway lines, often beautifully decorated and serial numbered for nominal security against forgery. AFAIK the follow-on concern of manipulation of the modern legal environment as a tool for unencumbered multinational greed really began with entities like the East India Company being empowered by pontificating rulers back home granting because-I-said-so immunity for arbitrary actions outside their borders, thus establishing the ground work for industrial scale opium trading, piracy, slavery, and banana republics. We're in a period of relative reckoning now where the cash-piles thus accrued are facing some popular scrutiny, but there'll never be recompense. As we've reached the ends of the earth and new wealth to seize has become scarce, we've turned to speculation and beyond earth to mars, the metaverse, and media in general. Stock markets are largely society's greed temples and in some cases designed for money laundering (eg. Singapore stock market for the Burmese junta). Even small companies on the public markets are worth orders of magnitude more than you can earn in a lifetime, leading to an intellectual drain toward speculative systemic value extraction instead of productive ventures. IMHO a naive hope of crypto was a reckoning, instead we received the opposite: increased speculation, libertarian multinational economics and now abject political profiteering. No action on critical issues like climate. Less international trust and diplomatic potential than we've had since WWII truly, we are lost.

Retirement should not mean a life of air travel and cruises, achieved by pension savings. Retirement should not mean continuing to live in your 2,500 sq. ft. ranch house in the suburbs with only car access. John Maynard Keynes famously predicted we would be working 15 hours a week due because of increasing productivity. Where did all that productivity go? If it's because we believed we needed ('deserved') more, then change those beliefs. If it's because of the concentration of wealth into the 0.01% then AI productivity improvements won't fix things. The AI-mongers sell the false and unsustainable promise that AI will magically solve things so people don't need to change their habits. Yet we can achieve a lot of savings by building more compact areas to live which don't require a car, and by building mass transit with the needs of the elderly in mind (no steps, low-frequency lines which run through neighborhoods, for those with limited mobility, etc.) We can save money and get better health outcomes with a tried-and-true single-payer health care system done in every other developed country (eg, \"Medicare For All\".)

The last paragraph portraits a stunning lack of economic knowledge, as companies raising prices in line with inflation obviously would not lower prices after the source of the inflation is gone.

The supplies of these goods have had occasional disruptions but are largely unchanged. The demand has not changed in any material way. And yet the prices have increased, and those increases have far outstripped the increases in the cost of goods sold. It’s worth noting that, in classical economic theory, the price in a competitive market is set by matching supply and demand, but the price in a monopolistic market is set higher such that the profit (“producer surplus”) is maximized, which harms the buyers (“consumer surplus”) even more than the amount by which the seller benefits. The net loss is called deadweight loss, and one can argue about whether and how government policy should be arranged to minimize deadweight loss. reply pwg 1 hour agorootparent> The supplies of these goods have had occasional disruptions but are largely unchanged. Those \"disruptions\" you refer to create periods of \"lack of supply\" (i.e., less of the goods).

True, but, during the period of \"temporary reduction in the supply\" (i.e., the disruption) Econ 101's supply/demand curve will predict that the price will rise to make the \"demand\" during the period of limited supply equalize with the new supply level due to the disruption. What often happens (and you see it most clearly with gasoline prices), is that the price reacts extremely quickly to the supply disruption by increasing fast (seemingly within hours). But then, when the \"disruption\" clears, and the supply amount returns to normal, the price tends to slowly drift downward (if it drifts downward at all). reply arrosenberg 1 hour agorootparentForget about oil for a second.

If people were not buying the cereal at that price, they would lower it, or have gone out of business by now. If someone could produce a substitute for far cheaper, and undercut, they would, and they do, but consumers are partial to name brands. Cheerios are $5 at Walmart, People are buying them.

Capitalism is a system of oppression that requires poverty to work, so is an economic system of oppression. \"Crimes\" committed in the context of oppression are required when \"noncrimes\" are insufficient for meeting needs. Cartels operate without regard for human life and support the context of oppression. Totally different level of responsibility. Politicians create the system based on choices made due to support from the cartels. They're in some classes of equivalence with the politicians because they're interacting in a way that promotes the context of oppression.

Companies don't want employees or customers to get injured and come after them for damages, which would almost certainly be worth far more than whatever the person is running off with. There are a slew of cameras covering the parking lots for a reason with photos and video of the person, the car, etc it is trivial for cops and courts to handle. reply bovermyer 2 hours agorootparentprevI doubt that. \"Loss prevention\" divisions in larger corporations might allow for some amount of unpunished theft, but once that number gets high enough, they'll implement measures to control it.

Additionally, the amount of video and audio (and other data) recorded is increasing, not decreasing.

The government needs to step in actively to keep a free market from collapsing into one of the natural end states. But the US has consistently been far too passive and accepts greedy companies far too readily. If a single company can sell almost 100% of an essential good, they need to atomatically lose the power to set their prices and margins independently.

Price fixing cartels need to be busted more aggressively. reply Aurornis 2 hours agoparent> If a single company can sell almost 100% of an essential good, they need to atomatically lose the power to set their prices and margins independently. The fallacy is assuming that the government will make everything cheap for consumers. In practice, government regulation of prices just changes the game. Look at any market with rent control: There are numerous meta-games around building or not building new supply, landlords are incentivized to not fix units because they know tenants don’t want to give up their rent control and move, and a new market emerges where people illegally sublet their rent controlled apartments because it becomes attractive to take advantage of the market demand that landlords aren’t allowed to capitalize on. The other fallacy in all of this is thinking that companies control both supply and demand. For nearly all commodities, there is a price where consumers won’t pay for it. If rents get too high, people move to a different city. If gas gets too expensive they start carpooling and looking for WFH jobs. If eggs are too expensive they eat something else. These choices make people angry as hell, but there’s no denying that these choices exist. Companies can’t push past these limits and force people to buy at any price. They still have to discover that point on the supply and demand curve. reply galleywest200 1 hour agorootparent> If rents get too high, people move to a different city. With what money?

(to show numbered lists, do you want to display the ol tags before the numbers (thus using fake numbers) or do you let ol numbering tags tag the elements with numbers and then show the source inside that?) btw it really drives me crazy that browser implementors think that when I copy/paste a numbered list, I somehow don't want the numbers. reply divbzero 20 hours agoprevWhere is the good old… alignment with no CSS reply assimpleaspossi 19 hours agoparentThat's been obsolete for over 20 years: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/obsolete.html#non-conformin... reply edoceo 17 hours agoparentprevBring backandreply assimpleaspossi 5 hours agorootparentYou can't bring back something that never existed and both of those have never been part of any HTML standard.

Meaning there are pages out there that used to be valid, but aren't anymore. And since HTML spills to EPub specs, I recall there were EPubs or EPub spec examples/test suites themselves having to change specifically, epubcheck being actually used for validation and hence directly noting this backward incompatibility. In a nutshell, hgroup was originally criticized and rejected when W3C was still redacting HTML specs received from the loose group of browser devs and other people calling themselves \"WHAT working group\" because it paired headings of multiple ranks in a way that confused assistive technologies in browsers. But the first (and at the same time the last;) W3C HTML recommenndation created as unredacted WHAT WG spec snapshot under the W3C/WHATWG \"memorandum of understanding\" actually smuggled hgroup in. Then Steve Faulkner removed HTML outlining and the whole concept of sectioning roots that was part of Ian Hickson's vision of \"HTML 5\" for the longest time, but W3C never actually started a new recommendation process afterwards, and the charter for the HTML WG at W3C, Inc. has ended last year.

HTML parsing is terrible reply dmsnell 1 hour agorootparentThe story of XHTML is instructive to the field of software design. There are plenty of good resources on the web if you search why did XHTML fail? HTML parsing at least is deterministic and fully specified, whereas XHTML, as an XML, leaves a number of syntax errors up to the parser and undefined. Conforming software may detect and report an error and may recover from it. While fatal errors should cause all parser to reject a document outright, this also leaves the end-user without any recovery of the information they care about. So XHTML leaves readers at a loss while failing to eliminating parsing ambiguity and undefined behavior. Interestingly, it’s possible to encode an invalid DOM with XHTML while it’s impossible to do so in HTML. That means that XML/XHTML has given up the possibility of invalid syntax (by acting like it doesn’t exist) for the sake of inviting invalid semantics. reply thiht 11 minutes agorootparentInteresting perspective, it makes me miss XHTML wayyy less.

    "originLink": "https://www.historynet.com/maj-buang-lys-daring-feat-to-save-his-family/",
    "originBody": "Share This Article As his country crumbled, a South Vietnamese pilot attempting a high-risk landing on the Midway depended on the ship’s quick-thinking crew to save his family from disaster. On the last full day of his country’s existence, South Vietnamese air force Maj. Buang-Ly stole a tiny two-seat airplane. He helped his wife and their five children, ages 14 months to 6 years, into the backseat and storage area before climbing into the pilot’s seat. They took off and headed out to sea while enemy ground fire zipped past them. It was April 29, 1975, and chaos had enveloped the nation. Two years earlier, the 1973 Paris peace agreement had theoretically ended the war, but after American combat forces left the country, the North Vietnamese took the opportunity to press their new strategic advantage. The long war between North and South Vietnam paused only briefly before ferocious fighting resumed. In early 1975, the North Vietnamese Army seized key bases in the Central Highlands, and, by the end of March, had captured areas along the coast. The remaining American advisers and many South Vietnamese families began frenzied evacuations on American military aircraft and civilian transport planes. Those large, fixed-wing aircraft flew thousands of people to hastily constructed camps in the Philippines, Guam and Wake Island. The last plane out of Da Nang, a civilian Boeing 727 on March 29, was unable to retract its landing gear in flight because at least seven of the 290 passengers had climbed into its wheel wells. Soon North Vietnamese forces were shelling Saigon. Buang and his family were stationed on Con Son Island, about 50 miles off the southern coast and home to one of the last bases still under South Vietnamese control. Used mainly as a prison camp, the island also had a small airfield. When Buang and his wife learned that North Vietnamese forces were closing in, they loaded as many of their possessions as possible into the plane and got airborne—with no plan for what to do next. Their tiny aircraft, an O-1 Bird Dog, was a modified Cessna 170, a light, single-engine tail dragger with fixed landing gear. Ruggedly built and highly maneuverable, Bird Dogs flew over South Vietnam’s terrain during the war, spotting enemy targets and then marking them with white phosphorous rockets to guide U.S. artillery shelling and airstrikes. The planes could take off and land on a dime, but their range was limited to just over 500 miles when fully fueled—and Buang’s fuel tank was not. As Buang coaxed the overloaded plane airborne, he faced enormous challenges. The Bird Dog was not designed to operate over water. It lacked sophisticated navigation equipment, life vests and the ability to safely ditch in an emergency. Buang had never seen, much less landed on, an aircraft carrier—and to make matters worse, this Bird Dog had no working radio because Buang had not been able to bring a headset. Still, he knew that his family was more likely to find safety out at sea, where the U.S. Navy was in control, than on the land now controlled by communist forces under Gen. Van Tien Dung. After flying for a half-hour, Buang spotted a gaggle of helicopters in the distance heading east. At the time he had no idea they were loaded with friendly evacuees, but it seemed like a good idea to follow them. “I was searching for a safe place,” Buang later recalled. “It made me think there was something out there they could depend on.” On April 19, 10 days before the Buang family departed Con Son Island, the aircraft carrier USS Midway had received orders to leave Naval Station Subic Bay in the Philippines and make best speed toward Saigon to help evacuate the roughly 5,000 Americans remaining there, including diplomats, CIA agents, contractors and a handful of Marines. Midway and the rest of the 7th Fleet would also evacuate as many friendly Vietnamese as possible. The old ship had been in service since September 1945 and was just starting a pier side repair period. Its engineering plant, which had been taken offline for maintenance, needed to be hastily restored to operation, and the ship got underway with fewer sailors than normal. At Subic Bay, Midway offloaded half of the fixed-wing jets in its combat air wing. When the ship reached the South China Sea, it received 10 large Sikorsky H-53 helicopters—two U.S. Air Force HH-53s from the 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron and eight CH-53s from the Air Force’s 21st Special Operations Squadron. Each of these choppers could comfortably transport 55 passengers at a time. The mission, dubbed Operation Frequent Wind, would employ an ad-hoc fleet of helicopters and several elements of the 7th Fleet—an impressive array of combat vehicles—to conduct a massive humanitarian operation, transporting and caring for thousands of refugees. During transit, the carrier’s crew got busy training for the work ahead. Throughout the war, most air operations from carriers like Midway had been combat sorties: bombing, intelligence gathering and combat air patrol. Noncombat logistics operations normally took up only a small slice of a day’s action on the flight deck. The logistics crews usually transferred a few dozen passengers a day, maybe brought onboard a new jet engine or other supplies, and shipped mail via plane or helicopter. Typically, a junior air transfer officer leading a crew of about a dozen sailors could easily handle the load. But for Operation Frequent Wind, the entire ship and its crew were devoted to the effort. The carrier’s senior enlisted sailors led the rest of the crew in drills designed to account for every imaginable problem. On the morning of April 29, former South Vietnamese Prime Minister and Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky, accompanied by Lt. Gen. Ngo Quang Truong, requested permission to land on the Midway, after making a one-hour, 15-minute helicopter flight from the mainland. Their arrival signaled to the carrier’s officers that Operation Frequent Wind had begun. About 11 a.m. that morning Secretary of State Henry Kissinger finally gave American diplomats the order to evacuate. An American radio station broadcast the secret signal: “The temperature in Saigon is 105 degrees and rising,” followed by Tennessee Ernie Ford’s “White Christmas”—because the DJ couldn’t find the more well-known Bing Crosby version. The signal told evacuees in Saigon to move to pre-assigned extraction locations, board buses there and head to the airport. As the official evacuation commenced, many resourceful Vietnamese commandeered whatever aircraft they could to fly to safety. “At least 74 planes of the South Vietnamese Air Force, including about 30 F-5 fighters, streamed into the U Taphao air base in southern Thailand from South Vietnam without warning,” The New York Times reported the next day. “The pilots and passengers—about 2,000 people—requested asylum,” and more planes kept arriving. Thai officials declared their intention to return the aircraft to South Vietnam, which soon became impossible as the South was absorbed into a unified Vietnam under Hanoi’s communist leadership. More choppers began arriving on Midway’s flight deck. The ship’s contingent of Marines and the sergeant at arms searched the new arrivals for contraband and weapons, confiscating pistols and wads of worthless South Vietnamese cash that they threw over the side. Then they helped passengers into the ship’s command structure on the starboard side, known as “the island,” where crew members gave them food and basic medical care. All but 80 or so of the most dire cases were transferred by helicopter to other ships to be distributed across the whole fleet, a process that went on well into the next day. Young, tough sailors who were used to handling bombs, chains and fuel lines amid the roar of jet engines now devoted themselves to caring for bewildered parents, frightened children, the elderly and the sick. The flight deck was choked with choppers and lines of men and women carrying suitcases and children. The hangar bay below decks ran out of room for more aircraft as efforts to aid hundreds of refugees continued there. The Midway was commanded by Capt. Lawrence Chambers, the first African-American carrier captain and just the second to graduate from the U.S. Naval Academy when he earned his degree in 1952. Chambers had reported aboard the carrier in January 1975 and been in command for only a few weeks. In a television interview 35 years later, he recalled the scene as he watched from his chair on the bridge, just above the action: “A flight deck is a hazardous operation under normal conditions. And when you see little kids and mothers holding little babies, and airplanes, helicopters are taking off and landing, you just kind of hold your breath.” Weather conditions were not ideal, observed the ship’s air boss, Cmdr. Vern Jumper, from his perch five stories above the flight deck in the Primary Flight Control room. Jumper was responsible for all aspects of flight operations, including any aircraft flying near the ship, all the action on the flight deck, and the work happening down in the hangar bay. He noted rain falling from a 500-foot cloud ceiling, 15 knots (17 mph) of wind over the deck and 5 miles visibility. But the seas remained relatively calm, which meant the deck, though sometimes slick with water, wasn’t pitching. Air traffic controllers inside the ship and landing signals crew on deck used whatever means necessary to keep helicopters in order as they approached. Communication went smoothly with the 10 H-53 helicopters that were part of the operation. They would land, unload, refuel and make repeated trips to Saigon. By mid-afternoon, an additional 45 UH-1 Iroquois “Huey” helicopters had arrived from the mainland. Most had no ability to communicate with the ship via radio. “We were using hand signals to the pilots to control where they landed on the flight deck,” Jumper recalled 35 years later. Sailors and aircrews also communicated via signal flags and colored signal lamps—red, don’t land; green, OK to land. Every pilot managed his fuel and waited patiently for his turn. At one point, Jumper and his assistant, Cmdr. Pete Theodorelos, counted 26 helicopters circling the carrier while sailors assisted waves of arriving passengers. As soon as a chopper’s rotors stopped twirling, sailors pushed it away from the action, using small rectangular tractors or brute manpower. By packing the incoming aircraft close together, they were able to recover them all. None had to ditch next to the carrier, but the flight deck soon filled to capacity. Toward the end of that wild afternoon, spotters on the carrier saw a tiny two-seat Cessna come into view. Through binoculars they counted at least four people in the plane, which had South Vietnamese markings. The Bird Dog began circling overhead with its landing lights switched on. Periodically the pilot rocked the plane’s wings. A Vietnamese translator was rushed to Primary Flight Control to join Jumper and Theodorelos in the ship’s tower, but attempts to radio the plane were met with static. From the bridge Chambers quickly consulted task force commander Adm. William Harris, who was at his battle station below deck. “The admiral ordered me to tell the Bird Dog to ditch,” Chambers later recalled. A helicopter could be dispatched to drop swimmers in the water and rescue the occupants. Other pilots flying choppers near the rest of the 7th Fleet were putting their aircraft into the sea. They hovered to drop passengers onto the fleet’s smaller ships, including destroyers and supply craft. When all passengers had safely left a chopper, the pilot would maneuver away and steer the machine on a course to safely ditch into open water. At the last moment he would jump clear of the rotors and drop into the sea, then swim toward the nearest vessel. However, the fixed-wing Bird Dog couldn’t hover to drop off its passengers, and its fixed landing gear would cause the plane to flip onto its back as soon as the wheels touched the water. Only a well-trained crew member, properly strapped in, would get out alive. If the plane was ditched, the rest of its occupants had almost no chance. “My judgment told me, if I didn’t give him a chance to land that he was going to crash it on the deck,” Chambers said. As the Bird Dog circled, the pilot dropped three paper notes from the plane, but they blew over the side before the ship’s crew could snatch them. On the next pass he stuffed a fourth note into his pistol’s leather holster to weigh it down, and sailors rushed to grab the little package after it hit the deck. They read a scribbled message written on a crumpled chart of South Vietnam: Can you mouve [sic] these Helicopter to the other side, I can land on your runway, I can fly 1 hour more, we have enough time to mouve. Please rescue me. Major Buang wife and 5 child. The message was quickly relayed to the bridge where Chambers was discussing the situation with Jumper over the phone. Ignoring pressure from the admiral, Chambers decided to do whatever was necessary to let the Bird Dog land, even if that meant throwing millions of dollars worth of equipment over the side and possibly being relieved of his command. “Vern,” Chambers said into the phone, “give me a ready deck.” Jumper called for all available crewmen and volunteers to help prepare the angled flight deck for the Cessna. Meanwhile, with six boilers offline for maintenance, Chambers ordered his chief engineer to transfer the ship’s electric load to the emergency diesel engines and make steam for 25 knots (29 mph). The captain turned his ship into the wind to prepare for a fixed-wing landing. Fire crews readied their hoses and donned fire-retardant suits. Since the Bird Dog had no tail hook, sailors removed the four landing cables that normally spanned the runway. Other crew members leaned in together to heave three Hueys and one Chinook over the side. When their skids went over the flight deck’s edge, the empty choppers nosed up, twisted, then fell backward into the sea with big splashes. Immediately, five more airborne Huey pilots took advantage of the cleared runway to land and disembark their passengers. Assuming he would be court martialed, Chambers ordered those helicopters thrown overboard as well. He later told interviewers that since he expected to be deposed by prosecutors, he turned away from the action to avoid seeing exactly how many were pushed into the sea. In the same interview Jumper also claimed not to know how many helicopters went overboard. The old ship rattled and groaned as its speed increased. Jumper gave the green lamp signal to land. Buang made two practice passes over the ship to get a feel for the approach while translators—in English and Vietnamese—tried to warn him about the dangerous downdrafts that naturally occur behind the ship’s fantail. With no response, the crew could only watch, hoping that he would carry enough power to fly through that turbulence. Buang lowered the Bird Dog’s flaps and approached in a shallow descent at a speed of 60 knots (69 mph). With the ship providing an estimated 40 knots (46 mph) of headwind to aid the landing, the light plane slowly caught up. It seemed to flutter for a moment just above the deck, then bounced once in the landing area and rolled to a smooth stop in the middle of the runway. Dozens of sailors ran toward the plane to grab it in case the aircraft’s momentum was enough to send it over the side, but the Bird Dog stayed where it had stopped. A hodgepodge of squadron crew and ship’s company weighed the plane down with their bodies while Buang and his wife, carrying their youngest child, climbed out of the cockpit. He pulled forward the seat and out tumbled the other four children. Cheers rang out and sailors clapped while the family walked into the ship’s island. Altogether, 71 American helicopters flew a total of 662 sorties from Saigon to the 7th Fleet’s ships, rescuing more than 7,800 people. The 10 Air Force H-53s flew four round trips from the Midway to Saigon, evacuating more than 1,400 personnel from the start of the operation on the morning of April 29 until its end at 9 a.m. on April 30. Three hours later, South Vietnamese Gen. Duong Van Minh surrendered Saigon to North Vietnamese Col. Bui Tin, effectively ending the war—as well as the nation of South Vietnam. The Bird Dog Buang-Ly flew that day now hangs at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida. Chambers kept his job as the aircraft carrier’s captain and was later promoted to rear admiral; he retired in 1984. Nobody was prosecuted for the estimated $10 million loss of the helicopters that Chambers ordered overboard. The Midway’s crew collected money to help ease the transition for the Buang family, who became seven of the estimated 130,000 refugees from the Vietnam War to eventually resettle in the United States. All seven are now naturalized American citizens. Paul X. Rutz is an artist and freelance writer. A 2001 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, he served aboard the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy.

In the final days of the war he and his drill sergeant stole a helicopter as Saigon fell and flew west, expecting to keep fighting. They wound up in a refugee camp in Thailand and eventually made it to the US. He wouldn't see his family again until Clinton normalized relations with Vietnam 20 years later. In those final moments, soldiers who knew how to fly took whatever aircraft they could get their hands on, (Chinooks, Hueys, Cessnas, etc.) and flew aimlessly, hoping to run into friendly forces along the way before their fuel ran out. reply refurb 13 hours agoparentPeople get so tangled up in the geopolitics of these types of conflicts, and forget that every person the war touched has a personal story. I’ve known quite a few Vietnamese who lived through the conflict and their stories, no matter how lucky they were, the stories are incredible and hard to comprehend, no matter which side and whether they suffered horribly or made it out real relatively unscathed. Whether fleeing at a moments notice from your country of birth, never knowing where you are going or whether you’ll ever return. Or even the stories of people seeing the end and planning in advance what they will need and how to make sure family is ok. Then you think about the scale of it and that tens of millions of humans went through it and it’s impossible to comprehend the scale of it. What is really remarkable is the resiliency of humans. You speak to people who went through it and realize many have the perspective of “you did what you had to do” and “its a part of my life that is over now”, but try and imagine how hard it must be to live in a country of relative peace and see all these people around you who have never, and will never, go through anything similar, and try and have it all make sense. It’s also really fascinating talking to people who stayed in South Vietnam after. The entire system is reset. The police, the government, even where you get your food is swept away and rebuilt. I’ve noticed many people thrive on rumors as the government isn’t known for transparency. Days after the war order is restored and you hear rumors of what will come. Neighbors gossip, you do your best to prepare and wait. reply arrowsmith 5 hours agorootparent> It’s also really fascinating talking to people who stayed in South Vietnam after.

The article looks as of it was deliberately staying ambiguous about that part. But the complete absence of any statement about his previous flight experience or lack thereof suggests that he was a pilot, but they prefer not to talk too much about that part for the sake of a gripping story. (it does say so in the title, even if a reader eager of sensationalism might very well argue \"that was the flight that made him a pilot\") Zero experience in carrier operations is super-impressive nonetheless, but it completely pales next to the drama of setting out into nowhere overloaded and with a half-empty fuel tank. The airspeed delta between a Chessna and a carrier steaming into the wind is so low that the landing itself really would not be so that impressive. Impressive bit not crazy impressive. reply mannykannot 3 hours agorootparentAs the article mentions, the most dangerous aspect of the landing may have been the turbulence and downwash over the fantail. Given that this was a STOL airplane (and also given that the pilot would have had no experience landing on a target moving at almost his stall speed) it might have been safer if the ship just pointed its flight deck into the wind. I recall from flight school one instructor who liked to demonstrate that the aging Cessna 150 he was often assigned to could be landed in the width of a runway (as performed at an intersection.) reply dredmorbius 1 hour agorootparentit might have been safer if the ship just pointed its flight deck into the wind Reading TFA, that's precisely what occurred: Chambers ordered his chief engineer to transfer the ship’s electric load to the emergency diesel engines and make steam for 25 knots (29 mph)... The captain turned his ship into the wind to prepare for a fixed-wing landing.... Buang lowered the Bird Dog’s flaps and approached in a shallow descent at a speed of 60 knots (69 mph). With the ship providing an estimated 40 knots (46 mph) of headwind to aid the landing, the light plane slowly caught up. 15 knot headwind plus ship's speed gave 40 kt landing wind, aircraft landed at stall speed of 60 kt airspeed, giving 20 kt to kill on landing. That was a risk on a slick deck, and from the accompanying video the landing was fairly far down the deck, but had sufficient braking distance. reply dylan604 3 hours agorootparentprev> Your comment reads a lot like you were assuming that he was a layperson who never flew a plane before. You're reading something that's just not there then. I clearly left out the details as TFA clearly states he was a pilot (you just need to have read it and not skimmed). What I was referring to was landing on an airstrip on the ground is drastically different than landing on moving landing strip that also has hidden gotchas for trained pilots.

The draft is unequal, they are concerned about their IT worker shortage. The majority of drafting is happening in impoverished areas of the country, and ethnic minorities.

No one snatches people on the streets or when exiting the country like in Ukraine I don't think I heard of anyone drafted to war but I know many russians knowingly went to war to make money on contract basis (which is also not the same as mandatory draft).

Did they get in trouble? reply duxup 16 hours agorootparentI suspect someone could make up some sort of violation, but it seems like it is unlikely there's a specific order preventing them. Ship's captain is going to have a lot of leeway to complete his mission. Punishing a high ranking officer in their efforts to save allies would not look great, and at the end of the Vietnam War, I'm not sure who was interested in that. reply brookst 14 hours agorootparentprevThe article talks about the ships captain expecting to be court-martialed for it, but ultimately being promoted (not necessarily for this act). reply rl3 16 hours agorootparentprevIt's right there in the article: From the bridge Chambers quickly consulted task force commander Adm. William Harris, who was at his battle station below deck. “The admiral ordered me to tell the Bird Dog to ditch,” Chambers later recalled. [...] Assuming he would be court martialed, Chambers ordered those helicopters thrown overboard as well. He later told interviewers that since he expected to be deposed by prosecutors, he turned away from the action to avoid seeing exactly how many were pushed into the sea. [...] Chambers kept his job as the aircraft carrier’s captain and was later promoted to rear admiral; he retired in 1984. Nobody was prosecuted for the estimated $10 million loss of the helicopters that Chambers ordered overboard. reply refurb 12 hours agorootparentprevThere was a very small presence of Americans in South Vietnam at the time around 5,000. Mostly US government workers (e.g. USAID), CIA and some military. When the US disengaged in 1973, it left most of the military equipment and gave it to South Vietnam. So most of the helicopters and such that fled to the US fleet were South Vietnamese aircraft, not US aircraft. So I assume the US has pretty much written them off before that. reply keybored 9 hours agoparentprevI don’t know.

You know history is truly shaped by the victors as no one should forget the unthinkable horrors the country inflicted on civilians yet here we are. reply reaperducer 13 hours agoparentprevHow many countries would push $10 million worth of aircraft (1970s money) to save civilians? I know anti-American sentiment is very trendy on HN, but I found this interesting: Sirius Satellite Radio runs 1970's episodes of American Top 40 with Casey Casem on Sundays. A few weeks ago I was surprised to hear a spoken-word piece called \"Americans\" by a Canadian named Byron MacGregor was a top-40 hit. Here's a sample of the lyrics: When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through age It was the Americans who rebuilt them When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke Nobody loaned them an old caboose Both are still broke I can name you five thousand times When the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble Can you name me even one time When someone else raced to the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help Even during the San Francisco earthquake You can read the full lyrics here: https://genius.com/Byron-macgregor-americans-lyrics reply dredmorbius 1 hour agorootparentThe US was joined in Vietnam, context of this article, by France (whose problem it was to begin with), Canada, Australia, the UK, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Taiwan, and other states. The US was at the time in military alliances with much of Western Europe (NATO, 1949), South Pacific (SEATO, 1955), and an intelligence alliance (Five Eyes, 1941), amongst numerous other alliances and strategic partnerships. The US was born in battle with the assistance of France. Lafayette and the Statue of Liberty attest to this. At the time Americans was written (1974), the US was the world's leading superpower. It's not terribly surprising that in general aid flowed from the US to other states. But the flow and alliances were far from one-way even then. Your song, as with your broader point and follow-ups, is an extraordinary misreading and misrepresentation of history. reply relix 9 hours agorootparentprevI read worryingly little (no?) counter to the sentiment expressed by the lyrics as part of your message and the comments here. And the implication that people in other countries wouldn't spend $10MM of government funds to save a family instead of watching them ditch in the water is ridiculous. \"The World\" has jumped in to help Americans often. It's just that USA, due to their advantageous geographical position, never being bombed to bits, and having economic and military absolute supremacy, hasn't often been in a position of need where other countries can help out significantly. An example of where the world has helped significantly: Post 9/11 wars A recent example of when the world has helped: Californian wild fires And separately from that, of those \"five thousand times\" where the USA has helped other people in trouble, I guarantee a lot of those actually had considerable benefits for USA, meaning it wasn't a charity thing but the USA got something they wanted out of it, as well. Which is fine but let's not kid ourselves about those motives. Just opening Wikipedia on the San Francisco earthquake, under the heading \"Relief\" it gives some indication of the international support given: > During the first few days after news of the disaster reached the rest of the world, relief efforts reached over $5,000,000, equivalent to $169,560,000 in 2023. London raised hundreds of thousands of dollars. Individual citizens and businesses donated large sums of money for the relief effort: Standard Oil and Andrew Carnegie each gave $100,000; the Dominion of Canada made a special appropriation of $100,000; and even the Bank of Canada in Ottawa gave $25,000. And if we're allowed to go back as far as the San Francisco earthquake to \"judge\" the world, maybe we can extend that just a little further towards independence, where France provided significant support to the fledgling nation. \"The Americans\", is frankly, ridiculous, and anyone subscribing to the sentiments within betrays the same (and wrong) isolationist understanding of the world as they ironically indeed blame others to have. reply StefanBatory 5 hours agorootparent> The World\" has jumped in to help Americans often.

From the AP: “I’m not going to commit to that,” Trump said, when asked if he would rule out the use of the military. “It might be that you’ll have to do something. The Panama Canal is vital to our country.” He added, “We need Greenland for national security purposes.” This is just Trump being Trump, blustery and vague. It barely qualifies as saber-rattling. The guy loves to posture, but the level of hysteria around it is absurd. I’m not a fan of this kind of rhetoric, but Europeans acting like this is a genuine military threat instead of just laughing at him is ridiculous. Anyways, what were we talking about? Something inspirational I recall. reply seanmcdirmid 2 hours agorootparent> This is just Trump being Trump, blustery and vague. It barely qualifies as saber-rattling. The guy loves to posture, but the level of hysteria around it is absurd. It used to be posturing and blustering around acquiring territories was absurd. People are hysterical because they aren’t sure if Trump is being serious or if he just is sh*t talking. Greenlanders who feel like they might be invaded by the US aren’t just being sensitive snowflakes. reply mp05 1 hour agorootparentI encourage you to read the recent Reuters article on the topic: https://www.reuters.com/world/us-says-it-has-no-plans-increa... Danish PM Frederiksen: \"I cannot imagine the United States would use military intervention in Greenland, and it is up to the people of Greenland to decide what they want.\" Oh, interesting. I think that’s called self-determination, a key underpinning of democracy. > Greenlanders who feel like they might be invaded by the US aren’t just being sensitive snowflakes. Greenland is a critical strategic asset, and Denmark is incapable of defending it or its people. If Greenlanders are worried about being \"invaded\" by the U.S., they should be a hell of a lot more worried about Russia or China making moves in the Arctic. The world would objectively be safer if the U.S. took custodianship of Greenland, full stop. I’m no policy buff, but I’d bet that if someone were willing to make a rational deal, like perhaps allowing the U.S. to offer security in exchange for a slice of Greenland’s massive untapped resources, this entire situation would be resolved, and everyone would be better off. Again, I stress that the rhetoric around what is clearly a negotiation is not my style of doing business, but no serious person can argue that something has to be done about securing Greenland, nor do they think Trump is actually going to use military force. Edit: I must insist that I'm not trying to be inflammatory at all. I'm sincerely concerned about this geopolitical implications of this potential attack vector and it feels like pride is getting in the way of our security in the West. reply bradrn 13 hours agorootparentprevApparently it was by Gordon Sinclair originally: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans_(commentary) reply Toutouxc 4 hours agorootparentprevThat's... surprisingly bad. reply keybored 9 hours agorootparentprev“Now newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent war mongering Americans I'd like to just see one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States Dollar build its own airplanes Come on, let's hear it Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing jumbo jet The Lockheed Tri-star or the Douglas-10?

The author, himself, said it was not about the Vietnam War. You can wish as hard as you want, but it doesn't change the facts.

You release a song during the tail-end of the Vietnam War and decry the fact that people are decrying the “war mongering” Americans? Well that’s the obvious association.

I don’t know what kind of harebrained idea that was. > I hate to break it to you, but America and the rest of the world had been through a lot more than just the Vietnam War. You hate to break it to me? That’s a bizarre statement. I’m not jilted by anyone over that war.

      "In April 1975, Maj. Buang-Ly, a South Vietnamese pilot, executed a daring escape with his family in a small plane during the fall of South Vietnam. Captain Lawrence Chambers of the USS Midway made the unprecedented decision to clear the deck for Buang's landing, even discarding helicopters, allowing Buang to land safely. This event was part of Operation Frequent Wind, the final phase of the evacuation of American civilians and \"at-risk\" Vietnamese from Saigon, and Buang's plane is now displayed at the National Naval Aviation Museum."

Many South Vietnamese soldiers fled using any available aircraft, highlighting the desperation and chaos of the time. The USS Midway, now a museum, was pivotal in these events, reflecting the broader human impact of war and complex geopolitical issues."

    "commentBody": "YC Graveyard: 821 inactive Y Combinator startups (iamwillwang.com)285 points by memalign 12 hours agohidepastfavorite169 comments jll29 9 hours agoThere are not just startups that become unicorns and startups that fold. Investors' worst nightmare is if you just make enough money to keep going, but you don't grow (\"lifestyle business\" as they use it is a derogatory term). That's because they prefer a sudden death where they can write down the investment and deduct their loss from taxes than an investment where they never see any money again. And then there are \"acquisitions\" that are really \"acui-hires\" dressed up as acquisitions to get the people (more common) or to buy an asset in a limited shell package (less common) after things did/may have (but people were to tempted to take the offer) or did not pan/panned out. Some people consider anythingVery low cash flow only with no growth seems to be the only exception.. That's not an exception. That's the norm. Most start-ups fail. They literally burn down the investors' money and that's it. reply jbverschoor 9 hours agoparentprevThat’s not what a lifestyle business is. Unless your lifestyle is eating ramen reply smallerfish 8 hours agorootparentSure it is. If your business nets 3 million a year, it takes 5 people to run it, and your customer base is steady, that's lifestyle. Sucks for investors, pretty nice for you if you can keep it running. reply idlewords 7 hours agorootparentIn other sectors that's just called a \"small business\" and celebrated as the fullest expression of the American dream. I've always found it funny that tech treats the idea of a going concern with such distaste. reply amyjess 2 hours agorootparentMy favorite video game company is a little Japanese outfit called Nihon Falcom. They've been around since 1981, have about 65 employees, release exactly one new game a year, and if you've played any of their games, you can tell they're all made on absolutely shoestring budgets. They have also never posted a loss and have an absolutely bonkers amount of cash on hand (enough to keep the company going for several years on their current budget IIRC). They also make the best story-driven RPGs I've played in my life. And they specifically went the story-driven route because it's cheaper to hire good writers than it is to wow people with AAA graphics or a giant open world or whatever. More video game companies should be like Falcom. reply baxtr 5 hours agorootparentprevI know a guy who sells kitchens for a living and makes around $2-3 million per year with a profit margin of 60% or so. But he didn’t spend 10s of million dollars to get there. reply nunez 1 hour agorootparentThis is kind of like tech sales at huge tech old-cos. Sales people there can pull down insane comp if aligned to the right account with way less work than a traditional sales grind. reply AbstractH24 3 hours agorootparentprevEven if he did, that’s not such a bad deal. Particularly if the brand has value when he’s ready to move on and can be sold. reply erikerikson 3 hours agorootparentprevOr bar owners pulling down similar amounts. reply nunez 1 hour agorootparentThe VERY lucky ones that have been around a long while and own their building, sure. reply rvba 52 minutes agorootparentAlso lucky to not get robbed by mafia reply rchaud 4 hours agorootparentprevWhen you see how VC-funded AI startups market their products (\"eliminate artists/editors/paralegals\"), it's not surprising that they wouldn't be happy with dividends from a profitable business that employs people. Better to throw the money into a \"moonshot\" company that perennially loses money until BigCo buys them out to acquire their IP and fire everybody. reply CPLX 5 hours agorootparentprevWhile I do agree with you, if it took tens of millions of dollars in initial capital to get there, which hasn’t been returned, it’s quite a different thing to the standard small businesses model. reply withinboredom 4 hours agorootparentSo ... is a restaurant considered a small business? Where do you draw the line on initial investment? reply zdragnar 3 hours agorootparentWhat kind of restaurant takes tens of millions to start? Most estimates I'm aware of are less than 1 or 2 million at the very most. reply withinboredom 2 hours agorootparentI imagine some of the themed restaurants in Disney cost at least that much. reply soared 11 minutes agorootparentHaving worked at those, they are shoestring to the core. Guests see beauty, behind it is paper mache and $8/hr college students whose wages are garnished for rent and class fees. CPLX 3 hours agorootparentprevDepends on what kind of restaurant. But the point is that a business model that is \"profitable\" but actually took millions in initial capital and has no provision for debt service isn't an actually profitable business model. reply nprateem 3 hours agorootparentprev10x return reply aprilthird2021 6 hours agorootparentprevSpecifically investors, not \"all of tech\". And to be fair to them, if a company doesn't grow, your investment is wasted in that company, right? No shade to good small businesses, but they may not be worth investing in? reply cowsandmilk 6 hours agorootparentVenture Capitalists, not all investors. See https://codiesanchez.com/book/ or https://store.hbr.org/product/hbr-guide-to-buying-a-small-bu... reply Lerc 6 hours agorootparentprevI thought that was called sustainable. reply mrweasel 5 hours agorootparentIs it sustainable, if it took millions to bootstrap? I mean I guess if it can just keep running, but the investors might not agree if they need to wait 15 years to make their money back. reply SergeAx 4 hours agorootparentWhat choice do they have? If they shot the enterprise down, they got nothing. reply mrweasel 57 minutes agorootparentI think someone else pointed this out as well, but if the business fail, they can most likely do a tax write-off. reply anovikov 5 hours agorootparentprevBut in a case like that eventually (once the business has become \"sustainable\") we will be speaking of 1.5 founders (some full-time founder and some guy who just holds some stock because they started together/knows some know-how) and 3.5 Indians/Ukrainians at $40 an hour. With like 60% of cash going to the main guy, domicile in some tax haven and probably that principal founder living in some tax haven, too, pocketing some 1.5M a year after all (minuscule) taxes. Good lifestyle! reply YetAnotherNick 8 hours agorootparentprev3 million a year for 5 person is something like 400k/person after corporate tax. Which is pretty high and low at the same time(unless it is just freelancing). High in the sense that there would be competition and the other company will have more budget to reduce the price and make the entire segment unprofitable till you die. Low in the sense that you would likely make the same or higher in corporate if you are that skilled to net 3 million/year. reply smallerfish 7 hours agorootparentOnce the competition has initially shaken out in a new category, minority players can hang on for years. Their product could be perfect for their customers in ways that the big guns don't accommodate. reply that_guy_iain 8 hours agorootparentprevEnough money to keep going doesn't mean just enough money to cover the costs. It means being able to continue paying yourself and all your employees their salaries, meet costs and make a small minimum profit. reply normie3000 8 hours agorootparentAren't salaries considered to be part of the costs? reply oefrha 8 hours agorootparentEmployee salary is definitely cost. Founder/owner salary is more complicated. reply that_guy_iain 6 hours agorootparentprevYea, I meant more pay all the other bills like AWS, etc. But yea, salaries are defo costs. reply CPLX 5 hours agorootparentprevYou have to add “and return initial capital” to that list. That’s usually what’s at issue here. reply that_guy_iain 1 hour agorootparentThe reason that is the issue is because that is not something they actually need to do. It's something the investors want but not generally required as they expect an exit of some sort. reply sebmellen 10 hours agoprevI personally know the founders of three YC startups that are functionally dead (raised capital, not developing anything, basically laid off everyone but the founder(s)) but are not on this list. I'd bet it's at least twice that number. reply chipotle_coyote 1 hour agoparentI can think of at least one YC startup one that was relatively high-profile, for a hot minute, at least in the developer space that just shut down, period, that doesn't seem to be on the list, because I worked there. One extra irony point for its absence: it was basically across the street from Y Combinator's office in Mountain View at the time. :) reply chasely 45 minutes agoparentprevI know a similar number but they were \"acquihired\" to essentially return money to investors and get the founders promotions at their former companies. So an exit on paper even if it's not necessarily so in practice. reply satvikpendem 10 hours agoparentprevI'm curious, what do ex-founders generally do after their startup is dead? For me I just got a job after my first few ones died, until I was able to succeed at my current ones, but I'm sure many might just continue working a job indefinitely. reply sebmellen 9 hours agorootparentI know some (YC and others) who float around doing nothing on $200k a year in salary because no investor cares enough, or has the legal right, to get their money back. Not sure what their long-term game plan is. The others end up at another Series B+ startup or go to a MANGA company if they can grind leetcode for a bit and get an interview. reply tinco 8 hours agorootparentThey pay themselves 200k/y in a pre-market fit startup? That's insane and I guess on the investors for going over the traditional preseed amounts. Or do you mean that they're zombie startups that make enough to pay the founder 200k/year? reply sebmellen 8 minutes agorootparentYep. The former. Maybe they make $50k in revenue, have a few products still officially available, and raised a couple million dollars. reply bobxmax 4 hours agorootparentprevDepends on your money raised and your leverage. YC companies are typically top tier founders with tons of leverage and capital options. reply xenospn 7 hours agorootparentprevI think a lot of gen z founders see nothing wrong with paying themselves a FAANG salary. My generation, not so much (I’m 45). reply leetrout 5 hours agorootparentI worked at a startup where the founders were your age and paid themselves that much while holding their majority stake in stock. We had open salary bands so we were all paid OK especially our couple ~entry level folks at $100-120k. It was strange times in my eyes, though. They hired an HR person whose first act was to raise the c-suite salaries to market rate ($200k+) while the business still had negligible income but closed a round. It is good to be in the owner class, I guess. reply Salgat 5 hours agorootparentWhat a sweet position to be in. All the upside of the potential stock valuation windfall while none of the downside of putting your career and income on the line. reply ryandrake 2 hours agorootparentI mean, when your dad knows the right guy at a prestigious bank, and your mom is a VP in a prestigious biotech firm, and they bought you your spot at Stanford, you kind of deserve it, right? reply gammarator 3 hours agorootparentprevNot an expert myself, but I don’t believe $200k/year counts as a “FAANG salary” for anyone with founder-level responsibility. reply AlotOfReading 19 minutes agorootparentI'd argue there there aren't any single positions at large tech companies with founder level responsibility by design. It's a pretty decent compensation though. The base salary of a mid-level position at Amazon with substantially better equity terms (no cliff, no one deciding your bonus will be cut without your input, etc). It's a far cry from the PG ideal of salaryless founders surviving on instant ramen in their garage. reply immibis 2 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you see wrong with it? There's no social contract any more, where people are expected to be nice and save each other money. Everyone's in it for themselves, and the VC/investment side started that trend first. reply chrisjj 5 hours agorootparentprev> some (YC and others) who float around doing nothing on $200k a year in salary So, not \"functionally dead\" then. ;) reply noduerme 10 hours agorootparentprevI don't think a lot of founders actually write code, but I did, I just realized my startup was probably going to be illegal soon and also that it wasn't going to get the funding it needed. I just kept writing code for whoever wanted to pay. It's fairly lucrative. Looking back, maybe I should have just done the illegal thing and gotten pardoned. reply netsharc 9 hours agorootparentGotta love the jumping on the criminality bandwagon... Louis Brandeis says hello. https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1062178 reply xenospn 7 hours agorootparentFun fact: my kibbutz is named after him. He bought the land from the local Palestinians. reply kiney 10 hours agorootparentprevnow I'm curious about the illegal thing reply CamelCaseName 9 hours agorootparentSeems like Bitcoin casino (from bio) reply jsemrau 9 hours agorootparentMight have worked in a different jurisdiction. If you look at valve and the CSGO controversy. reply choppaface 10 hours agoparentprevNeed to also consider the ones that had a qualified exit event and then the product got axed (e.g. aquihire or just customer acquisition). It’s a very different graveyard but in many cases has similar impact on the non-Founders (especially the IC SWEs). reply zenyc 6 hours agoprevI love seeing the 'YC Graveyard' project. It’s a great reminder of the incredible ideas and effort behind each startup, even if things didn’t pan out. We’ve been working on giving some of these inactive startups a second chance by acquiring them and exploring ways to repurpose or revive their tech. If anyone’s been involved with an inactive YC project and wants to chat about what’s possible, I’d love to connect. reply ungreased0675 3 hours agoparentI’d love to read more about this. Looking through the list, my reaction to some was “of course that OpenAI wrapper failed” but others sounded compelling. It’s logical that some of those failed companies have a viable product but failed for other reasons. Maybe combining the IP of similar companies could breed a winner. It’s an interesting concept and I’m curious if it works. reply robocat 10 hours agoprevI'm onehundertpercent pissed off with YC: * The modal win for a founder is $0.00 * PG makes big talk about winner's average returns... Yayyyyy..... However YC gets preferential shares; YC is not aligned with the common shareholders (founders; builders). YC builds a story that they support creators however YC doesn't sit on the same table-side as creators. * I actually believe YC is worthwhile, but I wonder if Ize just been brainwashed? (reëdited for clarity) reply jasode 8 hours agoparent>However YC gets preferential shares; It's not that YC specifically gets \"preferred shares\" it's that investors in general insist on liquidation preferences when buying non-liquid shares in unproven private companies. How would an alternative scenario of investors buying common shares of illiquid stock in a private company actually be realistic? Maybe the startup founders could hypothetically insist on selling only common shares and never preferred shares as a condition of investment?!? But what investors (other than family relatives) would put in money in that case? Or put another way, let's say we create a brand new VC fund to invest in startups and one of the novel concepts is that the fund only buys common shares to be more \"founder friendly\". The problem is that hypothetical VC fund will attract no rational limited partners with money because they know that startup founders can just take their invested dollars with no payback protection. Such a VC fund with no investors and no money to invest would be a moot point. The general partner of such a VC fund would be considered a \"financial idiot\" for buying common shares in startups. In the end, the \"preferred shares\" is the market's \"risk premium\" that investors charge as an offsetting factor for losing 100% of their money. If startup founders can't find a way to convince investors to accept illiquid common stock instead of preferred shares, they need to avoid investors altogether and self-fund via bootstrapping. reply AbstractH24 3 hours agorootparentWhy is the risk being taken by investors greater than the one being taken by employees and founders? If anything, employees are taking a greater risk because you can replace money far more easily than years of your life. reply epistasis 3 hours agorootparentOne is risking money, one time, and the money is what could possibly get paid back. If you can find money that doesn't insist on preferred liquidation, good on you. But those with the money tend to have a lot of say on giving it away. reply mlhpdx 1 hour agorootparentFor what it’s worth, which isn’t much, I see signs this precept is changing because of the huge amounts of investible capital fighting for opportunities as the thaw progresses. It’s not going to be a widespread change, though, most will stick with what they’ve known. reply nradov 2 hours agorootparentprevThe level of risk is irrelevant. What matters in access to capital is negotiating power. This isn't a charity. If employees want lower risk then they can go work somewhere else. reply mlhpdx 1 hour agorootparentLikewise, if investors want to invest (deploy capital) they will adapt. There is more balanced leverage recently. reply derangedHorse 5 hours agorootparentprevHe didn’t claim YC does this where others don’t, his gripe is with the narrative YC pushes and how they seem incongruent to how they currently operate. reply dustingetz 7 hours agorootparentprevpreferred shares prevent cookie cutter founder fraud. Founder raises $1M at 10 post. Founder decides to sell 6 months later for 2 mil. Investors get 200k back founder gets 1.8 mil. Now run this math for AI unicorns. reply AbstractH24 3 hours agorootparentThis is a valid concern.

As long as the company is able to recruit and retain qualified employees, any fairness or lack thereof is entirely irrelevant. But as a potential employee interviewing for a new job, if you're being offered equity compensation then you might want to inquire about share classes and liquidation preferences.

The original 2005 YCombinator where Paul Graham & Friends used some of their personal Yahoo wealth from selling ViaWeb ... instead of raising outside money from \"limited partners\" ... was the period when they were more like \"angel investors\". Today, YC is more institutionalized and has different funds that raise money from outside investors as limited partners very much like traditional VC funds. (https://www.google.com/search?q=YC+new+funds+raise+billions) But YC still doesn't do all the typical \"vc fund\" procedures such as take a board seat or negotiate a different % with each startup founder on a case-by-case basis. The VC funds like Sequoia/a16z/etc will require a board seat and negotiate different ownership percentages.

    "originBody": "Downtown Doug Brown Thoughts from a combined Apple/Linux/Windows geek. Home About Mac ROM SIMMs Software Microcontroller lessons Contact Jan 25 The invalid 68030 instruction that accidentally allowed the Mac Classic II to successfully boot up Doug Brown Classic Mac, Reverse engineering 2025-01-25 This is the story of how Apple made a mistake in the ROM of the Macintosh Classic II that probably should have prevented it from booting, but instead, miraculously, its Motorola MC68030 CPU accidentally prevented a crash and saved the day by executing an undefined instruction. I’ve been playing around with MAME a lot lately. If you haven’t heard of MAME, it’s an emulator that is known best for its support of many arcade games. It’s so much more than that, though! It is also arguably the most complete emulator of 68000-based Mac models, thanks in large part to Arbee‘s incredible efforts. I will admit that I’ve used MAME to play a game or two of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time, but my main use for it is Mac emulation. Here’s how this adventure begins. I had been fixing some issues in MAME with the command + power key combination that invokes the debugger, and decided to see if the keystroke also worked on the Classic II. Even though this Mac model has a physical interrupt button on the side, it also has an “Egret” 68HC05 microcontroller for handling the keyboard and mouse (among other things) that should be able to detect the keypress and signal a non-maskable interrupt to the main CPU. I believe the Egret disables this keystroke by default, but MacsBug contains code that sends the command to enable it. I didn’t get very far while testing the command+power shortcut in MAME’s emulated Classic II, because I observed something very odd. It booted up totally fine in 24-bit addressing mode, but I could not get it to boot at all if I enabled 32-bit addressing, which I needed in order for MacsBug to load. It would just pop up a Sad Mac, complete with the Chimes of Death. On this machine, the death chime is a few notes from the Twilight Zone theme song. If you’re not familiar with Apple’s whole 24-bit versus 32-bit addressing saga, I’ll briefly summarize it for you here. The original Motorola 68000 processor only had 24 address lines even though it used 32 bits internally for addresses. Apple took those eight extra otherwise unused bits and repurposed them for storing flags as a way to save on RAM, which was scarce at the time. When newer machines/processors came out that supported a full 32-bit address space, the upper byte couldn’t be used for flags anymore. Because of that discrepancy, old software would have been incompatible, so newer machines had two modes: 24-bit mode for compatibility with older software, and 32-bit mode for being able to use all of your RAM. So why was the Classic II failing to boot in 32-bit mode in MAME? What was broken? Arbee also reproduced the issue, so at least I knew I wasn’t losing my mind. I assumed it was a random bug in MAME, so I started looking deeper into it to try to understand what needed to be fixed. According to an old Apple Tech Info Library article, 0000000F means an exception occurred and 00000001 means the exception was a bus error. A bus error on 68k Macs typically means that something tried to access an invalid address, like if you try to read from or write to an expansion card when there isn’t one installed. What was the invalid address being accessed? I decided to step through the code using MAME’s amazing debugger to understand what was leading to the crash. Comprehending what’s going on in the ROM with no context at all can be tricky, but luckily, Apple included symbol maps for a bunch of Mac ROMs with Macintosh Programmer’s Workshop (MPW). MPW was Apple’s development environment. Tracing backwards from the actual Sad Mac screen would be difficult, because there is a ton of code involved in setting up and displaying the screen. To make it easier on myself, I decided I would set a breakpoint on the bus error handler and then look backwards from there. The 68030’s vector table starts at the very beginning of the address space, and the bus error vector is at 0x00000008. With the Sad Mac error still on the screen, here’s what memory looked like at that location: This meant the bus error handler was at 0x40A026F0, which is also known as GenExcps in the ROM map. I performed a hard reset of the emulated machine, set a breakpoint on that address, and then waited until it hit the breakpoint. It looks like GenExcps is a big list of BSR instructions that all jump to 0x40A026A0, which is common error handling code identified in the ROM map as ToDeepShit. Nice name, Apple! Anyway, since MAME hit my breakpoint, this meant Apple’s technote was correct about it being a bus error. I was able to use the MAME debugger’s history command to show a backtrace of instructions that led to this point. The end of the history output is displayed in the bottom pane of the screenshot below: If we walk upwards, we can see that the instruction that caused the bus error was at 0x40A43B9C: move.b #$90, ($1c00,A1) I opened up this section of code in IDA, which I still find myself using with 68k Mac stuff because I’m used to it. It was pretty clearly part of the routine that starts at 0x40A43B40, which is helpfully labeled in the ROM map as InstallSoundIntHandler. Let’s look at the whole function in more depth. The first thing it does is immediately jump to V8SndIntPatch1. This appears to be something that was patched into this ROM for handling sound initialization for the V8. For some added context, the Classic II isn’t powered by an eight-cylinder gasoline engine; V8 is the name of the custom chip that Apple first used in the Macintosh LC. From the LC hardware developer note: Why are we talking about the LC here? Well, the reason is because the Classic II is architecturally based more on the LC than the original Macintosh Classic. Here’s an explanation from the corresponding developer note for the Classic II: The text description of the EAGLE gate array is very similar to that of the V8, so it should come as no surprise that the chips themselves are very similar too. MAME handles them both in the same source file. The point I’m trying to make here is that it makes sense that the Classic II’s ROM has code referring to the V8. With that info out of the way, let’s look at V8SndIntPatch1: This chunk of code is calling the Gestalt trap, which is how you determine various info about the Mac. In particular, it’s using the gestaltHardwareAttr selector, which is defined as ‘hdwr’ in Apple’s public header files. If bit 3 (gestaltHasASC) isn’t set in the response, it bails and returns. Otherwise, it jumps to V8SndIntPatch1Rtn at 0x40A43B4A, which you can see in the history trace in the MAME debugger screenshot from earlier. I went pretty deep into the hardware tables for the Classic II and can confirm that gestaltHasASC is definitely set on the Classic II. After all, the EAGLE contains a stripped-down equivalent of the Apple Sound Chip (ASC). Now, let’s take a look at V8SndIntPatch1Rtn: Phew! This is a decent amount of code. It’s not that complicated though. I’ll explain the important stuff. You can see the instruction that leads to the Sad Mac at 0x40A43B9C. If you start at the top, what’s happening is it’s loading a byte from RAM at 0xCB3 into register D0: moveq #$0,d0 move.b (byte_CB3).w,d0 If you know where to look out there, you can discover that this global variable is called BoxFlag and contains a value identifying which machine you have. If I step through this code in MAME, I can see that D0 ends up loaded with the value 0x11 = 17, which is correct for the Classic II. Continuing further through the code, some other stuff happens, and then at 0x40A43B6C the value in D0 ends up being doubled (so it turns into 0x22). Immediately after this, it is used as an offset in a jump instruction. Here’s IDA’s syntax for the jump, because it’s more intuitive than what MAME displays: add.w d0,d0 jmp loc_40A43B72(pc,d0.w) Since D0 ends up as 0x22 after being doubled, we jump to 0x40A43B72 + 0x22 = 0x40A43B94, and here’s what that code looks like in MAME’s debugger when we reach it: Stepping further through the code, you can see we eventually reach the instruction that causes a Sad Mac. Let’s see what all the registers look like before it’s executed: Hmm, that’s odd. This crashing instruction writes the value 0x90 to an offset 0x1C00 bytes past the address stored in A1. A1 is set to 0xFFFF8FBA, so the address where the write occurs at is 0xFFFF8FBA + 0x1C00 = 0xFFFFABBA. This is a totally invalid address on the Classic II! No wonder we get a Sad Mac. As expected, as soon as we step into this instruction, instead of reaching the RTS instruction just below it, we end up in the code path for displaying a Sad Mac error at 0x40A026F0. This is definitely where everything craps out. Okay, so now I had a pretty good idea of what was happening in MAME. A1 had a junk value, so the ROM code was writing to an invalid address. FFFFABBA dabba doo! I decided to investigate further to understand how A1 came to be loaded with a bad address. And that’s when I discovered something really bizarre. Let’s take a closer look at one of the earlier screenshots, after we used the value of D0 (BoxFlag) to jump to the correct chunk of code for the Classic II: I thought about this some more, and eventually realized that something absolutely crazy happened here. We were supposed to be jumping into a table of BRA.S instructions, one for each possible BoxFlag value. That’s why we added D0 to itself before using it as a jump offset — each BRA.S instruction is two bytes long, so the index into the table needed to be doubled to turn it into a byte offset. Why didn’t we end up pointing at a BRA.S instruction? And where did this CAS.W instruction come from? If you look closely at the table of branches below the JMP instruction at 0x40A43B6E, there are only 16 entries in the table, corresponding to BoxFlags 0 through 15. The Classic II is BoxFlag 17! As I said earlier, the calculated offset we jump to is 0x40A43B94, which is not even supposed to be the start of an instruction. It’s smack dab in the middle of the MOVEA.L instruction at 0x40A43B92, which is the instruction that loads A1 with a real address that this code can use for enabling the sound interrupt. When we jump to 0x40A43B94, we aren’t running intended code anymore. The CPU gets out of sync with the path that the code was designed to follow. 0x0CEC was supposed to be the second half of the MOVEA.L instruction — the address in RAM to load from — but instead, it is being treated as the start of a new instruction. The CPU doesn’t get back in sync right away. We execute this mystery CAS (compare and swap) instruction, and then an unintended “MOVE.B D0, D4” instruction, before finally reaching a real MOVE.B instruction at 0x40A43B9C — the instruction that crashes. That is the point where the CPU has returned to running code that Apple actually wanted it to run. But unfortunately, A1 contains an invalid address because the code that was supposed to fill it out wasn’t reached, so of course everything crashes when we try to write to A1 + 0x1C00. It all makes sense. Going back further, A1 gets loaded with the “junk” value of 0xFFFF8FBA as part of the initial jump to InstallSoundIntHandler. So, of course, it’s not really junk. It’s being used as an offset for a jump instruction: IDA’s disassembly is a little more readable. That value of 0xFFFF8FBA loaded into A1 represents how much you have to add to the program counter in order to reach InstallSoundIntHandler from where you currently are. Interpreting it as signed, it’s a negative number because that function is further back in the ROM code. Overall, I felt that I totally understood what was happening. I’m probably repeating myself, but I just want it to sink in one more time: The problematic value in A1 gets loaded as part of a big relative jump to this section of ROM, and an out-of-bounds table access is jumping past code that is supposed to load A1 with an actual address of a peripheral to configure for sound interrupts. So A1 still contains that negative offset for the jump instead of a real address. Finally, it ends up being used as an address in a write operation, and boom, Sad Mac. If you’ve followed along with me thus far, I’m sure there are some burning questions on your mind. This explains how MAME fails, but not why. Why was this happening? Also, why didn’t this same failure occur on actual hardware? Obviously, the Classic II wasn’t recalled because of an inability to use 32-bit addressing. There’s no way that happened. It would have been all over tech news. Not to mention the fact that the people actually working on the ROM code would have quickly noticed it while they were testing. It’s kind of a glaring issue. So what gives? Was MAME doing something wrong here that didn’t match hardware? This code couldn’t have really been reached on hardware, right? I have the answer to these questions, but as a forewarning, the situation is way more complicated than I expected it to be. I started out by trying to understand what the CAS instruction reached after the out-of-bounds jump was doing. Here are the bytes: 0C EC 08 A9 00 04 I quickly noticed that if I changed my disassembly in IDA so that it thought the code was supposed to start there, it refused to disassemble the instruction at all: When I tried to convert it to code starting at 0x40A43B94, it said: Command \"MakeCode\" failed GNU objdump also failed to disassemble it, and then got right back in sync with the intended code: 40a43b94: 0cec.short 0x0cec 40a43b96: 08a9 0004 1800bclr #4,%a1@(6144) 40a43b9c: 137c 0090 1c00moveb #-112,%a1@(7168) 40a43ba2: 4e75rts The fact that two well-known disassemblers balked at this instruction piqued my curiosity. I decided to use MacsBug on my Macintosh IIci, which also has a 68030 processor, to put all that code into RAM at a random location and see what MacsBug thought about it. Since I was going through all this effort, I also arranged all the other registers to be identical to what I was seeing on MAME. It wasn’t a perfect match with what I was seeing in MAME, though; I had to leave the program counter pointing into RAM instead of ROM. Interesting — MacsBug also said it was a CAS.W instruction, but it interpreted it slightly differently. It said it was CAS.W D1,D2,$0004(A4). Of course, I couldn’t resist stepping through the code in MacsBug to see what it would do on a real 68030 processor: Wait…what? If you compare the register display on the left side of the screen in the first picture with the same display in the second picture, something incredibly strange has happened. Even though MacsBug and MAME both don’t mention A1 in their interpretations of this CAS instruction at all, the value of A1 has changed! It started out as 0xFFFF8FBA, and ended up as 0xFC6B8. It seems to have turned into a value similar to what’s in A5 through A7 — a valid RAM address. Further tinkering with MacsBug and different register values revealed that the new value of A1 depended on the original value of A1, A7, and the program counter. I couldn’t figure out exactly what it was doing, but it was definitely majorly changing A1’s value. At this point, I felt like I was onto something. The MAME-emulated Classic II was crashing because A1 didn’t change, so it still contained an invalid address. On hardware, this weird instruction, which several disassemblers refused to touch, and wasn’t even intended to be jumped to because it starts in the middle of an actual valid instruction, was changing A1 to a new value that was a good address. Was this crazy instruction accidentally fixing A1 and thus hiding a bug from Apple’s ROM developers in the early 1990s? This was about the time that Arbee suggested I start sharing my research on the 68kmla forums and the bannister.org forums to see if some of the incredible folks who know way more than me about the 68k instruction set might be able to chime in. I also asked around on IRC in #mac68k on Libera. The consensus was that this is not a valid CAS instruction, and that MacsBug’s interpretation of the registers being D1 and D2 is correct. Let’s look at what the Motorola M68000 Family Programmer’s Reference Manual says about the encoding of the CAS instruction: Comparing this with the 3 words of the instruction (0x0CEC 0x08A9 0x0004) and filling in the fields, we can see the following: The first word appears to be a valid CAS instruction. The second word, though, has a few bits that are 1 even though the instruction format specifically says they are supposed to be 0. I’ve marked them in red. Also, the Du and Dc fields match what MacsBug says, as opposed to how MAME interpreted it. The third word, 0x0004, is the d16 value mentioned in the MODE field. It’s the $0004 offset from A4. So according to Motorola’s reference manual, this instruction is: CAS D1,D2,$0004(A4) …except it has three bits that are 1 in places where they are supposed to be 0. So it’s not a valid instruction at all. At least, it’s not documented. Side note: I think MAME’s debugger is also decoding normal CAS instructions incorrectly; if I change it to 0x0CEC 0x0081 0x0004 instead, which is the correct way to write this instruction without the three bad “1” bits, it still thinks Du is D0 instead of D2. But that’s beside the point — the instruction we’re dealing with in this story is completely messed up either way. The CAS (compare-and-swap) instruction is an interesting one. It’s used for accomplishing various atomic operations without requiring a lock. It is one of the few instructions in the 68000 family CPUs that perform a read-modify-write bus cycle. What this particular instruction is supposed to do is compare the word value in memory at A4 + 4 to the value of D1. If they are the same, then the value in D2 is written to memory at A4 + 4. Otherwise, the value in memory at A4 + 4 is loaded into D1. It clearly still does some of this stuff, like the read-modify-write cycle involving A4 + 4. If I change A4 to point to an invalid address, MacsBug complains to me. For example, on my Mac IIci with the same test setup I showed earlier, if I set A4 to 0xFFFF0000 and rerun the bad instruction, MacsBug tells me this: Bus Error at 0004CB20 while reading word (read-modify-write) from FFFF0004 in Supervisor data space This definitely means that this instruction still performs the RMW cycle at A4 + 4. It doesn’t seem to do exactly what the CAS instruction is supposed to do though. Obviously, the normal CAS instruction wouldn’t mess with the value of A1. I ran more tests after changing A4 to point to RAM. If I store the value 0xFFFF at A4 + 4, and D1 is set to 0x1111 and D2 is set to 0x2222, then after executing the instruction, memory at A4 + 4 changes to 0x2222. But that doesn’t really make any sense, because it only should have written 0x2222 to memory if D1 was equal to 0xFFFF. Let’s summarize what we’ve learned so far. The invalid code that the ROM accidentally jumps to (0x0CEC 0x08A9 0x0004) is sort of like “CAS D1,D2,$0004(A4)”, but not really, because some of the bits that are supposed to be 0 are actually set to 1. On another 68030-based Mac, I’ve observed that this instruction ends up modifying the value stored in register A1. MAME’s 68030 CPU emulator does not change A1 like this, because the instruction is undocumented and normal code would never use it. The Sad Mac in MAME occurs a couple of instructions later because A1 is set to an invalid address, and code in ROM tries to write a byte to A1 + 0x1C00. I was starting to believe something that sounded almost too crazy to be true: Apple had an out-of-bounds jump bug in the Classic II’s ROM that should have caused a Sad Mac during boot, but they had no idea the bug was there because the 68030 was accidentally fixing the value of A1 by executing an undocumented instruction. How could I prove that my theory was correct? By buying a Classic II and hacking the ROM in order to see exactly what is happening on hardware, of course! This Classic II was manufactured in 1991, so it’s about 34 years old at this point. Computers this old usually need to be repaired if nobody has already fixed them. As I mentioned in a previous post about the LC III capacitor polarization mistake, the surface mount capacitors in old Macs leak out corrosive goo over time. This machine was no exception. I didn’t even try powering it up. I immediately opened it up and removed what I believe was the original Sonnenschein 1/2 AA lithium battery with a March 1991 date code. The battery had not leaked at all, luckily! That’s another unfortunate thing that happens in a lot of old Macs that have been sitting around for decades — severe battery damage. I don’t want to go into excruciating detail about the repair and make this post even longer to read, but if you’re interested in hearing more about that process, I posted a few updates about the repair in my 68kmla forum thread. I did accidentally short /RESET to ground while soldering in new capacitors, but I eventually got the logic board working. This was very similar to what happened to Adrian’s Digital Basement on his SE/30 board a few months ago, but lucky for me, my accidental short didn’t involve 12 volts and fry a bunch of chips! Adrian’s channel is an excellent resource for vintage computer enthusiasts out there, if you’re not already subscribed. The Classic II has a cathode-ray tube for its screen, which scares the crap out of me, so I opted to use a different solution in order to run the logic board by itself without any dangerous voltages. Plus, the analog boards in these computers are known to be a huge pain to repair. This one had really bad capacitor leakage, so that’ll probably be a future repair project. The bottom line is I knew I’d be installing and removing ROM chips a bunch, so I wanted to run the logic board out in the open, for reasons of both safety and convenience. Special thanks to 68kmla forum member davewongillies for posting his similar setup with a Classic II logic board, complete with Amazon links for a bunch of the parts. That Mini-Fit Jr. pin extractor tool on Amazon is absolute garbage though — I could never get it to work. I ended up using staples instead. I got impatient while waiting for my RGBtoHDMI to arrive for converting the Classic II’s video signal into HDMI, and eventually discovered another solution created by GitHub user guruthree involving a Raspberry Pi Pico that converts the signal to VGA. I made a few cables, tweaked the code until the timings and colors were correct, and ended up with this concoction to adapt between a CGA DE-9 video connector and VGA: Although I would never do anything like this in a real production environment where reliability matters, I didn’t even use level shifters for the 5V signals coming from the Mac. Technically, the RP2040 is “sort of” 5V tolerant, even though it’s not documented in the datasheet. That, combined with the fact that I had a few Picos laying around that I didn’t care about destroying, gave me enough confidence to try it out. Here’s the whole mess, all wired up together, along with an ATX power supply. I also swapped the original ROM chips out with some programmable SST29EE010 EEPROMs I had on hand. Interestingly, the factory chips from Apple were actually UV-erasable EPROMs, so I could have even used the original chips if I had a UV chip eraser. I successfully booted from a SCSI drive using this setup, and could capture the video signal with one of my many video capture devices: By the way, I think there’s something wrong with at least one column of pixels on the left side. I think it has something to do with the tweak I made to the code running on the RP2040 in order to make it sync up correctly with the Classic II’s video signal. I’m sure I could fix it if I played around more. The RGBtoHDMI, which arrived a few days later, does not have this problem. Anyway, I knew I was in business. I threw together some 68030 assembly code to display the value of A1 on the screen, found an unused place in the ROM to put it, and then came up with three custom ROMs to try on the Classic II: Custom ROM 1: Replace the instruction at 0x40A43B9C that results in a Sad Mac (the MOVE.B instruction) with a jump to my special code that draws A1 to the screen, so we can see what A1 is on hardware at that point. Also, this would verify whether this code even runs at all on hardware. Custom ROM 2: Replace the instruction at 0x40A43B94 (the CAS instruction) with the same jump to my special code. This would verify whether the out-of-bounds jump was really happening, and what the value of A1 was leading up to it. Custom ROM 3: Replace the instruction at 0x40A43B94 (the CAS instruction) with NOPs. This would ideally replicate exactly what I was seeing in MAME, proving that the bad CAS instruction was vital to the Classic II’s ability to boot. Let’s look at the results one by one. Here’s the result that was displayed when I ran Custom ROM 1: This verified that the section of code I was looking at definitely ran on hardware. It also showed that A1 was set to a very interesting value when it reached the instruction that crashed on MAME. 0x40A4BBB2 is not really an address you would write to because it’s a ROM address, but it doesn’t cause a bus error if you attempt it. Here is what I got when I ran Custom ROM 2: The same A1 value that we saw in MAME! This proved two things. One, the out-of-bounds table jump was definitely happening — if it wasn’t, my custom A1 drawing code wouldn’t have ran at all, since the JMP to it was stored out of sync of the normal intended code flow just like the accidental CAS instruction. Second, it also proved, along with the first test, that the CAS instruction was indeed fixing A1 on hardware, just like I theorized. Lastly, my test run of Custom ROM 3, which eliminated the CAS instruction from the situation altogether, gave me the final proof I needed: A Sad Mac, just like I saw with MAME in 32-bit mode. I also discovered during this test that on hardware, the same Sad Mac happens in 24-bit mode too. So MAME is actually more tolerant than hardware of that invalid write in 24-bit mode. These results motivated me to make a couple more hacked ROM images to run on hardware in order to glean the values of all of the CPU’s data and address registers immediately before and after the CAS instruction. The data register values are shown in the left column, address registers in the right column. Before: And after: Yep! Everything is the same except for A1, which has magically been transformed from FFFF8FBA to 40A4BBB2. The mystery instruction is definitely what was responsible for that. One fun part about this test was being able to successfully verify that everything on hardware was exactly identical to what MAME did up to the bad instruction. The entire register state shown in the “before” picture is a perfect match to what MAME shows when booting in 32-bit mode prior to the bad CAS instruction. See for yourself: If your brain is fried after reading all this, first of all I don’t blame you at all, and second, let me bring everything together to explain what this all means: I’ve discovered an undocumented MC68030 instruction that performs a read-modify-write bus cycle and also changes the value of the A1 register. This newly-discovered instruction turns out to be the glue that’s accidentally holding the Classic II together. Without this instruction modifying A1, the Classic II can’t boot. I’m confident that it was a mistake and not something intentional. A totally understandable mistake, at that. If the pesky 68030 hadn’t been hiding the bug from Apple’s ROM developers, there is no doubt they would have caught it before the Classic II shipped. It’s not like they did all of their development work in 24-bit mode! I searched deeper and found the same chunk of code in the newer Macintosh IIvx ROM, and in that ROM they finally increased the size of the jump table. I confirmed that the case for the Classic II in that code does nothing at all. It just jumps directly to an RTS instruction. I wonder if the Apple ROM developer working on that chunk of code in the IIvx ROM scratched their head in confusion when they added new entries for a bunch of new models, including the Classic II, after the Classic II ROM had already been finalized and shipped. Who knows? I’m not sure how Apple handled all the different ROM variants back then. Because of this new discovery, I think it’s very likely that there is not a 100% perfect Motorola MC68030 emulator or replica in existence right now. This might be the only case in existence where it matters though. What this means is I could write a small chunk of code that determines whether it’s running on a physical 68030 or an emulator, by simply using that instruction and looking at the resulting value of A1. What can MAME do in order to work around this problem and allow the Classic II to boot? We don’t really know the exact details of what this instruction does. With some limited testing, I believe I’ve observed that the resulting value of A1 depends on the original A1 value, the value of A7, and the program counter. But I’m not sure. Maybe someone can make a program that tries out a bunch of different register values and memory contents, and attempt to deduce what exactly the instruction does so that it can be emulated accurately. Until someone decides that it’s worth trying to figure out, MAME is patching this bug out of the ROM in order to allow the Classic II to boot. As Arbee pointed out, we’re a little late to get Motorola/Freescale/NXP to issue an errata. Unless someone who worked on the 68030 happens to see this post and might have a clue about what’s going on here… Here’s a screenshot of MAME with Arbee’s patch applied, now able to successfully emulate a Classic II with 32-bit addressing enabled. Yay! After all that, what’s the lesson we can learn from this story? I guess it’s that emulators can teach us new things about hardware that we never would have thought to look into! I bet this bug in the ROM would have gone undiscovered for all eternity if not for MAME providing emulation of the Classic II, which isn’t a particularly notable machine compared to more popular compact Macs like the SE/30 and Color Classic. It also goes to show you how bugs can be lurking in the background in places where you might think everything is totally polished. I think it’s also a good example of how some bugs just aren’t that big of a deal. This bug fits that category pretty well. The machine worked fine and nobody noticed. Oh, and as for the original reason I somehow managed to pull myself into this investigation in the first place: the command+power key combination does not work in MAME. Now that I have a real Classic II, I have been able to confirm that the keystroke does indeed work on hardware. It only works with MacsBug installed, which is likely due to what I said earlier about the Egret disabling it by default. Either way, it really should work in MAME when MacsBug is installed. I suppose that’s another MAME fix for me to work on!

I am too young to have used MacsBug for development during the time when it was heavily used, but I’ve gotten a lot of great use out of it recently while experimenting with these Macs from the era. Thank you for all the work you did on MacsBug! It truly is an excellent piece of software. Dan Allen @ 2025-01-25 16:55 Thank you Doug for your kind words. Dan tim lindner @ 2025-01-25 20:36 I had something like this recently happen the Mame’s Color Computer driver. A game loader was using an undocumented instruction intentionally. Fortunately we have someone in our community to really dig into undocumented 6809 instructions. https://github.com/hoglet67/6809Decoder/wiki/Undocumented-6809-Behaviours Christian Zietz @ 2025-01-26 00:06 Really nice debugging and write-up! I encountered similar weird behavior while debugging differences between a real Atari TT and an emulator. (The Atari TT has a 68030 CPU, too.) What I learned from that: Setting reserved bits in the extension word of the instruction does NOT cause an illegal instruction exception. It is even documented that it won’t. Instead, all sorts of undocumented/undefined behavior can be triggered with “illegal” extension words. Bob Felts @ 2025-01-26 10:26 I miss the 68K, Macsbug, MacNosy, and MPW. Are you sure the CAS isn’t triggering an illegal instruction exception and the handler isn’t doing something screwy with A1? CAS was a wonderful instruction, but atomicity was lost when the address was that of a NuBus peripheral.

Rather than a \"real\" instruction that CPU designers consciously created and which was meant to do something useful but wasn't documented, it could just be that this is an illegal instruction and the logic in the CPU is doing whatever it happens to do when given don't-care inputs. (Maybe this is what the author meant, and I'm just catching up.) Normally the CPU would detect illegal instructions and cause an exception. This would mean there are certain situations where it doesn't. I found a manual at https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/MC68030UM.pdf. On page 8-9 of the manual (which is page 276 in the PDF file), it says: > An illegal instruction is an instruction that contains any bit pattern in its first word that does not correspond to the bit pattern of the first word of a valid MC68030 instruction or is a MOVEC instruction with an undefined register specification field in the first extension word. Note \"in its first word\". According to the write-up, the instruction is 3 words long. The first word is normal, and the weird bits occur in the second word. So quite possibly the 68030 doesn't validate this second word, just plows forward with the logic that implements the CAS instruction, and lets whatever happens happen. (Great write-up and amazing dedication, by the way!) reply rep_lodsb 8 hours agoparentIt looks to me (not being an 68k expert) that only the first word is considered the \"opcode\": the second word just selects what \"D\" registers are used for the CAS operation. Normally one would expect the zero bits to be completely ignored in that case, since they don't have any role in the instruction. But maybe on the 68030 in this case, the bits must be zero even if they have no documented use, because there is hardwired logic for another instruction that is activated by those bits being set, somewhat like the 6502 illegal opcodes? reply userbinator 7 hours agorootparentThis is the closest I could find to what the 68000 opcode map looks like: http://goldencrystal.free.fr/M68kOpcodes-v2.3.pdf It's reminiscent of ARM, but the relevant part is that the CAS instruction's second word bits 5:0 look like a \"modrm\" (to use the x86 terminology) where the officially documented values select only Dn, but the undocumented variant would correspond to (d16,An). At least, that's my theory for why A1 gets modified. reply kazinator 34 minutes agoprevIt's not miraculous. If the flaw had prevented the system from booting (in a way that has a high repro rate) they would have fixed it. The system booted in spite of that undocumented instruction. When things work, you don't go looking for undocumented things that are contributing to the working state. Millions of C programs work accidentally, in spite of undefined behavior. Nothing gets investigated until a compiler change triggers something. reply kstenerud 16 hours agoprevCAS has always been a bitch. I think I've received more bug reports about that instruction's emulation than any other instruction. Incidentally, I remember another old \"bug\" in King of Fighters that \"incorrectly\" checked the carry flag of the SBCD instruction, which it used to decrement the round timer and end the current round. Completely undocumented of course, but if you don't emulate the arithmetic status flags when doing binary coded decimal operations, the round timer in KOF will just keep on going forever, cycling from 00 to 99 :P SNK were really the gods of the 68000 chip. reply mrandish 43 minutes agoparent> SNK were really the gods of the 68000 chip. As a fan of retro arcade machines and the 68k, I'd love to hear more about why SNK were godly in how they maximized the 68K. reply userbinator 13 hours agoprevNearly all CPUs have undocumented instructions, and the 68k is no exception; it's just that the vast majority of people with enough interest and low-level knowledge at the time were focused on the x86/PC instead, which was arguably a far more open and stable architecture than Apple's. The 8088 and 8086 microcode was disassembled and studied extensively a few years ago, and I believe there's been some attempts at simulating it at the transistor level already. Even before that, the structure of the x86 opcode space was also explored in detail by many, with documents like these resulting from such effort: http://ref.x86asm.net/geek.html https://gist.github.com/seanjensengrey/f971c20d05d4d0efc0781... We don’t really know the exact details of what this instruction does. With some limited testing, I believe I’ve observed that the resulting value of A1 depends on the original A1 value, the value of A7, and the program counter. But I’m not sure. Maybe someone can make a program that tries out a bunch of different register values and memory contents, and attempt to deduce what exactly the instruction does so that it can be emulated accurately. Until someone decides that it’s worth trying to figure out, MAME is patching this bug out of the ROM in order to allow the Classic II to boot. IMHO this is definitely worth figuring out for accurate emulation. I'm not familiar with 68k but the bits in the instruction offer a good clue my theory is that bits 5:3 of the 2nd word seem like another mode field, and instead of selecting one of the Dn registers via mode 000, 101 is selecting (d16, An) again and the Dc field, containing 001, is being interpreted as A1. reply fulafel 10 hours agoparentnitpick: 68k of course wasn't Apple's architecture. The '030 was the nicest GP CPU around in its day, used in the Amiga 3000, Atari Falcon, Sun 3, NeXT Cube etc. reply pjmlp 11 hours agoparentprevAt the time Mac Classic was relevant, PC still wasn't thar great in home computing, no one was bothering with this stuff in x86/PC. We were still bothering with demoscene stuff in 8 bit home computers, and those of us busy with 16 bit home systems were focused on Atari and Amiga systems. PC and x86 at home only took off, meany really taking off among demoscene and other home users, was when VGA and sound cards became part of a standard PC. reply userbinator 10 hours agorootparentThe Mac Classic was released in 1990, the Mac Classic II that is the subject of this article was released in 1991. At that time PCs with 286s and 386s were already common, and the 486 was just starting to gain marketshare at the high end. Most of the undocumented 8086 instructions had already been known for almost a decade; and the majority of those who knew were not demosceners. Many developers used Asm exclusively, and the \"classic hacker mindset\" was very much alive among them. reply pjmlp 10 hours agorootparentDepends on where in the globe one were and in my demoscene circles PCs only took off as interesting after Windows 95, folks using MS-DOS or Windows 3.x were mostly due to their parents family computer. reply TazeTSchnitzel 4 hours agorootparentprevI think non-x86/non-PC-compatible home computers did remain relevant for a bit longer in Europe and Japan than in the US but by 1992 the writing must have been on the wall. reply zargon 10 hours agorootparentprevThis is 1992 we're talking about.

Yeah, I have a tendency to go into pretty big deep dives when I find stuff like this. It's so rewarding at the end, even if it does take a lot of time! reply mrandish 20 hours agorootparentFinding a previously unknown undocumented instruction at this late date in a line of processors as prevalent and historically significant as the 68k is surprising. Congrats on your achievement! If someone does dive into fully characterizing the undocumented instruction so it can be properly supported in emulators (as you suggested), please post about it on HN. I suspect, like many undocumented CPU instructions, it was probably to help the original designers test or verify something during development but it would be interesting to know. While obviously a subjective judgement, a lot of people who hand coded assembler on 68k processors regard the ISA as especially elegant, powerful and fun to develop for. In many ways I think of it as peak CISC, thanks to its orthogonal instruction set and wildly flexible addressing modes. And of course the platforms which used it are legendary, from consumer (Mac/Lisa, Amiga, Atari ST, Sinclair QL) to workstations (SUN, Apollo, Quantel) to gaming (Sega Genesis, Neo Geo, Capcom, Atari, Namco, Sega, Taito, Konami) to embedded (automation, print/network controllers, synthesizers, appliances). I'm certainly biased but to this day the 68k (and its 8-bit little brother the 6809) are the only CPUs I still enjoy writing assembler on. reply userbinator 13 hours agorootparentI suspect, like many undocumented CPU instructions, it was probably to help the original designers test or verify something during development but it would be interesting to know. Or simply be an emergent but unintended behaviour of the implementation, as is the case for most of the undocumented 6502, Z80, and x86 instructions I know of. reply dougg3 16 hours agorootparentprevThank you! Yes, I will definitely make another post if and when someone figures out what the instruction does. reply bell-cot 4 hours agorootparentprev> a lot of people who hand coded assembler on 68k processors regard the ISA as especially elegant, powerful and fun to develop for. In many ways I think of it as peak CISC, thanks to its orthogonal instruction set and wildly flexible addressing modes. I definitely agree...but I'd say Motorola really got carried away with those wildly flexible addressing modes. Which lead them into implementation, power draw, and gate-delay hells by the late 1980's and the 68040. The future was ever-rising transistor counts and clock speeds and their 68k architecture just couldn't go there. reply submeta 9 hours agoprevI had an Amiga 2000 with an 68000 processor when I was a kid. How I got excited when I heared about the 68020, or even 68030! And then even RISC architecture. Those were things that got me excited back in those days. I could let my Amiga say a sentence like „Hello, how are you?“, in a robotic tone, and my friends were baffled as if they‘d been to the moon and back. I couldn’t have imagined that less then four decades later I‘d be talking to my computer in natural language using llms.

Definitely doesn't touch A1 at all. I didn't test further, but it's possible it just handles the instruction as a normal CAS. It did cause a system error the first time I stepped through the instruction with MacsBug on my LC 475, but then it was fine after that. reply mras0 19 hours agoparentprevHave an Amiga w/ 060, and that instruction doesn't seem to modify any A registers.

From what I’ve seen, machines with Egret don’t have it enabled by default, but machines with the newer Cuda do. reply 1over137 19 hours agoprevThis seems like it will be impossible in the future with today’s Macs. Apple’s technical documentation is rubbish these days. reply grishka 11 hours agoparentIMO the reason Apple doesn't provide this level of hardware documentation is because modern Macs don't have comparable expansion capabilities. The kind that expose system buses on connectors that users are supposed to plug cards into, and third-party developers to interact directly with hardware to make those cards work. On a modern Mac, you've got USB and Thunderbolt that you can interact with from a userspace program. Though I'm not denying that some of the newer macOS APIs are very poorly documented. As in, you know you've stumbled upon the cool shit when you end up on one of those old pages with a blue gradient in the header that says \"Apple documentation archive\". reply kevingadd 16 hours agoparentprevI think in modern environments the odds of this sort of bug slipping into released firmware/software are much lower. Address spaces are much bigger and the vast majority of addresses aren't mapped so doing a memory operation on a garbage address is going to fail most of the time, and invalid instructions will probably fail too. Reading from a jump table with an index that's too big is a realistic sort of bug to have, so I could see that part making it into modern shipped software. But I would expect the process to fall over when it happens, not keep on trucking like it did here. FWIW, WebAssembly is an environment where bugs of this sort are more possible, since it has a single linear address space where every address is both readable and writable. So if your garbage address is within range you can do an erroneous read, write or CAS and get away with it. But then invalid instructions like in the post will cause the WASM module to fail to load, so it's still not 1:1 comparable with this issue in the mac's ROM. reply 1over137 16 hours agorootparentSorry, the “this” I was referring to was the ability to consult docs, reverse engineer to this extent, etc. reply saagarjha 12 hours agorootparentI think you’re underestimating people who do this. reply TapamN 19 hours agoprevDoes Ken Shirriff have time to look at a 68030? reply kens 13 hours agoparentUnfortunately, not any time soon. reply phibz 2 hours agorootparentThat's great.

    "originSummary": [
      "Doug Brown identified a bug in the Macintosh Classic II's ROM that should have stopped it from booting, but an undefined instruction on the Motorola MC68030 CPU allowed it to proceed. Using the MAME emulator, Doug discovered that the Classic II failed to boot in 32-bit mode due to a bus error from an invalid address, corrected by an undocumented instruction on actual hardware. This finding underscores the role of emulators in uncovering hidden hardware bugs and the intricacies of undocumented CPU instructions, with real hardware tests confirming the undocumented instruction's importance for booting."
