    "originBody": "How I Designed a Dieter Rams inspired iPhone Dock Dieter Rams and his friends (Dietrich Lubs and Ludwig Littman) designed many great looking alarm clocks. I'm looking for one for a long time. Because I have many books about Braun (the company) and Dieter Rams, here are some of their designs: The various vintage desk and alarm clocks by Braun I have been looking for an original DN 40 for a long time. As many of you know, I also visited the annual Braun Collector's Fair to source this alarm clock. It's hard to find one in pristine condition. However, there is another problem. This is what my current bedside table looks like: If I put the DN 40 here, the bedside table will be crowded. For one, I like to have a watch that shows me the time when I sleep or wake up. I use the tray to put my hearing aids, watches, pens etc. Otherwise, they might get damaged or fall off. Third, I have an iPhone MagSafe charger. The problems I have with this setup: They take up a lot of space It's hard to put and take my iPhone It's crowded, especially at night, and knowing where the objects are is hard. So, a few weeks ago, I watched a YouTube video that changed my perspective on iPhone's Standby mode: What a great video. Anyway, I immediately 3D printed this design: Scott Yu-Juan's and Overwerk's Nightstand design, inspired by Braun DN 40 The DN 40 is the Alarm clock Scott and Overwerk were inspired of. However I had a few issues with the inspired design: It's too big and still takes up a lot of space. This is no surprise, of course, because the iPhone's screen is big. It replaces my charger and desk clock, but I still have to use my tray. You need an adhesive for the MagSafe charger. Over the years, Braun went through many turbulent years , but lately their Design department releases great products. They of course released a newer version of these alarm clocks, the BC21: The form of the BC21 is reminiscent of a classic Braun product while its function has been redefined for a modern user. The new design reflects the current modern era better in my opionon. It's slick, slimmer and has a multi-purpose form. It's not only a wireless charging pad for your phone, but also a alarm clock. I had a muse at that moment, and finally came up with an idea to solve some of my issues. I decided to combine all my objects (tray + charger + clock) into a single one. So I started taking notes and created the first, basic prototype: I also had a leather valet tray laying around, and I thought I'll can use that as an insert so when I put my watch, it's protected by the rought 3d texture: After a few hours design + a few hours of printing I had my first initial prototype I nailed the valet part, but the MagSafe part didn't look nice. So I started iterating, and had many versions of the same design, each time with a more refined shape. Here is another one (I abandoned it later): One of my failed design's. The MagSafe's proportion wasn't as nicely to the rest of the body. There were many small details I had to figure, for example the iPhone doesn't use a circle for their corner radiuses: Instead the iPhone has multiple G points and curveatures: From the Accessories Design Guide, on the top you can see that the corner profile of an iPhone has multiple corners. This is also called a G2 Curvature. After fixing it, I played around with a case that would wrap the phone: A prototype with corners that would match the iPhone Silicon Case. Here is a version I came up with, which I used for my future iterations: This design was not only looking better, also was heavily inspired by the BC21 (which was inspired by the DN 40). I printed a version of this and shared it on the internet: Some photos how the tray is being used: And here is how you take out your phone from the dock: Of course, no design is finished. At least there are still things one can improve here. And I wasn't quite yet happy with it. I went back to my CAD app and started working on it. During the iterations, I shared my designs with a few friends and asked them what they thought about them as well (thank you, Adem). After a few tweaks, I came up with a design that was more rounded. I also printed with a more colorful color, as an ode to Braun 550 Hair Dryer and Jaro Gielen's \"Soft Electronics\" book. I further improved the Standby Dock with more rounded corners. The Soft Electronics books shows the various electronic gadgets created in the 60-80s. One of them, the Braun 550 Hair Dryer can be still found in good condition. This particular design stuck with me. Initially I was sceptical about it, but the more I looked at it, the more I loved. Of course because I 3D Printed it with a PLA filamanet, it's not as shiny and glossy compared to actuall electronic devices. People use acetone and various solutions to make it shiny. What I like about this version is how more comfortable is to hold this. It has no sharp edges anywhere Now the the base design was finalized, I made a few more changes. The sharp edges at the front are removed, the tray insert is also less sharp. However the most obvious addition was the cable canal optimization. After putting the Magsafe, the cable would juggle around, and I wouldn't say I liked that. Because of 3D printing, and because the cable has to be inserted after the print, I came up with this solution: I'm still astonished by what you can do with CAD software and a 3D printer at home. Even though I'm a software engineer, it allows me to experiment with other arts and skills in my spare time. I made the 3D model for free under the Standard Digital File License. However, many people like to pay for it, so I created a Gumroad page so people who can afford it can make a small contribution.

Let me know if you have any questions, and I'll be happy to answer them. reply daemoens 2 hours agoparentCould you rescale the model to fit an iPhone 13 Mini? reply farslan 2 hours agorootparentRescaling usually doesn't work well because the MagSafe portion is static between all sizes. Hence, every custom sizing needs a custom re-design. reply schiffern 2 hours agorootparentIn theory, with parametric design (eg OpenSCAD, Autodesk Inventor, etc) a model could allow you to enter the phone dimensions and it automatically re-calculates the correct geometry. In practice, experience says doing this (in a robust way) is a lot harder than it sounds. ;) Thanks, very nice design and write-up. reply bredren 2 hours agoparentprevYour entry doesn’t discuss the finishing step between printing and use. My experience has been that a great deal of sanding and other tool use can be needed to get to smooth results. Did you go through a finishing process after printing to get to the smooth results you show here? reply farslan 2 hours agorootparentThere are none? All the photos are straight from my Bambulab X1C. I used eSun PLA+. No special treatment was done. reply bredren 1 hour agorootparentThat’s awesome. reply MattGrommes 29 minutes agorootparentI've also been shocked at how little post-processing prints off a Bambu printer need. They're pretty amazing machines, right out of the box. reply bdcravens 1 hour agorootparentprevTo build atop of OP's response, the Bambu Lab line of printers are much higher quality than some older printers. I have 3 different ones, and I also just pull them off the build plate and begin using them. Many modern printers also give similar results, but may require a bit of tuning. Also it's as much about the settings in your slicer software, and most current ones have evolved to have great defaults and are easily tweaked. reply Darthy 3 hours agoparentprevIt looks beautiful, thanks for the write-up! Question: Most docks have ample space around the phone to grip it and remove it from the dock easily. Your design encases the phone on every side. How do you get the phone out in the morning? reply farslan 3 hours agorootparentThank you. Check this tweet out: https://x.com/fatih/status/1836691756965933084 There are two holes on both sides (for both left- and right-handed people). All you do is push slightly, and it comes out. You're the third person asking this, so I'll add a section about it to the blog post. Thank you again. reply bruckie 2 hours agoparentprevWhat orientation did you print it at, and did you use supports? reply farslan 1 hour agorootparentYeap, so I added the instructions on Gumroad's page (where you download the 3D file). I printed it where the bottom is touching the plate. And support is minimal supporting the tilted part of the model. reply frantathefranta 2 hours agoparentprevI might upgrade soon anyway but is there something preventing iPhone 13 Pro to not fit? I'm not aware of any changes between that one and 14, 15 and 16. reply farslan 2 hours agorootparentActually probably not. Does it have the same size as the 14 Pro ? If it's the same you can use it with no issues. All the orange photos you see are from an 14 Pro, so it should work nicely. reply akie 3 hours agoparentprevI mean I just want to buy it. Give me a link and I pay you money. reply zymhan 55 minutes agorootparentThat's kind of the opposite of the Hacker ethos reply akie 16 minutes agorootparentI don't have a 3D printer and I unfortunately don't have the time. reply dymk 39 minutes agorootparentprevGetting the job done is the hacker ethos. Sometimes that means buying a solution instead of spending a bunch of time (and money) building it. reply samatman 37 minutes agorootparentprevNah. Building your own, idk, mechanical keyboard? Hackerish thing to do, sure. But buying someone else's cool design is not against \"the ethos\", that's a silly thing to say. Supporting artisans in their craft is Good, actually, I don't see anything about this design which make it different that way. reply azinman2 3 hours agorootparentprevSimilar. Would be nice for a max version as well. What about cases on your phone? I assume you need to remove it first? reply kurthr 2 hours agorootparentIt looked like his design incorporated space for a standard case. Actually, without a case I think there might be an interesting edge detail. That wouldn't affect functionality, and look cool too! reply danielktdoranie 1 hour agorootparentPersonally, I don’t use a case on my iPhone 14. I pay Apple every month for Apple Care +. If I break it Apple fixes or replaces it for free reply rootusrootus 37 minutes agorootparentI use a case for grip, not for the protection it provides. I'd be dropping this slippery device pretty often otherwise. I haven't been able to go case-less since the days of the iPhone 4. > Apple fixes or replaces it for free Where? In the US they charge $29 and up for repair with AppleCare+. $29 for the screen, $29 more if you damage the glass on the back too. $99 if you damage the camera or anything else that requires replacing the phone altogether. reply farslan 3 hours agorootparentprevThanks a lot for your support. A friend and I looked into the economics, but the lowest company willing to print was around $63. If you know of any services that provide 3D printing, I am happy to look into it. reply boustrophedon 2 hours agorootparentI haven't downloaded your model but https://www.i-solids.com/ (US-based, FDM and MJF) and https://www.weerg.com/ (Italy, mostly MJF ) will both do instant quotes and you might get reasonable prices from them at scale. PCBWay and JLCPCB in China will also do 3d printing at reasonable volume, if you want to get an idea of a baseline price. reply farslan 1 hour agorootparentThank you, I'll look into it. reply HorizonXP 3 hours agorootparentprevWhat about these guys? https://www.slant3d.com reply farslan 2 hours agorootparentI believe they want a minimum order of $1000 and only allow me to print it in a single color. Honestly, providing a physical good is a whole other set of issues with which I have no experience at all. reply gadders 2 hours agorootparentJust wait 3 months and you'll see someone selling it on Ali Express :-) reply rupi 1 hour agorootparentprevCame here to say this. Will happily pay for it. reply neves 38 minutes agoparentprevCan you charge it while in dock? reply rcarmo 36 minutes agorootparentDid you notice it has a MagSafe charger? Like... It's the whole point, the iPhone won't go into StandBy mode without charging. reply sizzzzlerz 9 minutes agoprevNice work. What is the clock app that you show in the pics? The one with the pink and orange characters? reply phrz 7 minutes agoparentThis is actually the iPhone nightstand mode which activates when the phone is on magsafe and in landscape. reply pikseladam 2 hours agoprevI follow your journey with admiration, Fatih, and I want to say that you are truly an inspiration. Congratulations on building something exactly the way you envisioned it—a remarkable achievement that is often overlooked but incredibly difficult to accomplish. Eline sağlık :) reply farslan 2 hours agoparentThank you for your kind words. reply rcarmo 1 hour agoprevNice. I saw Scott's original design and thought it was very classic but wasteful of filament, and this one feels like a good replacement for my current MagSafe stand (which is also 3D printed). I would like to see a parametric version for older iPhones, though (I have a 15 Pro, but there are others in the house...) reply jstanley 45 minutes agoparentWorrying about being wasteful of filament is a mistake. That's how you end up making parts that feel cheap and flimsy. Noone praises cheaply-made products for being economical with materials, we call them cheap and nasty, it's the same with 3d prints. reply rcarmo 38 minutes agorootparentIt has a very sizeable volume of _nothing_ behind the phone (besides the slot for a watch charger), and is bulky. That's my definition of wasteful. reply djmips 1 hour agoparentprevA parametric version could include Android. reply rcarmo 59 minutes agorootparentI just had a brief stab at this using OpenSCAD. The bottom curves are tricky (and of course OpenSCAD's lack of bevels and fillets is a pain), but it seems doable--given time. reply delichon 4 hours agoprev> This particular design stuck with me. Initially I was spectical about it, but the more I looked at it, the more I loved. Spectical sounds like an improvement over skeptical since it implies that you keep looking and don't just dismiss. If this was a typo we should consider it a coinage and run with it. reply xnx 4 hours agoparentAlternately: Spectical - Specification skepticism. Doubts based on technical specifications that may later be assuaged by real world performance. \"I was spectical of the Nintendo Switch because it had nine year old CPU, but it still delivered games that were more fun than the Xbox X or PS5.\" reply latexr 3 hours agorootparentI understood your parent comment as thinking of it in terms of “spectacles” (i.e. glasses) rather than “specification”. Emphasis mine: > it implies that you keep looking As in “On first glance I was spectical the chair could hold enough weight, but the more I looked the more I noticed little details that improved its strength”. reply matanyall 4 hours agorootparentprevLol, I love it reply garyrob 3 hours agoparentprev\"Spectical sounds like an improvement over skeptical since it implies that you keep looking and don't just dismiss. If this was a typo we should consider a coinage and run with it.\" I love it! I seriously may use it. reply farslan 3 hours agoparentprevHaha, it was a typo. I fixed it now :) reply delichon 2 hours agorootparentThere were two great mashups in this article. Now sadly just one. reply duxup 4 hours agoprevVery cool. >I'm still astonished by what you can do with CAD software and a 3D printer at home. I really want to get into 3D printing, for neat hacks like this, but also because I've been fiddling with arduino and similar and find it difficult to really find good parts to mount them on, attach servos too and so on. Would be nice to just be able to print something that I know will fit even just for prototyping. Anyone have a good suggestion for a 3D printer that is good quality, will last a while, and beginner friendly? reply jhbruhn 4 hours agoparentThe BambuLab A1 mini is the obvious choice here. Incredible value for the money and IMO quite beginner friendly. The alternative choice would be the Prusa Mini, although the BambuLab has higher quality and more features than the Prusa. reply Tepix 4 hours agorootparentI heard that Bambu Labs is violating open source licenses, thus stealing from Prusa in particular. reply opencl 3 hours agorootparentI've heard people claim this but never seen any actual evidence of license violations. Everything seems perfectly in order with both the Linux-based firmware on the X1C[0] and their slicer[1] which is a fork of Prusaslicer. [0] https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/knowledge-sharing/open-source-s... [1] https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio reply iancmceachern 3 hours agorootparentprevNot really. They forked a slicer, which wasn't against the license but not terribly nice either. The big thing now is the patent lawsuit with Stratasys None of these things matter for the average user. For the average user the Bambu products are the ones to buy. Easy button for 3d printing. reply kapep 4 hours agorootparentprevFor functional prints I would go with the Bambu Lab A1 instead of the A1 mini because of the larger build plate. reply farslan 4 hours agorootparentprevI agree. I have the X1C, however the A1 is as good as the X1C (unless you go into more advanced stuff like ABS/ASA or want to print large objects) reply pbronez 1 hour agorootparentprevI bought the Prusa Mini+ kit. It was educational, but a few months later I upgraded to a Bambu Lab X1C. It’s a much more expensive machine, but the print quality and consistency are worth it. With the Mini, I was hesitant to try things because I was afraid the prints would fail and I’d spend forever calibrating things. With the X1C, I can crank out prototype iterations as fast as I can design them. reply mauvehaus 4 hours agoparentprevIf you aren't sure you're going to pursue this for the long run, think about joining a makerspace/hackerspace first and trying out theirs. On the downside, many people with varying degrees of skill have used the machine and it may not be factory fresh in performance. On the upside, given a vibrant makerspace, there's somebody there who's responsible for upkeep and can help you over some of the bumps in the road. reply __jonas 3 hours agoparentprevBambu is surely the best option if you have the money to spend, but I wanted a budget option, so I got a used Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro for 150€ and I'm extremely happy with it. I'm shocked by how well the prints come out and how little fiddling it requires. I've set it up with Klipper now with an old mini PC I had around and a Playstation 3 Eye camera, feels nice to put old hardware to use and controlling / monitoring prints remotely is neat. reply bdcravens 1 hour agoparentprev+1 to all of the recommendations for anything by Bambu Lab. It's as close to plug and play as you'll get. (Personally I feel the P1S with the AMS combo is the best value to price, but you really can't go wrong with any of them) reply post-it 4 hours agoparentprevI've had a very good experience with the Sovol SV06. It was around CA$300 when I bought it a year ago. I'm considering getting a second one. reply timc3 4 hours agoparentprevBambu labs. Pick your price point. I got one a couple of months ago and it’s been great and so far has worked without hassle. reply kapep 4 hours agorootparentI just got a Bambu Lab A1 (Combo with AMS lite, which I can also recommend) and am really impressed how smooth and well designed everything is. They really put a lot thought even into how the product is packaged and assembled. The few parts that you need to assembly yourself are all color coded (but after installing the color coding is hidden). With my good old Ender 3, almost every print required tinkering with settings, otherwise print quality was bad or prints straight up failed. It was great for learning about 3d printing but with the A1 I can just print everything in much better quality without worrying about any settings. reply swah 3 hours agorootparentprevI only noticed recently that people are now printing in multiple colors (materials?) in one go - is that a new thing? Maybe something this manufacturer integrated? reply dole 1 hour agorootparentBambu Labs has the AMS, Automatic Material System that sits on top of the printers and makes multicolor printing pretty easy, holds 4 colors but you can link units together for up to 16. There's other companies that provide other multi-color solutions for other printers but Bambu's P1 and X1 series with the AMS really took off in the last 2 years. reply organsnyder 4 hours agoparentprevI started with a Prusa Mini. It's a reliable workhorse. Bambu Lab is extremely popular right now, and looks to be very easy to use. reply mbreese 3 hours agoparentprevI have a cheap Ender 3. I’ve had it for about 5 years and it’s been just fine. I did do a few upgrades along the way that helped a lot (bed leveling probe l, direct drive extruder, and second z axis screw drive). Figuring out how to add those was part of the fun. If you wanted something more production/out of the box ready, you can certainly find it. But it doesn’t have to be a big initial investment. You can start small and then upgrade as you go. reply edm0nd 4 hours agoparentprevIf price is no option, Bambu labs is the way to go. If you are tryna get a 3d printer on a budget, any of the Creality Enders, like the Ender 3 or the CR-6 MAX are good starting points within the ~$200 range. reply jhbruhn 4 hours agorootparentSince the BambuLab A1 series was released, I consider this highly outdated information. reply edm0nd 4 hours agorootparentLooks like the A1 is $489.00-$559.00. A $170-$200 3d Creality printer still fits into a different category and pricepoint imo for beginners on a budget. reply Jaepa 4 hours agorootparentThe A1 is presently $339.00. The price you cited is for the combo including the AMS, which allows for multi-filament printing. source: https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/a1?variant=4158335519... reply kapep 4 hours agorootparentprevYou can get a Bambu Lab A1 mini for 205 EUR. Cheapest Bambu Lab A1 I see is 345 EUR. reply Tepix 4 hours agorootparentprevBut there's also the A1 mini. A volume of 180x180x180mm³ is not bad. reply voidUpdate 4 hours agoparentprevI got myself a Ender 3 V3 SE for christmas, and it has served me very well once I got used to it, especially once I hooked it up to a pi running octoprint. However, I've heard that the Bambu printers are generally the most \"plug and play\" you can get reply criddell 3 hours agorootparentI have an Ender printer as well and probably wouldn't recommend it. IMHO, the Bambu printers are a much better value. The exception might be if 3d printing itself is your hobby and you enjoy tinkering endlessly, upgrading parts, tramming, setting esteps, etc... reply edm0nd 6 minutes agorootparentAuto leveling printers alone are a godsend. Having to manually level my Ender 3 got to be a true pain but it sure did teach me a lot as a beginner! reply Brian_K_White 3 hours agoparentprevI used to joke that my favorite tv show was just spinning a model around and around that I was working on in freecad or kicad or openscad. It's honestly still my favorite tv show. reply romanhn 2 hours agoparentprevAnother +1 for Bambu. Recently replaced an older Ender 3 with P1S and it's been a breath of fresh air. Ender was much cheaper but the many, many hours I spent on tweaking both the software and hardware... I was many times ready to give up on the whole thing. reply delichon 2 hours agorootparentSame. I struggled and struggled to print things on a two year old Qidi that just worked on a Bambu Labs X1. The Bambu has limits but they are in a very different place. The pace of development in this area is wild. Patent law may be slamming on the brakes though. reply dv35z 2 hours agoparentprevI suggest do a search for \"makerspace\" in your area - They can help you build the project & you can learn how to do it, and you might meet some great friends in the process. reply mft_ 3 hours agoparentprevIf you want something that just prints, and want to spend absolutely no time fettling or upgrading the printer, then either Prusa (which I can speak to) or Bambu. Bambu has leapt ahead of Prusa in terms of features, though. They’re more expensive than some competition, but you’re paying for the simplicity. reply para_parolu 4 hours agoparentprevI just get bambulab p1s a few weeks ago. My goal was to find “iphone of 3d printers”. It is still not there but it’s as close to “press a button to print” as possible. So far I’m pretty happy with the device and software. reply dwayne_dibley 4 hours agoparentprevBambu Labs A1 - not had it long, but for less that £300 it's unbelievable, easily matching quality with the prusas on the type of stuff I'm printing. reply Tepix 4 hours agorootparentThe Bambu Labs A1 Mini is less than £300, the A1 is more expensive. reply Jaepa 4 hours agorootparentA1 is presently £289.00 GBP reply asadm 3 hours agoparentprevA1 mini, it's sitting on my desk right now (is very small) and I love it! reply nsxwolf 4 hours agoparentprevI love my Creality Ender 3, I was intimidated by the assembly process but it went fine and I can’t believe how good it is.

If you print with tree support, you should be OK. reply can16358p 3 hours agoprevI can't explain exactly why but this looks beautiful! reply farslan 2 hours agoparentThank you! reply AdmiralAsshat 3 hours agoprevThe article mostly made me just want to buy a BC21 (https://us.braun-clocks.com/products/bc21-braun-digital-wire...). But I can see the advantages in making the phone still be the alarm clock, or else you'd run into problems w/ having an alarm on both the phone and on the clock. Plus it would be nice for the display to change if e.g. someone is calling me in the middle of the night. I can see why the design is the way it is, since presumably none of that would be possible if the dock is just a wireless charging cradle. It reminds me of the cool ways the wireless charging dock for the HP Touchpad let you turn the tablet into an ambient clock or a digital photo frame, all the way back in 2011. reply dewey 1 hour agoparentI also checked that first, unfortunately according to the Amazon reviews (Can't always be trusted) it seems to have some issues with positioning for charging where you have to place it pretty accurately to work. reply jbverschoor 2 hours agoparentprevOut of stock :-( reply costcopizza 4 hours agoprevVery nice!

One for the camera, and one (likely) to push the phone out. reply farslan 4 hours agorootparentActually, both are used for pushing out. I made it so both left and right-handed people can use it. The cameras are already taken into consideration, and you can use them on both horizontal sides. reply ChrisMarshallNY 4 hours agoprevThat looks very cool! Thanks for sharing it.

It adds a lot of work! It's surprisingly tough to sand. And sanding makes it look bad, so you end up having to use filler primer and/or bondo, then more sanding, and more painting. Here's an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTE9bJyUO_8 reply martin_a 3 hours agoparentprevYes, you can. If you want to do that, I'd recommend to print in ABS though. It's easier to sand and you can use vapor smoothing afterwards to get a very smooth and shiny surface. Printing ABS is more challenging though and the fumes tend to smell. reply iancmceachern 3 hours agoparentprevYou can also do something caled \"vapor smoothing\". You can also use \"adaptive layer height\" in the slicer settings to greatly reduce it. reply andrewmcwatters 4 hours agoprevI remember when Apple sold standing docks with their iPods.

I've been tempted to buy a 3D printer for various little things like this but have yet to make the leap. For those who haven't tried using standby mode as a bedside clock, I recommend it. Started using it maybe a year or so ago after buying a prebuilt magsafe stand, and the OLED panels that have been in most iPhones for several years now are very well suited to the use case — the panels can get quite dim (latest models go down to 1 nit!), there's few pixels lit up in the first place, and what light does get emitted is a sleep-friendly red. It's like the old red 7-segment display alarm clocks but even better since it's not as bright and turns off when no motion is detected. reply internet101010 3 hours agoparentIt has definitely become an invaluable tool for taking care of things around the house for me. Things like broken light switch sliders, under desk mounts, things related to cable management, and any sort of custom bracket. Going back in time though, I should have paid up for something with auto-leveling from the start. That is the most important feature. After using the $100 Ender V3 Pro for several years I'm probably going to make the jump to something from Bambu soon. reply rootusrootus 2 hours agorootparentI heartily recommend the Bambu printers. I started with a Creality CR10, then an Anycubic Photon, then added an Ender 3 Pro. About a year ago I picked up a Bambu P1S and I was blown away. It's way more than just a step up from an Ender. Auto leveling, way, way faster, etc. I also ended up adding the AMS, which is super handy. Over time my conclusion with 3D printers is that the capital cost of the printer is (within reason) largely irrelevant. Unless you're on an extremely tight budget and are going to print in just one color, the cost of filament pretty quickly dominates. Especially with the inexpensive printers. $20-30 a pop adds up in a hurry. reply madeofpalk 2 hours agoparentprevI've been 3d printer-curious for a while now, and I think this might just be the thing that pushes me over the edge. reply brainzap 2 hours agoparentprevno need to buy, visit the local hacker group reply martin_a 3 hours agoprevAny recommendations on good books on Dieter Rams, Braun and the philosophy behind all of that itself?

Student is obvious. Being Swiss might not be but is one. People not living in an english speaking country have a different appreciation of swearing in english as they are exposed to it differently: appart from our english classes at school we learn and hear english mostly in songs, movies, TV shows, even modern literature. We are pretty much inundates by the f-word which makes it more an innocent word than in britain and us english. A few days ago I was doing some cleaning in the house. Usually I rather put music but this time I chose a tv shows instead. Bad idea, it makes you much slower. Bottom line is I chose action-drama Banshee randomly. It seems they literally say fuck or motherfucking every 30 seconds! So my advice would be: before complaining of people living abroad and using the f-word, maybe you guys should clean your house and stop putting the f-word in every fucking piece of media you sell all over the motherfucking world. Also swearing can be cultural. For example wear I live in Spain swearing is part of the normal language.

(peabee.substack.com)434 points by captn3m0 13 hours agohidepastfavorite291 comments qnleigh 11 hours ago> I would have thought about privately disclosing these findings to Dotpe. But all the API requests are right there in plain sight... There are pretty common ethical standards about disclosing vulnerabilities privately before disclosing them publicly. I don't see how the obviousness of the vulnerability changes the situation. By warning the company, you give them the opportunity to remedy the problem before announcing to the world that anyone with a laptop can exploit it. Probably they were just hoping that nobody would notice, which is stupid of course, but now they don't have the chance to build up a better wall before the flood of fake orders that could cause real harm to the small businesses whose financial information you disclosed online. Perhaps I'm being too optimistic about how the company would respond, but I still think it's hard to justify not doing a private disclosure. reply mainframed 10 hours agoparentAdding to this, in some countries he is already past the gray-area to what constitutes as computer fraud. Pissing off the company, whose systems you accessed without authorization, is one way of getting to experience the full force of the justice system. reply moralestapia 9 hours agorootparentCurious. How is this, specifically, fraud? reply nkrisc 7 hours agorootparentThe gist of some various laws around the world is that simply obtaining credentials does not authorize you to access the system, and accessing it without authorization is the illegal part. reply drdec 7 hours agorootparentThis principle is clear if you apply a real world analogy. Just because you happen to have keys to a building doesn't mean you can enter without authorization from the owner. (E.g. you may have kept copies after a lease expires or a sale, it maybe you found them, etc.) reply whamlastxmas 6 hours agorootparentConsidering it’s a API available without any authorization, the better comparison would be walking around on unfenced private land. There’s nothing to indicate they don’t want people on it but it’s also obvious it’s private land. reply hunter2_ 5 hours agorootparentWalking around isn't usually a big deal until told to leave (verbally or by way of conspicuously posted signs), since that is a prerequisite to trespassing. Otherwise, delivery people would operate in a gray area which would be very problematic for them, since not all deliveries are requested by the recipient/owner. However, although you are free to walk around in search of the front door, you can't start eating the fruit off the trees. Perhaps that's the better analogy: the trees are happy to serve up a delicious treat for anyone requesting something of it, but that doesn't mean the tree sets the rules. Just because fences preventing this are popular doesn't make them compulsory. reply ryathal 4 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn't matter. It's still just as illegal to get into an unlocked car or one with wide open doors without permission. The same premise applies to computers in a lot of places, access controls don't matter. If you access something on a computer not indented to be accessible, it's considered a crime. reply moralestapia 6 hours agorootparentprevI get the unauthorized access argument. But how does it become fraud? reply esrauch 6 hours agorootparentDefeating access control by using credentials that aren't yours is fraud. Like, if you found a company badge laying around, go to that office and flash the badge to the security guard and go in. You've committed fraud by tricking the guard into thinking you're authorized to enter when you weren't. reply moralestapia 5 hours agorootparentI see, thanks. No credentials involved here, though. reply nkrisc 15 minutes agorootparentThe question a judge (or jury) would answer is: would a reasonable person think they had permission to access it? API documented on the website under a section called “For Developers”? Probably, yes. API reverse engineered by intercepting requests? Probably not. Note that the blog was taken down before I could read it myself. hunter2_ 5 hours agorootparentprevTFA mentioned sending requests with a table number that the sender was not at. That is hardly any different from the idea of showing a badge that wasn't issued to you. The ease of spoofing doesn't matter at all, in the eyes of such laws. The same could be said about typing any URL that wasn't knowingly supplied to you by the owner, but a \"reasonableness test\" in court would sort those out from nefarious activity. reply tetha 5 hours agorootparentprevInterestingly enough, the very lawsuit-happy nature of a major german party has \"backfired\" quite a bit recently. A security researcher was found not guilty of circumventing security measures or accessing authorized computer systems or resources without authorization, because there were no security measures or authorization on the API to circumvent. Though note that this would not help one if one started to use or abuse the API to get free food or cause financial damage to a restaurant through fake orders. For example, ordering the corn soup through the API could really backfire if someone wants to present it as good old fraud or theft, or if the recipient of the unexpected soup got into trouble and started to look for someone to hand the damages to. reply ceejayoz 7 hours agorootparentprevBy the sensible definition, it isn’t.

The only civil copyright proceedings were JSTOR settling with him out of court. reply rvnx 9 hours agorootparentprevHe is in India: If any person without permission of the owner or any other person who is incharge of a computer, computer system or computer network - (a) accesses or secures access to such computer, computer system or computer network or computer resource; - (b) downloads, copies or extracts any data, computer data base or information from such computer, computer system or computer network including information or data held or stored in any removable storage medium; [...] - (e) disrupts or causes disruption of any computer, computer system or computer network; [...] - (g) provides any assistance to any person to facilitate access to a computer, computer system or computer network in contravention of the provisions of this Act, rules or regulations made thereunder; If any person, dishonestly or fraudulently, does any act referred, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees or with both. ==== Though, I prefer a lot the poster of the blog post than the company... reply mainframed 9 hours agorootparentprevI don't know Indian laws. But this wikipedia page [1] gives a list of types of computer fraud in the US under the CFAA: Types of computer fraud include: * [...] * Accessing unauthorized computers * [...] He accessed their computers to access purchase information of other people (e.g. his friend) and business data. I guess making it public, thereby damaging the companies reputation and potentially getting sued by their lawyers is one way to find out, whether he was \"unauthorized\" to do so. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_fraud reply cornel_io 9 hours agorootparentprevPeople have been convicted of hacking for merely editing URL strings, under the theory that were knowingly accessing systems in ways that they were not supposed to. This would be similar. Whether or not that seems reasonable to us is a different matter, but basically it boils down to the fact that \"they left the door unlocked\" doesn't make it legal to walk in. reply ensignavenger 4 hours agorootparentI believe the conviction of which you are thinking was overturned on appeal, though. reply ryukoposting 5 hours agoparentprevWell, the link leads to a 404 so it seems like the author has been convinced. reply ffsm8 9 hours agoparentprev> 37,529 restaurants use Dotpe for QR codes.

It's too small for them to care about the liability of security and too large to move quickly reply loktarogar 7 hours agorootparent> At that scale, it would take years to get fixed without forcing it like this. But it also might not take years. The point of responsible disclosure is to give them the opportunity. If they don't take it, fine - that's now on them. Instead this guy is committing fraud with actual financial damages (wasted food) and then sharing how others can commit the same fraud on a massive scale, potentially causing more damage. This is now on him and Dotpe, not Dotpe alone. reply hunter2_ 4 hours agorootparent> fine - that's now on them Is that legally true? The legal risk of having published this without responsible disclosure vanishes if the conventional period of opportunity is ignored? That smells fishy. reply chippiewill 7 hours agorootparentprevMaybe, maybe not. But in responsible disclosure you usually give a 90 day notice period before publicly disclosing and \"forcing\" them. reply tomalaci 10 hours agoparentprevIn this case? Nope. This must be treated as willful design decision to open up API to entire public (including PII/phone-number leak as per design), even if they say they totally didn't meant that to happen. Government itself should then be notified to go after these guys for failing to do the most basic access controls. I mean, come on! To treat this as a proper security vulnerability just gives too much leeway for these fast-and-loose businesses/systems. It will just encourage more such crap to proliferate. I am with the author on this one, I am fairly certain the issue of this was raised internally already, probably multiple times. Fortunately for the business, their management did the right decision - focus on quick and easy features, security is a non-issue, we will just blame the hackers and have legal channels deal with them. I mean, you even have people here berating someone uncovering gross negligence for Google-backed company. Why would businesses bother with basic security when they can play the victim so damn easy? reply mpeg 9 hours agorootparentAuthor is in India, I would be very careful because it's much more likely the government will prosecute them for unauthorised access and irresponsible disclosure than do anything to the company. Truth is even in the west this kind of irresponsible disclosure could land you in jail, much more so in a developing country where these laws are all relatively new. reply krsdcbl 9 hours agorootparentprevFully agree with you! The API being unauthd is clearly a core design choice, and finding out any customer or service data is openly accessible with consecutive numbers through that API is not a zero day or something. There is no \"responsible disclosure\" to be made here, going to the company and explaining what's the issue with all of this amounts to \"handing out free consulting\" if anything reply mpeg 9 hours agorootparentUnfortunately that is not how the law works, at least in most countries. As soon as you enumerate ids regardless of whether there is any security in place it is unauthorised access and it's illegal. reply komali2 9 hours agorootparentRight, I believe they're posting as if the ethical standpoint is normalized, to further highlight the absurdity and injustice of the current legal framework. reply tsimionescu 6 hours agorootparentWhy is it unjust to prosecute people who harm a business and unsuspecting customers of that business by disclosing 0-day vulnerabilities publicly without giving them even a chance to patch? The poster here has no proof that the vulnerability was already being exploited. For all we know, as obvious as this was, no one else had yet thought to look. This is like going around people's house doors, testing to see if they are unlocked, and if they are, posting a big sign saying \"unlocked door\" on each one. It's obviously an anti-social act masquerading as benevolent, and it should be punished. Of course, the company running such highly vulnerable code should also be punished, but that doesn't absolve anyone. reply pnt12 7 hours agorootparentprevSeems outlandish. Citation needed? I'm aware of a couple of cases in the US, but not all over the world. Secondly: can consumers be blamed for gross negligence? It's not reasonable for a bank to post account balances in public billboard and ask people not to look at others. We should contest when private data is available publically, hidden only by small obfuscations, not professional security practices. reply mpeg 6 hours agorootparentSo for example in the UK with the computer misuse act, intent matters. If you intentionally change an id because you expect you will be able to access other data it becomes a crime. Your example is flawed because in this case the private data was not made available publicly at all – you need to intentionally exploit a software flaw to access it. Of course, it also matters how you handle it. If you do enough to just discover the flaw, try to adhere to the bug bounty program scope (if any), use your own accounts in testing and responsibly disclose any findings as soon as you have a poc then you'll probably be ok. In this case the author went way beyond just finding the flaws, and then disclosed it publicly in a completely irresponsible way without even trying to contact the company or any of the clients affected by it (some of which will certainly have a security contact that can liaise with the vendor) reply pnt12 3 hours agorootparentI concede that intent matters. Maybe a better analogy is a bank with open lockers and no vigilance: if someone enters and steals money, the police will look for them, because \"the coffers were open\" is not a valid defense. But customers will also demand answers from the bank - why were they so negligent and incompetent that someone can just enter and get their money? We should hold similar values for digital systems. Was the author's intent on stealing private data and causing harm? Did he gain from this abuse? Did the company take enough measures to safeguard their data? Companies have been mostly not held responsible for their fuck ups, and no matter the law, that's wrong to me. reply tsimionescu 6 hours agorootparentprevThere are exactly two activities you can be participating in if you are exploring someone else's undocumented API: (1) free consulting, or (2) illegal hacking. Disclosing vulnerabilities you found in someone else's product, regardless of how obvious, is free consulting. If you're not responsibly disclosing them, then you were illegally hacking their systems. reply thinkingemote 9 hours agorootparentprevJust because someone or something is unethical doesn't mean we should be unethical as a response. We shouldn't limit ourselves to only be responsible and disclose properly when the vulnerability suits us. That is both unfair and irrational. reply rapnie 12 hours agoprev> Is this what the peak ordering experience looks like?

There is an icecream place opened nearby I had no chance trying because they only have touchscreen order. Guys at the till only serve icecream and all orders must go through the touch screen.

I believe you hold paper menu without the need of smearing the matter on your skin all over it you know (or just leave alone on the table if it is one page), unlike touch screens where it is a must ... Also the fast food places stear people towards glass surfaces smearing the cover of their skin all over normally had no menus, just look up and say what you want.

If a restaurant has a QR-code menu, I ask for a physical one. If they don't have a physical one, I walk out. I've done that many, many, many times. reply glandium 10 hours agoparentprevIn Japan, many chains are using tablets for their menu, and you can order through that. That's much better than having to pull whatever from a QR code. reply atoav 10 hours agorootparentThis might be the best of both worlds. The advantages of digital ordering for both customers and restaurants are: - staff can keep the menu up to date, basically realtime (they have to do it tho) - orders can directly land in the kitchen instead of through the waiting staff, which may or may not be coming - payment can also be done thst way Of course there are more advantages for the restaurants that may or may not go counter to the interests (or rights!) of their customers. E.g. the ability to easily build profiles and sell that data to the highest bidder. There are downsides too: - digital menus can fail more easily than paper menus - congrats you are a waiter, and now IT-support as well - customers without phones, no/sucky internet or devices that fail to display the menu are out of luck, so you have to provide offline alternatives/own devices that need their own maintenance - options that are not in the menu and fields that are not offered cannot be filled, e.g. can be a problem if you are allergic rtc. - unpersonal. Most people prefer not having to jump through hoops. Using a tablet that is provided by the restaurant can aleviate many (but not all) of these issues. reply xandrius 10 hours agorootparentprevYep but many many more have handwritten menus in kanji on the walls, I can read many kanjis by now and I'm still pretty swamped by trying to interpret every shop's different handwriting.

For customer, it's all the benefit of a digital menu with none of the downsides. Of course, all the downsides are the very reason restaurants are switching to digital menus in the first place, which is something people need to be reminded of.

But one thing I can say for this tech is it fixed it and the difference is noticeable. reply digitalengineer 11 hours agorootparentinefficiency? It's part of the experience. I'm not in a restaurant or café to drink as fast as possible. I'm there to socialize as well. Waiting a bit is not a bottleneck, but a feature. (If I wanted speed, I'd take the drive-through). reply austinjp 10 hours agorootparentThere are plenty of comments disagreeing with you, but I'm fully in agreement. As for the arguments that QR codes are somehow a time-saver, they can be a real time waster. Find phone (not glued to my eyeballs), scan QR, swerve option to install app, wait for enormously bloated website to render badly, get frustrated trying to find what I want, get up to find a staff member to order something but with X instead of Y please if that's possible, can I pay with cash, etc etc etc. Clearly, everyone's needs and experiences are different. If you like QR codes in cafes, fine, but we should recognise that they represent something other than supposed 'convenience'. They are there to gather data, and to allow cafes to hire fewer staff. They represent the creeping invasion of privacy in every possible aspect of life. The fact that cafes may want to hire fewer staff masks the issue that an increasing number need to in order to survive. Small business margins are squeezed by unreasonable costs and shrinking profit margins, and these pressures are instinctively passed down to the customer -- you and me. Rather than mindlessly capitulate to this and encourage the one-way downward spiral, I really would hope for communities such as HN to see opportunities to 'disrupt upwards'. How can businesses resist exorbitant rents? Why are our lives so hectic that talking to a waiter is seen as too slow? Why do we give away data without being an eyelid? reply hot_gril 10 hours agorootparentI don't understand the privacy part. If you order through a waiter, they still record what you ordered. reply Phemist 10 hours agorootparentThese menu websites obviously track the living hell out of you and now they can tie restaurant food preferences to everything else they have already gathered. A waiter recording your order is at a completely different, much smaller scale. Additionally, the waiter is an anonymizing wall between the system that records my order and me and will only correlate orders across multiple visits to the same restaurant. Not potentially across single visits to multiple, geographically highly separated, restaurants. reply hot_gril 10 hours agorootparentThe waiter inputs your order to their point-of-sale system, which can do similar things as an online menu. If you pay with credit card, it's tied to your identity and will be used for targeting ads. reply soco 10 hours agorootparentprevA waiter is not tracking your whole browsing data together with their 36763 partners (click here for the full list). reply austinjp 8 hours agorootparentprevThey may record what I order (although the cafes and restaurants I go to use pen and paper or just plain-old human memory) but that's it. Even if they enter my order into some system for analytics or what have you, there's no cookies, no tracking, no transparent pixels, etc. Look, all these micro-arguments about the micro-invasions of privacy are 'bread and circuses' [0]. We've entirely lost sight of what it means to be a private citizen just going about our own lives without every nanosecond being tracked, without every damn interaction being an opportunity for someone to skim a cent. Any micro-invasion can be 'justified': it's more convenient, I don't care about a restaurant chain knowing what I've ordered, I don't want to talk to other people, etc. But they all add up. Societies are increasingly unhappy, anxious, overweight, polarised. The gap between ultra-rich and regular citizens is widening. It all adds up. Yeah.. old man, cloud. Whatever.

The app isn't there to improve on this. The app is there to maaaybe cut a little bit of hassle with replacing paper menus, but mostly promises to improve the business analytics site and creates many marketing opportunities, including but not limited to screwing with (er, personalizing) recommendations, creating incentive structures, and better tracking thanks to tricking the user into giving the vendor their phone number and bunch of other data. And, whatever else on top it is, one thing the app is not is an improvement in convenience or experience to the user. reply austinjp 8 hours agorootparentprevThis highlights the underpinning problem: wages are so low that people cannot afford to live.

When was the last time you were out in public? I hate to break it to you but this doesn't happen, ever; if I see a kid in a restaurant they are pretty much always watching iPads. If they aren't watching an iPad they certainly aren't learning to socialize, because iPad-less kids in restaurants are almost always allowed to misbehave and be disruptive or even destructive. reply Fnoord 7 hours agorootparentSpoken clearly by someone who lacks experience with having children. Look, it works pretty simple. Witching hour is right before dinner time. Kids are grumpy / hangry (hungry + angry). On top of that, young children have a short attention span and patience. Children certainly can socialize (after toddler age), but while sitting still at a restaurant table? Not for long. A tablet or smartphone is a tool to keep them distracted during waiting. Heck, playing is learning too, so it is IMO a learning tool. That said, I can recommend a family restaurant. For example, on vacation to Texel we went to this one [1]. I have not even seen the indoor playground (only outdoor) as the two times we were here the weather was great. Tons of children playing, the picture you see of the outdoor playground is not even 20% of the whole playground. It is quite large, with a special area for toddlers. Moreover, we went to a family friendly bungalow park with activities for children, and the restaurant on the park (we didn't go to it this year but previous year) has an adjacent playground. If you're on a more tight budget, the same exists for camping. Do children socialize on playgrounds? Toddlers kind of don't. They're still in their own world, at best they play 'parallel'. After toddler age? Absolutely. They form new bonds, become friends, they play together. They also get into conflict with each other, which forces them to learn conflict solving skills. They practice motor skills and build muscles. But I couldn't leave them completely alone, so I stayed in the vicinity. Hence, I did not socialize (which, as autistic as I am, I do not mind :P). On top of that, I remember going to McDonald's as kid in the late 80s (it was one of the first McD's in my country) and they had a playground with balls in it. Also great fun. For the record: I did have a Nintendo game watch and Game Boy back then. But in the McD's such wasn't necessary. And finally, to all those people who claim they want to socialize with strangers they visually meet. Yeah, that is why people sat on banks reading newspapers, why walkman and discman existed long ago already, why the hairdresser has magazines, why trains have a silent area where you can read a book, etc. Let's face it: not everyone is an extrovert.

And it's not about stilling your hunger. You can eat in any order and pace that you prefer. So if people arrive at different times, you can share some starters while waiting for the other people to arrive. Then jump into some main courses when everybody is ready.

But still, this is much easier to do when you don't have to flag down the waiter everytime you want to order. > You're not supposed to arrive hungry to a restaurant Not if it's fine dining and I have low expectations about portion sizes.

Also we should recognize that the waiter is often looked down at, it is not a very nice job, and as a human being, having a poor experience with some customers will probably pass on to other customers, etc...

The whole point of going out for drinks or food is not having to prepare it yourself and having someone else do the dishes. Depending on the venue getting waited on is a feature, not an inconvenience. If interacting with the people facilitating that is stressful I would recommend finding a bench near a vending machine, having someone else in your party handle the interaction, or, not going out. Is this just an issue in countries where waiters depend on tips for their income? reply n4r9 9 hours agorootparentThe food is still prepared to restaurant standard and brought out by waiters. The dishes are still done by someone else.

A waiter orchestrates and coordinates the experience for the diners they are looking after. They slow down orders to stop the kitchen getting overwhelmed. They upsell on the menu in a way that is helpful and informative. They understand the dietary requirements of guests. They hold complex orders in their head and drop the right plate to the right person. They know the flow of a table and engage or back off as appropriate.

Plenty of places will tell you not to expect fast service for certain dishes or drinks. If you order a cocktail at a bar and complain when it arrives after the cola, you'll raise eyebrows. The confusion between you two in this thread may be partly due to the conflation of 'slow service' with 'poor service', they're not necessarily the same. Sure, if I ordered a cola and was still waiting after the table next to me received their 5 different cocktails, something would have gone wrong. Here's a fun story. The other day, I was in Belgium. We ordered food at a restaurant. While we were waiting I had a beer, my partner had a negroni. We waited... and waited... and waited. Other diners arrived, ordered food, their food arrived, they ate it. And still we waited. After a while we asked a waiter if our food order had got lost. They were apologetic, and pointed to my partner's still-unfinished drink, but said they'd get our food out ASAP. The food arrived rapidly (it was delicoius). What had happened? Well, a negroni is an apéritif, so is drunk before a meal. The staff hadn't been inattentive; quite the opposite -- they were waiting for the apéritif to be finished. Serving the meal beforehand would have been... rude? Undignified, perhaps. And certainly something that all the other local diners would have been well aware of. Sure, it was a leisurely situation, nobody was in a rush, this isn't a daily occurrence, blah blah. Anwyay, I learned a thing about apéritifs. Cultural heterogeneity is educational and enriching in a way that QR codes and social isolation are not. reply PUSH_AX 6 hours agorootparentI'd amend that to being confusion between the accepted norm of service vs poor service. I'm fully aware that there is breathing space in a service, it's not a conveyor belt. Your anecdote is nice. I think another thing to recognise is everyone has different expectations around service time and availability of service. The great thing about some of these systems is you can choose, the one I helped implement is there if you want it, if not your table falls back to classical service, and best of all there are of course still staff around to talk to if you need. reply peoplefromibiza 10 hours agorootparentprev> You're either trying to solve the problem of service or you're not, it's binary.

I don't understand what you mean, it's probably that I, as a non US citizen, don't understand why people should sit down and enjoy a meal while also being in a hurry, there's no management involved here, it's just my opinion. if I'm in a hurry I'll buy a sandwich or some pizza slice (it has a kinda different meaning here than in the US, but to get you an idea of what I mean) reply PUSH_AX 10 hours agorootparent> The point is: throwing a QR code at your issues won't solve your issues. I believe this to be (generally, but with exceptions) false.

I know that for a diner to serve me at a table it can't take less than 20-30 minutes or I am eating literal dog shit and I honestly don't like dog shit, regardless of the service I am receiving (or worse: I am making the staff uncomfortable by asking them to be quick because I am the one who's in a hurry). It means in total it will take at least one hour, if I don't have that time available I simply do not sit down in a diner. It's as simple as that, the ideal condition it's a dinner that usually takes from 2 to 4 hours. The 10 seconds saved on a QR code assuming that the QR code really saves time it's irrelevant at that point. It is possible that different cultures have different ways of understanding 'service standards'. > expectation of the tip You're hyper focused on your own bubble, in most of the World tips are not mandatory nor common especially for a quick lunch break. And still your answers do not address the larger picture: the staff is there to help you, not to serve you in the as a servant way. They shouldn't, in my opinion, be considered like minions executing what the machine told them to do. That's what Fritz Lang warned us about in 1927. But even assuming that the QR code saves a lot of time, good staff can go a long way, a fast self-service order system where you wait at the table because the place is understaffed it's a worse experience than an understaffed place where at least a real human greets me asking what I want to drink, before taking my order. reply PUSH_AX 10 hours agorootparent> Am I? I mean, yeah.. You've even done it again. Outlining situations with perfect service. That's great, now think about the original problem statement where service becomes a bottle neck, and no \"if you want great fast service just go elsewhere\" is not an elegant solution, sorry. reply peoplefromibiza 9 hours agorootparent> Outlining situations with perfect service What are you even talking about? Are you implying that QR code solutions are optimal for shitty services? > where service becomes a bottle neck this is a textbook example of false dilemma. If service is the bottleneck making the ordering process faster will make things worse, not better. If anything if a place is slow to take orders, I know they'll be late on serving it I can anticipate the problem and go somewhere else, if I already placed the order now I'm stuck. It's the same things happening at McDonalds with ordering booths, your order is very fast, the service is not and you end up wasting a lot of time in line waiting for your number. As one of the error pages of this website states Please stop hammering. It makes the problem worse. Thanks, but no thanks. You're also contradicting yourself here > where service becomes a bottle neck > \"if you want great fast service just go elsewhere\" is not an elegant solution The \"service is the bottleneck but please stay here and wait until we serve you who knows when, after you placed your order\" is much worse. At least with staff taking the orders they can straight tell you \"we're full, there's a wait list\" or warn you that that day orders are being processed more solwly than normal and you can decide what to do. QR code machines will place orders no matter what, but, again, people are not machines and quality has its merits, more than speediness, In my opinion. YMMV reply PUSH_AX 8 hours agorootparent> this is a textbook example of false dilemma. If service is the bottleneck making the ordering process faster will make things worse, not better. I’m sort of at a loss for words, I haven’t posed a dilemma, also do you think a server exclusively does one task and nothing else, or is it more fair to say they do multiple and eradicating one task frees up capacity for another?

Which a few restaurants actually do, but usually only a few dishes. That said, I refuse to go to any restaurant that has a QR code menu, reply TeMPOraL 10 hours agorootparentIt's not hard. It's just a bit more work - enough that it starts requiring a professional to be involved (graphics design, photography, coordinating print), whereas traditional menus can be half-assed[0] by anyone with passing familiarity with Word and access to the office printer. In contrast, the digital menus usually come as a solution, packaged with a promise of some juicy business analytics, so the restaurant only needs to sign the contract and send over some files - that's even less work than regular paper menus. So no surprise they're jumping to \"high tech\" - they're really outsourcing menus to a marketing company. -- [0] - I don't know how things are at the very highest tier of restaurants for the rich, but for those accessible to less rich, it seems the higher-end the restaurant is, the worse the menu is. Bad design, typos, etc. I suppose having an established reputation allows them to get careless about the minor details. reply hot_gril 10 hours agorootparentI would expect the most expensive part to be printing and laminating those menus, which will also be longer due to the space used on images. Then they need to be cleaned, possibly updated, and will still go bad over time. reply TeMPOraL 3 hours agorootparentPrinting is cheap and, even with a half-decent consumer-grade inkjet or laser printer, takes very little labor. Laminating is much more labor-intensive, though it's not bad as long as you stick to a standard paper size[0]. In my experience, somehow, in the transition to digital and past worries about \"dead trees\", most people missed the fact that paper and printing are dirt-cheap these days[1], and if you account for e-waste, often much more environment-friendly than digital alternatives. -- [0] - We bought a laminating machine recently, so my wife could make various educational tools for our kids herself. It quickly stops being fun once you're trying to laminate a bunch of arbitrarily-cut shapes on a single shit; keeping things aligned is a PITA. [1] - Well, not if you're paying a print shop.

At least that was the case in Bengaluru,India before Covid. I would say that from the restuarant's point of view, having the order-from-app experience works out since the freelancers can order via their laptops whenever they want, without having to flag down a waiter. And during rush hours, tables could order what they want without having to spot and call a waiter among a very drunk dancing crowd. reply giarc 5 hours agoparentprevThe best implementation of QR code menu I've seen was as followed. There was a paper menu but could also order from QR. It was a well designed page to choose from, but the wait staff was still there and took order. We had the option to order from QR if we wanted. When they entered our order, the page (linked to our table through custom QR code) updated with our order. We could add items at any point or we could \"call our wait staff\" who would then come to our table. At any point we could just pay our bill and walk away.

You as a user are not meant to knowingly access data that does not belong to you. Even something like changing the id from 1 to 2 is legally considered unauthorised access. It would be different if for example the application was showing data for other customers through normal use of it, but even if there is no other barrier to access than changing an id that is considered bypassing access control and can result in jail time in most places.

Private disclosure is for when you believe the company cares about security but made a genuine mistake. For the company in the OP it would be more like free education in fundamental privacy and ethics. They're not entitled to that. Name and shame. reply appendix-rock 12 hours agorootparentSure, but what you’re describing is not what is being suggested. Responsible disclosure typically involves disclosing publicly after a reasonable period of time. reply TeMPOraL 11 hours agorootparentWhy? Why should they be the responsible ones, when the well-funded, well-connected service provider is acting like the fly-by-night startup (that they probably started as)? There's little public benefit in responsible disclosure here; all it would lead to is the whole thing being swept under the rug with some trivial \"fix\". There's lots of public benefit in immediate, wide disclosure - the scramble to fix this under pressure from vendors before potential abuse, and any real or imagined attempt at abuse, and subsequent lawsuits, would go far towards educating people and the industry about privacy, security, and bad business practice. It's a nice low real damage, high publicity case. It's not like this stuff is new. But without serious pressure, the businesses will never learn and never stop making or enrolling into such systems. Anyway, if it happened over here in the EU, I'd do the responsible disclosure thing and give a full, detailed advance expose to the local Data Protection Authority. (And if I sound adversarial, then consider that neither the vendor developing such systems, nor the venues using them, are doing it in the interest of the customers.) reply altacc 11 hours agorootparentThere's a big difference between announcing \"I found all this private data\" and \"I found all this private data and here's exactly how I did it and here are the URLs\". What the author has done is detail exactly how anyone else can abuse this system from anywhere in the world and also given them ideas about what to do with that information that would cause a direct cost to the company. I think that's irresponsible and unnecessary. You public disclosure rationale has some merit but it didn't require publishing the user manual for the attack. Just saying you used the API, publishing the amounts plus some proof of private data from people who have given consent would be enough to get the business scrambling. reply golol 10 hours agorootparentThis seems less like a \"manual for attack\" and more like tweeting that your local storage unit rental never puts locks on their garages and gates and \"anyone could just walk in and out\". reply altacc 10 hours agorootparentTo expand your analogy can you see the difference between: \"A storage unit I know of never uses locks\" and \"The storage unit at 1234 Central Boulevard, San Andreas never uses locks, just wiggle the door a bit and it'll open.\" I think most people would acknowledge there's a big difference. reply Wytwwww 8 hours agorootparentThat's not the same though at all.. A closer analogy would be publicly announcing that \"Company managing the storage lockers 1234 Central Boulevard, San Andreas is keeping all of them unlocked without telling their customers\".

Sometimes I find some interesting stuff and possibly some opportunities for mild exploits. The other day I was at burger king. They allow you to refill your drink as many times as you like within 60 minutes of purchasing it, and the way this restriction is implemented is by having you scan a QR code they print on your receipt at the drink machine. I scanned the QR code with Binary Eye (android app that reads all sorts of barcodes, highly recommended). It contained some numbers I couldn't immediately recognize as interesting, a timestamp in a format similar to 202409231049, and a UUID. Now, the UUID is probably the ID of the order in their internal system, so the question is: does the drink machine only read the timestamp or does it also use the UUID to query the internal system to re-validate it?

You accidentally stumbling on something unprotected generally clears you from any liability as long as you stop as soon as you notice it.

    "originBody": "Uber Caught Overcharging? How Having Credits in Your Account Might Be Costing You by Gary Leff on September 22, 2024 I noticed something strange earlier this month when I pulled up the Uber app and requested a ride. I had my monthly $15 American Express Uber credit in my account The price for the ride was displayed net of this credit (rather than full price, just showing the Uber credit as a payment method later) And the fare seemed higher than usual. It was also much higher than Lyft. My hypothesis was that Uber seemed to be picking a higher price because I had credits in my account. I might be willing to spend more because my ‘real’ out of pocket cost was less, and those credits were trapped anyway. I decided to use my Uber credits for Uber Eats instead. That pricing seemed normal. I need to keep my eye on this. Reader Charles says he noticed something similar. He regularly pre-books rides with Uber – between the same locations at the same time of day – and generally finds the price to be stable ~ $20 and a bit cheaper than Lyft. He bought Uber gift cards at Costco for a 20% discount to face value. That’s when things got weird. Loaded first $50 card in my uber account, everything behaved normal. I loaded another $200 before taking Uber to airport, then was surprised to find uber won’t allow payment with uber cash loaded in the account this way for rides scheduled ahead of time. …then stranger things happened: for same ride I book regularly increased from about $20 to $30! Just as a sanity check, Lyft is still ~$20 for same ride. He went a step farther and did something I didn’t: he checked Uber prices “with someone else’s phone” who did not have a balance in their Uber account – and Uber was pricing the route at the usual $20 for them. I don’t know exactly what’s happening here, but something seems strange and – unsurprisingly – not in a customer-friendly way. At the same time, I’m also not the first person to experience (or think they experienced) this. Have you seen anything like it? I’d be curious your experiences, especially once you get Uber credits in your account. My theory, and it is definitely just that, is this is something they’re testing on a subset of users to learn how customers respond. Remember when Uber brought in Dara Khosrowshahi from Expedia to be their new CEO, to become kinder and gentler and friendler? At the time I figured things would get worse because he was literally in charge at Expedia. But drivers now seem to earn less, even though (because of) tipping. It’s more expensive to customers, too. And there’s no more “surge pricing” – they just charge you higher and higher amounts without telling you they’re doing it.

Refusing to give good reviews harms the drivers who are already barely scraping by. I drive on Uber part-time. In my city at least, rating is not such a big deal. The vast vast majority of people give 5 stars ratings (i'm talking about 99% of ratings). I assume there are some people who only give ratings when the service was exceptionally good or exceptionally bad, or would otherwise consider 3 stars as a fair rating for a normal experience. Let's call there honest raters. As a driver, i don't think honest raters can have such a big impact on me, because the platform is designed so that there's no preference to always match honest raters to some particular drivers. Their honest ratings will be spread more or less uniformly among drivers. And, if we want to apply Kantian logic and think \"but what would happen if everybody did the same?\", well, Uber is a live system too: if more people would become honest raters, then the ceiling of what's the minimum average rating you need to have as a driver would be lowered accordingly. Uber needs drivers too. It needs to keep a healthy balance of available drivers and available passengers. If either of the two gets too low, if would lose the other part in short time. reply maeil 10 hours agorootparent> I drive on Uber part-time. In my city at least, rating is not such a big deal.

Think about it, and you'll discover that pricing algorithms have been subject to human whim since before the invention of money.

It offends your (and my) puritanical sensibilities, but prices are all made up and have no relation to what something costs to make (it's true. think about that deeply) anyway, so of evils in the world, Uber's pricing strategy is hardly the worst of it. reply bozhark 19 hours agorootparentprevnext [2 more] [flagged] mvdtnz 19 hours agorootparentIf you have something to say, say it. reply bdangubic 20 hours agorootparentprevnext [6 more] [flagged] Eddy_Viscosity2 20 hours agorootparentWhat?

It's not obvious though because it seems that there's disagreement about whether or not we have free pricing (as seen by other subthreads here), so it wasn't clear to me at first if the parent comment here was arguing that we have transparent prices and therefore are communistic or that we don't and therefore aren't. reply Eddy_Viscosity2 19 hours agorootparentRight, thank you that. I didn't get what was being said there. Of course in a large economy where most price discovery is transparent in the sense that they are not individualized and can't change in real-time based on arbitrary and hidden rulesets, then a few exceptions won't topple the whole thing. Some amount of fraud can also be tolerated. But too much and things start to break down. reply saghm 18 hours agorootparentYep, I agree with that. I think there's probably a spectrum of \"transparency\" rather than just a binary thing, and we all have different ideas of where to draw the line of what's acceptable. They key question to me is whether it's transparent enough for there to be accountability. Right now, it's impossible to tell the difference between the pricing algorithm that Uber currently uses and one where they pull tricks like the one described in the article, and I think that's the problem; they might do it, they might not, and from the outside, it looks identical because there's no way to hold them accountable if they do. reply bdangubic 4 hours agorootparent> no way to hold them accountable if they do Hold them accountable for what exactly?! Uber provides a service - how much it costs depends on many factors like where you live, time of the day and many other factors. You open the app to see what their services cost and you can then choose to use their services or not. There is no price transparency in many businesses. Try buying airline tickets online - first try at your own home. Then take your laptop and go to a zipcode where one of your friends lives that is much better off than you financially and try the same thing. Next, do the same but go to a different friend's house, one that perhaps lives in a zipcode that is a lot less affluent and see what happens there. Then repeat this same test but use MacBook Pro vs some shitty HP running Windows 7 and see what the difference is.

Time based pricing elasticity is also exploited, for example, people leaving the concert at 12am likely dont have other options - driver bonuses and rider coupons optimizing for marginal rides.

In fact I'm struggling to think of a single scientific theory that would be falsifiable by your definition. reply nfw2 18 hours agorootparentConservation of momentum is falsifiable because you could construct an experiment that where the expected movement based on the theory might not be observed, in which case the theory would be falsified. Perhaps what you are getting at is that scientific theories can not be \"known true\" through experiments. This is correct. Theories can only be strengthened by experiments. It is not uncommon for theories long-believed true to be falsified later, despite extensive experimentation supporting them. Conservation of momentum, for example, doesn't apply when you zoom out far enough (i.e. general relativity). The proposition that is unfalsifiable in this case is this: \"Uber sometimes charges different rates based on if the user has credits.\" An experiment where the same rate is shown would not falsify this proposition, nor obviously would an experiment where a different rate is shown. reply dataflow 18 hours agorootparent> Conservation of momentum is falsifiable because you could construct an experiment that where the expected movement based on the theory might not be observed, in which case the theory would be falsified. No. That would only prove something about your specific time/location/instance of the experiment. It doesn't prove that the law holds in all time/space/instances of the experiment. That's literally impossible to prove, and that's what you're demanding here. You're claiming that just because you can't prove the pricing theory always holds then it's unfalsifiable. That's nonsensical and not how anybody uses the term. reply nfw2 16 hours agorootparentHow the term is used: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability From Karl Popper: \"The only way to verify a claim such as \"All swans are white\" would be if one could theoretically observe all swans, which is not possible. On the other hand, the falsifiability requirement for an anomalous instance, such as the observation of a single black swan, is theoretically reasonable and sufficient to logically falsify the claim.\" How is this different from what I am saying? reply nfw2 16 hours agorootparentprevI'm not saying what you think I am saying. The theory that \"Uber price is always independent of whether the rider has credits\" is indeed falsifiable, and the experiment in the anecdote seems to do so. The opposite claim, \"that Ubers do not always charge the same rate\" -- the one that logically flows from falsifying the first -- is the claim that is unfalsifiable.

The truth may be far more banal. They may be using a ML model to determine pricing. The ML model takes as input all known information about that user.

The ML model, after much historical analysis, figured out that it can charge users more if they have credits available.

In the latter case, it's based on intuition. In the former, it's based on statistics. However, the motivation remains the same. If people are thinking this is evil, it's the motivation and the result that matter, not the means through which they achieve their goal. And if they used ML as a black box, it could act in problematic ways. Maybe the ML figured out that it could charge Black riders more. They didn't look into it and just rolled it out. Things like that can happen when you don't look into stuff. And I'd say that it's questionably legal. If a store charged you more money because you were using a gift card, I think we'd all agree that the store had unjustly taken value from you.

While I'm here, it sure would be nice if someone were to spin up a fediverse/decentralized alternative that municipalities could adopt and interconnect. reply Rayaan22 13 hours agoprevElevate your corporate holiday gifting with our exclusive selection of premium gifts!

If you dig into the headlines, they all trace back to one article written by a small Belgian newspaper [1] which is barely more than a blurb. The evidence in the article is one very casual experiment: > Dernière Heure conducted a test using two smartphones, one with 84% battery and the other with 12%, to request a ride from their office in Brussels to Tour & Taxis in the centre. > The result showed a significant price difference, with the phone at 12% battery being charged €17.56 and the phone at 84% battery being charged €16.6 for the same service. Uber also denies it in the article. Obviously you don't have to believe them but IMO it's more likely that the \"significant price difference\" (less than one euro) is explained by some other variable that the author wasn't able to identify.

I don't know if this particular claim is true but dynamic pricing is getting out of control. Things should have an advertised price rather than some amorphous ML system deciding to charge you more because you're desperate or you can afford it (according to some criteria). These companies have to be careful too because they may open themselves up to discrimination claims. There are protected classes you can't discriminate against under federal law. Facebook already settled a case of race discrimination in housing ads [1]. This has nothing to do with dynamic pricing but I guarantee you dynamic pricing will open up more of these issues.

However I should, as someone who just left a concert, have a notion as to how much it's in my best interests to either rideshare with my friend and deal with two stops, or walk up the street to a restaurant and kill an hour or two while we wait for the chaos to dissipate.

    "originBody": "Tech News We Hot-Wired the iPhone 16 Innovations in Repairability Article by: Kyle Wiens @kyle September 22, 2024 Filed under: Teardowns, Tech News 12 Comments Share Our teardown lab is filled with iPhone 16 parts, and we’ve been having a blast playing with them. Apple’s latest smartphone series has largely underwhelmed tech reviewers, who are mixed on the usefulness of the new dedicated camera button and twiddling their thumbs waiting for Apple Intelligence to drop. But in our world, it’s a big deal: the iPhone 16 lineup makes three big leaps for repairkind. First: The adhesive that secures the battery, in the vanilla and Plus models, is this fancy new sticky stuff that can debond when you pass an electrical current through it. That means no more reliance on finicky, brittle adhesive strips, just a consistent, easily repeatable process. It will require a new tool, of course—more on that later. Second: The 16 Pro battery has a hard steel case instead of a soft pouch, a form factor that looks familiar from the Apple Watch. Every time we’ve heard electronics manufacturers suggest that repairs could be dangerous because of lithium-ion batteries, we point out that the power to make battery repairs safer is in their hands: Hard cell batteries instead of soft pouch batteries won’t get accidentally punctured by a slip of a screwdriver, and so they’re way less likely to catch fire. Since the Pro doesn’t feature the new adhesive, getting the battery out may sometimes require prying, and a hard case will make that process safer. The one model with no battery improvements? The flagship 16 Pro Max. Third: We’ve lauded the “enter through either the front or the back” design that debuted on the base iPhone 14, but it took two generations for Apple to trickle that innovation up to their pro phones. It’s here on all models now—and it looks like it’s here to stay. Having to remove an expensive, fragile, ProMotion OLED during a repair path isn’t ideal, so being able to avoid it for simple repairs streamlines procedures. And that’s not even counting iOS 18’s new “Repair Assistant,” which aspires to end the parts pairing software barriers to repair. When we tested it out with the iPhone 15 series earlier this week, we thought it was promising, if not quite ready for prime time. But it worked impressively smoothly on our vanilla iPhone 16: one click to pair and calibrate all components at once, and no bugs to be found. Announcing FixHub: A New iFixit Tool Speaking of innovations in repairability, we’re really excited to announce the latest addition to our workbench, the FixHub Portable Soldering Station.

Whether you're in the workshop or out in the field, you're always ready to fix. $249.95 Shop Now Fancy New Sticky Stuff The earliest rumors of new electrically-releasing battery adhesive came back in June, when Wayne Ma at The Information reported that Apple was testing technology to make DIY repair easier. When adhesive manufacturer Tesa released a video showing their new “Debonding on Demand — Electrical Release” process, we were convinced. We have high confidence that this Tesa technology is adhering the battery. As soon as Apple’s official iPhone 16 repair manuals dropped (which was actually on launch day, something we love to see), we hustled over to their battery guide, which sure enough described passing 9V through this fancy new adhesive. This image is from Apple’s official iPhone 16 battery repair guide. So, how does this magical adhesive work? This research paper sheds some light: In the second scenario, anodic delamination is caused by the oxidation of the surface of the aluminum substrate and migration of Al3+ into the adhesive. This will lead to fast debonding since the substrate layer bonded to the adhesive is no longer supported. What does this jargon mean? Imagine an Oreo cookie with a thick layer of double-stuf creme. You figured out that if you dip just the bottom cookie in some milk and twist the cookie apart, the filling will always stick to the top cookie. Similarly, when we zap the adhesive, the current oxidizes the negative/anode mating surface and loosens the adhesive from it. The adhesive “filling” between the battery and the frame will then stick to whichever surface that’s connected to the positive terminal. Trial Run of Our Next FixHub Tool When the time came to crack open the new phones, we were ready with a prototype of our new iPhone battery repair tool: a USB-C cable on one end, alligator clips on the other. We plugged it into our FixHub Power Station, clipped the ground wire to a nearby screw, and attached the red wire to a silver tab next to the battery. Our cable was set up to deliver 12V, and since Tesa suggested that their adhesive would release in 60 seconds at 12V, we waited a minute: Sure enough, the battery lifted out with no force, and the case underneath was almost residue-free (though the battery side remained tacky). You’ll probably still want to take a pass with isopropyl alcohol before you put a new battery in, but you won’t have to scrape out adhesive strip remnants like in iPhones of yore. One of the biggest problems with the current stretch-release adhesive strips—the ones still used in the 16 Pro and Pro Max—is that they get more and more brittle over time. In older phones, repair techs essentially expect that they’re going to have to apply a solvent under the battery to get the adhesive to disengage—not a huge deal, but depending on the solvent and how careful you are with application, it can damage other internal components. Only time will tell how this new adhesive ages; Apple’s own repair manual suggests that the adhesive may take longer to disengage over time. They say you can use up to 30V to trigger the electrical release. We tried releasing our battery at several different voltages. At 20V, the battery released in about 5 seconds. At 5V, it took a tad over 6 minutes. The adhesive sits inside a well in the frame, specially machined to create ridges and rough surfaces for the glue to adhere to. A close up under Evident Scientific’s microscope really brings this simple but beautiful structure to life. This Phone Needs a New Tool. Is That a Repairability Problem? The last time iPhone repair required a brand new tool—when Apple began sealing phones with their proprietary five-pointed screw, the pentalobe—we raised a fuss. At the time, nobody outside official Apple repair shops had access to the driver, which effectively blocked repairs until we reverse-engineered it. This is pretty different. Any hardware store around the world will sell you a set of alligator clips and a 9V battery, at a reasonable price. Everyone fixing one of these phones is going to need a power supply of some kind. Apple’s 9V battery solution is perfectly fine, but USB-C can also output the needed power and is in some cases more convenient (9V batteries have fallen out of favor). Good news: we’re already working on a ruggedized version of our prototype to include with our battery repair kits. Is It Reversible? If we connected the 9V in reverse, would that rebond the adhesive? Nope. The adhesive remained ungrippy. The reverse polarity did have an effect: when we reverse-zapped a new phone, the zap released the battery, but the adhesive residue stuck to the frame instead of the battery. Before that, a positive zap consistently left the residue on the battery. If you’re trying this at home, be sure to get the polarity right so you have less residue to clean up on the frame! With the correct polarity, the adhesive sticks to the battery and leaves the frame clean (right). With reversed polarity, the adhesive sticks to the frame instead (left). It doesn’t seem like this adhesive is intended to be multi-use. We’re guessing that Apple will sell batteries with the new adhesive already applied (the repair manual describes “peeling the pink release liner” off the adhesive). Easy Battery Repairs Matter There was a time when cell phone battery replacements hardly deserved being called a repair—you’d pop the back cover off with your thumbnail and stick in a new battery. Fairphone has proven that this is still possible in the form factor of a modern smartphone, with an IP55 rating. But until the industry goes the way of Fairphone (or chooses that’s where they want to innovate), battery replacements will remain the repair most worth talking about. Batteries are consumables. They’ll eventually wear out, no matter how durable the rest of your phone is. Extending a phone’s life by a year saves about 100x the phone’s weight in CO2 emissions, and easy battery replacements are a necessary part of that lifespan extension. Some people have speculated that the new adhesive is aimed at helping Apple comply with new European Right to Repair regulations that passed recently, but we don’t think that’s what’s going on here. There are two regulations that address battery repairs: Ecodesign for Smartphones and the new Battery Regulation, each with slightly different requirements for compliance, both requiring easily removable batteries. Europe will probably enforce one or the other. The Joint Research Centre has suggested that Ecodesign will likely supersede, but it’s not yet settled. Regardless, in either case, we don’t believe the changed battery adhesive affects compliance—stretch-release adhesive and electrical-release adhesive under a battery seem to be equally compliant. However, display removal is a sticking point for both regulations: The iPhone 16 display removal is not compliant with the Ecodesign Directive because of the use of pentalobe screws, and it’s not compliant with the battery regulation because it requires heat for entry. If Apple could use this new voltage-release adhesive to open the phone, that might get them compliant with the Battery Regulation. Improved Thermal Handling of AI Workloads How well the iPhone can dissipate heat has always mattered: When the processor gets too hot, it has to throttle down and reduce performance. In this new world of AI, with on-device machine learning models, performance is going to matter more than ever. Faster models are more intelligent and can give you better suggestions or photo enhancements. Thermal paste transfers heat from the A18 to this sink. The orange insulator on the sink prevents it from spilling on the smaller components. Apple has significantly changed up their approach to dissipating heat from the main A18 processor with a new, ferrous heat sink. In this photo it looks like an EMI shield, but it’s actually a solid block of material. This sink sits inside the mainboard sandwich, soldered to the inside of the RF half of the logic board—which has an L-shaped footprint, similar to iPhones past and the 15 Plus from last year. Thermal paste transfers heat from the A18 to this sink. Markup indicates where the sink and insulator sit on top of the SoC. Intriguingly, this heat sink only covers about half of the A18 SoC. If the alignment of the die markings match Apple’s marketing photos, then the heat sink is over the Neural Engine, Apple’s machine learning hardware. The more efficiently they can run their Neural Engine, the better it will work. These improvements will enable the iPhone to run at maximum performance longer than previous designs. Apple’s illustration of the Neural Engine, via the iPhone 16 keynote. Is the Camera Control Button … a Button? Aside from the delayed Apple Intelligence, the feature that’s got everyone talking in this lineup is the new dedicated camera button. Yes, it does physically actuate. Yes, it’s a button. But there’s more to it than that. When we pulled it out, we discovered that it’s got its own tiny integrated circuit. Unfortunately, the button seems to be laser-welded to the frame. Buttons in past models featured a latch mechanism that made them fully replaceable and repairable. Now, if the button malfunctions, you’ll have to replace the whole frame. The welds appear unnecessary, except to attach the button and its IC to the frame. There’s a new “enclosure” component in the service history of the phone, and we confirmed it’s tracking this IC—when we swapped out a button, “enclosure” popped up in the history. Chips enable parts pairing, the software barrier to repair that has increasingly plagued Apple products. But since the new Repair Assistant mode worked flawlessly for us on the iPhone 16, a new serialized part is less of a red flag today than it was before. The spot where the button slots into the frame previously held a 5G mmWave antenna in the iPhone 15 (and every model back to the 12). Now there seems to be just one mmWave antenna left, sitting up against the camera assembly. Will that affect the phone’s signal strength? We also noticed this interesting flex cable epoxied onto the bracket holding the button in place. This is likely the “force sensor”—a strain gauge that converts tiny amounts of deformation into changes in resistance. The iPhone uses this to sense half-presses before the button actually clicks. Settling the Score Last year, we awarded the iPhone 15 a lowly four out of ten, primarily due to the real-world complications that parts pairing causes. This year, Apple has changed their tune. Accordingly, we’re changing ours. Let’s start with the basics: Apple’s repair manuals are well written, well above the average we see from other manufacturers, and it’s awesome (like, really cool!) that Apple had them ready for launch day. Our only real gripes are a lack of schematics for board-level repairs, and missing repair procedures for the charge port or any buttons. Everything else looks great. Repair parts aren’t on sale yet, but if Apple matches what’s already available on the 15-series, they’ll get quite a bit of credit there—mostly a good offering with a few omissions (no charge ports, buttons, or enclosure, for instance) and a display assembly that’s too pricey to be an attractive repair option for most people. The new battery procedure is the design highlight. We repeatedly deactivated the adhesive with a variety of tools and timings, and the procedure seems very robust. We really like that you don’t need an expensive proprietary tool for this: You could rig up any 9V battery with whatever length of wire you’ve got lying around, and you’re set. We’d still prefer screws or some other fastener that’s easier to reverse—this will require cleanup/prep before installing a new battery (which presumably comes with fresh adhesive pre-applied, otherwise folks will have to get creative). And the adhesive supplier will need to make this glue available to the repair market. Still, this is a really cool innovation. The dual-entry design, first introduced on the 14 series, remains very elegant. Once inside, lots of components are independently accessible with little to no additional disassembly. The layout is smart, prioritizing access to critical repairs like battery and camera replacement. In past models, it was normal to see, for example, battery pull tabs blocked by a Taptic Engine, which was blocked by a speaker, which was blocked by a big grounding bracket—all of that having to come out in sequence. The 16’s design offers independent access to the battery, the speaker, the Taptic Engine, cameras, display, back cover, and so on. It’s really thoughtfully laid out. The largest remaining obstacles to repair: Apple continues to use a variety of fussy screw types. The display and rear panel adhesive requires heat to get inside. But we’re beyond pleased that Repair Assistant worked effortlessly, which removes our biggest complaint about the last few models of iPhone. The iPhone 16 earns a respectable 7 out of 10, a significant upgrade from last year’s model.

The sum of the replacement parts can vastly exceed the price of just buying a new one (which is often a newer model). We even have terminology for that in the auto world where you can “total” a car because it costs more to fix than replace. There are other hidden costs to repairs too. One is you’ve “broken the seal” and now your device isn’t “stock” anymore. The water seal might not work as well. The display connector might be slightly loose and tweak out. The screws might not be factory torqued down. For a car it’s similar too… maybe after that accident the frame is now just slightly off kilter. Maybe there was that proverbial “extra mystery bolt” left over. Then there is opportunity costs. Is repairing it really the best use of your time and money? What other things could you have done instead of repair? I dunno… All I’m saying is, repeatability isn’t the end all be all. It’s yet another set of trade offs factored into product design like security, user experience, quality, cost, time to market, size and weight, durability, etc. I think the score is fine.

It blows my mind that I never made this connection before. reply grues-dinner 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's also very common now for even superficially fairly minor danger to total a car because there's so much custom electronics all over a car that replacing the parts and wiring costs thousands in parts and days of labour, even if you can get the parts.

And even if it is, the insurers won't touch it because the manufacturers can't, won't and don't want to know how to agree that it's safe. Phones and other electronics are not a lot different in that manufacturers don't really want you to fix them and any sop towards repairable phones is under duress from legislation or . Hell, good luck even finding a genuine battery, I can't even get one for a ThinkPad and they're supposed to be good for that.

If the device can only be repaired by having extremely specialist tools, skills, etc. then it's still repairable, you just need to invest in those things which costs $$$. But it's hardly worth doing, because by the time you've done so the next iphone rolls around and the skills/tools lose most of their value. If the device can easily be repaired but the replacement components cost so much it's hardly worth doing the end result is the same: Devices won't be repaired because it's not financially attractive. Which is exactly what Apple wants, they're only doing this because the EU is practically forcing them to. reply Kirby64 4 hours agorootparentIf the physical part itself just costs a lot of money, it will have a high cost. And if it doesn’t, then the third party markets will thrive and solve this issue if the OEM is charging “too much” for it. Neither impacts a repairability score unless you want repairability to just be corresponding to how cheap something is, which would be nonsense. This isn’t Apple being evil, it’s just basic cost of goods. It’s like complaining that a 10 yr old car is too expensive to repair cause the parts cost too much. Yeah… at some point they do, relative to the value of the car. reply shuntress 4 hours agorootparentIt's not about the OEM charging \"too much\". It's about the OEM sandbagging the market. If that 10 year old car was designed with a non-standard shape battery, it would get a lower repairablity score. If additionally the OEM sued anyone who made batteries in that shape it would get an even lower repairability score. If on top of that the car was designed to turn on the check engine light if its battery was made by anyone other than the OEM then it would get an even lower score. reply Kirby64 4 hours agorootparent>> If that 10 year old car was designed with a non-standard shape battery, it would get a lower repairablity score.

Whoops! I guess you got me! After all it really is actually super easy to buy new parts for Apple products either from Apple themselves or the thriving third-party market! And on top of that, once your local repair shop has the parts, they are super easy to install. Surely my damaged iphone mini 12 will be easily repaired at a reasonable price by the skilled technicians at the Genius Bar who have parts in stock and tools ready to go. It would be absolutely wild if their price for that service was based on the price of the latest iphone rather than the cost of parts and labor for the actual service.

The only difference is cars have many more components and individually they cost less, whereas phones only have a handful of components and each cost a considerable portion of the phone cost. Your specific complaint about the iPhone 12 mini seems extremely unfounded, as well. Their repair cost (which is totally turnkey) is $89. Seems extremely reasonable for a turnkey repair from a first party vendor. Surely, maybe you can buy a “new” 12 mini for $200… but this is just like cars. At some point it’s “mechanically totaled” and the repair cost doesn’t make sense. And that point changes for a car too, depending on if you use a dealership service department or a third party mechanic. reply shuntress 2 hours agorootparent> Surely my damaged 4 year old car will be easily repaired at a reasonable price by a skilled mechanic at the car dealership who have parts in stock and tools ready to go.

Obviously the dealerships are typically more expensive but that is from marking up parts and labor not from trying to pressure you into buying a new car. If Ford had it the way Apple does brakes would be built in to the transmission, last for 60,000 miles, and be priced at $25,000 to repair. My specific complaint about my 12 mini is that it needs a new frame, back glass, camera, and battery. $89 dollars is obviously unrealistic for those parts. And, like you say, phones have fewer parts that make up a larger portion of the total cost for the product. Unlike with a car, you can actually swap everything into a new frame pretty easily. reply Kirby64 1 hour agorootparentYou need a new frame, a new back, a new camera, and a new battery, and you're confused why it would be outrageously priced to replace it? Basically the only things you aren't replacing are the mainboard, the speakers, and the display. To continue stretching the car analogy, that's like saying you bring in a car to the dealership that only needs a new gas tank, new infotainment system, new bodywork and frame, and then you're outraged that they want to charge you $25k! Most of the car is damaged, you scrap it and some third party can salvage what's valuable and repair some other car. reply shuntress 42 minutes agorootparentYou are wildly out of touch here. The labor cost for replacing parts on a car isn't just another ballpark. It's another planet. Obviously if you want to replace every part of the phone it is going to cost more altogether than a new phone. No reasonable person would argue that. And of course there are limits. The screen and mainboard are by far the most complex parts. The frame is trivial by comparison. The problem is that there is effectively no real aftermarket for parts and repairs. Apple all but refuses to sell parts and makes using third party parts as onerous as possible. They have been able to get away with it so far by riding the wave of quickly advancing mobile technology. But as next year's phone starts to look less and less different from last years phone, people are going to start to get serious about repairability and Apple is going to be forced to make some changes. reply beeboobaa3 3 hours agorootparentprevDo you really think that nearly half of the price of an iphone is the screen?

Maybe a bit cheaper, but also the pixel displays are not quite as nice as iPhone ones. reply gorkish 1 hour agoparentprevStrong agree; 7/10 is a ludicrous score for a device that takes a heat gun and a proprietary screwdriver to open. It is my opinion that iFixit is starting to turn from being actually hacker friendly into something of a mouthpiece for too-little-too-late corporate-sponsored initiatives designed to curb right-to-repair efforts. The money coming into their business from corporate programs is evident, and it's evident they are strongly perusing that market. I'm not convinced it's going to be a win for consumers though. I found the recent release of their soldering station at $300 to be particularly distasteful. If you want to spend that kind of money on soldering tools, go for Metcal.

It seems to come from a misunderstanding of expertise. Experts are often deeply focused on a specific issue and provide highly specialized advice. The problem arises when people either dismiss this advice outright, believing they know better, or when experts themselves overstep and present their advice as the only viable solution, missing the broader picture. In the case of Apple’s screen removal method, it’s not that experts didn’t think of simpler approaches like using heat, but rather that they likely considered and discarded it for technical reasons. Just because a solution seems obvious to us doesn’t mean it hasn’t already been carefully evaluated by those with far more experience in the field. This gets to the heart of why decision-makers must take expert advice but balance it with other factors. Experts, by nature, can become so focused on specific details—like examining individual leaf cells—that they fail to see the trees, let alone the entire forest. That’s why we shouldn't let any single expert dictate the entire process. If you let a lawyer design your product, it might be lawsuit-proof but unusable. If a security expert designed it, it might be unhackable but frustrating to use. And if an abstract artist designed it, it might be beautiful but completely impractical. The pandemic is an extreme example of this problem. We didn’t just listen to epidemiologists; we listened to a specific subclass—the doomsday epidemiologist. The more balanced experts, who understood their role as advisors and recognized how their guidance needed to fit into the bigger picture, were sidelined. This led to morally reprehensible policies, like forcing children to die alone in hospitals and isolating the elderly in nursing homes, all because visitors were banned. In Australia, they even killed 15 shelter dogs, including puppies, just to prevent volunteers from traveling to pick them up [0]—another example of blindly following extreme advice. These kinds of decisions, made in the name of public health, are why many people have lost trust in “experts.” Good product design—or public policy—requires input from multiple experts and a balance of priorities.

Cathedrals were the result of centuries of research into materials science, physics, and geometry -- and that's just considering the buildings themselves, not even the often-intricate religious art within. Some of the challenges and solutions in cathedral architecture took generations to solve; in many gothic and neogothic cathedrals with particularly tall, internally-unsupported naves, solutions like flying buttresses were thought up to support the walls externally -- sometimes with multiple layers of buttresses-upon-flying-buttresses. Developing the right cement and figuring out which type of stone you could use alone were often a project that took years, especially for landmark churches. These churches sometimes took decades or centuries to build, depending on how you measure it (basically, if you include significant reconstructions). They also weren't representative of the average construction project in essentially any region where there are cathedrals; those were more likely to be houses, shops, and other commercial buildings like port structures. Things like flying buttresses or new, opulent-but-functional arch designs also weren't representative of the average innovation in those times. Depending on where you look, that might be stuff like, a new loom variant that lets you produce new patterns, or a new kind of cheese that ages quickly while having a similar enough flavour to a slower-aging, more expensive type of cheese. My overarching point is -- at any given point in time, the average invention is small and boring. Specialists are a valuable resource, yes, but the more specialized they are, the smaller and more boring their contributions will seem to the average person outside of that specialization. Landmark innovations are built on thousands of smaller innovations made over years or decades, and those smaller innovations were usually invented by someone who's spent the past 25 years of their lives obsessing over that tiny thing, having published dozens of papers and argued for years about something you've likely never even heard of. reply TrapLord_Rhodo 1 hour agoparentprevWe build cathedrals almost daily, and they dwarf any cathedrals ever created.

Most laptops these days that opt for a thick enclosure are doing it for the sake of the cooling system, not for the sake of fitting in a thick battery. Edit: I looked at the Gigabyte A5 and agree that it's probably using cylindrical cells. It appears to be a Clevo system, so there were probably other brands reselling as well. But it's not quite a current model (3 year old processor), and the reviews seem to agree that the battery is one of the worst things about the machine, because the capacity is way too small for that class of machine. reply Algent 9 hours agorootparentprevPretty sure the airtight casing is here on purpose to trap flammables gas a dying cell create. Without it it would be very unsafe to use this type of batteries. reply moffkalast 5 hours agorootparentI guess using cylindrical cells in power tools, laptops, electric bikes and cars, power banks, flashlights, etc. must be super unsafe then, since they all have valves that release gas instead of inflating. reply ClumsyPilot 7 hours agorootparentprevA container that traps flammable gasses is called a bomb This is not usually a design goal reply hobs 6 hours agorootparentNo, a container that contains flammable gasses and then destructively allows them to escape is a bomb, one that just inflates is arguably the equivalent of a self inflating pillow. reply ClumsyPilot 2 hours agorootparentGasses create pressure A phone casing is not a pressure vessel This isn’t going to work reply chongli 9 hours agorootparentprevA valve is a one time only device to prevent an explosion in the event of thermal runaway. It’s not going to accommodate the slight expansion and contraction which are a normal part of the charge cycle for lithium batteries. If the battery is kept under mechanical pressure in order to avoid movement (without the use of an adhesive) then there is no place for the battery to expand to. That sounds like a recipe for disaster. reply chongli 9 hours agoparentprevThe rubber mat is only going to work if the battery is pressed against it with a lot of force. An adhesive will hold with no pressure at all. reply ChocolateGod 9 hours agoparentprevSize, adhesive is thinner than any kind of physical layer surrounding it. I would presume as well it's better for thermals for allowing heat away from the battery. reply chakintosh 7 hours agoparentprevMy guess is that even the tiniest movement would wear out the battery's casing. reply cupofsludge 9 hours agoparentprevDrop protection is one of the main reasons, especially when you use batteries with soft shells. reply greatgib 9 hours agoprevI find the glue thing nice but my sceptic mind let me think that it could be another great trick to fight competition with generic battery manufacturers. The glue goes with the battery, and there is probably a few patents on this magic glue, so generic battery manufacturers will be prevented to be able to add this glue to the new batteries they will want to sell. reply londons_explore 8 hours agoparentIn my experience, 3rd parties aren't worried about being identical to the original design. They'd just give you a square of double sided sticky tape to hold the battery down with, and accept that if you ever wanted to replace the battery again you'd have to destroy it to get it out. reply williamDafoe 7 hours agorootparentThe battery measurement software will never work again with any third party battery replacement. You will never know your actual battery value and the phone may shut off when there is plenty of juice available. Also Apple has software to detect if any part of the phone is replaced and will refuse repairs if any part is replaced. I was told this by the Best Buy authorized repairman as he spent 20 minutes checking my phone and I was told not to leave because they would refuse the repair if my phone had been touched! reply givinguflac 6 hours agorootparentThis is no longer true with iOS 18 parts pairing, fortunately.

I would guess that not original parts which could work get refused by the app? reply londons_explore 5 hours agorootparentI think vanishingly few parts you buy for iphones are clones these days - everything is stripped from dismantled phones. Batteries being perhaps the only exception, and even then, the battery identification chip and flex cable is original apple, just the cell is switched out. reply modernerd 9 hours agoparentpreviFixit speculated that the tape is from Tesa. Tesa says it has filed \"50+ patents for 'Debonding on Demand' adhesive tapes' … 'using various mechanisms such as temperature, electricity, laser and electromagnetic induction': https://www.tesa.com/en/about-tesa/press-insights/stories/de... So generic battery manufacturers could presumably buy the tape from Tesa, license production themselves, risk producing their own variants, or supply replacements without electrical debonding (the consumer probably doesn't care that the replacement battery doesn't use the same debonding tech their original battery used). reply echoangle 9 hours agoparentprevWould this be really necessary for a replacement battery? Are many people replacing the battery twice over the life of the phone? reply computator 5 hours agoprevThe article says that 9V batteries have fallen out of favor and links to this explanation that makes no sense to me: A 9 volt battery uses six smaller 1.5 volt cells connected in series to achieve its 9 volts. But cramming that many cells into a compact enclosure leads to less space, resulting in lower energy density and shorter lifespan. Why would a 9V battery have less energy density than 6 ordinary AA cells of 1.5V each? If you shrink down AA cells to the size and shape to pack into the rectangular 9V form factor, isn’t it exactly the same energy density as full size AA’s? reply fsh 5 hours agoparentThe encapsulation of the six small cells takes up a significant fraction of the volume of a 9V battery. reply birdman3131 5 hours agoparentprevBecause what is in a 9 volt is 6 AAAA batteries. They are smaller than even an AAA battery. Only thing I know that uses them is some of the surface drawing pens and the like. That said if you need 9 volts ask a church. I know we would gladly hand you a box of half full ones as you have to pull them out of the wireless mics before they die. And older Shure mics are 9 volt. reply computator 4 hours agorootparent> Because what is in a 9 volt is 6 AAAA But then the question would shift to: Why wouldn’t a AAAA cell have the same energy density of a AA cell? Remember that the argument is about energy density, not total energy. By the way, I think that fsh’s reply is a convincing answer: it’s the extra packaging that kills the density. reply DanTheManPR 3 hours agorootparentThe current collector also takes up relatively more volume, on top of the packaging (the wall thickness would be the same, and it's not a trivial part of the volume of small cell batteries). reply qnleigh 10 hours agoprevRandom question related to the photos of the phone's motherboard: Why does the PCB have so many holes in it? It looks very unusual. There's quite a large area with nothing but holes. reply joshp_ 9 hours agoparentIf you’re referring to the edges then those are vias. Apple has been stacking PCBs like this since the iPhone X. See step 14 in https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+X+Teardown/98975 reply grues-dinner 7 hours agoparentprevThey're not holes (though there are probably many vias there to connect to the ground planes and signal traces, but on this board the vias will be tiny and will either be under the solder resist or under the solder blobs). They're soldering lands for where the two halves of the mainboard are soldered together into a sandwich via some kind of thicker PCB interposer, which can carry the signals between the boards. This is probably an order of magnitude or more cheaper and far, far less volume-consuming and way more robust than standard mezzanine connectors. But rather tricky to repair! Look at the video in the article around 7:29. The article calls out the soldered-on heatsink plate, but it's not very clear from the pictures how it actually works in the stack-up without reference to the video. I don't know why they didn't do a better close up of both sides of that, maybe it's in a different article. reply Luc 8 hours agoparentprevI'm not quite up to date on modern electronics, but I assume they are ground-stitching vias - connections to the ground plane optimized in size and number to reduce electromagnetic interference.

Consider the moment of impact when a phone hits a hard floor: the relatively heavy battery has its force distributed over the large area of the adhesive and absorbed by it, vs very high localized forces at the screw mounts and lowest corner that will more likely result in deformity or breakage. reply elzbardico 5 hours agorootparentI have a 12 Pro Max that I bought after years as an android user. This thing is almost 4 years old, I never used a case or any kind of protection. It has fallen from tables or slipped from my hand into hard tile floor too many times for me to count. Other than some slight chipping and scratches on the metal enclosure, nothing ever broke. I just assumed by now that waterproofing was caput because of all the falls and acted accordingly keeping it far even from splashes. Last weekend we had a party here at home, the whole family and friend at pool, barbecue and beer. I am in the pool, and \"hey, someone dropped the phone in the pool, folks!\". I retrieve, and it was my phone. Other than the annoying message that it couldn't charge because the charging port was wet until it got dry, no problems, so I think waterproofing is still working. Maybe I am lucky, but I had flagship Android phones that I paid as much for as I would pay for a flagship IPhone at the time, and none of them have been so durable, either I got a cracked screen, or didn't have updates anymore, or it got progressively slower around the 2 years mark. I think the only smartphone I had in my whole life as durable as this one was my Sony P910 that I got in 2004 only to replace it with a Motorola Cliq some 5 years later. reply cesarb 4 hours agorootparentprev> Consider the moment of impact when a phone hits a hard floor In my personal experience with cell phones with removable batteries, whenever one of them hit a hard floor, all that happened was that the battery cover and the battery were ejected. You just had to put the battery and battery cover back into the phone, turn it on, and everything worked fine (perhaps with a few extra cosmetic scratches on the phone's plastic casing). reply wtallis 3 hours agorootparentThat seems pretty unlikely to be the failure mechanism for a phone that's waterproof. reply JoshTko 5 hours agoparentprevScrews will weigh a lot more than the glue and take up more volume. You'd probably need 3-4 screws to keep the largest mass item in the phone secure. Also the screws would time it take to assemble, and increase points of manufacturing failure (incorrectly installed screws). Nobody wants a replaceable battery with the compromises. For smartphones, better weatherproofing probably decreased total phone waste vs fully repairable phones simply due to water damage. reply InMice 7 hours agoprevIs it true that after a battery replace or other service the waterproof seal is compromised? Maybe they'd be able to restore this after a battery replace in some way. reply jacoblambda 5 hours agoparentGenerally yes but there are ways to repair said seal.

I fully expect Apple to release a phone in the future with a removable battery and claim it is some incredible invention of theirs when it was Apple that pushed everyone to the non removable battery in the first place. reply alphabettsy 7 hours agorootparent> Apple that pushed everyone to the non removable in the first place. How so? If removable batteries were favored by consumers it would seem the Android devices that offered them far longer would’ve continued to have them. reply sschueller 7 hours agorootparentThe \"Free Market\" showed that it is way more profitable to sell a shinny skinny phone that many replace instead of fixing after a year. Apple successfully brainwashed consumers via their brilliant ad compains that thinner and shiny is better than usability, longevity and the environment. Samsung and others copied what made more money. reply alphabettsy 3 hours agorootparentMaybe you’re right. Or maybe people aren’t brainwashed and instead are buying what they want. We in tech, myself certainly included, often have an idea of what people should want or prioritize rather than what they do. reply Arnt 8 hours agorootparentprev20 years ago we didn't have today's battery technology or capacities. AIUI Apple didn't push anyone, Apple would be happy to be the vendor with the longest battery lifetime: If you use a thin foil instead of a hard shekll and glue it into place for stability, of course you have a bit of extra space inside the battery. reply sschueller 7 hours agorootparent> Apple didn't push anyone They indirectly did. The \"Free Market\" showed that it is way more profitable to sell a shinny skinny phone that many replace instead of fixing after a year. No one cares about what is actually better for the user when more money can be made. Prime example of that is when apple removed the ESC key in favor of a touchbar. That doesn't even address the other issues such as the environment which has an even smaller interest. reply Wytwwww 7 hours agorootparent> instead of fixing after a year Back in those days phones would effectively become obsolete after a year or two anyway (from the perspective of a significant number of consumers) so I'm not sure that mattered too much. Also there were plenty of Android phones with replaceable batteries available for years, the market just didn't value that compared to the visual and technical design improvements that weren't compatible with user-replaceable batteries. Also modern batteries are generally a lot better. > Prime example of that is when apple removed the ESC key in favor of a touchbar How? Apple tried that, it failed, they recognized their mistake and reverted to normal keyboards i.e. it's an actual case of the free market working as expected and the opposite of what you're claiming. Also how do you think Apple could have made more money by adding the touchbar? Surely it's significantly more expensive than an extra row of keys... Of course it didn't stop Dell going down the same path a few years latter due to who knows what reasons... reply cryptonym 6 hours agorootparentIf it was for the \"free market\" you wouldn't have usb-c at Apple. reply Wytwwww 5 hours agorootparentSure, of course it doesn't always work. Did I imply otherwise? Especially for minor annoyances, design optimizations/flaws like USB-C, glued batteries, no side-loading etc. that don't outweigh the other advantages that specific product has over it's competitors for the overwhelming major of consumer. I personally found Apple sticking to lighting to be a minor inconvenience at most but it might have been different for other people. reply Arnt 3 hours agorootparentI have a cable that'll charge all of my battery-operated devices, except my work phone.

It was pretty clear they were moving to USB-C at some point. reply Arnt 6 hours agorootparentprevThe shop that replaces my batteries also makes a nice income from reselling one-year-old iphones. I know some people consider replacing an almost new phone unethical, no matter how it's done. That seems a bit calvinist… the iphone can be sold for about half price and the buyer will get support and upgrades for 5+ years. From my environmentalist point of view, I don't see anything to complain about. Some people pay Apple a pretty penny to get the New Shiny, other people get a well-built device at a good price with comparatively long support, Apple profits, all three are happy. reply trollied 8 hours agorootparentprevI imagine making a phone IP68 rated with a swappable battery is not trivial. reply sschueller 7 hours agorootparentAll iPhones pre the iPhone 7 were not water-resistant (IP67).

At least we know one boundary - in London, about 91k phones were stolen in 2022, of which a lot are expected to end up shipped to China [1] to be either parted out or its identifiers reflashed so that they can be re-sold. The true number is likely to be significantly higher, as not everyone is willing to go to the police and deal with the paperwork when someone snatched their older-issue phone on the subway when the police doesn't do shit anyway. And the latter part is the problem. The UK could impose inspections on outgoing parcels, say to listen for Find My BTLE beacons, and China could impose the same kind of inspections on incoming parcels or shut down the companies buying up clearly stolen property. But UK politics are too busy embroiling themselves in bullshit scandals and China most likely actively wants to contribute to the growing sense of destabilisation in Western societies, so here we are. Assume an average value of 300 € per stolen phone, and alone London's citizens and visitors experience 30 million € in damage from stolen phones alone. It's utter madness.

Not sure how user-replaceable batteries will impact that in any meaningful way, especially if the world already has \"Chinese criminal city for stolen phones\".

Let's not assume DRM will reduce theft and criminal activities. reply mschuster91 6 hours agorootparent> Do we really see an important amount of stolen batteries in lawfully owned and maintained phones to the point a DRM on batteries would benefit legit users? The stolen batteries have to end up somewhere and official spare part supplies are really expensive (unless you are a certified partner shop of a specific manufacturer of course), so it's most likely they end up distributed into the grey market. If I were to decide upon a global regulation, I'd say that spare parts have to be made available under FRAND terms (so, no more preferential pricing) and all valuable components have to be reasonably e-marked, that there be a public global registry between device identifiers and associated component identifiers, and that when someone presents a proof-of-purchase plus a police report, all components get denylisted... and when a device recognizes a change in its parts, the component's identifier is checked against the global denylist. If there is a match, the device's user gets a warning, and the owner of the original device who made the theft entry gets a notification, let police do their job then. reply fullspectrumdev 8 hours agorootparentprevMost people I know who have had a phone stolen only bothered reporting it if they had an insurance.

    "originLink": "https://grist.org/cities/london-fining-polluting-cars-more-active-kids/",
    "originBody": "Syris Valentine Climate Solutions Fellow Published Sep 17, 2024 Topic Climate + Cities Share/Republish Copy Link Republish Copy Link Email SMS Twitter Facebook Republish Reddit LinkedIn Restricting the volume of high-emitting vehicles roaming city streets carries many benefits, from clearing the air to quieting the urban din and beyond. Recognition of this simple fact has led to the proliferation of clean air zones, designated regions within a city where vehicles must meet strict pollution standards or pay a fee to operate within it. At last count, over 300 such areas had been established across Europe. In London, which boasts the largest ultra-low emissions zone in the world, a study has found a secondary benefit: Kids started walking and biking to school more. In 2018 — the year before London’s rule took effect in the center of the city, and five years before the zone encompassed its entirety — researchers at the University of Cambridge and Queen Mary University saw in the impending policy an opportunity to conduct a natural experiment. They recruited children aged 6 to 9 and their families in central London and in Luton, a small city to the north, for a multi-year study to investigate how the program might affect a child’s health. Though research focused on understanding how lightening a city’s pollution load shaped the way young lungs develop, participants completed questionnaires alongside their annual health assessments. The responses allowed researchers to glean insights into their subjects’ activity levels, mental health, and other ancillary outcomes. Help Grist raise $25,000 by September 30 to further advance our climate reporting One Time Monthly $10 $15 Other Donate In the first of many papers expected from the study, the researchers found that, a year after the ultra-low emissions zone took effect, 2 out of every 5 London students in the study had switched from “passive” to “active” ways of getting to school. So instead of being chauffeured to school by their parents, the students started walking, biking, scootering, or taking public transit. On the other hand, in Luton, which acted as a control group, 1 in 5 made the same switch to modes that got them up and active, but an equal proportion switched to passive travel. But in London’s ultra-low emissions zone, shifting to driving was rare. The implications of getting kids active, even if it’s just for their pre-class commute, are intuitive but important.

Here's How “Walking and biking and scootering to school is better for the child, better for the family, and better for the environment,” said Alison Macpherson, an epidemiologist at York University in Toronto who researches ways to protect and promote the health and safety of children. (She was not involved in the London study.) “It’s a great way for children to start their day,” she said. “You can imagine just being thrown in a car and thrown out of a car is not the most calming way.” Walking or biking to school, on the other hand, can be calming and conducive to concentration, Macpherson said, potentially even improving academic performance. But perhaps most importantly, at a time when an epidemic of childhood obesity is on the rise worldwide, walking or wheeling to and from school can get kids more active. “Physical activity in general is vital for preventing obesity,” said Christina Xiao, an epidemiologist affiliated with Cambridge University and lead author of the paper. “There’s strong evidence that shows that it prevents weight gain, and also has benefits in terms of children’s physical development and mental health as well.” What exact health outcomes manifest among the cubs involved in the study will be a subject of forthcoming studies. One will attempt to tease apart what prompted parents to stop driving their kids to school. Xiao’s results demonstrate that the change took place, exploring why was beyond the scope of her study. So, whether the parents stopped driving because the daily fee of $16.50 (12.50 British pounds) made it cost prohibitive or because, with fewer cars on the roadways, parents felt safer letting their kids make the stroll to campus (or some combination of the two) remains to be seen.

Here's How Despite the benefits that stem from emissions-control zones like this, the legal environment in the United States has erected immense obstacles to replicating something like London’s ultra-low emissions zone. The closest anyone’s come was a voluntary and short-lived zero emissions delivery zone pilot in Santa Monica, California. And then there was New York City’s ill-fated congestion pricing zone, which Governor Kathy Hochul axed before it had a chance to woo the opposition. Read Next Critics of congestion pricing often end up supporting it. Here’s why. Akielly Hu While the legislative gordian knot tied by federal laws that preempt cities from establishing low emissions zones waits to be unwound, cities across the country can improve the infrastructure that enables people to embrace walking, biking, or busing, said David Reichmuth, a senior engineer with the Union of Concerned Scientists’ clean transportation program. “We are on the way in making this switch from gasoline and diesel to electric vehicles, which is great,” Reichmuth said. “But really to meet our climate goals, we also just need to reduce the amount of driving. And these things that encourage or enable the ability for people to use active transportation are super important.” While developing pedestrian-friendly infrastructure and building out protected bike lanes can encourage a shift in how people travel, Xiao found as she assembled a review of research investigating how to promote shifts to healthier transit, people preferred the stick to the carrot. In other words, discouraging car travel was often more effective than just building infrastructure conducive to active travel. But whether it takes carrots or sticks to drive the shift, Xiao’s work adds yet more evidence to the argument that what is best for the health of the children benefits the health of communities and that of the planet as well.

Check e.g. the Dutch road design, where many kids ride bikes. This is already for decades, and has nothing to do with emission zones. But another road design can also help reducing emissions. It is about how many people can travel safe, and with big cities, you have to reduce cars to increase the amount of people that can travel safe, like bikes, walking, and public transport. Road and city design is very important for a livable city. reply danieldk 12 hours agoparentThis. Though it doesn’t stop at road design. You also have to change the regulations so that car drivers are (partially) legally responsible for accidents, even when a cyclist or pedestrian made the error. Pedestrians and cyclists are orders of magnitude more vulnerable. Putting much more of the legal burden on car drivers makes them more careful. The hard part is that you also need to build a cycling culture. Most car drivers in NL are more mindful of cyclists, because they are cyclists themselves as well. Circling back to road design. In our mid-sized Dutch city, it’s often faster to go from A to B than by bike than by car because of the excellent biking infrastructure and car-free city center. Everything is designed around cycling, some traffic lights will even give bikes a green light more often when it’s raining. reply magicalhippo 11 hours agorootparent> car drivers are (partially) legally responsible for accidents, even when a cyclist or pedestrian made the error Here in Norway the traffic law states[1] that everyone should be considerate, heedful and careful to avoid harm, and this stands above everything else. So you can indeed get (partial) blame even if the rest of the rules and regulations say you did nothing wrong. For example you can't just ram a cyclist or a pedestrian if you have the right of way, but you saw them, or should have seen them, in time to take avoiding action. Having a quick look at the NYS traffic rules[2] as a semi-random point of comparison, I'm assuming most states have something similar, it does say at the start that \"no person shall operate a vehicle in a manner that will endanger any person or property\". This seems to be similar in spirit but not quite the same. I guess I could see the NY courts could find in favor of the driver where the Norwegian courts would not, depending on how they draw the line of endangering.

What actually gets enforced is another. There is almost 0 probability of any consequences for a driver in NY who kills a cyclist, regardless of whose fault the incident was, as long as the driver doesn’t flee from the scene. The US is not really a developed country with stable rule of law in the same way most countries in Western Europe are. reply Cockbrand 7 hours agorootparentIt’s similar in Germany, where truck drivers regularly kill cyclists on right turns and get away with a four figure fine and (if the judge has a bad day) a few months of license suspension. reply magicalhippo 3 hours agorootparentHere in Norway, the one crossing lanes has the blame almost regardless. So with a bicycling lane on your inside, you have to be very, very careful. However the exact limits to that are being tested. There's just been a case in front of the supreme courts here[1], where a e-cyclist in a bike lane got run over by a truck doing a right-hand turn in a busy intersection.

Not just designing but redesigning roads when accidents happen.

None of them ever look over their shoulder before doing this. A couple weeks ago one swerved out of the bike lane so he could draft behind me. Around the same time, oncoming cyclists (a cohort) not only wandered out of the bike lane, they wandered into my lane (the oncoming traffic lane). I had to brake hard. I do not understand what is the matter with them. Brain damage? I've ridden a bike on the roads for decades, I always rode as if the cars could not see me. The people who lay out the paths must be high, as there are multiple places where the bike lane and the car lane swap sides in an X. Don't they remember those kid slot car toys that had an X piece of track for the purpose of crashing the slot cars? These aren't kids, they're adults. reply aden1ne 8 hours agorootparentDutch cyclists also do all these things. As a driver in the Netherlands, you'll quickly learn that cyclists don't stick to any rules, they will cross red lights, use the wrong lane, use the sidewalk if it saves them 2 seconds, ignore yield signs etc, and in general they will come from every direction imaginable. In a car, the onus is still on you to pay more attention. Defensive driving style is the norm - assume mistakes will be made and rules will be ignored.

That's pretty perilous. reply consteval 2 hours agorootparentprev> Is it really too much to ask cyclists to stay in the bike lane? Yes, this is like asking cars to stay in their lane. How often do you see a car outside of their lane? For me, every day. Even if everyone had perfect intentions, mistakes would still be made. What then? Everyone has been operating on the assumption mistakes would not be made. So then, your assumption was incorrect.

The point I'm making here is that a commuter cyclist is not supposed to be hyperaware or extra vigilant of the dangers they are surrounded by if they are not riding on a dedicated motor highway. In fact riding on what in the UK we call the hard shoulder on the motorway (which is illegal anyway) is way way more safer than riding in the city, even though there may be cars whizzing by at 70mph. Drivers going around town don't drive in a hyper-aware state for fear that they may be crushed by an 80 ton battle tank traveling at over 70mph for a minor lapse in judgement, or even carelessness. They even divert their attention to fiddle about on their mobile phones and their Tesla touch screens without coming to any harm. Why should a cyclist making the 15 minute 3 mile journey in to work in an urban environment be in a hyper-vigilant mental state unlike the driver? I'm not saying it is okay for cyclists to ride around in alackadaisical manner which too many of them do, but the consequences for such lapses should not be death or serious injury, especially if they are just riding around town. When a cyclist says that they find their 4 mile commute to work more stressful than the weekend rides out of town where they may do a 100 miles in day, you know there is a problem, and this is an experienced cyclist. Take a look at this clip and tell me where the young woman erred? In fact she didn't. If the driver had been ahead of her in the outer lane, checked for her presence before swinging out and waited for her to pass there would have been no danger. He just swung out from the inner lane assuming that she had noticed him, when she hadn't and had no cause to. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tnd1lCwI9Yc There is nothing to even suggest that the side of the cab had turn indicators that she would have noticed when he begin signalling only after getting alongside her - in the other lane -. The comments should tell you the kind of dangers cyclists face, and it is usually drivers most of the time. Please remember that not all cyclists by nature are as aware as you are, but they should still be able to ride their bikes just like drivers who may be even less than vigilant cyclists. reply WalterBright 47 minutes agorootparentIt isn't necessary to be hyperaware to simply look over your shoulder before wandering into a car lane. > the consequences for such lapses should not be death or serious injury Well, that's indeed what the consequences are. > He just swung out from the inner lane assuming that she had noticed him All my posts here are about the cyclist assuming that cars see them. > they should still be able to ride their bikes just like drivers Drivers are required to signal and look before changing lanes. reply nottorp 7 hours agorootparentprevFrankly the one time I visited NL I was afraid of cyclists as a pedestrian.

They allow cars to park in them, or they are too narrow, or they are blocked by construction, etc. In general far less consideration is given to the blocking of a bicycle lane than a car lane, so cyclists are often disinclined to use them. They also often just... end, at places like intersections (so it's a good idea for the cyclist to occupy a regular lane or somesuch ahead of time).

As proof, I cite this amusingly stupid 2024 Daily Mail article which notes that \"more than 30 pedestrians have been killed by cyclists over the past decade\". https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13396307/The-rise-d... reply bluGill 7 hours agorootparentprevAlmost all roads are designed in the US by a professional engineer who is legally liable for the design. we need hold them responsible for not designing good infrastructure. If politicians don't allow for something safe than their job is to say it cannot be done. reply vfclists 7 hours agorootparentprevIf it is a proper bike lane, ie a physically separated bike lane that shouldn't happen. If the speed at which you are allowed to drive at is high enough that colliding with a pedestrian or cyclist will cause them serious injury or death then the road design is wrong. Simple fact is people make errors in judgement, suffer lapses in concentration, or even develop strokes when they are on the highways. A person moving around on urban roads who suffers such an event should not suffer life-changing injuries or death from it. A safe road environment which pedestrians and cyclists are allowed to use is one in which the horizontal impact of a collision shouldn't result in serious injury or death. Death should only come from an impact which involves in serious head injury, such as the head striking the sidewalk, a heavy vehicle rolling over a person, or the case of a frail elderly person. If you get back to UK law for instance, there are 19th century laws(they still on the books) which forbade \"furious riding\" on public highways which should tell you that riding at a gallop on a public road was illegal, and would be even more so in a built up area shared with pedestrians and other horse carriages. There were no cars or even bicycles them. It is one of the laws under which cyclists can be prosecuted. Cars doing 30mph outpace galloping horses which should tell you that even at 50kph cars are driving at speeds considered dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists around them. Yet a cyclist who has no more protection than a pedestrian is supposed to share a road with 2+tonne vehicles of reinforced steel travelling at speeds far faster than a horse rider or carriage driver riding furiously. How does that make sense? I see you are Walter Bright of Zortech C++ infamy and the D language ;) reply close04 7 hours agorootparent> Cars doing 30mph outpace galloping horses > Yet a cyclist who has no more protection than a pedestrian is supposed to share a road with 2+tonne vehicles of reinforced steel travelling at speeds By speed alone, bikes are to pedestrians what cars are to bikes. A pedestrian will walk at 3-5km/h. A bike will be 5-7 times faster than that at 15-35km/h (especially since the advent of e-bikes which ignore assist requirements). Cars will be 1.5-4 times faster at 40-50km/h. Where I live I feel less safe as a pedestrian sharing the sidewalk with a bike lane than I feel on the bike sharing the street with cars (except car doors randomly opened in my path, that's what terrifies me). Not a day passes without a cyclist almost running me over when I cross on a green light, or because they try to squeeze around on the sidewalk at unsafely high speeds. When it comes to protection, the usual killer is a strong hit on the head. You don't need too much speed to cause a fall. But despite cyclists riding and implicitly hitting the ground at higher speeds, protecting the old melon with a helmet is still seen as optional (embarrassing, unfashionable, uncomfortable). Cyclists take fewer precautions than drivers while exposing themselves to higher risks than pedestrians. Can't tell you how many times I was asked why am I bothering with the helmet, \"I'll get suntan stripes\". In my circle of friends the only other one wearing a helmet for city riding (everyone wears it on the long roadbike rides) is one who has a lot of kids as is terrified of leaving them without a father. Everyone else rides as if the epitaph of \"The other guy should have paid more attention\" will give anyone consolation. reply Illotus 6 hours agorootparentIf only the speed was the big issue, but mostly it is the mass. Even with all the reckless cyclists there are very little fatalities where cyclist runs over pedestrian. Ultimately separating all groups would be the best, but heavy consequences for the heaviest road users is ultimately the solution. reply close04 3 hours agorootparent> Ultimately separating all groups would be the best, but heavy consequences for the heaviest road users is ultimately the solution. I agree that physical separation would be the best, with curbs or fences not just painted lines. As a pedestrian I would very much like to not share the sidewalk with any vehicle under any circumstances. Most people riding a vehicle on the sidewalk have no real legal constraints and the least respect I've witnessed anyone having towards the rest of the people. Pedestrians come in all shapes, sizes and ages, can't walk like robots and will easily step into the bike lane, or drop something, or a child will run around, etc. Riding at 30km/h in that environment is common and stupid. As a cyclist I'd much rather have the cycling lane on the street. Cars are more dangerous but also generally more predictable than pedestrians on a narrow sidewalk. Driving also has more regulation and enforcement. From my experience cars are a danger to me as cyclist at intersections (the dreaded right turn) and a terrifying thought when it comes to doors opening in front of me. As a driver I'd rather lose a driving lane to a cycling one than to have cyclists randomly bobbing in and out of my lane, crossing my path after crossing a red light, or after ignoring the right of way. reply steve_gh 7 hours agorootparentprevThe classic one is the number of cyclists riding along with their helmet dangling from the handlebars. reply WalterBright 6 hours agorootparentprevI've been told by a cyclist that a lot of Seattle bikers have implants for front teeth. reply vfclists 5 hours agorootparentprev> By speed alone, bikes are to pedestrians what cars are to bikes.

Cars will be 1.5-4 times faster at 40-50km/h. When it comes to collision you should remember the formula \"half m v squared\". A cyclist with his bike is usually less than 100kg which yields on impact. A collision with a pedestrian can be as bad for the cyclist as it is for pedestrian. A car will be at least 20 times heavier and twice as fast as the cyclist and will not yield on impact. The bonnet and windscreen maybe, but not the chassis after the bumper yields. > Where I live I feel less safe as a pedestrian sharing the sidewalk with a bike lane than I feel on the bike sharing the street with cars (except car doors randomly opened in my path, that's what terrifies me). Not a day passes without a cyclist almost running me over when I cross on a green light, or because they try to squeeze around on the sidewalk at unsafely high speeds. Statistically you are in far more danger of getting killed by a motor vehicle on the sidewalk or an intersection than you are by a cyclist riding the sidewalk or jumping a red light. A cyclist will usually inflict a painful bruise on collision. Even needing to be hospitalized is unlikely. Despite the blatant and often overlooked red light jumping by cyclists on busy city streets, how many fatalities occur from that behaviour, compared with those from motor vehicles? Another thing to be said. The danger from the cyclist stems primarily from the cyclists riding manners, and has more to do with the social and cultural attitudes. The danger of the motor vehicle comes from the nature of the motor vehicle itself, its mass, steel reinforcement and speed which is compounded by the attitudes of drivers. The average speed of a cyclist on urban streets is roughly that of a top level marathon runner if not less, and how scared are you by the danger a marathon runner with a metal bar held in front of them poses in a collision? > Can't tell you how many times I was asked why am I bothering with the helmet, On the matter of cyclists wearing helmets, how different is a cyclist riding on a narrow road without a sidewalk differ from pedestrian walking the same road? Does the absence of a safe sidewalk to use mean the pedestrian should wear a helmet in case they collide with a car? Helmets worn by cyclists are no different from those worn by horse-riders or in other high impact sports. They serve to protect the helmets from impacts incurred on their own account, not from collisions with motor vehicles, although they do help in the latter. reply close04 4 hours agorootparent> When it comes to collision you should remember the formula \"half m v squared\" Of course a car is faster, heavier, and more dangerous but spherical cow and all that. I've never seen a \"frontal\" collision between a pedestrian and a cyclist. And 99% of incidents I've witnessed between cars and cyclists were side swipes (the car slides into the cyclist's path and the contact is on the side) or the car flat on cutting off the cyclist who subsequently hit the side of the car like a wall. Neither are influenced much by speed. > how different is a cyclist riding on a narrow road without a sidewalk differ from pedestrian walking the same road? About 25km/h of difference. Meaning anything the cyclist does happens 7 times faster than with the pedestrian. Hit a pothole? You fly over the handle bars for some meters at 25-30km/h instead of 1.5m under pure gravity. > They serve to protect the helmets from impacts incurred on their own account Helmets are there to protect your head from an impact. They don't bother to assess blame. You're really taking this as \"but that's worse so nothing else matters\". And this makes you forget one obvious thing: everyone is a pedestrian, not everyone is a cyclist or a driver. Whether you're 8 or 80 years old you're a pedestrian so there's no excuse to endanger them because \"it could be worse\". And another big difference is street traffic is regulated, sidewalk traffic is not. A cyclist among pedestrians is a more immediate and unpredictable danger to pedestrians (sure, not deadly, a broken wrist is just really unpleasant). The bottom line is that from my personal experience looking around as mainly a pedestrian and a cyclist, this conversation withstanding, cyclists are the group of people who always expect the favorable treatment even though the cyclist who respects the law is more of a mythical creature. On the street the cars are bigger and faster so should pay more attention. On the sidewalk the same logic no longer applies, the bike is \"not that fast or heavy\", the injuries aren't \"that serious\" so the pedestrians should pay attention instead. reply richardw 12 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if the flatness of the country plays a part?

Nobody wants to lug any bike up stairs. But it's a solvable problem. Newer apartment buildings in London must provide secure cycle parking for residents and visitors. For older buildings that lack such provisions, London councils often provide secure (covered, lockable) on-street cycle storage facilities. 1 or 2 car parking spaces can be converted into parking for quite a few bikes!

Suppose you have a cyclist and driver traveling opposite (180 degrees) directions on the same road toward a 4-way stop. The driver stops, looks all ways, notes the cyclist approaching the intersection soon, and enters the intersection. The cyclist then does not stop, does not signal, and turns left (from their perspective) in front of the car which was already in the intersection. Most of the time, you'd probably need one more failure for that to result in a collision (manufacturer's defect in the accelerator, cyclist slips and falls, ...), but suppose the car did hit the cyclist and none of those other failures were the driver's fault either. In your model, how much legal blame should the driver have? reply lenlorijn 6 hours agorootparentI briefly studied law in the Netherlands and it was used as an example. Our lecturer told us that if \"A person on a bike would jump out of an airplane on a bike, land with a parachute on a highway and get hit by a car, just maybe would the car have a case.\" The reasons for this are varied. Cars are insured, bikes are not. But most importantly, in basically all traffic situations with cars and bikes the car introduces the danger and should thus bear the responsibility of any accidents.

I'm scared to hell from cyclists in London, because they are inconsiderate and extremely unpredictable. Try rolling up to a major 4 lane intersection, and you are going to have cyclists materializing out of thin air on both sides. Furthermore, visibility on UK roads is very poor. You often have very tall hedges lining streets, which means you can't see more than a few meters until the very last moment. You'd need to basically rip up the entire city and rebuild it from scratch, and then replace all the inhabitants with rational actors. It's simply not going to happen otherwise. reply vfclists 7 hours agorootparent> and you are going to have cyclists materializing out of thin air on both sides. It is called filtering and it is totally legal in the UK. It should be no problem if you are patient and allow the cyclists to ride off first when the lights go green. In a properly designed system the green light should come on for the cyclists first, then the larger vehicles can follow on after that. reply short_sells_poo 6 hours agorootparentAh yes, thanks for mansplaining that to me. I was totally unaware that the concept of filtering exists - particularly as a motorbike rider of 20 years... With that out of the way, like all things, filtering works when all participants are careful. Motorbikes are actually quite a bit easier to deal with (as a car driver), because a) they can be heard and b) they are quite a bit bulkier. Even as a motorbike rider, it's not cars that I'm most afraid of, but cyclists. Again, this is not about arguing against being careful - on the contrary. I'd like the cyclists to exercise just as much care as they are asking others to exercise. It's basic self preservation. What good is it to a dead cyclist that it was the truck driver's fault? reply arghwhat 10 hours agoparentprevYes, but until the ICE is gone, emissions and car flow is linked. An ultra-low emission-zone limits car flow by only allowing a smaller subset of cars to pass. A restriction on car flow reduces emission by allowing fewer emitters. A low-emission zone can be a way to gradually reduce car traffic, and at the end it may be low enough that you can limit car traffic to residents only, or even no one at all. reply p0w3n3d 9 hours agorootparentSorry but it's simply to put the rich in power to drive their new EV SUVs while limiting people with less money from driving their own car.

That doesn't change the substance of your point, though. Very few people living in Z1 or Z2 run a car unless they're rich: parking is extremely difficult and public transport is so good that there are very few reasons to want one unless you're regularly leaving London. reply INTPenis 9 hours agoparentprevBeing from Sweden that is how I measured safety for a large part of my adult life. How safe I felt in a new area directly depended on how far I could walk with my dog without crossing car traffic. In Malmö for example I could walk for 2 hours and only cross 2 roads. Because the bicycle network is so developed they have underpasses for bikes that us pedestrians can use. Then I lived in the balkans and saw the stark contrast. But there's no point in shoving this down American's throats because their whole country is far too vast for European design. They need to fill it up with people for a few hundred years like Europe before they will be forced to implement good street design. reply ninalanyon 8 hours agorootparent> their whole country is far too vast for European design. That's not really true though. There is no particular reason to think of the vast almost empty spaces when thinking about urban and suburban spaces. There are plenty of walkable towns in the US, the problem is that there are vastly more towns that are not. I spent quite a lot of time in Raleigh NC and the surroundings in the 1990s and early 2000s and walked and cycled everywhere. There were a lot more roads to cross than in Malmö of course but it was still quite reasonable. One need not be forced to implement good urban design, one merely needs to want it. And I would also say that most towns in Sweden are not really very typical of European towns, even Norway next (where I live) is different. Sweden has a lot more space available than most European countries and in fact has an average population density (25/km2) lower than that of the US (33/km2). reply ginko 8 hours agorootparentprev>Because the bicycle network is so developed they have underpasses for bikes that us pedestrians can use.

That's very much apples to oranges. Stricter low-emission zones result in fewer cars in the short term (because some subset of the existing cars no longer enter). In the longer term they might result in fewer cars because the initial car reduction brings other benefits (such as safer cycling/playing/whatevering and reduced congestion which benefits public transport). reply pif 7 hours agoparentprev> It is about how many people can travel safe This is not false, but it isn't either completely true!

The metric I care about more, as a users of a car, bike, rental scooter, bus, and subway, is the variance in door-to-door time. If it takes less 80% of the time but 20% of the time I'm 20 minutes late, I won't use public transport.

It's not the lack of helmets by itself that's a problem; it's the combination with high-speed electric bicycles, and their primarily being used by the elderly, that is causing deaths. Yes, old people falling and sustaining heavy injuries that they wouldn't have had with a helmet is a problem, but not one that (I think) can be solved by street design. If you see that in 2018, the Netherlands had 4.7 deaths per billion vehicle kms, vs. the US's 6.9, and then consider that it's a very densely populated country where lots of traffic intersects, then I would count that as a big success. reply mdrzn 6 hours agorootparentprevThis comment is a great example on how to \"lie\" with statistics.

You cannot protect a cyclist in a car collision using a helmet, the solution is separate infra? Other than that you have positive outcomes of increased general health. reply soomerons 5 hours agorootparentoff course you can. And it's been proven over and over. Are you really trying to argue that wearing a helmet is not safer than not wearing one? Not all car and cyclist collisions are high speed, big impacts, in fact, statistically speaking, most of them in the netherlands are slow speed knocks, cyclist, get bumped, when a car tries to squeeze by, and the cyclist falls and hits their head on the concrete or whatever else is close by. And then there are all the cyclist against cyclist collisions, someone gets knocked off, and smacks their head against the curb. But I guess the dutch way of saying \"we are dutch and are born on a bicycle and know how to cycle\", (and they really actually don't), is easier to say than, looking at the actual stats, and seeing they are wrong. reply aqme28 5 hours agorootparentWhat stats are you referring to?

It's just that the Dutch stats show that proper infrastructure is even more important, and cyclists are less of a danger to other traffic participants than people in cars, which is why there's no stronger push for making people wear helmets — it might cause them to stop cycling. At an individual level, for sure, wear helmets, but as a society, there are better things to focus on when it comes to traffic safety.)

It cuts across every demographic. Under 25k household income - a good 40-50% of households have a car. Housing estates - tons of cars. Well off - almost everyone. https://content.tfl.gov.uk/technical-note-12-how-many-cars-a... It mostly comes down to whether someone has a need (e.g. has children, fairly mobile in their job, has family outside of town, enjoys going on road trips etc) and actually wants to pay for it rather than anything else. In addition to that, a bunch of stuff happened basically at the same time. We got ULEZ, we got a ton of low traffic neighbourhoods (e.g. streets where cars are not allowed at certain times of day regardless of emissions), we had COVID meaning that habits and demographics changed, we had Brexit which probably had some minor effect, etc. All of that happened within about 5 years and I don't think you can isolate any of them. I don't really find most discussions about it interesting as a result of all of the above - it usually just ends up with someone trying to find evidence for their pre-existing position rather than anything that feels actually scientific, unfortunately. reply reedf1 10 hours agoparentMy 2c as a local: I live in zone 2 and at least anecdotally I am in disagreement with your point here. So I looked it up in your link from TfL - \"There are 2.56m cars licensed in London. This equates to an average of 0.3 cars per adult. In total, 46 per cent of households do not have a car, 40 per cent have one car and 12 per cent have two or more cars, with very few households owning more than two cars.\" This is the same as your stated numbers, but framed in a substantially different way. In addition I suspect this is dominated by the outer boroughs; maybe one or two of my 20+ coworkers who live in zones 1-3 have a car, it's more once you get z4+. reply philipwhiuk 10 hours agorootparentBy Zone 5 you're basically almost back to the world of infrequent bus services and out-of-town supermarkets so it's a lot more understandable why you need a car. reply short_sells_poo 8 hours agorootparentprevAnecdotal sample from my village just outside Zone 6 (but inside M25): every single one of my neighbours has 2 cars, some have 3 (or 4). Basically every adult or young-adult member of the household who has to go somewhere on their own has a car. You could argue that they don't need that many, but take it this way: the reliability of the UK train network has become absolutely disgraceful. They are either on strike, or if they are not striking, then they are doing engineering works, and if neither of those are happening, then there is a major disruption. This means that in the last 6 months, I think there have been 2-3 weeks perhaps where the connection into London was reliable.

To facilitate that, the taxpayer through the ULEZ scrappage scheme offered £2,000 even if the car was not worth anything close to that value.

Put another way: Where I live in Outer London, most housing apart from a handful of conversions and some council blocks until recently started at 3-bedroom houses with gardens. There are now a few large blocks targeting renters that include smaller flats by the station, but they're all marketed as luxury flats. A walk further out and the 5+ bedroom houses and mansions lining private sports grounds and expensive private schools start.

Outer and anti-ULEZ right-wing areas - Bexley, Romford, Welling, Uxbridge - might be more affluent than deprived inner-city parts, but they're a lot less affluent (as well as far less educated) than the professional-class areas of the inner city, which these days seems to span all the way from Muswell Hill down to Tooting. Tory/rightwing votes used to be a thing for rich people who wanted to keep their winnings for themselves, pay less tax and/or encourage the less successful to work harder and pull themselves up by their bootstraps.

Many suburbs don’t have sidewalks, and the sprawl often means a substantial walk. That leads to an arms race of sorts: people who think it’s too dangerous drive, making it more dangerous for everyone else and conditioning everyone to think a distance greater than the walk from the parking lot is an unreasonable level of physical exertion.

How very surprising!” reply Mvandenbergh 10 hours agoprevThis is a terrible article, written by someone who is either dishonest or doesn't know what they're talking about and has never been to London, covering a paper that appears to be reasonably well done but has some serious limitations. The study is here: https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-024... The data was collected during the 2018/2019 academic year and then during the 2019/2020 academic year (but before the Covid school closures). First, some context: -The original ULEZ, which the referenced study looked at covers central London and should not be confused with the much larger recently expanded ULEZ which covers the whole city. Nor should it be confused with the much smaller congestion charging zone or the larger and older Low Emission Zone which covers freight vehicles. -The ULEZ rules are designed around penalising the driving of the oldest and most polluting vehicles only. In 2019 this was 80% of cars, the expanded ULEZ has overall vehicle compliance of 95%+. As as result of the second point, it would not be expected that it would have a substantial effect on the number of vehicle journeys since 80% of passenger cars in the zone were already compliant anyway, therefore any effect at all is actually surprising. The paper notes a drop of 9% in total vehicle counts. \"Four in 10 London children stopped driving and started walking to school a year after the city's clean air zone went into effect.\" This little quote heads the article. It seems like quite a result, right? It isn't. Let's look at the baselines here, something which immediately anyone who lives in London would be suspicious about because like me their first question would be: \"who was driving their kids to school in central London in 2019? Are there enough for there to be four in ten at baseline to switch?\". It turns out not many people do, and no. Let's look at table 2 from the paper: (there were about 1000 kids in both the Luton and London samples) At baseline, 856 kids in London travelled using active modes and 105 using inactive modes In Luton that was 599 and 364 respectively So first, we can say that \"four in ten children\" has to be interpreted pretty carefully here since 85% of kids were already walking to school (note that if they just took the bus the whole way this also counted as walking). At most, we must be talking about changes to the minority of kids who weren't using active travel before, in other words maybe it's that \"Four in 10 London children (of the minority who were being driven) started walking to school. But, if we look at the changes, that doesn't quite stack up either. In London: 47 kids switched from active to inactive (all measured based on travel \"today\" and in many cases there will be variation in modes across days) 44 switched from inactive to active 61 inactive/inactive 809 active/active In Luton: 124 active/inactive 74 inactive/active 290 inactive/inactive 475 active/active It doesn't look like, ignoring the Luton control for the moment, there was any modal shift at all for London! Luton has proportionally shifted away from active transport and only in relative terms to the control has there been a modal shift. This is already a much less positive message. \"Kids in general less likely to walk to school, except in London where (potentially due to a low emissions zone) their behaviour didn't change.\" Where's my four in 10 gone? The \"four in 10\" comes from the 44 kids who were inactive in the first sample but active in the second (out of 105 total inactive in first sample). Of course that is a much larger % of children from that group who switched in that direction than the 47 who switched the other way from much larger number of first sample actives. If your transition probabilities from A to B are much higher than B to A, but B is much larger group, you can end up in this situation here where you have impressive sounding % changes which nonetheless mean nothing and don't change the population behaviour at all. It's a very fine thing, no doubt, to run multilevel binomial logistic regression models on data and come up with statistically significant odds ratios but I don't think these results remotely justify the news article headline and subhead. reply throwaway2037 6 hours agoparentWow.

This article seems to be both making an extremely obvious observation (that the introduction of ULEZ is forcing poor families to get around the city in alternative ways) and missing the fact that such decisions come with both positives and negatives which need to be weighed up. If we simply want to implement policies to benefit children's health then we'd probably be better off banning junk food. But we don't do that because we understand that there are trade-offs.

For the last couple of years since the low emission zone was implemented he's had to take a 30 min detour to get to work meaning it's taking him 1.30 hours to get to work adding an hour to his total daily commute and 50% to his weekly fuel bill and increasing his emissions by 50%. While he could just about afford getting a petrol car, this isn't exactly a cheap purchase for someone who only makes £25,000... This isn't some media conspiracy. It's been making my dad's life hell for the last two years now. My understanding is that working class people who use vans for work are also getting screwed by this. If you want to reduce the number of polluting vehicles in the city then ban non-essential cars, buses, vans and lorries.

Jessica Sep 22, 2024 52 Share this post The Elite's War on Remote Work Has Nothing to Do with Productivity www.the-sentinel-intelligence.com Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 10 Share Arquimedes Every year, CEOs demand more employees return to the office. Mainstream news outlets run stories calling remote workers lazy. They say it’s about productivity. It’s not. David Graeber's book on bullshit jobs blew the myth of office productivity wide open several years ago. The elites have been promising us shorter work weeks for more than a century now. We have the technology to make it happen. As we speak, they're bragging about their new AI minions. One of the most recent articles bashing remote work tries to make it sound audacious that remote employees would dare to do household chores or use the bathroom while attending otherwise pointless, tedious zoom meetings. Look, Karen and Dwight don’t deserve your full attention if your boss is going to give them 15 minutes to complain about the office furniture, do they?’ Of course, that article even admits that onsite employees aren’t more productive. They just find different ways to “goof off,” like shopping online or scrolling their phones. The real ire seems to stem from envy, that remote workers are capable of meeting their responsibilities while also doing healthy things and taking care of themselves, like taking a walk in the middle of the day or (gasp) even a nap. Ironically, wellness articles have been telling bosses to let their employees take walks or naps in the middle of the day for almost 20 years. Now that they’re actually doing it… That’s bad? Many of us have embraced remote work because it liberates us from distractions and unproductive meetings, often hailed as the cornerstones of “office culture.” It especially benefits those of us on the spectrum, who need a quiet place where we can focus. A recent Stanford study found that remote or hybrid workers are just as productive, more content, and less likely to quit. A review of evidence in The Economist concurs. When remote work hurts productivity, it’s because companies don’t give their employees the resources they need, and in some cases they put obstacles in their way. They want it to fail. Many news outlets finally came clean last year and reported that a big chunk of companies might simply be using office return mandates as an excuse to lay off employees and “restructure” their workforce. So, what's really going on? It’s about real estate. There's an office real estate apocalypse unfolding. Corporate landlords currently hold $1.2 trillion in loans on office towers all over the country. In some cases, these are the same jerks who've been buying up all the houses and driving up prices on residential real estate, too. When the pandemic hit, these landlords did something even dumber. As The Financial Times states, they took advantage of “nearly free money” from the Federal Reserve to buy up “trophy office buildings.” Now that everyone is embracing remote work, they can’t lease that office space to anyone. They have a bunch of zombie office towers. They can’t do anything with them. Some of these commercial real estate owners are trying to turn their empty buildings into apartments and restaurants, but it’s an expensive overhaul. Not every zombie office building makes a great apartment. They’re stuck. Anywhere from 12 to 20 percent of office space remains vacant. It’s worse than the 2008 recession. If these landlords can’t find a way to make money off their corporate real estate soon, they’re going to start defaulting on their loans. The landlords will go bankrupt, and banks will wind up with giant office towers they can’t sell. More than $1 trillion will go poof. According to a piece in the Harvard Business Review, the $1 trillion will come due between now and 2026. That explains why CEOs keep making these edicts, and newspapers keep trying to trash remote work. As the piece explains, “The damage could metastasize into a full-blown financial crisis if scores or even hundreds of small and midsize commercial banks fail simultaneously.” Elites bought up these trophy office towers based on the bad assumption that workers would rush back to offices. They also didn’t factor in skyrocketing energy costs or labor shortages, all driven by their own mistakes. You see, millions of workers are dead or disabled by the virus they wanted to ignore. Delinquency rates have already started going up. The Federal Reserve’s misguided war on inflation has made everything even worse over the last couple of years. By raising interest rates, they’ve motivated more companies to ditch their office leases. Now commercial real estate is in a death spiral that could tank the economy (again). The Fed has started to cut interest rates. According to another recent piece in Fortune, that’s not going to stop the crash. The fears went away during the first part of 2024 because of the frenzy over AI investing. Now they’re coming back. A piece in Forbes is predicting a major collapse for the same reasons, citing a Columbia University economist who foresees a minimum wipeout of $644 billion, and possibly up to $1.5 trillion. Even if it doesn’t trigger a total meltdown, it’s going to be painful. Rich people hate losing money. There’s more bad news. Major cities have spent the last several decades catering to these corporate landlords. Now their entire downtowns rely on workers for commerce. We’re talking about all those restaurants and coffee shops that serve breakfast and lunch to white-collar workers, and all the bars where people used to go and complain about work before they spent an hour commuting home. These cities also depend on property taxes from overpriced commercial real estate. When nobody wants those buildings, their value plummets. New York alone has lost $453 billion in office real estate. Across the U.S., office buildings have shed anywhere from 40 to 80 percent of their value. Talk to anyone who works in commercial real estate. Even well into 2024, office buildings in major cities are half empty. So, we have a problem. Once again, the elite have gotten themselves into big trouble. They want the rest of us to bail them out. If they don't want our tax money, they want us to give up our freedom and autonomy. They want us to sacrifice ourselves on the altar of capitalism to protect their fortunes. They don't care how productive we are. They don't care how creative we are. They definitely don't care about our health. They only care about one thing, forcing warm bodies back into office buildings to stop the commercial real estate apocalypse. If they can’t fill those zombie towers, they have to trim their budgets with stealth layoffs. That's it.

    "commentBody": "The war on remote work has nothing to do with productivity (the-sentinel-intelligence.com)248 points by kruuuder 13 hours agohidepastfavorite255 comments klodolph 12 hours agoI’ve heard this argument before and I don’t buy it. By that, I mean it may be true (that people want to prop up real estate prices), but I don’t think that this is enough of an explanation. If it were just about real estate, then Amazon would not be calling for 5 days a week return-to-office. I don’t think real estate interests are powerful enough to push Amazon around and I don’t think they’re entrenched enough in Amazon leadership to make it happen. As an alternative contributing factor, I suggest that Amazon wants employee attrition, and five day return-to-office is a convenient tool for that. One of the things that makes return-to-office such a convenient tool for employee attrition is that it’s a deniable tool. In cities like New York, it’s pretty clear that commercial real estate interests are in bed with the city government. I just don’t think that real estate has enough power to push through a return-to-office agenda at the scale that we’re seeing. Don’t get me wrong, I think commercial real estate interests have a ton of influence. I just don’t think it’s enough influence to explain RTO at this scale (but it can explain RTO policies in some specific cases). reply kitsune_ 12 hours agoparentMy theory, which is kind of informed by what I saw it play out in my company: The reason is a psychological one. Most leaders derive their power from in-person interactions. Remote and video calls severely impact that. Those leaders also love having an audience that needs to listen to them whenever they are in the room and the lack of that kind of feedback and adulation shellshocked a lot of them. reply slg 12 hours agorootparentIt feels a lot worse to deliver a lame joke at the start of an all hands meeting to a bunch of muted zoom windows with their cameras off. How much of the return to office is leaders wanting that polite chuckle from that captured audience back? I'm barely being facetious. \"That polite chuckle\" is really a stand in for all the soft power they wield in person that evaporates with WFH. They have lost a degree of control and power, it is basic human nature to look for a way to claw that back. reply JohnBooty 6 hours agorootparent\"That polite chuckle\" is really a stand in for all the soft power they wield in person that evaporates with WFH. They have lost a degree of control and power, it is basic human nature to look for a way to claw that back. That's an interesting angle and I really mean \"interesting\" in the literal sense. My hunch is that the corporate executive's thirst for power generally works a little differently than that, in ways I find it difficult to express. Why do people want those executive jobs? Quite honestly I don't feel the primary appeal for them lies in the minutia of those in-person interactions -- the polite chuckles and such. I do not think they typically care about Cubicle Slave #58332 enough to be gratified when they (either individually, or in aggregate) give up that polite chuckle for an unfunny joke. For them, that would be like caring about whether or not an insect laughed at their jokes -- and caring about your token genuflections, about your small personal humiliations, is still caring. So what is the appeal for them? Well, money and status, occasionally with some loyalty and/or core belief in the company added to the mix. reply tankenmate 10 hours agorootparentprevTo follow on from your premise; I suspect it comes from a misunderstanding of authority. In my experience most leaders have a visceral understanding of authority, but not an actual understanding. Authority comes from submission; anything you submit to has authority over you. The corollary of course is that the submissive person has the power in the relationship; at any time they can say I don't want this any more. Obviously in a work context this means quitting. So if a leader wants, requires, needs, is addicted to that feeling that people are submitting to them, then things will eventually go downhill as in the end the only people who will work for them will be \"yes men\". reply csomar 10 hours agorootparentprevI am not sure why not more people are not considering that to be the reason. In my last job, it actually made sense to have an in-office audience and yet management was opposed to it due to costs. When we had a round meeting, it kinda transpired to me that upper-management didn't really like to interact with the tech team much. They had a liaison person and that was as much as they wanted to interact with tech people. reply slippy 10 hours agorootparentprevAlas, it's a nuclear option. People are going to stay or leave based on random criteria. Your company is going to be left with various deficits and it will take a long while to sort out the hiring mess. This feels more like it's about power. Those with the power leave, likely to competitors. reply chairmansteve 1 hour agorootparentThe good people always have other options. The bad ones don't. Immediate supervisors usually know who is good and should be empowered to decide who can WFH. And who they don't want to lose. Diktats from god are a sign of a disfunctional org. reply close04 10 hours agorootparentprevI think we're looking for the unified theory of RTO. Soft power is definitely one of them. But every company and group of people have their own mix of reasons. I bet Amazon's exercise is a hidden layoff process. Other companies probably want to get their money's worth from the office buildings. The management of others wants to see the army of smiling minions that report to them. Others want to see people in the office for control (make sure they're not enjoying too long breaks, or working from the beach, or working double jobs in parallel, etc.). And some believe that people will interact better, easier if they're in physical proximity. Or a mix of this even between managers from the same company. And sometimes I think some cities push employers to get people back in office because they have no better idea how to keep those centers of activity vibrant, alive, and contributing financially. I remember reading some city authorities complaining that RTO means the death of the city center and the businesses tied to it. I don't see why there would be one reason to rule them all. reply clumsysmurf 10 hours agorootparentprevThe soft power aspect of jokes, who laughs at what, and when is fascinating. There is even some research on it: From https://www.thehrobserver.com/indepth/laughing-at-the-bosss-... >You mentioned that humour and power is intertwined – what is the social impact of this? >If a boss is trying to be funny, they are automatically trying to get a response, so the use of humour is never neutral or irrelevant. People have a split second to decide whether or not to fake a laugh, or even how much to laugh – trying to figure out if the boss thinks a particular joke is a little funny or a lot funny. At the same time, they are trying to decide what the consequences of not laughing might be. original paper https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2022.0195 reply sulandor 10 hours agorootparentprevnew rituals for video-calls and remote interactions are being evaluated by gamers and nerds for decades now, but the application to diversely motivated workers is difficult reply RestlessMind 1 hour agorootparentprevIn addition to what you mentioned, most of today's corporate leaders rose through the ranks in 2010's or even before. They have thrived in offices and hence have habits and cultural norms more suitable for in-office work. No wonder they think offices are a better setup. In addition, a lot of people facing functions (Sales, Management etc) were done in person. There might be a world where those are possible on Zoom, but the workforce has to be trained for that. Why should a company train their 35+ management stack about online people management, when they can just force the RTO? reply agumonkey 12 hours agorootparentprevI really wonder if there's a tribal / psychological effect of this kind and if not having to play the submissive / adoration dance made people more interested in practical information passing. Saying this because a few articles mentioned that some full remote teams were much much more effective at actual work, spreading data so that everybody could find solutions or continue work right away. reply wiz21c 12 hours agorootparentprevAnd that goes up to every levels of the hierarchy. It's definitely about power and control. I'd add that it is also a question of geography. The work place is the place where power exists. And so having you inside the company's walls means you are under control. reply bjornsing 10 hours agorootparentYeah I think this is a huge part of the primitive gratification many people get from workplace “power”. You can often get a glimpse of it in-between the lines in more charged situations: some people essentially have a mental model where they are the sovereign of the office space, or speaks directly for the sovereign. It can get very interesting when that model meets reality (where they are in fact not the sovereign, but just another loyal subject under the law of the land). reply kwar13 11 hours agorootparentprevExactly this. When I was a junior investment banker we worked brutal hours, often 80-90 hours a week with most days ending at 1-2am. Yet the head of investment banking insisted we always make it to his Monday 8am meeting since he wanted a bigger crowd when he talked. Going from a Sunday all-nighter into this was quite painful. reply Eddy_Viscosity2 7 hours agorootparentOff topic question, but what do investment bankers even do for all those hours every week? reply Propelloni 10 hours agorootparentprevObviously this is a multi-causal issue. RTO policies spring up for a variety of reasons, often a mix. All those negative narratives sure have some founding in reality, but maybe you can think of benevolent reasons why companies call for RTO? Here is an example. Ms. Follett [1] made a good case a century ago that value is not created by people but between people. So you need interaction to add value -- something companies are imminently interested in, even if some employees are not. Some interactions, actually anything with more than 3-4 participants, break down over Teams and require face-to-face contact to be effective. Cutting everything down to 4 participants is to put the tool above the people and, to add insult to injury, will create a new pyramid of management levels, which we chucked for good reasons in the last century. So just get together in the office, which you have anyway to set up your football table. Does this mandate a 5-day RTO policy? No, but it shows that there is at least one good reason to get into the office once or twice a week. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Parker_Follett reply miki123211 9 hours agorootparentAll these \"face-to-face meetings are better\" arguments are predicated on the fact that all your teammates are on the same campus. That is just no longer true in a lot of companies these days. Even with mandatory, 5-day-per-week RTO, you may have 2 team members in the US, 2 in Europe and one in Bangalore, all in their respective offices in their respective timezones. The meetings are still happening over Zoom. reply Propelloni 3 hours agorootparent> All these \"face-to-face meetings are better\" arguments are predicated on the fact that all your teammates are on the same campus. True. People need to be at least in the general vicinity, yes. > you may have 2 team members in the US, 2 in Europe and one in Bangalore, all in their respective offices in their respective timezones Also true, but even before COVID and 24/7 home office we knew that this kind of team setup sucks and we complained -- loudly -- whenever we had to work this way. And while technology improved the main reasons why we complained haven't changed. In short, that's not an argument for or against RTO, it is one against bad work organization. reply kurthr 3 hours agorootparentprevI agree with the basis of this, but it assumes that a significant portion of people derive their influence and motivation by in-person interaction. Once you take that at face value, there are going to be things you can get done with that tool, that you can't otherwise. It's not a requirement for 5 day RTW, but it also speaks to the challenge of remote only work. There's a reason people do LAN parties even when you have to lug your rig around, and it's not just food and drink. reply aeze 3 hours agorootparentnostalgia? reply EoinB 12 hours agorootparentprevThis is the conclusion I have come to as well. So much of what happens in society can be best explained (imo) by human psychology and our relationship with ego, desire, perceived success etc. reply steve1977 11 hours agorootparentprevTotally agree. Add to that the fact that in many cases, businesses ran fine without the in-person interactions of these managers… which could mean that we actually don’t need them, the managers I mean. And they are very scared of that. reply JohnFen 3 hours agorootparentprev> Most leaders derive their power from in-person interactions. I think that this is the heart of the issue. Everything else is relatively meaningless. reply sulandor 11 hours agorootparentprevthou, leaders are more dependent on it, imho it impacts all human interaction and mostly for the worse. we need to adjust our recipe/theory for coherent/functional constellations of humans unless heightened denial of humanity is in our collective interest reply bjornsing 12 hours agoparentprevI talked to an acquaintance who ran a startup that went remote during the pandemic. His view was that the self-motivated conscientious employees were just as productive remote as they were in the office, if not more. The problem was that when they left the office the people in the office became less productive. To me that makes a lot of sense and aligns well with my experience of office life. Some people depend on seeing others around them working, or they can’t get much done. I asked him if he thought it was fair that his self-motivated employees essentially had to provide this service for free to the company, and spend time commuting to do it. Don’t think he could fully grasp the question, didn’t see a problem with that at all. (This was in Sweden, which has a more collectivist work culture than the US.) EDIT: But to be honest I think there might be more truth to @kitsune_’s sibling comment. reply mgh95 11 hours agorootparentI think a lot of this comes down to perception of ROI for management. If the employment market is giving you qualified candidates at the price you seek in-office, why would you expose yourself to risk? I'm in this situation now where I'm hiring early employees and looking to grow, and about 90% of the decisions is how well can I derisk this hire. I don't need elite developers; I need competent, conscientious \"75%\" developers. It doesn't make sense to spend time interviewing, onboarding, and hiring, just to expose myself to another risk factor. Your friend was probably not thinking \"fair\" or \"unfair\", rather, what is the employment market bringing him. reply swiftcoder 10 hours agorootparent> If the employment market is giving you qualified candidates at the price you seek in-office Is the employment market actually giving you that? Anecdotally, I knew a handful of FAANG engineers with 10+ years experience who had gone full remote before the pandemic, and dozens more during/since. Those are the creme-de-la-creme of the employment market, and they are all hanging out at startups who are willing to play ball on full remote, to get access to talent they otherwise couldn't remotely afford... reply consteval 5 hours agorootparent> Is the employment market actually giving you that? Yes, because the employment market is not a free market. You can find (virtually) any employees your heart desires, because workers are highly motivated to not die. In addition, they have no bargaining power, meaning they take what they can get. They don't have visibility either - hiring is a perfect black box to them. The scales are not only not balanced, they're almost completely tipped. This is why companies can pay below market and still get a constant supply of (shitty) employees. If you simply lower your standards, you can get infinite employees. They could hire children if they wanted, and it would be easy. They could pay 50 cents an hour if they wanted. Luckily, the laws prevent this - but it's most certainly NOT an issue of demand. There's a high demand among children to work and there's a high demand among laborers to work for poverty wages. reply mgh95 10 hours agorootparentprev> Is the employment market actually giving you that? Yes. Not all applications benefit from FAANG experience. There is a lot of work to be done that pays in the 130-200 range that isn't necessarily cutting edge. I should add, benefits are excellent (major medical) and it's a private office. > Anecdotally, I knew a handful of FAANG engineers with 10+ years experience who had gone full remote before the pandemic, and dozens more during/since.

I can believe it. Sometimes, you just need technical excellence to bring a product to market, otherwise you fail. But other times, you can simply apply well understood paradigms to well understood markets and have excellent financial returns. It's the difference between an excellent business and an excellent product. When you have a choice, choose the excellent business. reply bjornsing 11 hours agorootparentprev> Your friend was probably not thinking \"fair\" or \"unfair\", rather, what is the employment market bringing him. In a relatively free labor market (like e.g. California’s) that perspective is fine with me, because you probably have to pay more for the conscientious “75%” developers you need. But Sweden has a heavily regulated and unionized labor market where differences in pay are typically motivated by the collectively agreed “fairness”. I can assure you that your argument would have been just as foreign for my acquaintance. reply mgh95 11 hours agorootparentIf I'm being totally honest, I am not sure it would be totally foreign. Entrepreneurship in Sweden (at least according to a quick google search) is relatively rare. Most of the entrepreneurs coming from the nordics I have interacted with have been decidedly less social contract oriented than even I am to the point where they seem almost like Gordon Gekko caricatures as though they are attempting to behave in a manner they think someone attempting to operate in a market-driven context would act. I am not sure that this argument would be totally foreign to your acquaintance, at least based upon the entrepreneurs coming from that region of the world in the USA. reply bjornsing 10 hours agorootparent> If I'm being totally honest, I am not sure it would be totally foreign.

If I wanted to stretch my budget, I would go to LATAM. Developers marketing themselves as \"go remote, stretch your budget further\" will see just how far it can stretch. I'm hiring in the USA because my business requires knowledge of the US business environment (benefits management) and require in-person because it's easier to prevent mistakes which can attract the ire of regulators when you are small and don't have formal review processes. > I wanted to reply to your comment re:Nordics but it seems it reached a limit to comment depth, your experiences are probably related to interacting with a biased sample, a quick google tells me that on average only a couple hundred Swedes immigrate to the US per year. Possible, and I didn't interact with only Swedes; I interacted with mostly Norwegians and a few Swedes, so I may be generalizing somewhat. But it really seemed like there was a collective sense of \"I need to act as ruthless as possible to run a business here\". I don't think American business customs are well understood in practical application. reply benterix 10 hours agorootparentprevThat's kind of normal so I only pick up companies that offer remote only positions with no strings attached. reply mgh95 10 hours agorootparentThat's fine? It's a market. Work for whoever is offering mutually agreeable terms for as long as that remains the case. reply benterix 6 hours agorootparentOf course. That basically divides the market into 3 segments: (1) companies that fully enforce RTO, (2) those that partly enforce RTO (\"hybrid\"), and (3) those that give you a choice - full WFH or coming to the office when you wish. Based on what I observe in my niche, (3) have an enormous advantage when it comes to both hiring and maintaining senior talent. reply benterix 10 hours agorootparentprev> Don’t think he could fully grasp the question, didn’t see a problem with that at all.

It seems that office buildings are selling at a discount to what they were a few years ago. But I suspect that many buildings have not yet changed hands, and thus have debt based on their old values. I wonder how many underwater office buildings there are in the US right now, and who owns their commercial paper? Edit: looks like about half of all office mortgages are underwater. Welp, there it is. reply HeatrayEnjoyer 11 hours agorootparentBut the mortgage is fixed. Bringing people back in won't change the contract. reply jaggederest 11 hours agorootparentThe value of the building is as a multiplier of the net operating income, that's what a cap rate is. If people come back in and companies expand and renew their leases, that increases the value of the building and reduces the capital needed to recapitalize the mortgage. And, bringing people back in, especially in the context of e.g. Amazon with thousand of workers, also has lots of knock on effects on other businesses, and there are plenty of copycats who follow the big seven tech companies. reply rblatz 12 hours agoparentprevI’ve long suspected it’s a PR campaign/propaganda and talking points aimed directly at the c suite class.

My impression of US (and by extension) global finance state of things is, pension funds are holding the society hostage, preventing positive changes in some sectors of the economy, real estate being particularly blatant case. \"Propping up those real estate values\", in general, works for the benefits of \"haves\" at the expense of hoping to have when they get older - i.e. it works against the interest of younger generations. reply chii 12 hours agorootparentprev> shouldn't it be everyone's interest to actually keep showing up to prop up those real estate values? not if you're getting a large benefit from WFH.

I'm in my 50's and have worked fully remote for 15 years, but most of my business comes from past coworkers with whom I formed close relationships via working late nights in the office, going to happy hours, grabbing a coffee at the break room, etc. So, while I agree the companies are pursuing their own agendas, I think workers (especially young workers) could benefit from RTO. reply bryanlarsen 6 hours agoparentprevAmazon RTO has a very simple explanation.

But if we want to talk about this, we need to have in mind the capital amortization. The value of every business goes up or down if their fixed capital gets old or unused. For example, if you have 100 computers and every computer costs 1000, your company has that value as capital. But if they lose value in the next years and those same computers have a value of 50 in the market, then your company's value is halved (oversimplifiying it). The same happens with buildings and offices, if they lose values the company loses value too. Forcing workers to move to the office gives value to the area and the building, and the buildings around, and that's one of the main reasons why they are forcing the back to office thing. reply tonyedgecombe 7 hours agorootparentIf a company leases their building (and I think most do) then the capital value is of little interest to them and won't influence these sort of decisions.

Cities like big company offices because in theory their workers would become customers of local businesses, which would not be possible with remote work.

If we WFH, we own homes, not in dense cities. If we own homes we start having maybe a shed with p.v. and storage, a homelab, which with modern FTTH connections could be a small machine room alike datacenter, which with modern tech could be a part of a decentralized network so the SME/startup instead of buying someone else resources in the cloud buy their employees resources in their home at similar rates and equal reliability but with much more balance of power and much less private censorship possible (like arbitrary PayPal and co blocking of payments for Wikileaks or porn-producers). In such setup who will rent a Waymo? Who wont a more shiny macrobug aka smartphone? Who want JustEat or Uber? We will came back quickly in a real modern \"StrongTown\" economy, of many SMEs fighting with their dynamism, instead of creating slaves with taxes and rents to keep people moving. We will really implement the Green New Deal because we can't in a modern dense city without rebuild it from the ground, but we can for small buildings.

That's your management's problem, not yours.

If the outcome is the same in or out of office (that is, hours of unproductive time a day), then it seems to me you're upset that people are able to enjoy that time. Requiring and taking time for purposes other than creating value for the company is nothing more than punishment. I understand being angry that you're sitting in the office twiddling thumbs while others are at home cooking. The solution here is not to punish those people for your own, and everyone's, in-office woes. The solution is to demand better for yourself. I work in an office 5 days a week. I'll say right now - close to half of my time is wasted. However, I am still here in the office. Yes that absolutely sucks to know I could work 20 hours a week and achieve the same outcome. However, I am not \"better\" because I have enjoyed the punishment of spending that time. I am not more loyal nor more proficient. I am not less lazy.

Even if there was, why is this a problem? Presumably they're getting work done in those 4 hours that is satisfactory to the business, so what if they do some work on the side as well? Who cares? I do hybrid (2 times a week in the office) and don't mind it, but I know for a fact that pretty much every single person in my team does much less work on the office days than when they're remote, because we're mostly socializing, taking coffee breaks and taking full advantage of our 1-hour lunch break (rather than the 15 minutes it takes at home to just eat the meal). Most of us will even opt out of office days when we have a big deadline. Hell, I'm much less productive at the office simply because the chairs & monitors suck. At home I've got a quad 4K monitor setup in an extremely comfortable chair, my own desk, my own food & beverages of choice, my own music blasting as loud (or quiet) as I want it.

And my response to that claim was that it doesn't even have to be \"coordinated\". Do you disagree? I'm talking about the most rudimentary social dynamics we can observe and take part in daily. We can \"conspire with\" total strangers even, ad hoc, if we both realize our interests are otherwise endangered.

That is essentially what the entire field of economics is about: decomposing how people respond to different incentives to act in an \"agglomerated\" fashion. The thing I hate about articles like this one, and claims like \"look at the shady stuff McKinsey has done\" is that they never really even attempt to provide evidence about how the incentives around propping up com. real estate values would be enough to sway decision makers. They just try to tie some loose threads together, and use scary terms like \"elites\" as if all of the elites acted with one mind. There have been plenty of comments elsewhere in this thread making the argument that the connection between com. real estate values and people making the actual RTO decisions is far too tenuous to have that be a primary motivator. Also, having been a director and had lots of interactions with C-suite folks, I find it laughable to think that of all the concerns high-level execs have that \"helping the stock portfolios of other rich people\" is their primary driver. reply Lio 9 hours agoparentprevWell here in the UK Lord Sugar has vocally complained about people working from home (whilst doing so himself).

For one, look at the expenses of some of the large tech companies that often make the front page here on HN due to their RTO plans. Real estate is a relatively teeny portion (salaries are obviously the biggest).

These don't require anything other than people acting in accordance with incentives that they already have. I'm sure it's not hard to find more. Mechanism 1: Those S&P 500 shares that you own through Vanguard and BlackRock index funds, you don't actually control the voting rights to them. Vanguard and BlackRock do. They have coordinated voting power and a big voice in the C-suite of many large corporations. I do think that execs will listen when they make a suggestion, and it's in their interests that the value of assets under management stays high, because that's what determines their pay. Mechanism 2: C-suite comp is tied to stock price, often through options. Well, as it happens, asset markets are tightly interrelated, and high valuations are a result of leverage. Strangely enough, a dollar invested in real estate can also be a dollar invested in Amazon (even if it's not Amazon's real estate). When asset valuations are high, their owners can borrow against those assets and use that money to bid for other assets, raising the price of everything together. In this process new money is essentially created ex nihilo and increases the price of assets. Conversely, when asset prices start deflating, that can trigger a sell-off of other assets, and this money doesn't simply change hands, it disappears along with the leverage that created it. A pop in commercial real estate valuations can mean that many investment funds which own Amazon will have to sell them off at fire-sale prices to cover a margin call. If you're an exec, this wouldn't be a good thing to happen before your equity compensation package vests. reply dools 12 hours agoparentprev\"You don't need formal conspiracies when interest converge\" - George Carlin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAFd4FdbJxs reply rdtsc 12 hours agorootparentRight, they don’t all have to fly to a secret island.

Powerful businesspeople usually own real estate, it's great for financing new ventures and so on, and they have habits. They go to clubs, golf courses, rather exclusive hunting trips and so on, where they meet other people with power in business. And they talk, speculate on the future and develop a community. A community where they go looking for contacts when they need something, like a public affairs firm for pushing political buttons, or a real estate investment to put a big payout into, or whatever. If you are in this environment and fuck around you'll make enemies. People won't recommend you as a public affairs customer, won't tip you off on good investment opportunities, might start to talk shit about you behind your back.

If your company is chugging along making, say, 4% return on capital, that may be fine in the ZIRP era, but when treasuries are paying north of 5% it means it makes more economic sense to close down the company and put your cash into government bonds.

Being stonewalled by a non-cooperative senior coworker in a slack chat while you start your job is a very stressful experience, I can tell you.

At least in an org set up correctly for remote work. Smaller teams (or those with a single decision maker) are more susceptible to failing this, but thats a management problem that needs to br highlighted and addressed. And requires management to be actual people and process managers, and not psuedo manage by following some random guides and ticking off items on a checklist and \"managing\" by graph/stat outputs and only attempting to make some dashboard green, lines moving in the direction etc. As for allowance of some slack, yeah, theres possibility for that to happen. But management doesnt need to be intrusive: what does anyone care if some employee is working a 2nd job for example? Does anyone care how their colleagues or staff spend their time away from work as it is? As long as their work is done within acceptable timeframes (or there is reasonable limiting factors preventing it) , its of sufficient quality to meet expectations, and they meet expectations of availability, what they do in their spare time is none of anyones business. In other words, so long as someone is not breaking company requirements/policy (which would include working on competing products, etc), whether they hack away on side projects, volunteer their time somewhere, work a 2nd job, do nothing... it doesn't particularly matter. Management only needs to measure performance relative to the org's expectations of performance for that position, and timeously address any concerns if need be.

Studies and real-world examples show the opposite: many people are more productive at home without the daily commute and office distractions. Plus, companies have tools and strategies to keep teams connected and engaged, so the idea that culture just dissolves over time isn’t based on reality. Culture isn’t about being in the same room; it’s about values, leadership, and communication. And remote companies are proving you can have a strong, action-driven culture without a traditional office. Also, let’s talk about this idea that employees’ good intentions aren't enough and that without the office, everything falls apart. This screams of a lack of trust in workers, which is not how modern businesses run. Successful companies trust their people, set clear expectations, and hold them accountable—whether they’re in the office or working from a coffee shop. It’s not about babysitting; it’s about outcomes. And this notion that computer science professionals won’t have bargaining power because of some glut is just not accurate. Sure, there are more CS grads, but the demand for skilled talent is still high, especially for top performers. Companies offering WFH flexibility are not just doing it out of kindness; it’s a strategic move to attract and retain talent in a competitive market. Restricting WFH options actually puts companies at a disadvantage. Bottom line: dismissing WFH as some kind of fad or liability ignores the reality that a ton of companies are making it work and even excelling.

I mean that in the sense that they want all their employees in the office but don’t want to pay for enough office space to make that possible. Hell, even the “golden path” schedule for my team or any other in the company doesn’t have set desks. Where we sit in office changes depending on the day because we have the seating capacity for 75% of the employees mandated to be in office, and hr is doing their best at accommodating this.

So either a) The company that is ordering workers back to office owns the property - then they get absolutely no financial gains from it, because they need to pay for the office space in any case. or b) They rent the office.

He wasn’t taking anyone’s spot, the desk would otherwise sit empty. When someone first goes remote they are sent a bunch of stuff they don’t really need, but it’s a one time cost, not recurring.

The marketplace is the final step of Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince’s larger plan to give publishers greater control over how and when AI bots scrape their websites. “If you don’t compensate creators one way or another, then they stop creating, and that’s the bit which has to get solved,” said Prince in an interview with TechCrunch. As the first step in its new plan, on Monday, Cloudflare launched free observability tools for customers, called AI Audit. Website owners will get a dashboard to view analytics on why, when, and how often AI models are crawling their sites for information. Cloudflare will also let customers block AI bots from their sites with the click of a button. Website owners can block all web scrapers using AI Audit, or let certain web scrapers through if they have deals or find their scraping beneficial. A demo of AI Audit shared with TechCrunch showed how website owners can use the tool, which is able to see where each scraper that visits your site comes from, and offers selective windows to see how many times scrapers from OpenAI, Meta, Amazon, and other AI model providers are visiting your site. Demo of AI audit. Image Credits: Cloudflare Cloudflare is trying to address a problem looming over the AI industry: How will smaller publishers survive in the AI era if people go to ChatGPT instead of their website? Today, AI model providers scrape thousands of small websites for information that powers their LLMs. While some larger publishers have struck deals with OpenAI to license content, most websites get nothing, but their content is still fed into popular AI models on a daily basis. That could break the business models for many websites, reducing traffic they desperately need. Earlier this summer, AI-powered search startup Perplexity was accused of scraping websites that deliberately indicated they did not want to be crawled using the Robots Exclusion Protocol. Shortly after, Cloudflare released a button to ensure customers could block all AI bots with one click. “That was out of frustration we were hearing, where people were feeling like their content was being stolen,” said Prince. Some website owners told Business Insider that AI bots were scraping their websites so much, it felt like a DDoS attack was crippling their servers. Having your website scraped can not only be upsetting, but it can literally run up your cloud bill and impact your service. But what if you wanted to block Perplexity’s bots, but not OpenAI’s? Prince tells TechCrunch that Cloudflare’s customers are asking for tools that allow them to choose which AI models have access to their sites. Cloudflare’s new tools launching today will allow customers to block some AI crawlers, while letting others through. Even large publishers that have struck licensing deals with OpenAI — such as TIME, Condé Nast, and The Atlantic — have relatively little insight into how much ChatGPT is scraping their websites, according to Prince. Many of them have to accept what OpenAI tells them, but the answer determines if the publishers are getting a good licensing deal or not. But Cloudflare’s marketplace, launching sometime in the next year, aims to allow small publishers to strike deals with AI model providers as well. “Let’s give all of you the ability to do what only Reddit, Quora, and the big publishers of the world have done previously,” said Prince. “What if we let you set, effectively, a price for accessing and taking your content to ingest into these systems.” While it’s a bold idea, Cloudflare is not sharing a fully fleshed-out idea of what its marketplace will look like. Prince says websites could charge AI model providers based on the rates at which they’re scraping individual websites, but it’s unclear how much they will really pay. Further, he says websites could charge a monetary price to be scraped, or simply ask AI labs to give them credit. The details are fuzzy. While AI companies may not initially be excited about paying for content they currently get for free, Cloudflare’s CEO says he thinks this is ultimately good for the AI ecosystem. Prince says the current landscape, where some AI companies don’t pay for content ever, is not sustainable.

The challenge is that Common Crawl is used for a lot of things that are not AI training. For example, it's a major source of content for the Wayback machine. In fact, that's the entire point of the Common Crawl project. Instead of dozens of companies writing and running their (poorly) designed crawlers and hitting everyone's site, Common Crawl runs once and exposes the data in industry standard formats like WARC for other consumers. Their crawler is quite well behaved (exponential backoff, obeys Crawl-Delay, will use SiteMaps.xml to know when to revisit, follows Robots.txt, etc.). There are significant knock-on effects if CloudFlare starts (literally) gatekeeping content. This feels like a step down the path to a world where the majority of websites use sophisticated security products that gatekeep access to those who pay and those who don't, and that applied whether they are bots or people. reply Aachen 3 hours agoparent> gatekeep access to those who pay and those who don't, and that applied whether they are bots or people. I'm already constantly being classified as bot. Just today: To check if something is included in a subscription that we already pay for, I opened some product page on the Microsoft website this morning. Full-page error: \"We are currently experiencing high demand. Please try again later.\" It's static content but it's not available to me. Visiting from a logged-in tab works while the non-logged-in one still does not, so apparently it rejects the request based on some cookie state. Just now I was trying to book a hotel room for a conference in Grenoble. Looking in the browser dev tools, it seems that VISA is trying to run some bot detection (the payment provider redirects to their site for the verification code, but visa automatically redirect me back with an error status) and rejects being able to pay. There are no other payment methods. Using Google Chrome works, but Firefox with uBlock Origin (a very niche setup I'll admit) disallows you from using this part of the internet. Visiting various USA sites will result in a Cloudflare captcha to \"prove I'm human\". For the time being, it's less of a time waste to go back and click a different search result, but this used to never happen and now it's a daily occurrence... reply theyeenzbeanz 2 hours agorootparentLately I’ve been noticing captchas have been increasingly difficult day by day on Firefox. Checking the box use to go through without issue, but now it’s been starting to pop up challenges with the boxes that fade after clicking. Just like your experience, chrome has no hiccups on the same machine. reply Aachen 2 hours agorootparentThose \"keep clicking until we stop fading in more results\" challenges mean they're fairly confident you're a bot and this is the highest difficulty level to prove your lack of guilt. I get these only when using a browser that isn't already full of advertising cookies (edit: which, to be clear, I hope is still considered an acceptable state to have your browser in) reply diggan 1 hour agorootparent> Those \"keep clicking until we stop fading in more results\" challenges mean they're fairly confident you're a bot Those ones are the fucking worst. I've noticed that if I try to succeed in these captchas too quickly, it'll just say \"Sorry, try again\" even when every click was correct, so instead, I've started going in slow motion and faking \"misclicking\" which makes it much more likely to accept me as human. I cannot stand the idea that I have to pretend to be slower than I am, in order for a computer to not think I'm a computer. Thanks CloudFlare and Google. reply klyrs 35 minutes agorootparentI always spoil as many of these as possible. Sometimes it takes me a while to prove that I'm human, but I'm dead-set on convincing it that I'm a stupid human.

Not sure this makes a difference but it kinda works reply jkestner 56 minutes agorootparentprevHarrison Bergeron but for AI reply LegionMammal978 2 hours agorootparentprevFWIW, it can't be cookies alone that gives you an inordinate number of bot challenges. I use private tabs on Firefox (for Linux and Android) for most of my browsing, and I rarely get any challenges regardless of what I do. The only issues tend to be when I make repeated searches for things with \"quotes\" and whatnot on Google or on Stack Exchange sites. But for the most part, those challenges aren't particularly drawn-out: I've only ever gotten the \"fading\" ones when I'm using Tor or a VPN. reply Aachen 1 hour agorootparentIt varies a lot based on what I'm doing. Sites that rely on ads like english-language¹ recipes or health information have a lot of \"you're European so you're blocked altogether\" or \"let me check that the connection is secure, ah wait, here is a captcha for you to solve\" pages. Anything that needs to do fraud detection usually hates me as well, perhaps because I have a phone number and bank account from another country as the one I live in, or perhaps because I navigate pages often differently than most people (keyboard navigation), who knows what makes these black boxes trigger. That German ISPs have daily-rotating IP addresses, so there is absolutely nothing tying a previous request to the current request, may also be a factor All in all, I'm someone who would benefit from a society not run by algorithms, where I can just pay up front for my use (no credit mechanisms, no fraud detection, no tracking ads), at least as an available option ¹ it's the language I think in the most and has many more resources than the local languages I speak reply shadowgovt 56 minutes agorootparentprevIt's acceptable, but suspicious. Two standard deviations away from the median browser (and a lot more like the configuration of a scraper, which would get reloaded in some Docker instance frequently with a fresh empty cookie jar because storing data costs infrastructure). reply ajsnigrutin 2 hours agorootparentprevAw man, you haven't seen the 'captchas' of arkose labs yet... those are a pain (twitter used to have them some time ago). reply Aachen 2 hours agorootparentAre those the ones where you have to add up dice and select a matching third one or something? The ones GitHub used for registration, say, ~9 months ago? You're right! I forgot about those. A colleague and I tried to complete it independently but literally could not. One run would take multiple minutes and on the second try I was more diligent (taking even longer) and certain I did all the math correctly, but registration was still being rejected. Our new colleague did not sign up for GitHub that day and got the repository from a colleague who already had access instead Edit: seems that's yet another one. Arkoseis the ones OpenAI used to use on their login page until ~2 months ago, I found them very reasonable (3x selecting a direction an object is facing in), even if unnecessary since I provided the right username and password from a clean IP address on the first try reply gruez 45 minutes agorootparentprevWeird, cloudflare should have moved away from google recaptchas years ago. Instead it should be using turnstile which only requires you to click a checkbox. The only site I know of that still uses google recaptcha is archive.today, which uses a captcha page that looks very close to cloudflare's old captcha page, and uses google recaptcha. reply influx 2 hours agorootparentprevI wonder how many of those captchas are controlled by competitors of Firefox? reply quasse 2 hours agorootparentReCAPTCHA absolutely hammers Firefox compared to Chrome for me. On sites that use it for login I rarely just get the \"check the box\" challenge anymore, and am instead being asked to train their CV algorithms by picking 5+ images of stoplights or motorcycles. Punishment for avoiding the Chrome universe I guess. reply esperent 2 hours agorootparentprev> We are currently experiencing high demand. Please try again later. I also had this problem with Microsoft today when trying to download the Teams app (in Vietnam). We use MS Teams at work and onboard one or two people a week. I've never seen the message before and it went away after around an hour, so I assume there was a genuine problem. reply Aachen 2 hours agorootparentPerhaps, but it loaded fine in Chrome as well as a logged-in tab. It only rejected the Firefox no-cookies user agent.

Thanks for the pointer reply ajsnigrutin 2 hours agorootparentprevSame here... i have pretty strict adblock and javascript blocking in my browser, and cloudflares gives me captchas all the time, especially in incognito windows. reply Aachen 2 hours agorootparentIf it were only cloudflare, I'd be pretty happy since that's a small fraction of sites (outside of the USA at least).

Abuse of the public square means that public goods are then restricted. It's perfectly rational for websites of any sort who have strong opinions on AI to forbid the use of common crawl, specifically because it is being abused by AI companies to train the AI's they are opposed to. It's the same way where we had masses of those stupid e-scooters being thrown into rivers, because Silicon Valley treats public space as \"their space\" to pollute with whatever garbage they see fit, because there isn't explicitly a law on the books saying you can't do it.

I guess what goes around comes around. \"first they came for the....\" etc etc. Anyway, I see a potential upside to this, so we might be optimistic. Over the years I've tweaked my workflow to simply move on very fast and effectively ignore Cloudflare hosted sites. I know... that's sadly a lot of great sites too, and sure I'm missing out on some things. On the other hand, it seems to cut out a vast amount of rubbish. Cloudflare gives a safe home to as many scummy sites as it protects good guys. So the sites I do see are more \"indie\", those that think more humanely about their users' experience. Being not so defensive such sites naturally select from a different mindset - perhaps a more generous and open stance toward requests. So what effect will this have on AI training? Maybe a good one. Maybe tragic. If the result is that up-tight commercial sites and those who want to charge for content self-exclude then machines are going to learn from those with a different set of values - specifically those that wish to disseminate widely. That will include propaganda and disinformation for sure. It will also tend to filter out well curated good journalism. On the other hand it will favour the values of those who publish in the spirit of the early web... just to put their own thing up there for the world.

Their mission wasn't to provide an easy way to download & import the data so it wasn't a focus topic, and they probably ran more bleeding edge versions of mediawiki and plugins that they didn't deem stable enough for general public consumption. But it made it very hard to do \"the right thing\", and just whipping up a script to fetch the URLs I cared about (it was in Perl back then!) was orders of magnitude faster. At least for me, had they offered an easy way to set up a local mirror, I would've done that. I assume this is similar for many scrapers: they're extremely experienced at building scrapers, but they have no idea how to set up some software and how to import dumps that may or may not be easy to manage, so to them the cost of writing a scraper is much smaller.

We'd have the server reply to the initial request with a new HTTP response instructing the client to re-request with a POST containing an N-byte (N = data size) one-time pad. The client can receive this, generate random data (or all zeros, up to the client); and the server then will send the actual response XOR'd with the one-time pad. Upside: Most end users don't pay for upload; if bot operators do, this incurs a dollar cost only to them. Downside: Increased download cost for the web site operator (but we've postulated that this is small compared to upload cost), extra round trip, extra time for each request (especially for end users with asymmetric bandwidth). Eh, just a thought. reply Aachen 1 hour agorootparentMay work for small pages, like most of my webpages besides some downloadable files, but megabytes of JavaScript on an average (mobile?) connection are going to take very significantly longer to load, cost more battery, and take twice as much from your data bundle Perhaps it's effective as bot deterrent when someone incurs, say, a ten times higher than median load (as measured in something like CPU time per hour or bandwidth per week or so).

We seem to have been happy with Google doing that for ages in exchange for displaying the website in search results. reply red_admiral 3 hours agoparentThe website owner chooses. They can say \"nope\" in robots.txt. Not everyone respects this, but Google does. Google can choose not to show that site as a result, if they want to. This adds a third option besides yes and no, which is \"here's my price\". Also, because cloudflare is involved, bots that just ignore a \"nope\" might find their lives a bit harder. reply lolinder 3 hours agorootparentRobots.txt is for crawlers. It's explicitly not meant to say one-off requests from user agents can't access the site, because that would break the open web. reply Spivak 3 hours agorootparentYep, there's really two parts to this. * Some company's crawler they're planning to use for AI training data. * User agents that make web requests on behalf of a person. Blocking the second one because the user's preferred browser is ChatGPT isn't really in keeping with the hacker spirit. The client shouldn't matter, I would hope that the web is made to be consumed by more than just Chrome. reply brigadier132 3 hours agoparentprevFor traditional search indexing the interests of the aggregator and the content creator were aligned. AIs on the other hand are adversarial to the interest of content creators, a sufficiently advanced AI can replace the creator of the content it was trained on. reply lolinder 3 hours agorootparentWe're talking in this subthread about an AI agent accessing content, not training a model on content. Training has copyright implications that are working their way through courts. AI agent access cannot be banned without fundamentally breaking the User Agent model of the web. reply brigadier132 3 hours agorootparentOk, fine, let's restrict it to AI agents only, without training. It's still an adversarial relationship with the content creator. When you take an AI agent an ask it \"find me the best italian restaurant in city xyz\" it scans all the restaurant review sites and gives you back a recommendation. The content creator bears all the burden of creating and hosting the content and reaps non of the reward as the AI agent has now inserted itself as a middleman. The above is also a much clearer / more obvious case of copyright infringement than AI training. > AI agent access cannot be banned without fundamentally breaking the User Agent model of the web. This is a non-sequitur but yes you are right, everything in the future will be behind a login screen and search engines will die. reply lolinder 3 hours agorootparent> reaps non of the reward Just to be clear what we're talking about: the reward in question is advertising dollars earned by manipulating people's attention for profit, right?

Training embeds the data into the model and has copyright implications that aren't yet fully resolved. But an AI agent using a website to do something for a user is not substantially different than any other application doing the same. Why does it matter to you, the company, if I use a local LLaMA to process your website vs an algorithm I wrote by hand? And if there is no difference, are we really comfortable saying that website owners get a say in what kinds of algorithms a user can run to preprocess their content? reply jsheard 3 hours agorootparent> But an AI agent using a website to do something for a user is not substantially different than any other application doing the same. If the website is ad-supported then it is substantially different - one produces ad impressions and the other doesn't. Adblocking isn't unique to AI agents of course but I can see why site owners wouldn't want to normalize a new means of accessing their content which will inherently never give them any revenue in return. reply lolinder 3 hours agorootparentI don't believe that companies have the right to say that my user agent must run their ads. They can politely request that it does and I can tell my agent whether to show them or not. reply jsheard 3 hours agorootparentTrue, but by the same measure your user agent can politely request a webpage and the server has the right to say 403 Forbidden. Nobody is required to play by the other parties rules here. reply lolinder 3 hours agorootparentExactly. The trouble is that companies want the benefits of being on the open web without the trade-offs. They're more than welcome to turn me down entirely, but they don't do that because that would have undesirable knock-on effects.

Everyone is doing this, for AI products or whatever came before them, and it genuinely pushes me away from paying for Cloudflare, as I get the distinct sense that they aren't building the things or fixing the problems that I feel are important to me.

Cloudflares value proposition here is they will play the cat-and-mouse game of detecting things like spoofed user agents and residential proxies on your behalf, and actively block what appears to be scraper traffic unless they pay up.

With enough effort you can chase the bots until they run out of resources, but few people have time to win that battle by themselves, hence delegating it to Cloudflare or similar. reply TZubiri 4 hours agorootparentprev\"Unfortunately this probably means even more CAPTCHAs for people using VPNs and other privacy measures as they ramp up the bot detection heuristics\" Yeah.

Does content being freely reproducible with minor modification increase the demand for content creators since new content is more valuable than the existing that can be copied. I'd guess that since AI can fair-useify a work faster than any human, that fair-use reviewers, compilers/collagers, re-imaginers, etc content creators will be devalued. However, AIs are as yet unable to create work as innovative as humans. Therefore new work should be more valuable since now there is demand from people and AIs for their work. I'm assuming that AI companies pay for the work that they use in some way.

I don't recall the last I heard of Cloudflare spinning something up just to wind it back down? I don't think its impossible for them to make a bad choice, but I think they really think their projects through typically. My biggest problem with AI will be once it starts getting legislated, it will just be limited in how it can function / be built, we are going to lock in existing LLMs like ChatGPT in the lead and stop anyone from competing since they wont be able to train on the same data.

In fact they \"bet on blockchain\" way back in 2017 (https://blog.cloudflare.com/betting-on-blockchain/) but it's telling that they haven't published anything in the last couple of years (since Nov 2022).

I'm just saying they're part of an industry that thought web3 was the Next Big Thing between 2017-2022 and then pivoted when ChatGPT released in Nov 2022. Now AI is the Next Big Thing.

Accept & Continue Join Us in the Fight Against Air Pollution Indoor Monitor Outdoor Monitor Map Documentation Research Perspectives Support Shop Low Cost CO2 Sensors Comparison: Photo-Acoustic vs NDIR This article has been updated in September 2024 with new information about the Infineon photo-acoustic sensor as well as the performance of photo-acoustic sensors outdoors. When it comes to low cost CO2 sensors, there are basically three different methods to measure CO2. Estimated CO2 (eCO2) through TVOC sensors NDIR sensors Photo-acoustic sensors Estimated CO2 (eCO2) through TVOC sensors - not recommended - The first method via TVOC sensors is extremely unreliable. Some TVOC sensors like the Sensirion SGP30 estimate CO2 via organic components in the air. When you breathe out, you add organic components to the air which these sensors pick up and try to calculate a corresponding CO2 ppm value. The problem is that also other indoor sources like deodorizers add these chemical components to the air and thus the estimated CO2 rises -even though nobody might be in the room. We strongly advise against using TVOC sensors for CO2 estimation and thus will also not analyse it further in the rest of this article. CO2 gas absorption principle Both NDIR as well as photo-acoustic sensors are much more accurate than eCO2 from TVOC sensors as these sensors measure the CO2 directly and both are based on the absorption principle of gases. Different gases absorb light at specific ranges of wavelengths. So if the light is tuned at a certain wavelength and a receiver measures the incoming light levels, the rate of absorption can be calculated and with this the concentration of the gas established. Different gases have different absorption bands: Absorption wavelengths of different gases. To measure CO2, the light is tuned to emit a light of close to 4.26 micron (μm) which corresponds to the absorption of CO2. NDIR CO2 Sensors NDIR stands for “nondispersive infrared” and is a common technology to measure CO2. Thereby an infrared light emitter, typically an LED, sends light in a chamber filled with ambient air to a receiver. NDIR working principle. Some NDIR sensors have dual channels, one for the measurement of the CO2 levels in the ambient air and one with a control gas as a reference. This allows to detect drifts in the measurements and increases accuracy. One of the disadvantages of NDIR sensors is their size. There needs to be a certain minimum distance between the light emitter and receiver to achieve a certain level of accuracy and thus modern NDIR sensors like the SenseAir S8 that we use in our air quality kits are more than 3 cm long. This is not too big but would prevent certain applications, e.g. in a mobile phone. Photo-Acoustic Sensors Photo-acoustic sensors use the same working principle of the absorption wavelengths but unlike the NDIR sensors that measure the receiving light from an emitting LED, photo accoustic sensors measure the absorption with a microphone. When the CO2 molecules absorb the IR light, they start to “humm” and this sound can be picked up by a microphone. The biggest advantage of this principle is that the detection does not rely on line-of-sight anymore and thus these sensors can be built much smaller. Some are smaller than 1 cm3. Photo-Acoustic working principle. Comparison of the Specifications between SenseAir S8 (Optical NDIR) and the Photo-Acoustic Sensors from Sensirion and Infineon Below is a comparison of typical NDIR and Photo-Acoustic sensor modules based on their official specifications. Criteria Sensirion SCD 41 SenseAir S8 Infineon XENSIV PAS Working Principle Photo-Acoustic Optical NDIR Photo-Acoustic Accuracy ±(40 ppm + 5 %) ±(75 ppm +3%) ±50 ppm ±5% Range 400 ppm – 5000 ppm 400 ppm – 5000 ppm 400 - 3000 ppm Working Temperature -10 - +60 °C 0 - +50 °CConnectivity I2C UART UART, I2C, PWM Size 10.1 x 10.1 x 6.5 mm 33.5 x 20.0 x 8.5 mm 14 x 13.8 x 7.5 mm PictureExcept for the size and connectivity, the specs are quite similar. They do also cost around the same (USD 10 - 25). Side-By-Side Comparison Indoors We tested the SenseAir S8 and Sensirion SCD40 / SCD41 for a few weeks and saw them behaving very similarly. Below is a chart over 14 days in a typical indoor home environment (bedroom). Timeline comparison SenseAir S8 and Sensirion SCD40. Both sensors deliver very reliable results and the only difference that can be spotted is that the S8 seems to be a bit more sensitive and picks up higher values more. This can be seen on an X Y chart: X Y comparison SenseAir S8 and Sensirion SCD40. Photo-Acoustic Struggles Outdoors We do also measure CO2 levels outdoors with our outdoor monitor Open Air, and it helps to detect local emission sources. As part of that development we also tested photo-acoustic CO2 sensors outdoors in collaboration with researchers from the University of Cambridge. Outdoor measurement of CO2 is more challenging due to mainly two reasons: Firstly, there is a much larger range of temperature and humidity that the sensor is directly exposed to. For example indoor temperatures normally range between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius whereas outside we could have a range from -30 to +45 degrees Celsius of environmental conditions. Secondly, the typical CO2 concentration levels outdoor are in the range of 400 to 550 ppm (higher in rural areas) whereas indoors you typically have a range of 400 to up to 3000ppm. In general, it is often easier for sensors to measure higher concentrations because there are more molecules or particles that can be detected. Below is a comparison of two SenseAir S8 and two Sensirion SCD40 sensors compared to a CO2 reference instrument. All sensors have been offset to the same starting point. Outdoor time-line comparison SenseAir S8 and Sensirion SCD40. We can observe a few interesting things: The two pairs have very distinctive differences The two SenseAir S8 (optical) NDIR sensors aligns much better with the reference than the photo acoustic sensors from Sensirion The two SenseAir S8 sensors correlate much better compared to each other than the two Sensirion SCD sensors. In fact there are cases where the SCD sensors go into completely opposite directions These observations can also be easily shown in the R2 comparisons. R2 is a mathematical number showing the degree of correlation between two number. A number of 1 indicates a perfect correlation, where as a number of 0 indicates no correlation at all. In terms of accuracy we want to get as close to one as possible. First let’s compare the two sensor pairs: R2 between S8 R2 between SCD 41 0.90 0.36 These number clearly indicate that the S8 sensors have a much higher agreement with each other than the photo acoustic sensors. Now lets look at the comparison with the reference instrument. Sensor R2 S8 -1 0.69 S8 -2 0.64 SCD -1 0.16 SCD -2 0.24 Also, here we see that the S8 has a much higher correlation with the reference instrument compared to the photo acoustic sensors. By the way in more comprehensive (and ongoing) tests, the S8 actually achieves correlations with reference instruments above 0.9 and thus even better than the above numbers indicate. By the way all of the above observations can also be seen clearly in the X Y comparison between the point the sensor measures and the reference. Outdoor comparison SenseAir S8 and Sensirion SCD40 with X Y comparison. We can see that the S8 dots (red and blue) are much closer to the 1:1 line than the dots from the photo-acoustoc sensors. Conclusion We have been using the SenseAir S8 in our air quality monitors for many years now and have made very good experience with. The Sensirion SCD4x seems to give a similar accuracy under normal indoor conditions but seems to be more impacted by environmental conditions and is not recommended for outdoor usage. by Achim Haug Sep 21, 2024 Keep in Touch Curious about upcoming webinars, company updates, and the latest air quality trends?

It won't tell you if the air is being filtered (need MERV13 or better), but a lot of places for efficiency and/or due to old HVAC equipment don't bring in fresh air, which increases the risk in a more confined and/or crowded space. Also, some places like airplanes, which have HEPA filters and have 10-20 air changes per hour (ACH), don't run those systems at full power or bring in outside air at fast enough rate until airborne, so PPM can't build up to 2000 ppm vs the ~420 ambient outdoor CO2 level and approx 800 \"good\" indoor air rate.

Very accurate, very long-lasting, tells you other things like humidity etc, and only 1-2 hundred dollars when we bought it (may be more expensive now, been a couple years of inflation). reply SparkyMcUnicorn 15 hours agoparentI chose the AirGradient[0] One. It's slightly more expensive than the aranet4, but has more sensors. It's open source, reports CO2, PM10, PM2.5, temperature, humidity, and more I'm probably forgetting offhand. Loaded it with the esphome firmware, so Home assistant integration is seamless. And since it's open source, when a sensor inevitably wears out in a couple years (like the PMS5003), I can just replace the sensor instead of of buying a whole new unit. Highly recommend it.

I'm still happy with the purchase, and I haven't had to change the batteries yet. reply vegetablepotpie 5 hours agoprevOne of the things I’ve been wanting to do is make a batch of SAO style circuit boards with a CO2 sensor hooked up to a 7-segment display and hand them out to people at conferences. This would give people a way to witness ambient CO2 levels first hand, and how much it’s increasing. I’d have a QR code on the back, write something like “getting hot enough for you?” and have it link to non-profits doing work on climate change. The idea would be to build a batch of a few hundred of these. If co2 sensors get down to the $5 price point, this idea starts to get feasible. Right now sensors are getting cheap, which is impressive, but not cheap enough yet to hand them out to strangers for free. reply breput 19 hours agoprevI've used both the SenseAir S8 and Sensirion SCD41 sensors, and the SenseAir is clearly my favorite. The SCD41 seems to require a lot more manual calibration while the S8 is very stable - maybe once every 3 months or so, I'll see it reporting ~380 ppm in fresh air (which is actually within spec). The venerable MH-Z19 is probably my second favorite sensor, ahead of the SCD40-series. reply ahaucnx 16 hours agoparentThe MH-Z19 is similar from the performance of the S8 but we do see more noise in the readings and the MH-Z19 also seem to have less life time. We see some of them dying after around 5 years whereas the S8 has a ten year warranty and so far have been rock solid for us. reply imjonse 14 hours agorootparentI see all these three (SD40/41, MH-Z19 and S8) on Aliexpress, but in yesterday's discussion on the sibling post it was said that the SD40 is likely a fake since Switzerland based Sensirion do not distribute there. Do you have a blog about sourcing these sensors and those needed for other air measurements? The cheaper options on AliExpress look attractive for someone willing to try a small hobby project but if there's a risk of getting malfunctioning fakes that option may need to be scratched. Thank you reply ius 11 hours agorootparentI'm not convinced the mere fact that AliExpress sellers are not Sensirion distributors is sufficient to assume these sensors are counterfeit. Obviously there's precedence - buy a 'stm32' and you'll likely receive a counterfeit chip, but that's because these chips have been cloned by many. The Sensirion SCD40 is fairly niche and has an odd form factor - doesn't seem trivial to produce a convincing clone. AliExpress sellers sell these at €14,99/1 whereas DigiKey is at €16,38/600 (excl. VAT). Price seems 'right' to me. I have been looking for a comparison between sensors sourced from AliExpress and a reputable distributor, but sadly couldn't find any. Anyway, I did get a few of these sensors off AliExpress for my personal projects. They definitely measure CO₂ (not eCO₂) - the only issues I've been having with them is the default calibration being off and a struggle to get the temperature reporting right (the sensor suffers from self-heating). reply breput 15 hours agorootparentprevThat is good confirmation.

What should I google? I can only find $100+ galvanic sensors that need to be replaced after a few dozen months reply brok3nmachine 11 hours agoparentThe cheapest 02 sensors that I know of are around $50 each, and have a shelf life of 1-2 years. Average price for a decent sensor is closer to $90. And digital solid state O2 sensors go for $400+. *Edit*: google dive gear express O2 sensors to see these. I use them for technical scuba diving. In particular with a rebreather, which is capable of mixing oxygen with other gases such as nitrogen and helium. And as the gas is recirculated CO2 is scrubbed away. CO2 sensors are also available for rebreathers but are not always reliable (same for O2 sensors, so a minimum of 3 are used). The human body is actually quite sensitive to CO2, and it determines our breathing rate. So there are ways to know if you're likely being exposed to elevated CO2 levels by being aware of your breathing rate, paranoia, etc. reply joseda-hg 42 minutes agorootparentCompletely off-topic, but do you happen to use text-to-speech for comments? The usage of 02 and O2 interchangeably piqued my interest; it seems like a way for such an error to occur. reply amoshebb 1 hour agorootparentprevYes, these are the galvanic ones I was rounding up to $100.

No need to spend hundreds to thousands on lab-grade tech. +- 50ppm, or even 100 or 200 is nothing. You will mainly care if the ppm is around 500 or around 1000-2000 (depending on preference). The devices that have alarms are quite nice. Leave them on a desk and they’ll tell you when to open the window.

E.g. a study in the usual suburban house. reply rallison 17 hours agorootparentYep. Even if the building as a whole is generally well ventilated, particular spaces in a building can still build up CO2 pretty quickly. It's actually quite dramatic to see the rise in chart form at times. These sensors are really nice to help validate ventilation anywhere. reply twothamendment 17 hours agorootparentYeah, location matters a ton. I have 2 Awair Elements and we ran them in different places until we knew what \"normal\" looked like, then move them on. Because of what I saw in my house we switched from a gas stove/oven to electric induction, installed an air exchanger and set our central air/heat to recirculate more often (only important for us during spring and fall when we aren't heating or cooling much). I don't like noise when sleeping, so I liked the bedroom door shut. CO2 gets way too high, so I switched to using an earplug and leaving the door open more. It is so nice to have the data, make informed choices and see measurable results. reply rallison 15 hours agorootparentYep, I also run central air in fan only mode much more often now. Since I'm in coastal California, I don't need to run heating/cooling for much of the year, so previously that meant central air was rarely on. Now, I'll run it fairly often for the recirculation. And, since my house is old and leaky, aside from evening out levels, it no doubt results in more indoor:outdoor air exchange too. That alone made a massive difference at night, since I will usually have the bedroom door closed. And, while I haven't switched the range over to induction yet (it's on the list to eventually do), I did get a portable induction burner that I use fairly often instead of the gas range. Induction is pretty amazing, so I look forward to eventually going all the way. reply kupfer 11 hours agoparentprevSure if you are already airing every hour you don't need it. Then for me it was surprising how often I have to air and for how long (also depends on draft and temperature difference). Once you take into account the more harmful particulate matter coming in from outside, it's about finding a compromise, and without measuring you are tapping in the dark. But in the end people get old without all that stuff. reply breput 17 hours agoparentprevLet's be honest - the AirGradiant people/person are submitting these.

What other reason would they have to support Gorilla Tag on ARM? https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1837210246076588500 Compatibility with your existing Steam library out of the box will be a huge competitive advantage for Deckard over Meta Quest. reply dagmx 13 hours agoparentImho it’s unlikely this is for natively running on a standalone headset. The overhead of translation alone would be just burning already limited compute budgets. The other games on their list are too demanding for untethered play in the wattage one would have on a face mounted device. IMHO gorilla tag here is just a red herring. IMHO this is just valve hedging the bet that ARM machines become more popular , and future steamdeck like devices might use ARM. It would make sense that they test SteamVR running with proton and tethered to a headset rather than directly connected. Imho, that’s the more straightforward explanation for this. The game is just a test bed for tethered play. reply modeless 11 hours agorootparentI think you're right that they wouldn't ship Gorilla Tag this way. For a game that big I'm sure they can work with the developer to ship a native version. But for internal testing of a headset it would make sense to use this version in advance of availability of a native port. The games that will ship this way will probably mostly be non-VR games that would never get ported otherwise. So you can play your Steam library full of non-VR x86 Windows PC games on a giant virtual screen in VR. reply dagmx 4 hours agorootparentI think you’re perhaps over indexing on the one game in the list. The other games in the list have no VR mode at all. So they could run standalone in a flat screen view, but with fairly poor performance. Gorilla tag also has an ARM version already for Quest. So why would valve not just start from there? The Quest line of products use effectively the only SoC that Valve would have access to anyway for the XR space. Imho desktop and tethered playing are far more likely targets. I think Deckard might show up someday but it’s become a vessel for everyone’s hopes and dreams. reply jorvi 11 hours agorootparentprev> Imho it’s unlikely this is for natively running on a standalone headset. The overhead of translation alone would be just burning already limited compute budgets. I wonder if with both Windows and Valve getting into ARM64, that will bring significant enough pressure on the market for ARM OEMs (and ARM itself) to start including a x86-transpilation mode similar to the one Apple has in their M-series of CPUs to increase the performance of Rosetta2. reply dagmx 4 hours agorootparentAfaik the Snapdragon X cores include the memory ordering mode that the M series have as well. reply bloqs 11 hours agorootparentprevYeah tethered with a newer generation steam link wireless protocol would be great.

They probably make more money from the Steam store and there are some notable ARM based platforms where you currently can't use Steam and where they are not able to sell games. Macs would be a big juicy target, for example. If they can get emulation working well enough with proton on that, that's a huge market. Lots of people with disposable income on there that could be buying lots of games. And Apple is doing similar things as well so there might be some opportunity to tap into what they are doing. reply modeless 10 hours agorootparentAs much as it sounds like it would make sense, I haven't seen any hints that they are developing Proton for macOS. That seems like it would be evident from open source changes, if it was happening. I think Valve is reluctant to get any closer to Apple, or any large platform owner for that matter. They want to stay independent and own their own destiny. They even tried to get away from Microsoft with Steam Machines. It failed back then, but the Steam Deck is the continuation of that effort. reply Novosell 7 hours agorootparentprevIt isn't a huge market though. Mac has never been particularly big for gaming, they've always come in very low on the steam hardware survey. Now, post-ARM, it's beat by Linux even. reply FroshKiller 6 hours agorootparentI don't think the Steam hardware survey is representative of the market size. Most people with Macs are accustomed to games that should run just fine on them never getting released, which means there often isn't any point to installing Steam on a Mac in the first place. Therefore they wouldn't be represented even though they are gamers, they spend money, and they have Macs. I don't have a PC for personal use, but I do have a lot of game consoles, an M1 MacBook Pro, and an M2 Mac mini. There are lots of games like Pizza Tower that look fun to me, do not have a Mac version, but do have a Switch version. So I wind up spending money on Switch games that would've gone to Steam if the publisher had bothered with a macOS release. While I do have Steam installed on my M1 and M2, I rarely launch it because I've only bought eight games off Steam in two years because of this dynamic, meaning I haven't even participated in the survey myself. My Steam account is over 20 years old and has a healthy library from when I was a PC gamer. I'd say my money's on the table, but my money's in Nintendo's wallet.

Despite all the counterarguments offered each time. The simple reality is that there are decades worth of Windows games that will never have a Linux version. Because of the studios being gone. Because of the source code being lost. Because of the licensing issues for dependencies, assets, music. If not for the Valve efforts people would always need a copy of Windows to play a good chunk of their libraries. At which point why bother with Linux? But with Proton the calculus changes. Most of those Windows-only games are now fully playable on Linux. Many people no longer need Windows and that's a huge win for desktop Linux adoption. By this logic Apple should not have developed x86 translation for its latest Macs because it showed they are not serious about the platform and disincentivized devs from providing native Arm ports. Except we know that's not what happened. reply kelnos 9 hours agorootparentprev> They are fully dependent on Windows Games developed for Windows. Sure, but they don't want to be dependent on Windows itself. If they can run all those Windows games on another OS, that's a win. Proton is pretty amazing, even if it's not 100%.

Their previous push for native gaming produced very little results: Valve ported all their titles, a few minor publishers released native titles and some porting companies ported some AAA titles, but it was only a drop.

No one has heard of this game, but I could just boot up the old Japanese PC game Abyss Boat and it kind of just works. If I use a DLL replacement or something like dxwnd or dgvoodoo2 it's even better. reply anthk 8 hours agorootparentWith a Direct Draw replacement like the one from WineD3D your game/software is not better; the game literally stop beings a Power Point presentation and gets fully playable.

Such thing can't be really said about glibc and dynamic linking. Many old linux game binaries simply don't work or need tinkering to get them work. reply snvzz 2 hours agorootparentSteam Runtime takes care of this, offering a stable platform for games to target. reply kelnos 9 hours agorootparentprevSure, because Valve can't control what OSes other game developers target. That seems obvious? reply Beretta_Vexee 11 hours agorootparentprevthe majority of users have no idea what OS is actually running on their steamdeck and don't want to worry about it. Proton makes it possible to maintain a large library of older games on the platform. Like any Steam user since Half-life 2, I must have accumulated over a hundred games in my library. I think Valve knows better than we do what users want. reply YokoZar 11 hours agorootparentprevSo? How is a game fully running on Proton not a native game? Wine's version of the Windows API isn't conceptually different from any other cross-platform technology here. You could make a similar purity argument against using the Unity engine since most of its games end up being primarily on Windows too. reply imtringued 12 hours agorootparentprevMaybe because there is a large backlog of old games that will never be ported to Linux? Have you considered that game developers and not valve are responsible for providing a Linux port of their game and so far have managed to do a worse job than a DirectX implementation for Linux? The collective time spent on developing proton is probably less than a dozen high profile Linux ports. The latest commit to proton 9.0 is three weeks ago. The latest commit to an experimental branch is 3 days ago and it is just an update of a wine version and no other commits. A lot of proton commits just update a version here and there. The focus is certainly not on proton. It is simply very cheap to work on it, because it is highly effective. The steam deck probably cost them more software and hardware developer hours than proton. reply boomboomsubban 12 hours agorootparentprevAre you suggesting they aren't serious about Linux unless they stop selling games without a native Linux version? reply kranke155 9 hours agorootparentwhich would be insanity, considering the numbers... reply jasonjmcghee 13 hours agorootparentprevOn my deck, I can run native Linux games reply pjmlp 12 hours agorootparentSure, pity that the large majority on Steam library are running on top of Proton. reply ywvcbk 12 hours agorootparentWhy, though? What difference does it really make besides significantly reducing the cost of “porting” games? If anything, due to Wine, Proton etc. “Windows API” is almost a pseudo opensource way of developing cross-platform content. There are significant downsides but on the bright-side it’s extremely stable considering to most stuff on Linux. reply yazaddaruvala 12 hours agorootparentprevCould you help me understand why that is a pity? Seems like Valve’s adapter pattern is a great development tool to get Linux games without dev studios spending excessive dev time/money on it. Is Proton in some way inferior to native? reply mariusor 11 hours agorootparentI can think of one thing, which might not be what parent meant: the incentive of developing for linux, or paying porters like icculus and flibitijibibo to build a native version goes out the window, and the need for their kind of craft goes away. Frankly when the SteamDeck launched I hoped that game developers will start treating it as they do any other console and build specifically for it, but sadly Proton prevented that from happening. reply timschmidt 11 hours agorootparentI don't think Proton has prevented anything. In fact, without it, and the back catalog of Windows games it makes available on SteamDeck, I doubt the handheld would have been as popular. SteamDeck was successful enough to get a re-release in the form of the OLED model, which is a big success for a Linux handheld. The longer Valve remains committed to the platform, and the more devices they get into the hands of consumers, the more attractive native Linux games will look to developers. reply mariusor 8 hours agorootparentThe people I mentioned in my comment clearly disagree with you, and frankly they have more of an incentive to be well informed about the situation. See the twitter link I posted to your comment's sibling for Ethan Lee's impressions from three years ago. Also, I never argued against Proton having been a boon for Linux gamers, but I tried to present an opposing point of view that usually does not get taken into account. Like I mentioned in the other comment my impression over the past 3-4 years is that the number of native linux ports has dwindled to nothing and that is most likely due to Proton making them unnecessary. reply Novosell 6 hours agorootparentIn my experience, the Linux ports never got any attention from the devs either way. They'll usually have worse performance, not be on the current patch and in at least one case, Binding of Isaac Rebirth, not be compatible with the DLC as the DLC works in some hacky way on the windows version. Without Proton the steam deck would not be popular enough to warrant any Linux ports either way. So Linux ports would be doomed regardless. The real travesty is steam, with the recent introduction of WoW64 in Wine, is now the only software that requires me to run 32bit binaries on my desktop. Real annoying. reply schmorptron 10 hours agorootparentprevI think it's a longer term play. Step 1) Establish a large enough non-windows userbase with great compatibility tools Step 2) Studios and especially game engine developers notice linux install base Step 3) Some tangible benefit to running natively, if only stability, pops up and the userbase is now large enough to care about it Step 4) Engines, and then games get better native support reply mariusor 8 hours agorootparentI am pretty sure you're wrong.

Based on your prompt, I had another look today. So I went and downloaded this \"whisky\" thing. From their website: \"Experience the latest titles effortlessly with Whisky!\". OK. Installed. I open it and I see a window with \"bottle configuration\" (wtf is a bottle?), an \"open c: drive\" button (???), \"SteamCMD\" whatever that is, \"winetricks\" (??) and a \"run..\" button which opens a file from finder (??). I have absolutely no idea what any of this is or how to proceed.

Crossover is more user friendly but isn’t free. Crossover are the primary developers behind WINE and transitively, Proton. Steam just handles all the configuration elements of proton for the user but essentially it’s doing the same stuff under the hood. reply whateveracct 17 hours agoparentprevMe neither, but it's a shame. Those Apple Silicon chips are solid for gaming. reply shmerl 16 hours agorootparentIf Apple cared about gamers, they wouldn't have blocked proper Vulkan support. They simply don't care. A major reason to stay away from Apple if you are a gamer. reply caseyy 15 hours agorootparentIt’s not the end of the world to develop for macOS and iOS. These platforms are just idiosyncratic and don’t have many serious gamers. Neither smartphones nor Macs have been powerful or ergonomic enough to play current-generation games for decades. So the user base is almost entirely people who don’t play games. For a developer, the juice is not worth the squeeze (and by far!). The platforms are challenging to port for and all that effort seems to result in near-zero sales. All ports seem to be almost guaranteed commercial failures. My key point is that perhaps the platforms are now mature enough to develop for and Metal is alright. But they have not been for a long time and it’s a really bad market to target for a game developer. Unless Apple funds your games like some other platforms do, it’s better to just blow the porting budget on something that’s at least fun. I haven’t heard of anyone’s game funded by Apple, but maybe it happens? These deals are rarely made public. Chicken and the egg. Just my opinion. reply hot_gril 15 hours agorootparentI feel like Apple has the opposite attitude of Microsoft's towards 3p apps in general, not just games. Mac updates will constantly break apps at least minor ways, sometimes major (like 32-bit removal). reply dwaite 10 hours agorootparentMicrosoft's reluctance to break things comes from commercial entities being a big source of licenses both for desktops and backend servers. If some poorly maintained mission-critical app doesn't run on Windows 11 because it hasn't had a recompile in a decade, that means a Global 2000 company isn't able to update their workforce. Apple considers it a partnership with developers, even if that partnership in reality is rather one-sided. If you stop maintaining your software you aren't holding up your end of the partnership. For instance, ignoring six years worth of deprecation warnings about 32 bit software going away, or seven years (and running) warnings about OpenGL support, or still shipping only Intel binaries four years after M1 launched. But this is not how games are supported, except for subscription games like MMOs or crazy edge case labors-of-love like Starcraft. Fixes are going to be driven by a chance at new revenue, like updating to support HiDPI displays properly as part of a major DLC update. Afterthought ports (especially third party ones) like a Windows title to the Mac are even more limited in terms of ongoing support - and are often like-for-like limits to 32 bit intel only because the original developers never tried to write portable code. reply caseyy 15 hours agorootparentprevIt seems that way. For a long time, what Apple didn’t use or specifically wanted on their platforms didn’t get a lot of thought. Most game engines haven’t figured out resolutions and DPI scaling for windowed full-screen games in macOS and for a long time, it didn’t seem like there were many guidelines (bare minimum) or support from Apple. Third party is just not as important as first party to Apple, I think. Which is ironic for a company that has succeeded tremendously off the backs of 3p devs on iOS. But perhaps it’s a different strategy for each product line. And it’s probably been a good strategy to focus on certain areas and not others for them. It’s not all bad, you can definitely port games to Macs with some effort. If it was only worth it, it would be fantastic. Though I’ll say, I think there is a niche for casual games with excellent graphics on Macs now. This niche could be worth a lot of money by the end of the decade, just like casual mobile games. reply dudus 1 hour agorootparentprevWhile this seems counterintuitive Mac makes it very convoluted to release on their platform.

I haven’t heard of anyone’s game funded by Apple, but maybe it happens? These deals are rarely made public. Maybe I'm wrong but I thought/assumed that Valve's work to get Steam and their GoldSource and Source game engines working on Mac was with some sort of support from Apple - I know they did Linux support around the same time but the extra work to get everything working on a Mac wouldn't have been trivial. reply caseyy 15 hours agorootparentNice find, it’s true. That’s the only avenue I see where porting a AAA-style game makes sense for a Mac financially. Left 4 Dead 1 and 2, and several Counter-Strike games were also ported, but CS:GO was later discontinued for Macs. These were done without Apple’s money as I understand. And the discontinuation seems related to support costs on a platform that doesn’t have many gamers. reply jamesfinlayson 14 hours agorootparentYeah I think Valve ported their whole catalogue of games, but I'm not sure what exactly happened with the discontinuation - I thought they quietly dropped the Mac support tag from all of their games two or three months ago, probably because Intel Macs haven't been sold in a few years now? Presumably they didn't want to sink more money into Mac support (they had 11 years worth of Mac usage statistics to back up their decision). reply concinds 13 hours agorootparent> I'm not sure what exactly happened with the discontinuation They didn't update their old games with 64-bit support, and in February they dropped support for the last macOS with 32-bit support (Mojave) because 98% of Mac Steam users had updated to newer OS releases. Mojave (released in 2018) hasn't received security updates in years, and doesn't support the latest CEF, which the Steam client is based on. https://www.tomshardware.com/software/macos/32-bit-mac-holdo... reply caseyy 14 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think Intel v. ARM matters too much once the engine HALs support it natively, or through Rosetta 2. This to me doesn’t seem too bad. The OS APIs and building an ergonomic experience is the challenging part. Supporting APIs is harder than it may seem. That’s graphics, sound, task scheduling and multi threading, I/O for both files and devices, and many more. All these things have different approaches on different OSes, as well as different limits of what is allowed and what is not. Different best practices and degrees of documentation, too. This all then needs to make for a good player experience and meet gamer expectations. It’s a Herculean task. It is even harder, because many graphics APIs, for example, support different features. So either your artists must accommodate and create several versions of skeletal meshes, visual effects, and similar; or your engineers must develop new graphics technologies to compensate automatically. And if that didn’t seem hard enough, try recruiting from a pool of game graphics programmers for macOS without a hot six figures a year burning a hole in your pocket. Now consider this for other APIs, though they are often more standard and less challenging. I could be wrong, but many corners are cut for platforms that don’t have that many players — you just can’t justify the costs it would take to do an excellent port. And that creates pretty deep and difficult to patch issues. The same is seen on games ported to Linux. reply littlecranky67 6 hours agorootparentprev> It’s not the end of the world to develop for macOS and iOS. These platforms are just idiosyncratic and don’t have many serious gamers. That could change if Apple and Valve would team up and make proton-like stuff happen (GamePortingToolkit is a first, but half-assed step). I own a MacMini M2 base model (retailed at 630€ new) for work and was surprised how well games last-gen games run on it (either Rosetta2 or GPTK+wine).

Which prevents things like Wine / Proton from offering decent performance for games there (MoltenVK is not really adequate for that). Being it's Apple, not some kind of poor entity who can claim lack of resources, I'd say they very much on purpose disregard gaming as a use case and therefore it's a strong reason to stay away from Apple to begin with if you do care about it as a user (gamer). reply latexr 9 hours agorootparent> I'd say they very much on purpose disregard gaming as a use case Considering they made Metal, and the Game Porting Toolkit, and Game Center, and specific tabs for games in the App Stores, and Apple Arcade, and added native support for game controllers, and have dedicated sections of their keynotes to gaming, it is pretty clear they don’t disregard gaming as a use case. Tim Cook’s Apple is bad in a lot of ways, but it isn’t that stupid to ignore that lucrative of a market which fell on their lap. What you mean is they’re not embracing gaming the way you want.

And neither understands how the other can have a vastly different personal experience. This extends to any online discussion regarding weight loss/gain, politics, wars, etc. reply ben7799 4 hours agoparentI think people simplify this too much. Fast metabolizer doesn't mean it just doesn't effect you. I am an ultra-fast metabolizer on CYP1A2 based on genetic tests and yet I can still easily get negative side effects from caffeine. This is not an on/off thing, most of these metabolizers are rated on scale of 4 or 5 levels IIRC. I have been told the understanding of some of these metabolizer tests is not that great. They can test for it but they don't really understand how it changes things that well. The bigger thing with these tests is they point towards people of different genetic backgrounds needing different drugs or different doses of some drugs when it comes to certain treatments and that typical drug guidelines are heavily biased towards male patients with typical Northern European genetic characteristics. If you're an ultra-fast caffeine metabolizer there are apparently some drugs that don't work correctly on you. I typically try to limit myself to only 2 caffeine drinks a day. It's possible the tests can be wrong I guess. It's also possible I still metabolize it faster than usual but I have some other thing going on that makes me get jittery or anxious from caffeine easily. I suspect what happens is I just get a rush of the effects and then they wear off faster than usual but with a larger effect. reply wnolens 5 hours agoparentprevOh wow, I'm surprised that this is not common knowledge given how common coffee is. I didn't even know it was a thing. File me under \"A cup of coffee feels like a small dose of MDMA\" reply aantix 4 hours agorootparent1) Slow metabolizers of caffeine have an increased risk of hypertension or a cardiac event with coffee consumption. Whereas fast metabolizers may have net positive health benefits from coffee consumption. 2) We genuinely lack fidelity on so much subjects that we confidently pontificate about. I've read several reports that coffee is a \"net positive\". Imagine niavely following that advice your entire life only to realize you're a slow metabolizer and you've been increasing your risk by consuming? There probably so many aspects to our lives that have genetic components that no one knows about or acknowledges. Even to the point where people will shame others. \"I don't understand, I can drink a whole pot of coffee before bed and sleep like a baby. You'll be fine.\" \"I don't understand, why can't you just eat less and exercise more and then maybe you wouldn't be a fatty?\" They have no clue. reply embwbam 3 hours agorootparentprevFor anyone else who discovers they are a fast metabolizer of coffee: try eating a big breakfast before drinking coffee to slow absorption. I wanted to be a coffee drinker for YEARS, but it made me really high, and I felt super tired later in the day. I don't know why I didn't connect the dots until I searched my genome, but once you know whether you are a fast or slow metabolizer you can play all sorts of games. I can now drink coffee before dinner, and the crash hits right at bedtime. reply BeFlatXIII 50 minutes agorootparentFor me, I found the secret was eating anything other than cereal (or egg & toast) for breakfast. Those seem to make me jittery. Eating something like yesterday's dinner leftovers for breakfast turns the coffee into an on switch instead of leaving me exhausted but adding jitters and sleeplessness. reply seper8 5 hours agorootparentprevLucky you! LOL. Hope it doesnt come with the nasty comedown :P reply wnolens 14 minutes agorootparentIt's a thin silver lining. I can't have coffee multiple days in a row, else I'll experience panic attacks (and in that moment i think I'm going to die, nearly reaching for a phone to call 911). And can't partake in coffee ~95% of the time (friends don't have decaf, a ton of nicer coffee shops don't either, and often decaf is neglected so i'm drinking black water). I still love the taste of coffee, so i've kinda been robbed of that unless i'm at home and can make it myself. reply pazimzadeh 3 hours agoparentprevAlso needs to take into account if/when you're exposed to nicotine since nicotine can affect caffeine metabolism by CYP1A2 depending on your genotype. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3243019/ reply lagniappe 5 hours agoparentprevI think this is me, interesting. reply JoeAltmaier 20 hours agoprevHere's the thing: never mind getting to bed, that will happen when you are tired enough. How about sleeping through the night? A different function with different math. My model is caffeine is well-known for having a half-life, from three to six hours depending. That means a geometric fall in effective caffeine in your system after you go to sleep (you don't continue ingesting caffeine in your sleep do you? Sleep-brewing?) What is the function for 'tired enough'? That is, how does 'sleepiness' decline over the sleep period? Because, when the functions cross (sleepiness drops below the caffeine line) then Awake! That's often about 3AM for me. If the sleepiness function is a different time-constant, or is more nearly linear (as I suspect, as long as you get enough cobbled-together hours of sleep you are functional which sounds like a simple unweighted sum) then inevitably sleepiness will fall faster (cross the caffeine-left-in-system curve). At that point you can get up, knock around doing whatever, getting sleepier again. Once caffeine drops below your remaining sleepiness you can get a few more winks. And wake up shortly after, another hour or half-hour, whatever. Repeat the rest of the night in ever-shorter cycles as your curves both approach the x-axis. Anyway it describes my sleep behavior nearly perfectly. reply jaggederest 14 hours agoparentAnd there are at least 3 different metabolic rates for caffeine, rapid, standard, and slow. As a holder of the slow gene, none of these calculators work for me since for me caffeine has a ~9 hour half life. Caffeine after about 11 am is a bad plan. reply bigiain 13 hours agorootparentPretty sure there's some age related effects too. Over the last ~20 years I've gone from being happily able to drink coffee after dinner, through not being able to drink it after 5pm or so, and now to having the espresso machine automatically shut off at 2:30pm - otherwise my sleep quality plummets. I'm 57 now, I started noticing poor sleep related to late night coffee in my mid 30s. I do got fairly hard earlier in the day though, I've usually had 4 double espressos (somewhere between 17-21g of beans) by mid morning, and usually another one or two before my current self imposed 2:30pm cut off. reply err4nt 12 hours agorootparentIt's so funny but encouraging to read this. I started drinking coffee in college and could easily finish a whole pot, or have 3 Starbucks venti drip coffees in a day, but I was not sensitive to caffeine at all and could sleep right after. It also didn't seem to have that wake-up alertness effect either Then something changed, and now I am sensitive to it like a normal person. It does wake me up after a sip or two I can feel it, and I can easily have 'too much' if I have 2-3 cups in too short of a timespan, so I've had to learn to slow down. Having said all of this, my personal 'last call' is 6pm, with the idea that I will be able to sleep at 12-1am. But if I drink coffee after 6pm I might be delaying that bedtime a little. It will be interesting to learn more about the effects of how much, and how long. Should I be tapering off hours before 'last call'? What is the best 'last call' time in the day and should it be earlier? I'll have to track some of this and figure this out! reply o_nate 5 hours agorootparentprevMy problem isn't falling asleep, it's staying asleep. Restlessness at night has become more noticeable as I've gotten older. Cutting down on caffeine, especially later in the day, seems to have helped some. I now have one cup of coffee in the morning, and a cup or two of tea in the early afternoon. This is instead of the two cups in the morning and espresso in the afternoon that I used to have before. reply pfdietz 5 hours agorootparentYou might try slow release melatonin.

Also you may unknowingly run into medications that inhibit it, which gets more likely as you age and accumulate chronic issues requiring medication. I'm envious of your 100 grams of beans a day consumption - if I have more than about 10g / one single espresso I'm a wreck for the entire day! The area-under-curve for slow metabolizers is 9 times larger - 3x the duration, 3x the concentration. reply dharma1 5 hours agorootparentprevCaffeine metabolism becomes less effective as you age reply dotancohen 9 hours agorootparentprevTry drinking more water. When I drink a lot of water, I feel that I can drink a cup much later in the evening and sleep much better at night. I highly suspect that the water intake and release washes caffeine away with it (e.g. helps with whatever mechanism caffeine is removed be it filtration, chemical, metabolism, etc). There are lots of other benefits to remaining well-hydrated, I wish that I understood this decades ago. reply munksbeer 10 hours agorootparentprevThis is interesting. One thing I am fairly sure about, the amount of caffeine makes a difference to my sleep quality. If I have a single cup of coffee in the morning, no more, then my sleep quality seems not to be impacted. If I have several cups of coffee, only in the morning, I feel great for the morning, very stimulated, but my sleep is impacted. I wake up with a buzzing several times a night and have never been able to understand what is causing the buzzing. reply Rinzler89 5 hours agorootparent>have never been able to understand what is causing the buzzing Most likely it's the leftover caffeine still in your system that's beyond your personal threshold for quality sleep. I have the same issue. If I drink two double espressos very early in the morning and then no more after that for the rest of the day, I have no problem falling asleep at night but I keep waking up several times during the night with a buzz, while my gf can drink 3 coffees per day and an espresso after dinner and still sleep. The only way to get rid of this is reduce my caffeine intake to absolute zero, which is hard when you get the smell and taste of fresh single origin beans. I guess some people are just that much more sensitive to it than others, genetics be dammed. I wish there was a cheap way to measure the caffeine content in the coffees I make so I can precisely determine my personal threshold. reply munksbeer 5 hours agorootparent> have no problem falling asleep at night but I keep waking up several times during the night with a buzz. Yes, that's me.

However, never ever EVER dump your whole genome into a program that will output every match for some potential condition. Now that's not for the reason you might immediately think (\"Oh no look at all the bad stuff\"), but rather because the databases that tools like this use are pretty chock full of junk where some researcher threw in a reference - along with a few thousand others - to say that their particular piece of research implicates this gene at this poistion with this variant. I've seen it with my own eyes, and a lot of it is very low quality. You therefore need highly curated databases where the genotype-phenotype associations are well-defined and thoroughly researched. You'll spend the rest of your life either trying to prove/disprove every potential false positive, or just worrying yourself needlessly. So, yeah, it's not a bad resource to have if you can be responsible with it. reply bick_nyers 5 hours agorootparentHmm, now I'm interested in seeing if an LLM could be finetuned to give an effective quality score on such a study. reply bick_nyers 5 hours agorootparentprevNowadays whole genome sequencing can be done for $300-400 (for 30x WGS, with 100x around $1000?), it's been on my TODO list for a few years. reply FollowingTheDao 7 hours agorootparentprevI had mine run twice through 23andMe just to make sure they didn’t get something wrong. I tried to get my full genome once but the company screwed me over. And I take exception to your “no good news”.

The only question I haven't had time to look into yet is what is the biological effect of previously taken vs newly taken caffeine? Say I had a cup of coffee at 9 am and then have another one at 9+6 hours=3 pm. Assume that 1 cup of coffee has 90 mg of caffeine. Does it mean that at that moment, I will have to track 2 different half-lifes? That is, I have 90/2=45 mg of caffeine from cup #1 and 90 mg of caffeine from cup #2 at 3 pm. Should I just add those up and track the combined amount now or should it be kept separate? I am leaning towards the latter because I think that the effect(i.e. alertness) will be higher with the newly digested caffeine and not the one taken 6 hours ago? No idea how true this is though as I am not a biologist :) reply slwvx 2 hours agoparentIf I were to estimate my blood caffeine, I'd calculate the caffeine right before I took more, add that to the new caffeine, and use that in the exponential decay function. reply alienlike 5 hours agoprevThe HiCoffee app for iOS has been a great resource for me.

As an added bonus, the app has a lot of caffeine data on common drinks on the market. reply niemandhier 9 hours agoprevCool. But to guard your sleep a bit more than just caffeine blood concentration is needed. Caffeine will influence your sleep schedule by influencing your cicardian clock via its effect on the underlying signaling. That effect stacks with that of bright light etc, so half-life is not enough.

It took around six months to get past the additional fatigue after quiting. There seems to be some long term effect on me way beyond the half life. Does everyone else get past the effects of going cold turkey in a matter of hours? reply systems_glitch 7 hours agoparentI went cold turkey after developing a facial tic and realizing I was consuming 1000 - 1200 mg of caffeine a day (mostly coffee, French press and canned, with some energy drinks too). I was 100% not aware that caffeine is physically addictive and causes receptor changes in your brain. Aside from withdrawal symptoms (joint aches and pains for me), the fatigue didn't fully go away after several months. What did \"fix\" it was bringing it up to my doctor at my yearly checkup -- I explained that my mystery joint pains from a few years ago were almost certainly physical symptoms of caffeine withdrawal. This led to \"why in the world were you consuming that much?!\" questions and an eventual diagnosis of adult ADHD (likely lifelong and never diagnosed). 10 mg of generic ritalin twice a day and not only is the no-caffeine fatigue gone, but I basically don't tolerate caffeine anymore and have zero desire to consume it. Fortunately the local coffee roaster has a decaf :P I love coffee with or without the caffeine. reply cruffle_duffle 4 hours agorootparentNot to intrude but I highly recommend you “play around” with longer acting ADHD meds. Generic short acting Ritalin is the worst. It doesn’t last long and you can “feel it go away”. There are much better meds that have the same underlying drug but in much better delivery mechanisms. I’m sure you’ve done the homework but if anybody is reading who hasn’t… if generic short acting ritalin works, great! You know you respond to stimulant adhd meds.

I think gradual decrease would make it easier but it would take longer. You might need to step down to one cup of coffee/tea a day for 6 months before quitting. I ended up mixing small amounts of instant coffee with decaf instant coffee so that at the end of the day it was like I had only consumed one cup of coffee. I only did that for a few weeks and then just quit altogether and still got huge fatigue. I have recently started going for runs almost every day and that has helped me a lot so you may be in a better position if you exercise.

The \"Coffee Nap\" is where your drink a cup of coffee (quickly, I guess), then lay down for 10-20 minutes to rest, and by the time you get up the caffeine will begin to kick in. I find that process to be a bit more stress-inducing. reply toyg 5 hours agoparentprevFrom what I understand (I'm not a scientist), caffeine doesn't \"give\" you energy, but rather makes your body ignore the tiredness, by turning off some of the machinery that would make you feel tired. By having coffee in the morning and then in the afternoon, you build a \"high\" of caffeine that forces most of your \"alert systems\" to shut down. Once the peak wears off though, your body starts remembering to alert you to tiredness, which by then is often multiplied by the fact that by ignoring tiredness you've pushed your system hard when it was already tired. Hence you might feel like crashing. On top of that, caffeine de-hydrates, so if you've not had enough water, your body will start to crawl. On top of that, a lot (most?) people will have sugar with their coffee, and often quite a lot of it. Sugar can cause similar \"crashes\", particularly in the obese (like me), and obviously this combines with the abovementioned items. reply martinpw 2 hours agorootparent> From what I understand (I'm not a scientist), caffeine doesn't \"give\" you energy, but rather makes your body ignore the tiredness, by turning off some of the machinery that would make you feel tired. I have heard this too, but it doesn't feel like this to me, it feels like a stimulant getting me to a state above and beyond the one I would be in without the caffeine. There are also a lot of references to caffeine as a stimulant. So what is really going on? reply vren 5 hours agoparentprevAre you having coffee with milk? Casein/whey allergies affect a single-digit number of the population and can lead to feelings of sluggishness. Try black/almond/oat/etc. reply dr_orpheus 4 hours agoparentprevYeah, I have had this feeling as well. I don't think it is a direct cause of the coffee consumption and is more of an association that the tiredness is still building rapidly at the time you decide you need an afternoon pick-me-up. There is a hysteresis in the caffeine actually kicking in leading to the perception that drinking that cup of coffee in the afternoon is making you more tired. My understanding (I don't have any experience in any bioscience, just an avid coffee consumer) is caffeine works because it blocks receptors of adenosine which has a depressive effect and is a signaler that makes you tired. While the caffeine is blocking these receptors, the adenosine is still building up. So once the caffeine starts to wear off all of the adenosine comes rushing in to those receptors and you start to crash. Drinking more caffeine after you have started to feel tired now takes longer for the caffeine molecules to start to muscle in and start filling those receptors again. If you can start to clear out the tiredness receptors ahead of the caffeine hitting them it will make the caffeine more effective. This has led some people to start taking a \"coffee nap\" where you drink you afternoon coffee, immediately take a short nap to help the caffeine be even more effective when you wake up. reply byyoung3 2 hours agoprev3pm as a limit seems to work pretty well for me. reply bilsbie 8 hours agoprevCoffee must have a very different half life in me.

I can’t tolerate the amount in decaf coffee. reply aliljet 12 hours agoprevDoes this work to assess each individual'd actual caffeine half life? Every individual is metabolizing caffeine at a different rate... reply danielbarla 12 hours agoparentIndeed, and the variance on this number is surprisingly large. From [1]: > The mean half-life of caffeine in plasma of healthy individuals is about 5 hours. However, caffeine's elimination half-life may range between 1.5 and 9.5 hours, while the total plasma clearance rate for caffeine is estimated to be 0.078 L/h/kg (Brachtel and Richter, 1992; Busto et al., 1989). This wide range in the plasma mean half-life of caffeine is due to both innate individual variation, and a variety of physiological and environmental characteristics that influence caffeine metabolism (e.g., pregnancy, obesity, use of oral contraceptives, smoking, altitude). On the one end of the scale, it'd be nigh-undetectable within a few hours, and on the other end, significantly present for 24 hours+. I suspect estimating this number is also fairly difficult. I mean, I have some idea of the _outcome_ of what happens if I drink coffee at say 6PM, but I have little way of reversing this into a half-life number.

But in the last few years I started to get mild insomnia in the beginning of the night if I had coffee late in the day.

Meanwhile I can't sleep until 8 hours after drinking coffee. I don't know whether this is differing sensitivity to coffee or something else (better production of whatever it is that makes you tired at night perhaps). A clear and curious correlation is this: The same people that can drink coffee late can and do take naps during the day too. That is: if they lie down in the middle of the afternoon, they could sleep for a little while. That's completely foreign to me, I have never in my soon 50 year life been able to take a daytime nap (at least not since I was 5). It's curious that it seems like a related capability, in my small sample. reply carabiner 13 hours agoparentprevThis is called tolerance.

Tesla also announced joining the Ultra Ethernet Consortium (UEC) to share this protocol and work to standardize a new high-speed/low-latency fabric (be that TTPoE or otherwise) for AI/ML/Datacenters -- desiring a non-proprietary, low cost, distributed congestion control, standard EthernetII frame, and non-centralized interconnect protocol to commoditize and accelerate technical progress. In TTPoE, just like TCP, dropped packets and replays are the acceptable default behavior, yet full transmission is guaranteed. TTPoE's initial deployment was for the Tesla Dojo v1 project, where the protocol executed entirely in hardware and deployed to a very large multi-ExaFlops (fp16) supercomputer with over 10s of thousands of concurrent endpoints. This protocol does not need a CPU or OS to be involved in any way to link and execute. If you came here to be impressed by something complex and clever, you won't be. The protocol is designed on basic fundamentals -- simple transport and to the point. Ethernet transport in essence is only intended to move data from point A to B and should be limited by physics -- not software execution time. Centralized congestion management of extremely large scale machines (just like the internet) is a fool's errand -- each endpoint should be resiliant and self-managing.

RDMA over Converged Ethernet suffices perfectly well for whatever an \"AI/ML/Datacenter\" is and if we're being fair, the lackadaisical approach to the documentation suggests that they may not be taking it as seriously as they could anyway. If Tesla were really seeking to shake things up they wouldnt have picked IPv4 to do it when the newest release has been around for nearly 30 years and has latency reduction baked in. this smacks of a pandersome attempt from a company that sees the quite mandarin writing on the walls and has decided (in true Muskovite fashion) they too are just a misunderstood font of futurism. reply pclmulqdq 30 minutes agoparentRoCE sends huge packets down the wire. TCP has the wrong abstraction for truly high performance. I wouldn't necessarily standardize what Tesla does here, but most of the big companies have their own layer 3 transport protocol for things that need truly high speed and are operating within a datacenter. Cray/HPE has their own Ethernet-based protocol (Slingshot was an earlier version of it - not sure what its name is now) which seems to be better than whatever Tesla has, but is not necessarily published. reply FuriouslyAdrift 5 hours agoprevBe interesting to see how this stacks up to the dominant protocol in supercomputers/ai clusters : Infiniband. reply nine_k 3 hours agoparentAFAICT this is very much about handling unreliable links and congestion control.

It's intended for use on managed internal data centre networks. It skips OSI layers to gain speed and probably do 100% hardware routing with FPGAs. It's of no interest on the internet or any small scale netwwork. reply KaiserPro 5 hours agorootparent> fibre channel protocol Apart from FC is is explicitly lossless and ordered reply bcrl 3 hours agorootparentFC is not entirely lossless. One ticket I had the joy of dealing with involved a customer using a Fibre Channel network for their storage using multipathd for failover. In theory it was a fully redundant configuration with dual FC ports on the server with each one going to a different FC switch all the way back to the SAN. However, the system was generating I/O errors on large writes while small writes would succeed. Needless to say that ext4 failed horribly, and there were worries that it was a kernel bug in the FC driver. After a good amount of back and forth with the customer, and several test programs run on the system in question, I eventually came up with a hypothesis that there was an error in the write path of the SAN as small writes succeeded while larger writes failed. The customer ultimately found there was a dirty fibre on one of the links in their FC fabric. It was dirty enough to corrupt large packets, but not so dirty that smaller writes and control packets were unable to get through. Since multipathd only checks to see if a given target can be read from, it would never fail over to the other path (which was fine). So much for trying to build a high availability system using an expensive SAN! Lesson of the story: what you think is a lossless network is not always lossless. Using the IP stack has a lot of beneficial diagnostic tools that you really start missing when something goes awry in a non-IP network. reply KaiserPro 31 minutes agorootparentFC should be able to detect errors. I've had alerts shout at me when an FC switch detects a dropped packet. More over, the multi-path should have stopped that! it should have detected a bad link and failed over to the other one (but the config for that is hard, so I can see why that might not worked. ) reply stonogo 2 hours agorootparentprevBroken hardware does not make the protocol lossy. I think you're misunderstanding what 'lossless' is intended to mean in this context; it does not mean that it is error-free. In a lossy protocol, missing data is not necessarily an error. In a lossless protocol, missing data is treated as an error, which is consistent with what you experienced. reply delfinom 5 hours agorootparentprevElon just doesn't want to pay Nvidia for Infiniband.

EtherCAT is my personal favorite. reply DannyBee 5 hours agorootparent+1 - ethercat and profinet are the way. Random guessing - Ethercat seems more likely to take over for CAN because CoE (canopen over ethercat) is so common. It's very easy to turn CAN devices into ethercat ones.

    "originBody": "The Intelligence Age September 23, 2024 In the next couple of decades, we will be able to do things that would have seemed like magic to our grandparents. This phenomenon is not new, but it will be newly accelerated. People have become dramatically more capable over time; we can already accomplish things now that our predecessors would have believed to be impossible. We are more capable not because of genetic change, but because we benefit from the infrastructure of society being way smarter and more capable than any one of us; in an important sense, society itself is a form of advanced intelligence. Our grandparents – and the generations that came before them – built and achieved great things. They contributed to the scaffolding of human progress that we all benefit from. AI will give people tools to solve hard problems and help us add new struts to that scaffolding that we couldn’t have figured out on our own. The story of progress will continue, and our children will be able to do things we can’t. It won’t happen all at once, but we’ll soon be able to work with AI that helps us accomplish much more than we ever could without AI; eventually we can each have a personal AI team, full of virtual experts in different areas, working together to create almost anything we can imagine. Our children will have virtual tutors who can provide personalized instruction in any subject, in any language, and at whatever pace they need. We can imagine similar ideas for better healthcare, the ability to create any kind of software someone can imagine, and much more. With these new abilities, we can have shared prosperity to a degree that seems unimaginable today; in the future, everyone’s lives can be better than anyone’s life is now. Prosperity alone doesn’t necessarily make people happy – there are plenty of miserable rich people – but it would meaningfully improve the lives of people around the world. Here is one narrow way to look at human history: after thousands of years of compounding scientific discovery and technological progress, we have figured out how to melt sand, add some impurities, arrange it with astonishing precision at extraordinarily tiny scale into computer chips, run energy through it, and end up with systems capable of creating increasingly capable artificial intelligence. This may turn out to be the most consequential fact about all of history so far. It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I’m confident we’ll get there. How did we get to the doorstep of the next leap in prosperity? In three words: deep learning worked. In 15 words: deep learning worked, got predictably better with scale, and we dedicated increasing resources to it. That’s really it; humanity discovered an algorithm that could really, truly learn any distribution of data (or really, the underlying “rules” that produce any distribution of data). To a shocking degree of precision, the more compute and data available, the better it gets at helping people solve hard problems. I find that no matter how much time I spend thinking about this, I can never really internalize how consequential it is. There are a lot of details we still have to figure out, but it’s a mistake to get distracted by any particular challenge. Deep learning works, and we will solve the remaining problems. We can say a lot of things about what may happen next, but the main one is that AI is going to get better with scale, and that will lead to meaningful improvements to the lives of people around the world. AI models will soon serve as autonomous personal assistants who carry out specific tasks on our behalf like coordinating medical care on your behalf. At some point further down the road, AI systems are going to get so good that they help us make better next-generation systems and make scientific progress across the board. Technology brought us from the Stone Age to the Agricultural Age and then to the Industrial Age. From here, the path to the Intelligence Age is paved with compute, energy, and human will. If we want to put AI into the hands of as many people as possible, we need to drive down the cost of compute and make it abundant (which requires lots of energy and chips). If we don’t build enough infrastructure, AI will be a very limited resource that wars get fought over and that becomes mostly a tool for rich people. We need to act wisely but with conviction. The dawn of the Intelligence Age is a momentous development with very complex and extremely high-stakes challenges. It will not be an entirely positive story, but the upside is so tremendous that we owe it to ourselves, and the future, to figure out how to navigate the risks in front of us. I believe the future is going to be so bright that no one can do it justice by trying to write about it now; a defining characteristic of the Intelligence Age will be massive prosperity. Although it will happen incrementally, astounding triumphs – fixing the climate, establishing a space colony, and the discovery of all of physics – will eventually become commonplace. With nearly-limitless intelligence and abundant energy – the ability to generate great ideas, and the ability to make them happen – we can do quite a lot. As we have seen with other technologies, there will also be downsides, and we need to start working now to maximize AI’s benefits while minimizing its harms. As one example, we expect that this technology can cause a significant change in labor markets (good and bad) in the coming years, but most jobs will change more slowly than most people think, and I have no fear that we’ll run out of things to do (even if they don’t look like “real jobs” to us today). People have an innate desire to create and to be useful to each other, and AI will allow us to amplify our own abilities like never before. As a society, we will be back in an expanding world, and we can again focus on playing positive-sum games. Many of the jobs we do today would have looked like trifling wastes of time to people a few hundred years ago, but nobody is looking back at the past, wishing they were a lamplighter. If a lamplighter could see the world today, he would think the prosperity all around him was unimaginable. And if we could fast-forward a hundred years from today, the prosperity all around us would feel just as unimaginable.",

LLMs exist and they pass the Turing Test, which was something we couldn't have said or even hoped for a few years ago. Additionally, they have an IQ of 90 - 120, depending on which one you are working with. But LLMs aren't good at all things nor in all ways, and they have strange failure modes. And so what will happen now, and is already happening, is that we'll (re)design programming tools and languages such that they are the kind of thing that LLMs are suited to using well. This will be part of the process of figuring out how LLMs work. There will be a virtuous cycle, and it has begun. Better tools will increasingly mean, \"tools that LLMs are good at using.\" That's where the puck will be. reply samudranb 3 minutes agoparentprevThe way I think of it - we need a wrapper interface over our existing healthcare system so that any other entities and systems interfacing with the current one can continue to do so.

Six months ago, he probably could have gotten away with saying this and there would have likely have been enough people who were still impressed enough with the trajectory of LLMs to back him on it.

Each new generation gets even better at that prediction, but still hits its weird stumbling points, because its still the same algorithm, and that algorithm cannot do what he is ascribing to it.

Over the last, say, five years, a pile of 50+ year problems have been toppled by the deep learning + data + compute combo. This includes language modeling (divorced from reasoning), image generation, audio generation, audio separation, image segmentation, protein folding, and so on. (Audio separation is particularly close to my heart; the 'cocktail party problem' has been a challenge in audio processing for 100+ years, and we now have great unsupervised separation algorithms (MixIT), which hardly anyone knows about. That's an indicator of how much great stuff is happening right now.) So, when we look at some of our known 'big' problems in AI/ML, we ask, 'what's the horizon for figuring this out?' Let's look at reasoning... We know how to do 'reasoning' with GOFAI, and we've got interesting grafts of LLMs+GOFAI for some specific problems (like the game of Diplomacy, or some of the math olympiad solvers). \"LLMs which can reason\" is a problem which has only been open for a year or two tops, and which we're already seeing some interesting progress on.

My first attempt was terrible, because I didn’t have an intuition for how light propagates through a material. After a bit of chatting with ChatGPT, I had an understanding and some direction of where to go. To actually approach the problem properly I decided to run some Monte Carlo light transport simulations against an .obj of my diffuser exported from Fusion 360. The problem was, the software I’m using only supports directional lights with uniform intensity, while the LEDs I’m using have a graph in their datasheet showing light intensity per degree away from orthogonal to the LED SMD component. I copy pasted the directional light implementation from the light transport library as well as the light-intensity-by-degree chat from the LED datasheet and asked Claude to write code to write a light source that samples photons from a disc of size x with the probability of emission by angle governed by the chat from the datasheet. A few iterations later and I had a working simulation which I then verified back against the datasheet chart. Without AI this would have been a long long process of brushing up on probability, vector math, manually transcribing the chart.

If we forgot all the knowledge preserved by language it would take us the same effort to recover as the first time around. I think all progress comes from search - search for experience (data), and search for understanding (data compression). This feeds on itself, but is coupled with the search space - the real world. And the world is not eager to tell us all its secrets.

For something that profoundly changes the world, it's bad to base your hopes on assumptions. I see people dunking on llms which might not be AI's final form.

The steam engine and subsequent Industrial Revolution created a lot of jobs and economic productivity, sure, but a huge amount of those jobs were dirty, dangerous factory jobs, and the lion's share of the productivity was ultimately captured by robber barons for quite some time. The increase in standard of living could only be seen in aggregate on pages of statistics from the mahogany-paneled offices of Standard Oil, while the lives of the individuals beneath those papers more often resembled Sinclair's Jungle. Altman's suggestion that avoiding AI capture by the rich merely requires more compute is laughable. We have enormous amounts of compute currently, and its productivity is already captured by a small number of people compared to the vast throngs that power civilization in total. Why would AI make this any different? The average person does not understand how AI works and does not have the resources to utilize it.

AI is a side-show. Intelligence is ambient in living tissue, so we already have as much intelligence as is adaptive. We don't need more. As talking apes made out of soggy mud wrapped around calcium twigs living in the greasy layer between hard vacuum and a droplet of lava which in turn is orbiting a puddle of hydrogen in the hem of the skirt of a black hole our problems are just not that complicated. Heck, we are surrounded by four-billion year-old self-improving nanotechnology that automatically provides almost all our physical needs. It's even solar-powered! The whole life-support system was fully automatic until we fucked it up in our ignorance. But we're no longer ignorant, eh? The vast majority of our problems today are the result of our incredible resounding success. We have the solutions we need. Most of them were developed in the 1970's when the oil got expensive for a few minutes. Must we boil the oceans just to have a talking computer tell us to get on with it? Can't we just do like the Wizard of Oz? Have a guy in a box with a voice changer and a fancy light show tell us to \"love each other\"? Mechanical Turk God? We can use holograms. reply dbspin 23 minutes agoparentExistential horror of this whole conversation aside, this is a beautifully written comment.

Something tells me he rolled this himself. Clearly he's trying to coin a term for personal legacy reasons, and I say godspeed. Holocene is a little vague, the information age is too entrenched to get anyone's attention, a/the singular age / the singularity are way too deeply associated with the doomer community, and the cybernetic age (a term coined for academia!) is too associated with playful science fiction. I'm personally rooting for cognitive being the word of the next few decades, but that's just a shout from the sidelines. Only time will tell what humanity latches on to, but I wouldn't be surprised if this blog post/subdomain was referenced in a Wikipedia page's Etymology section in 10-15 years... Although this blog post & discussion has my anxiety at an 8, something's oddly comforting about the thought of Sam Altman fiddling with tailwind classes to get his profound aesthetic just-right. Something undeniably relatable and human. Hate the man all you want (I do!), but he's clearly acting in some sort of good faith. reply breck 5 minutes agorootparent> Clearly he's trying to coin a term You are right. I overlooked the simplicity of the headline. Thanks for calling attention to that. > Something tells me he rolled this himself. This would be cool. > I'm personally rooting for cognitive being the word of the next few decades I like that one too. > he's clearly acting in some sort of good faith. He's always been one to think and write for himself. Huge respect for him. Even though it needles me every moment that they still call themselves \"Open\"AI, I have so much respect for the guy, especially because PG basically told the world he was the next Michael Jordan of startups, and he actually went and fulfilled that. Not many people have it in them to live up to hype like that (Lebron being the only other one I can think of OOTOMH) reply leetharris 1 hour agoprevI like Sam's philosophy on this and I generally agree with him. However, I do not like how all the wealthy AI people are hand-waving the massive labor market shift in the coming years. > As one example, we expect that this technology can cause a significant change in labor markets (good and bad) in the coming years, but most jobs will change more slowly than most people think, and I have no fear that we’ll run out of things to do (even if they don’t look like “real jobs” to us today). People have an innate desire to create and to be useful to each other, and AI will allow us to amplify our own abilities like never before. As a society, we will be back in an expanding world, and we can again focus on playing positive-sum games. It's very easy as an extremely rich person to just say, \"don't worry, in the end it'll be better for all of us.\" Maybe that's true on a societal scale, but these are people's entire worlds being destroyed. Imagine you went to college for a medical specialty for 8-10 years, you come out as an expert, and 2 years later that entire field is handled by AI and salaries start to tank. Imagine you have been a graphic designer for 20 years supporting your 3 children and bam a diffusion model can do your job for a fraction of the cost. Imagine you've been a stenographer working in courtrooms to support your ill parents and suddenly ASR can do your job better than you can. This is just simple stuff we can connect the dots on now. There will be orders of magnitude more shifts that we can't even imagine right now. To someone like Sam, everything will be fine. He can handle the massive societal shift because he has options. Every a moderately wealthy person will be OK. But the entire middle class is going to start really freaking the fuck out soon as more and more jobs disappear. You're already seeing anti-AI sentiment all over the web. Even in expert circles, you can see skepticism. People saying things like, \"how do I opt out of Apple Intelligence?\" People don't WANT more grammar correction or AI emojis in their lives, they just want to survive and thrive and own a house. How are we going to handle this? Sam's words of \"if we could fast-forward a hundred years from today, the prosperity all around us would feel just as unimaginable\" doesn't mean shit to a family of 4 who went through layoffs in the year 2025 because AI took their job while Microsoft's stock grows 50%. reply s3tt3mbr1n1 1 hour agoparentFor this reason I read Andrew Yang’s “The War on Normal People”.

As someone who's been working on AI theory full time for ~1 year, I desperately wish we could go back to the days of my faraway youth (5 years ago) before intuition was cracked on accident by spellcheck algorithms. I agree with him that it holds the key to massive prosperity, but selfishly, it's gonna upend my life and the lives of everyone I love. Already has for me, as I grapple with how to (ethically) pay rent while spending all day lighting the Warning Beacons of Gondor... The only real answer, IMHO, is to vote for political systems that put control of society (and AI) in the hands of the public. Call it socialism, call it Georgism, call it anarcho-free-market-space-communism, call it whatever you want; there's no way that \"a tiny number of people have immense inherited power\" (capitalism) and \"people fundamentally understand themselves as members of a tribe put in opposition to all other tribes by default\" (nationalism) mesh well with an intelligence explosion. Here's to hoping the haters are right, and we all turn out to be wrong!

    "commentBody": "Alan Turing's 1950 manual for the Mark I electronic computer [pdf] (computerhistory.org)127 points by lisper 5 hours agohidepastfavorite31 comments adrian_b 3 hours agoThis Ferranti Mark I computer is notable because, despite being one of the earliest electronic computers, its instruction set included 4 instructions that are now included in most modern ISAs, but which have been missing for many decades from the instruction sets of most later computers, with the exception of the supercomputers made by CDC and Cray. Those 4 instructions, with their mnemonics in the Intel/AMD x86 CPUs are: LZCNT (leading zero bits count), which was named \"The position of the most significant digit\" in this manual. POPCNT (population count), which was named \"Sideways adder\" in Mark I (it is listed in a table at the end of this manual). RDRAND (read random number), which was named \"The random numbers generator\" in this manual. RDTSC (read time stamp counter), \"The clock\" in this manual. It is said that some or even all of these less usual instructions had been suggested by Alan Turing himself to the designers of Ferranti Mark I. Another notable instruction of Ferranti Mark I was used to produce an audible beep, like the internal loudspeaker of the older IBM PC compatibles, \"The hooter\" in this manual. reply fsckboy 2 minutes agoparentto save you time, this is a summary of the links various people here are posting: popcnt of a word counts the number of bits that are \"1\" https://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?t=38521 the NSA wanted to do cryptanalysis on intercepted messages, and since the CDC 6000 had 60-bit words, one word was enough to store most alphabets they were interested in. They were able to: Split a message into lines Set a bit for each unique character they encountered per line Use popcount to count the distinct characters Use the count as a hash for further cryptanalysis Curiously, popcount seems to have disappeared from instruction sets between the mid-1970s and the mid-2000s, so there has to be more to it than cryptographic applications to explain its return. (of course for all we know this could be NSA disinformation ;) reply dboreham 3 hours agoparentprevMen in black always want popcount (it's been added to various architectures over the years at their request) so this makes sense given his background. reply kichimi 3 hours agorootparent>Men in black always want popcount (it's been added to various architectures over the years at their request) I've heard this a few times, do you have anything that explains this? reply adrian_b 2 hours agorootparentIt is said that NSA has requested the addition of POPCNT to the Control Data Corporation CDC 6600 (1964), as a condition for procurement. The condition has remained in force later, so all its successors, like CDC 7600 (1969) or Cray-1 (1976), have included POPCNT. POPCNT has been added to the x86 ISA by AMD, in \"Barcelona\", in 2007, presumably because some customer for AMD Opteron has requested it. This happened during the period when the AMD server CPUs were much better than the Intel Xeons, so any wise customer was buying Opterons, not Xeons. Intel has followed AMD and it has added POPCNT to Nehalem, in 2008/2009 (for server CPUs, Nehalem has been the first that was better for any purpose than the AMD server CPUs, unlike for consumer CPUs, where Intel had surpassed AMD already since the middle of 2007, with Core 2). reply SoftTalker 24 minutes agorootparent> POPCNT has been added to the x86 ISA by AMD, in \"Barcelona\", in 2007, presumably because some customer for AMD Opteron has requested it.

It has you start programming in binary, and then just tells you how to make your own mnemonics to substitute for having to write out each 8-bit input. So you end up picking them based on what commands appear most often in practice. One instruction I ended up creating was JNEQCI, \"jump if not equal, comparing to immediate\". (jump if not equal where the first operand is treated as a register and the second as a constant/immediate value) [1] from LevelHead, and similar to nand2tetris in that you build a computer from its circuits and then program it reply cmehdy 1 hour agorootparentAll Zachtronics games are a strong recommend for anybody who doesn't already know them.

Also when the 132 character wide terminal standard was born. Thats’s another valid interpretation of desktop. reply adrian_b 1 hour agorootparentThe width of 132 characters was the width of the line printers, which were the main output device of the first commercial electronic computers. The line printers had been designed from the beginning as computer peripherals, because previously there was no need for such high printing speeds. They were called line printers because all 132 characters of a line were printed simultaneously, by impact. The first computers were not multitasking, so they could not be used for anything else while printing. Because of this, a very high printing speed was necessary, which required the development of the line printers. Later, when printing no longer blocked the execution of other tasks, the very expensive line printers could be replaced in many cases by cheaper printers, like dot-matrix printers or daisy-wheel printers. Many more recent operating systems, like Unix or MS-DOS, have kept the abbreviation LPT for printers, even if by that time the line printers were already obsolete and they were very seldom encountered. All early experimental computers used teletype machines for interactive communication with the computer. In the later commercial computers, teletypes continued to be used for the operator console, while the batch jobs of the non-privileged computer users would have had only the line printer or the card puncher as output peripherals. If there have ever been any teletypes with an output width greater than 80 columns, they must have been very seldom used. At the standard typewriter pitch of 10 cpi, 132 characters require paper with the width of 14 inches (including the perforated margins). That would have required a huge teletype. I do not believe that such a big teletype has existed. reply zabzonk 51 minutes agorootparent> do not believe that such a big teletype has existed. Decwriter II, according to wkipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECwriter. I've actually used one of these, but I can't remember the printing width. reply adrian_b 29 minutes agorootparentThanks for the link. Nevertheless, I see that Decwriter II was not a true teletype. It was a teletype emulator derived from a dot-matrix printer and it was introduced very late in the evolution of computers, in 1974, at a time when the true teletypes had already become obsolete and more than two decades after the line printers that have established the standard width of 132 characters. Decwriter II could provide a width of 132 characters only because the dot-matrix printer on which it was based was built to be able to use the standard line printer continuous perforated paper of 14 inches, like most other dot-matrix printers. It is likely that Decwriter II has been used much more often as a remote teleprinter than as an interactive teletype and in the latter case it was used only because some users were forced to use it because their bosses did not buy decent computer terminals for them. reply joshdavham 3 hours agoprevIt’s interesting to see how he had to write math in this paper. Instead of being able to type it, he had to leave spaces and fill it with his own handwriting.

So both the handwritten title about Ferranti Mark I and the typed title about Manchester Mark II are right. Only the name of the PDF file is wrong.

Fwiw I don't think SSH adds the include line upstream. Most distros add it now. reply krab 12 hours agoprevA bit less terrible way in my opinion: Find a dedicated server provider and rent the hardware. These companies rent some part of the datacenter (or sometimes build their own). Bonus points if they offer KVM - as in remote console, not the Linux hypervisor. Also ask if they do hardware monitoring and proactively replace the failed parts. All of this is still way cheaper than cloud. Usually with unmetered networking. Way less hassle. They'll even take your existing stuff and put it into the same rack with the rented hardware. The difference from cloud, apart from the price, is mainly that they have a sales rep instead of an API. And getting a server may take a from few hours to a few days. But in the end you get the same SSH login details you would get from a cloud provider. Or, if you really want to just collocate your boxes, the providers offer \"remote hands\" service, so you can have geo-redundancy or just choose a better deal instead of one that's physically close to your place. reply vidarh 11 hours agoparentThis. I used to colo lots of stuff, but now mostly use Hetzner. But there are many in this space, and some of them even offer an API. And some of them (like Hetzner) also offer at least basic cloud services, so you can mix and match (which allows for even steeper cost cuts - instead of loading your dedicated hardware to 60% or whatever you're comfortable with to have headroom, you can load it higher and scale into their cloud offering to handle spikes). The boundary where colo and dedicated server offerings intersect in price tend to be down to land and power costs - Hetzner finally became the cheaper option for me as London land values skyrocketed relative to their locations in Germany, and colo prices with them. (We could have looked at coko somewhere remote, but the savings would've been too low to be worth it) reply rsanheim 11 hours agoparentprevOne hurdle that many companies who have only known cloud hosting will face here is significant: how do you find a reliable, trustworthy datacenter? One who actually monitors the hardware and also has a real human if your networking access gets screwed or if you need a critical component swapped at 2 am on a Saturday. I used to have a short list of trustworthy companies like this I'd recommend to clients ~20 years ago when doing consulting. I think 3/4 of them have been gobbled up by private equity chop shops or are just gone. Nowadays noone gets fired for going with AWS, or resold AWS with a 100% markup from a 'private enterprise cloud' provider. reply jareklupinski 5 hours agorootparent> how do you find a reliable, trustworthy datacenter? drive to a few, and shake some hands. in my exp, the difference between colos is usually \"actual SOC2/ISO compliance\" on one side, and \"there are no locked doors between the parking lot and my rack\" on the other, with not much in-between that's not for some specialty (radio), and these things can only really be seen for yourself reply hedora 4 hours agorootparentThat’s unfortunate. I consider SoC 2 compliance as a negative indicator of security (I’ve been on the vendor side of it, and have seen it have significant negative impacts on security and reliability in multiple organizations). Ideally, there’d be locked doors, and the data center wouldn’t be subsidizing performative checkboxing. reply chpatrick 9 hours agorootparentprevI think if you want to host in Europe then Hetzner is the clear choice. They won't monitor your hardware for you though, you need to let them know if something breaks and they'll replace it very quickly. reply krab 11 hours agorootparentprevYou're right you need to find a company you can trust. And for a lot of startups it really makes sense to use AWS. But if you do something resource or bandwidth intensive (and I'm not even talking about Llama now), the costs add up quickly. In our case, switching to AWS would increase our costs by an equivalent of 4 - 8 devs salaries. After AWS discounts. That's a hard sell in a 15-person team even though half of our infra costs already are with AWS (S3). reply vidarh 11 hours agorootparentI often recommend a \"embrace, extend, extinguish\" approach to AWS: Starting there for simplicity is fine, then \"wrap\" anything bandwidth intensive with caches elsewhere (every 1TB in egress from AWS will pay for a fleet of Hetzner instances with 5TB included, or one or more dedicated servers). Gradually shift workloads, leaving anything requiring super-high durability last (optionally keeping S3, or competitors, as a backup storage option) as getting durability right is one of the more difficult things to get confidence in and most dangerous ones to get wrong. Wrapping S3 with a write-through cache setup can often be the biggest cost win if your egress costs are high. Sometimes caching the entire dataset is worth it, sometimes just a small portion. reply amluto 5 hours agorootparent> Wrapping S3 with a write-through cache setup can often be the biggest cost win if your egress costs are high.

Is there an off the shelf implementation of this? reply vidarh 4 hours agorootparentI usually just use a suitable Nginx config unless there's a compelling reason. It means you \"waste\" the first read - you just let post/put etc. hit S3, and just case reads, but it's easier to get right. It's rare this matters (if your reads are rare enough relative to writes that avoiding the cost of the first read matters, odds are the savings from this are going to be questionable anyway - the big benefit here comes when reads dominate massively) reply mbreese 5 hours agorootparentprevMinio used to support this, but removed the feature a while back. It was called “gateway mode”. Sadly, I know that doesn’t help much now… https://blog.min.io/deprecation-of-the-minio-gateway/amp/ reply amluto 41 minutes agorootparentEvery time I contemplate increasing my use of S3 or similar cloud services, I get annoyed at the extremely sorry state of anything on-prem that replicates to S3. Heck, even confirming that one has uploaded one's files correctly is difficult. You can extract MD5 (!) signatures from most object storage systems, but only if you don't use whatever that particular system calls a multipart upload. You can often get CRC32 (gee thanks). With AWS, but not most competing systems, you can do a single-part upload and opt into \"object integrity\" and get a real hash in the inventory. You cannot ask for a hash after the fact. I understand why computing a conventional cryptographically-secure has is challenging in a multipart upload (but that actually all that bad). But would it kill the providers to have first-class support for something like BLAKE3? BLAKE3 is a tree hash: one can separately hash multiple parts (with a priori known offsets, but that's fine for most APIs but maybe not Google's as is), assemble them into a whole in logarithmic time and memory, and end up with a hash that actually matches what b3sum would have output on the whole file. And one could even store some metadata and thereby allow downloading part of a large file and proving that one got the right data. (And AWS could even charge for that!) But no, verifying the contents of one's cloud object storage bucket actually sucks, and it's very hard to be resistant to errors that occur at upload time. reply krab 11 hours agorootparentprevWell, S3 is hard to beat for our use case. We make a heavy use of their various tires, we store a somewhat large amount of data but only a minor part ever goes out. The compute and network heavy stuff we do is still out of AWS. reply vidarh 11 hours agorootparentThat's pretty much the one situation where they're competitive, so sounds very reasonable. Some of their competitors (Cloudflare, Backblaze) might compete, but the biggest cost issue with S3 by far is the egress so if not much goes out it might still be best for you to stay there. Sounds like (unlike most people who use AWS) you've done your homework. It's great to see. I've used AWS a lot, and will again, because it's often convenient, but so often I see people doing it uncritically without modeling their costs even as it skyrockets with scale. reply throwaway384638 5 hours agorootparentprevS3 is a decent product with zero competition. You should keep s3, it’s a fair price. reply vidarh 4 hours agorootparentS3 has plenty of competition.

I couldn't find anyone to give me a ride to the datacenter, so I took a bus. By the time I got there my arms were numb from carrying the bloody thing. There was a single security guard, I signed in and he gave me directions and a big keychain. The keys opened most of the rooms and most of the cages around the racks.

But, I couldn't, because I was a consultant and it was an employees-only area. I had permission to make changes to machines in a rack but they didn't allow me to enter. There was a guard who would check badges but who didn't really check if he recognized people, and there were some people who had to enter and leave multipel times in a day. Myself, I couldn't get permission to enter via the correct channels. With my director's unofficial approval I was allowed to _try_ to enter the datacenter. So I just walked very confidently towards the entrance, nodded to the security guard like all of the regulars who didn't bother showing their badges, and he let me in. reply qhwudbebd 9 hours agoparentprevHaving run hosting companies from the mid 90s as well, from memory this kind of thing was pretty normal, even in allegedly secure places like London Telehouse.

The author of the post seems to be living in the bay area. It's easy when the number of nerds per km² is high, disposable income is even higher, and driving a car for 2 hours is considered \"next door\". I think for losers like myself, living in the middle of nowhere with low disposable income, the best solution is just to rent out a dedicated Kimsufi box (from OVH), or a server off the Heztner auctions. (Or whatever is the equivalent in North America) It's much much more cost effective than collocating. reply jareklupinski 5 hours agoprev> the bare minimum required to run your own hardware in a colocation environment i remember the look in the admin's eyes when they asked \"alright, what kind of hardware are you looking to install?\" and I said \"oh i have it right here\" and pulled two Intel NUCs out of my backpack > Consider bringing a screwdriver and a flashlight (any halfway decent place will provide those for you, but you never know). two multitools minimum, sometimes you need to hold a nut with one while loosening the bolt with the other the best space is the one that is right next to a Frys/Microcenter/whathaveyou reply theideaofcoffee 5 hours agoparent> \"oh i have it right here\" and pulled two Intel NUCs out of my backpack NUCs would be like nirvana after some of the jerry-rigged crap I've seen dragged into facilities.

Is it because you may want to add more servers later, but the colo host only provides one port in their router? reply kelnos 12 hours agoparentSo you can plug your laptop into it at the colo when you set it up so you can verify that the server is working right and can get to the internet while you are still there. And if it isn't working right, it'll be a lot easier to keep everything plugged into the switch, rather than swapping between your laptop and the colo's network every time you try something to fix it. But yes, if you think you might want to add other machines later, preemptively putting a switch in there will make it tons easier. reply pests 12 hours agoparentprevBasically.

If you can get an ipmi console in, you want it. reply qhwudbebd 10 hours agoparentIpmi is a bit of a double-edged sword. Network-connected access to a serial console (including uefi/bios console redirection) and the reset button can be a total lifesaver, I agree. I wouldn't want to be without a serial console and remote reset button either. But ipmi cards are little network-attached linux boxes which run prehistoric kernels and userspace, exposing as many services as the half-wits who put together the firmware image can shovel in, and are rarely if ever patched by the vendor unless there's some really public scandal. The standard thing to do is to isolate them on some kind of private management network in an attempt to shield the wider internet from the full majesty of the firmware engineers' dazzling skills, but that might be harder to do in the simple 'beginner' scenario Rachel describes. One good simple version when you get up to two servers instead of just one is to cross-connect so each machine has ipmi access to the other, but neither ipmi service is exposed to the wider world. reply omgtehlion 9 hours agorootparentEven if your server does not have proper IPMI, most colo providers have an assortment of ip-kvms, you can ask for those and access your server from any modern browser. reply qhwudbebd 9 hours agorootparentI'm pretty suspicious of trusting the firmware on things like that either, to be honest. (Personally, I tend to use serial cables and a little custom board to turn serial breaks into resets, but I know my NIH instinct is probably a little on the high side. It would be unreasonable for me to suggest someone new to colo start making random extra boards to stick inside their machines!) reply omgtehlion 9 hours agorootparentYou do not need to stick it inside, it plugs into monitor and keyboard ports. Power-on and reset are usually done manually on request. And you do not need it plugged in all the time, only to reconfigure network or boot values. reply qhwudbebd 9 hours agorootparentThat's definitely a level of remote-hands intervention I've not had from the handful of places I have racks of colo kit. You're right, it might be something some of them do for other customers though; I've never really asked. They'll certainly push a reset button, swap a drive or rack a server that's shipped to them. (Though hardware's reliable enough nowadays and I have go to data centres so rarely that it's a bit of a fun novelty, and I like doing it myself.) reply schmookeeg 3 hours agorootparentI've been colo'ing forever. I'd consider a Lantronix spider ipkvm available on request to be like minimum viable colo service. It's usually up in 5 minutes when I submit a ticket to the NOC. I bet your provider has something like that. It's a godsend when you screw up, say, the hypervisor running state somehow and need bare metal access to unbork it :) reply qhwudbebd 1 hour agorootparentMy version of this is to use a serial console server for direct access, rather than vga + keyboard. If the kernel is still running fine but network access is down, I have a getty running on the serial port. If the kernel has locked up too, I hit the reset button by sending a 500ms+ serial break (special circuit, highly recommended) and the bios has serial redirect, so I can do stuff like hit del to drop into bios setup or uefi shell at that point. But I expect you're probably right some or all of the providers we use do have something like that, as I speculated in the previous post. I've just never understood the point of vga-type stuff when bios/uefi serial redirect exists and serial console is more convenient anyway once the kernel has started, so never asked the question. reply michaelt 11 hours agoparentprevIt is indeed very helpful when it's needed - but most IPMI is horrifically insecure, so usually it's not connected directly to the public internet. Instead it's on a separate network with special VPN access. As this document focuses on keeping things simple, they don't have the isolated network / VPN needed to use IPMI. reply neomantra 9 hours agoprevDon't forget hearing protection!

Your house isn't going to have any meaningful reliability for either the network or power. Your house will have one connection to the outside work, the DC should have multiple for redundancy (In case a digger goes through your network connection), and same for power any good DC will have their own redundant power supplies (Batteries, generators etc). And if your server is serving a lot of traffic, your consumer home ISP might not be too happy about it. Theres a reason they split plans between home and business. reply nucleardog 5 hours agorootparent> Your house isn't going to have any meaningful reliability for either the network or power. Not really a serious argument, but maybe worth looking at this these days. Mostly because I think as engineers we all have the desire to hit 100% uptime and reliability when in a lot of cases \"close enough\" might be a lot further than you think. On the power end, a lot of people are getting to some form of local generation and storage (e.g., solar + batteries). Small backup generators aren't entirely unheard of. And on the network end, I'm probably not the only person that went to multiple connections when my ability to earn income became tied to my ability to be online from home. As it sits right now, my power's not the most reliable in the world but because of that I already have a fair sized generator and a lot of fuel stored on-site (~5 days of gasoline, ~10 days of propane). I'm directly off of a fairly regionally important power line, so I'm usually fairly high up on the priority list during any major outage. (I mean, not \"hospital\" but if my power's out so are tens of thousands of others generally.) My grid power's rarely out for that long, and my local power even less since I have the generator. If I finally got around to adding some solar and storage to bridge between grid going down and the generator firing up I'd be able to pretty comfortable ignore power outages for over a week before I started needing to worry about making trips out to dump fuel in the generator or calling for some propane. As far as connectivity, I've got three connections across two providers. All my traffic hits a real data center first so I can bond the connections (because residential) then flows to and from my house. One of the providers is wireless so the only single point of failure for cut lines is a few feet in front of my router. I'm well aware this gets nowhere close to the reliability of a data center. I wouldn't run anything safety or life critical this way. I wouldn't run anything making a substantial amount of money this way. But there's a lot of stuff that fits in below \"successful SaaS\" and \"life critical\" that I think could tolerate an hour of downtime here or there that would get along just fine like this. And even if you think \"well, you're clearly an insane person no one else is going to do that\" I think there's still lots yet that could tolerate a day or two of downtime every year or two just fine. There are a lot of smaller services out there that businesses rely on that are hosted in AWS but aren't much more reliable than if they were running in someone's basement and they survive just fine. reply dboreham 6 hours agoparentprevTypically having the necessary batteries and generators at your house is illegal. reply gr3ml1n 4 hours agorootparentI can't imagine it's actually illegal. Maybe cost-prohibitive and a bit noisy, but plenty of people have UPS systems for their local devices and backup generators. reply kkfx 10 hours agoprevI suggest a very different reasoning: we know WFH works, we also agree that in large part of the world we have enough sunlight for p.v., battery storage could be cheap [1] and FTTH connections start be be very good for modern time. Who have already understood where I want to go? Well, we could run decentralized systems at home for SMEs/Startup common needs from modern homes of remote workers, just renting them a room with proper local equipment the modern remote worker probably already have (VMC, A/C, \"the big UPS\" from domestic p.v.) with not much more expenses than using someone else computer also named \"the cloud\". Then if/when needs mount some sheds with p.v. + local storage and good connections can pops up. Who need a CDN in such setup? Then/if a real small datacenter could born. Are you horrified? Well, now try to see the recent history, when Amazon choose not to buy expensive and reliable SUN servers choosing cheap and crappy PCs or Google choose to save money with rackmounted velcro-assembled PCs with a built-in UPS, i.e. a naked velcro strapped one. See the history of buying cheap low quality ram because we have ECC, lo quality storage because we have checksums anyway and so on. Then think about some real recent datacenter fires and what they told about \"how brilliant and safe\" was their design. Long story short: as we ditch big iron in the past, we ditch mainframes, it's about time to think ditching dataceter model as well for a spread set of small unreliable but many machine rooms at homelabs scale. This, like FLOSS gives us reliability, cheapness and ownership as well. This ALSO decouple hw and sw giants, witch is a very good things in terms of free markets. It will also force he OEMs to be flexible in their design and ditching slowly from modern crappy fats-tech also some giants deprecate [2] as unsustainable, for more balanced tech because well, such homelabs last much longer than typical ready-made PCs and craptops or NAS from the mass distribution market.
