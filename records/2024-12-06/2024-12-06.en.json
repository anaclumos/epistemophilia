I personally have nothing against that move and I think freemium is the way forward if we want sites to be sustainable and not be invaded with ads. The personal highlight of the new version is obviously this: Subscribers will also get access to full-text RSS feeds Hell yeah, full RSS feeds are back. That said though, one thing is a big no-no: You can now pay to get fewer ads The correct amount of ads for a publication that’s directly supported is zero. That’s the amount we should get. I don’t care about the rationale behind it. I’m giving you money, you decided how much money I should be giving you for your product, you don’t get to double dip and also sell my data to your advertisers and earn more on the side. I’ll say it again: the correct amount of ads, in this case, is zero. Get your shit together verge people.",

That’s why newspapers had classified ads, even though they charged a nominal fee to subscribe. People won’t pay $5 a day to subscribe to a newspaper, but the ads subsidize enough of it to make it so that a paid subscription is accessible to more people. On the internet, the fact is this: Most companies do not offer a reduced ad load in exchange for your subscription money. In fact, they will be happy to take money from every source they can. The fact that The Verge is doing so reflects that they understand their audience and are trying to meet them halfway. It also reduces the cost of the subscription for you, the end user. This feels like a situation where an organization tries doing something laudable, but still gets criticized for it. reply bogwog 5 hours agoparent> miss the reality that when running a media business, relying on one revenue stream is dangerous. Why would I, as a consumer, compromise on what I want to make some MBA's life easier? That almost sounds like corporate welfare. Businesses sign up to take risks the moment they're created. A news organization doesn't need to be in business. There is nothing unjust or morally wrong with letting a business shutdown because they couldn't figure out a sustainable way to be profitable (assuming for sake of argument that most people don't subscribe due to the ads, which idk if that would really happen). > This feels like a situation where an organization tries doing something laudable, but still gets criticized for it.

You have full control over that. We all do. What we don’t have is the right to assert a condescending “moral” stance that ignores the economic realities that producers must grapple with. reply flashgordon 5 minutes agorootparentSo the problem is not just black and white - consume ads or dont. It is when my data is being sold without my consent or visibility, when an accidental visiting a page installs tracking cookies and shows annoying opt-out screens, when ad/malware gets installed in every piece of hardware I own (eg \"Smart TVs\") that is the problem. No business \"needs\" to exist - that too vampirically. Incentivize the customer to opt-in with full visibility and let them pick. Dollar costs are visible - why are ads sneakier? adamc 1 hour agorootparentprevWe have the full right to assert any moral stance. Whether others find it \"condescending\" is really not my problem. The reality is that the internet is not a good publication venue. There are lots of eyeballs and distribution is cheap, but getting people to pay is hard. That doesn't mean serving up advertisement is a moral response. Advertisement is met with ad-blockers and will continue to be. When that is too painful, people do skip the content. reply thunky 4 hours agorootparentprevI don't think you've said anything that disagrees with GP. Of course you can vote with your wallet. And of course a company can choose to seek profit from ads. The tension between those two forces will find a natural result.

Maybe they'll get a deal elsewhere that is more to their liking. reply neycoda 37 minutes agorootparentprevIf they can't survive without reduced ads on subscriptions, or the price of subscriptions without ads becomes unviable for users, then they're stuck between a rock and a hard place. I honestly wouldn't mind a subscription that reduces ads to the point of being _non-obnoxious_, but I'm in an odd position because I pay for YouTube Premium, which doesn't have ads, and costs a lot more money to distribute (video, text, and images vs text & images), but I grew up in the newspaper age which were chock full of ads free or subscription. reply knorker 4 hours agorootparentprevVoting with our wallets got us infowars and two major fake news groups of media (mainstream and not). Why should you want some MBA's life to be easy? So that it's feasible to keep producing what you actually want. I just wish it were possible to pay $1 for an article whose headline sounds interesting, or someone recommended. Subscribe, even with a free trial? Pass. The free market is great. But we should not deny it when it leads to bad outcomes. If we do, then we're no better than those who say \"real communism has never been tried\". reply mikeryan 4 hours agorootparentInfowars is an interesting example it’s (was) basically a health supplement company masquerading as a media company. Most of its ad load was selling supplements that it produced. All shadiness aside it’s an interesting model.

Most people won't do it when it's offered. The few who do aren't enough to be worth implementing it. reply bogwog 4 hours agorootparentprevThe fake news situation, like all (well, most at least) failures of the free market are solvable with regulations. I don't think any rational person would disagree that it should be illegal to deliberately spread misinformation and lies. We banned selling cigarettes to minors, we banned drugs, we (theoretically) banned monopolies, and we should be able to ban fake news. But it is currently a political weapon being wielded by a political party. I don't expect that problem will be solved any time soon, but it's not fair to blame that on capitalism. Politicians ruin everything no matter what economic system they're in. > Why should you want some MBA's life to be easy? So that it's feasible to keep producing what you actually want.

It's actually a very common opinion, because it always gets weaponized. It's not a new phenomenon. It's the reason for the whole idea of freedom of speech.

Lab leak was politically incorrect as a lie, and banned, but has since been downgraded to \"maybe\". > But I don't want ad supported journalism! Me neither. But the choice may be between ad supported or none at all. But I hope we can find a viable third way. reply madeofpalk 5 hours agoparentprev\"Less ads\" is the easy way to describe what they're offering, but I believe what they're doing is not just 50% less ad spots, but rather paying will remove all third party ad networks from the site, leaving first party ads only. > we’ll get rid of all the chumboxes and third-party programmatic ads, cut down the overall number of ad units, and only fill what’s left with high-quality ads directly sold by Vox Media If you think all advertising is immoral, then this probably doesn't do anything for you. However, if you have privacy and performance concerns, this is a big win I think. Generally I like what the verge does, and I would gladly pay if it included their podcast being ad free. The Verge’s podcast is the only podcast I listen to that I don’t pay for, and it’s full of repeating programmatic ads for crypto companies, sports betting, and cars. reply shortformblog 5 hours agorootparentThis is a good way to put it. Honestly, it sounds like they have a messaging challenge that they need to solve around this. reply nyclounge 1 hour agorootparentprevThat is what brave is doing. If we are going down this getting money for ads road, then let's just pick the lesser of all evils. reply chrisrhoden 5 hours agorootparentprevIn various contexts, you would draw the distinction here between `ads` (that is, marketing sold against large swaths of content) and `sponsorships` (marketing sold against a small targeted set of content) but the distinction is subtle and the terms are pretty overloaded. reply hmmm-i-wonder 4 hours agoparentprev>Most companies do not offer a reduced ad load in exchange for your subscription money. And the never ending struggle to increase/maintain subscriptions for some companies probably has something to do with that. For me personally, and I expect a not insignificant portion of users, paying for a subscription is primarily to remove advertising completely. Anything else means its not worth subscribing, so not offering that level of option rules us out as customers. I've spent a minor amount of time and energy reducing the amount of advertising I see, from (pre-streaming) downloading shows I already pay for legal access to with commercials removed with automated systems, to being an early adopter of streaming services and dropping cable, locally running pi-hole on top of ad-blockers and using VPN's, privacy focused browsers etc. The payoff has been immense for my family, to the point watching TV in other locations and being bombarded by advertising is jarring and uncomfortable, and the manipulation tactics become more obvious and gross the less you inundate yourself with them. Obviously you can't get away from all advertising, indirect, product placement etc. is everywhere, but I found a significant improvement in quality of life. I would also make the argument that social media engagement hacking at its root traces to advertising and we blame social media for the problems when advertising was the true problem. Advertising as a revenue stream results in trying to optimize and improve engagement, often by gamifying or moving towards sensationalism to drive up numbers to increase revenue, most of which is negative for the user and little actually positive. reply Tade0 5 hours agoparentprev> It also reduces the cost of the subscription for you, the end user. But I don't want to pay less. I want my data to not be sold to the highest bidder, that's all. As it stands there's no option for people like me other than not subscribing. This is very much like the situation with smartphones these days: they cost less because you get a bunch of bloatware that you can't uninstall. I don't want that on my device, so I went with an offering deemed \"overpriced\" because it has less of such crap than others and thus costs about $250 more. Ideally it should be zero, but that's the best I could get. reply conductr 4 hours agorootparentThe fact is people like you are in the minority and there’s no reason for a company to ever even entertain modifications to their product/service to cater to your wants This might seem common on HN but IRL people don’t give much attention to ad related privacy and are probably much more concerned with the fact they have to fork over a CC and a few bucks reply gizmo 5 hours agoparentprevOne way to describe reality is to argue that media organizations like Vox can't survive if they don't show ads to their paid subscribers. Another way to describe reality is that people can choose to subscribe to various substacks or newsletters instead. On those platforms subscribers get zero ads, they get more in depth and more thoughtful articles, and because the system has much less overhead modest subscription revenue is sufficient. Vox also does video reviews, but then again, there are also many high quality tech youtubers. Vox certainly has the right to charge for a subscription and then serve the subscribers ads. And people have a right to walk away from a bad deal. Vox could disappear tomorrow at no great loss to society. We might like some of the reporting Vox does, but we don't need it. Vox media has raised about 450m (according to the first google result). Modest profitability is not enough for Vox Media because they need to secure a significant exit for their investors. This puts them at odds with their readers and subscribers. Not that laudable if you ask me. They made a bet they were going to disrupt traditional media and become a new great media platform. But now it looks like Vox itself is getting disrupted. Like newspapers of old clinging to a business model that no longer exists. reply dghughes 5 hours agoparentprev> That’s why newspapers had classified ads, I don't recall in the past a company needing my identity required or be tracked just because I bought a newspaper. I pay the $1 for the newspaper and no more interaction or relationship after that. Ads are OK but why do all the ad companies need to track me and know my movements and just to show me an ad? It's basically malware, stalking. Ads are zero advantage to me the consumer for what I lose in privacy. reply fragmede 4 hours agorootparentWhat am I losing by being identified as an amorphous human with age X, gender Y, income Z, interested in categories A, B, and C? Do you buy shit that doesn't work? Do you spend money on a pair of shoes, knowing that they're going to fall apart in a week, or on food that's already moldy so you can't eat it? Companies recognize they need to advertise, and so they have a marketing budget. They'd rather they didn't have to spend that money but they recognize they do. Money they spend oh advertising is money they can't spend on something else though. Hence, they want to spend as little as possible for as much effect as possible. Problem is, gauging how effective advertising actually is, is impossible. You can at least select who you advertise to though. If I'm trying to sell men's shampoo I wouldn't want to waste money putting ads for it in a women's magazine. So there's a spectrum, from no advertising profile, to being able to identify you personally. What do you think is the best way for advertising to coexist with privacy without feeling exploitative? Do you think people are gonna pay for ad-free services? reply WickyNilliams 1 hour agorootparent> What am I losing..? An ever increasing amount of privacy. The ad industry will never be satisfied with the amount of data they collect now. They will always want more. This insatiable appetite for tracking and data represents a slow erosion of our privacy. Building unimaginable surveillance machinery for what? So that I might buy something online once every few years? It's casting an extremely large net to catch extremely small fries. The means do not justify the ends. I think relevant, contextual ads are the best alternative. I'm more likely to eg buy something related to what I'm reading than I am to buy a mattress advertised to me across a million websites (a mattress that I've probably already bought I should add!). That doesn't require intense tracking and surveillance across the web. It just requires understanding the context in which the ads are placed. And it's essentially how marketing worked prior to digital advertising reply JKCalhoun 6 hours agoparentprev> That’s why newspapers had classified ads, even though they charged a nominal fee to subscribe. My assumption is that the salaries of reporters, editors was paid for by ads. The nominal fee for the paper was to pay for the pulp, ink. I mean if you just printed up millions of papers and gave them away, people would pick them up simply as raw material for lining their bird cages, for papier-mâché, to insulate their cardboard box home on the corner of 12th and Main..... reply shortformblog 6 hours agorootparentI worked at a number of free tabloid newspapers in my day (one small-town exurban, one mid-sized car-centric metro area, one metro area where most people took public transit) and I will say that most people did not do this. Usually they just left the papers on the train or at the coffee shop. Nonetheless, the first half of your point—the ads usually paid for all the reporting—is correct. reply snowwrestler 5 hours agorootparentprevQuite a lot of papers were, and still are, given out for free. My city still supports 3 separate print newspapers that are free in coffee shops, libraries, corner boxes, etc. They’re a great way to keep up with the actions and gripes of the local community. Being such small operations, there is very light editing and the reporter’s point of view often comes through pretty clearly. All paid for via ads from local businesses. Quite a lot of the ads are from real estate agents, which I think reflects the belief that a lot of tourists are picking up the papers in addition to residents. reply ghaff 5 hours agorootparentprevRight. It is/was just a big bucket of money and obviously there were free papers given away on college campuses and subway stations. But, at least back in the day, newspaper subscriptions and newsstand/put your quarter in boxes basically paid for creating and delivering the physical copies. The generally dire journalism situation these days is there is mostly no physical distribution and physical advertising dollars have become digital dimes. And local news--which was never a really thriving business--is basically dead. reply alexvitkov 5 hours agoparentprevThis really doesn't add up to me. I don't have the numbers, but I would assume that: 1. A very small percentage of website visitors will end up paying for a subscription. 2. They make way less than $5 per user per month from ads. The money they'd lose by providing an ad-free experience to paying customers should be a rounding error. Removing ads will also increase conversion, but who knows whether or not that will be enough to offset the revenue lost. I don't particularly care about their \"business reality\" - if you're an online news outlet you're not paying the costs of printing and distribution - your expenses are just journalist salaries and the marginal costs of keeping a website running. If you need to charge anything close to $5 per user per day to keep such an operation running, you should be out of business. reply Loic 7 hours agoparentprev> Most companies do not offer a reduced ad load in exchange for your subscription money. At least in Germany, this has changed quite a lot. The publishers are naming the offers \"Pur Abo\" or similar. This is not perfect as one analysis[0] is showing, but for me, on the good way. [0]: https://netzpolitik.org/2020/nicht-ganz-ohne/ (in German) Edit: Added German analysis of these offers. reply shortformblog 7 hours agorootparentIntriguing. I know the German media market is very different from the American one—back in my D.C. days, when I was still at the WaPo Express, I met a German journalist who was working in the U.S. and I remember her explaining to me how different the rules were for promotion and social media and such. I do think The Verge offering this could lead other U.S. publishers to follow suit, especially if it’s successful. reply snowwrestler 5 hours agorootparentJust wanted to say I used to love reading the Express on the Metro in the morning. reply freetinker 4 hours agoparentprevFrom a UX perspective, there’s really no way to measure “fewer ads”. Customers with subscriptions aren’t doing A/B tests and feeling satisfied that they’re seeing fewer ads. They’re seeing ads. Still a subpar experience. The “fewer ads” narrative exists on some MBA/bean counter’s spreadsheet. This should be an absolute benefit, not a relative benefit. Who’s to say the number of ads won’t ratchet up in the future? Almost surely will. Let’s say a subscription customer sees 50 ads today vs 100 a non-subscription customer sees. Tomorrow, they 2x that – sub customer sees 100 ads, non-sub customer sees 200. Does a sub customer derive smug satisfaction that they’re seeing fewer ads than a non-sub customer? How would one even know? They’re just seeing ads. The correct amount of ads for a subscription service (from a UX perspective) is zero. reply hombre_fatal 4 hours agorootparent1. The Verge's post says they are paywalling some of their content, so the offering seems more than just reduced ads. 2. People do notice when $7/mo is cheaper than $16/mo which is possible because there are still ads. reply bambax 6 hours agoparentprevOkay, and probably true, but the difference with newspaper is, it would be prohibitively expensive to produce different versions of the same newspaper for different subscription options, while it's trivial to do on the web. Why not offer an ad-free tier? reply xixixao 6 hours agorootparentThe richest people, hence the most valuable for advertisers, would buy it. This significantly affects the whole ad business value. Such that the ad-free tier would have to be priced too high. It’s more profitable to “force” everyone to watch ads. I’m afraid. reply PaulHoule 6 hours agorootparentYep. Elephant in the room of media economics. Look at ads on daytime broadcast TV and it is: medicare advantage, something you can get from medicare, a medicare scam, personal injury lawyer, some drug your insurance might pay for, personal injury lawyer #2. Ads for something you spend your own money on are few and far between (maybe you will get a car ad because if nobody bought a car who'd get hit by a car and call William Matar?) People in that demographic don't have money to spend so they get subprime ads. In the day newspapers and magazines thought about the balance of ad and subscription revenue a lot. On top of (1) people have money for a subscription being better qualified than people who don't, (2) people who are motivated to get a subscription are qualified because they care about the topic (you can get a free magazine about construction equipment but you'd better convince them you are really in the industry) and (3) in the current era, subscribers give up their name and other personal details and will be more definitely tracked. reply ToucanLoucan 6 hours agorootparentYou see the same effect with twitter's advertiser exodus since it was acquired. It was not long ago you'd see everything on twitter: prominent fashion brands, car companies, big name electronics, everything you'd expect from a healthy ad ecosystem. Now it's basically nothing but crypto scams, reverse mortgages, supplements, dude wipes and pills that make your dick work. Like you can feel whatever you feel about that, but it's a clear, marked shift. reply PaulHoule 5 hours agorootparentI bet those ads must drive away some people.

Ad sense. You compete with advertisers not to receive ads. If youre wiling to spend 1 galactic credit to not see an ad, and advertiser must spend 1.01GC to show it to you. Whether this work, only hinges on the question of whether we are already in the situation of having the maximum number of ads served to us, that it is possible to. reply shortformblog 6 hours agorootparentprevMy guess is that some of those ads bring in so much money that covering them with an ad-free model would lead to a cost that they feel is prohibitively expensive. There may be ad agreements that preempt their ability to offer ad-free at this time, likely in the case of ultra-premium advertisers. It could also just be good ol’ internal bureaucracy at play. Maybe there was a turf war, and this was the best they could do while keeping everyone happy.

I am perfectly willing to pay extra to support a website or service that I'm using, but only if it removes all ads. reply ToucanLoucan 6 hours agorootparentThe problem is: advertisers will argue that if you're offering a tier of service that removes ads, that's specifically going to be the most appealing to the group of your user-base that has the most money to spend and whom is most ready to spend it, evidenced by the fact that they have subscribed to your ad-free tier, and is therefore worth the most in terms of reaching with ads. Those people are self-selecting as the most responsive to being appealed to to buy things, which is what your advertisers want. This is why the \"subscribe to remove ads\" thing never took off in a big way. Users love it, but advertisers hate it and it craters the value of the ad space you sell to whomever doesn't think it's worth it/can't afford it. reply wat10000 4 hours agorootparentYouTube and Spotify both do “subscribe to remove ads.” If they’re not big, who is? reply ToucanLoucan 2 hours agorootparentYou've got it back to front, mate. The concept didn't take off among services and smaller websites precisely because the advertisers won't pay nearly as much if you're doing it. The big players can do whatever the hell they want, what kind of company isn't going to advertise on the biggest platforms that exist? reply eterevsky 2 hours agorootparentprevThis entirely depends on the subscription fee, doesn't it? The amount of ad revenue that the service is getting for you is limited, even accounting for the fact that as a paying user you might push the price of ads up a bit. If you set the subscription fee above this value, you as a service will be better off regardless of the advertizers. reply benj111 5 hours agorootparentprevSurely in this reverse Catch-22 hypothetical anyone who is willing to pay to escape ads is therefore worth more, so they would need to be served fewer ads for the same income.

A (in)famous example is the practice of paying for expensive ink with excessive anti-customer practices in order to keep the prices of printers low. The printing manufacturers get multiple revenue streams that are more stable over time, and printers become accessible to more people. What is there to not like about it? The biggest problem is that anti-consumer behavior causes harm. With advertisement it brings disinformation, spying, abuse of the most vulnerable in society, general distrust, are often a crime (scams, fraud, targets children, and usually ignore local advertisement laws), and siphons money to a third party which usually is outside of the country and do not pay taxes. The benefits of anti-consumer behavior are generally not worth the downsides. reply adamtaylor_13 4 hours agoparentprevReality and principles don't always align. There's a \"rubber meets road\" moment where you have to decide what your principles are worth. I do not believe there was any rationale behind this pricing decision. I believe it is pure greed, and you're not likely to change my mind. I clutch my principles rather tightly, especially in cases like this. I will never pay for a streaming service whose first payment tier is \"less ads\", nor will I ever pay for a _newspaper_ of all things whose first premium tier is \"less ads\".

Serve those stupid ads to free users, treat your paying customers with respect. reply shortformblog 7 hours agorootparentGonna be straight up with you: I feel like you would have never thought about this had they not mentioned it, because so few media outlets are even thinking about reducing ad load for paid subscribers. As someone in media, I’m tired of well-intentioned media outlets try to strike a reasonable balance only to get yelled at for it like they aren’t already walking a tightrope. They have staffs of people to pay for, payroll. Travel budgets. Offices. Legal bills. And that they get hell for trying to give an inch, in my opinion, sucks. If you want them to offer an ad-free tier, tell them that directly! Given that they are clearly thinking about it suggests they might listen to you. But your binary way of approaching this is not helping and ultimately discourages companies who want to wean themselves off of adtech.

Given that they are clearly thinking about it suggests they might listen to you. The first thing I did the other day was emailing Nilay Patel, editor in chief at The Verge, to share my thoughts on the subject. That’s before I posted on my site. As for “ripping off the band aid”, again, that’s nonsense. I’m not saying they should drop ads. They should figure out how much a user is worth and then price their membership accordingly. The vast, vast majority won’t switch anyway because that’s the reality of today’s web.

There's a reasonable number of people who are willing to pay for content like this, but only if they actually get an ad-free experience in exchange. The business decision The Verge needs to make is whether they want to try to reach these people or not, since these people won't pay for a model that still has ads. (There could of course be 2 subscription levels at different prices, one that still has some ads… but that's also extra work and a different consumer experience.) I don't think newspaper ads are a good analogy either since the consumption model of a dead-tree newspaper isn't such that you get the ads thrown into your face when trying to read an article. And classifieds specifically I wouldn't even call ads, more of a community note board service. reply PaulHoule 5 hours agorootparentI think it is not just \"ads\" but also the character of the ads. If the ads stay in the boundary areas of the page or well-behaved interstitials that's one thing. In fact, ads can sometimes be interesting and entertaining and most importantly can make markets more competitive bringing you a better variety goods and services. When they screw up the page, jump around, cover things up, don't have proper controls to \"x\" them out, use confusing dark patterns, generate fake clicks (ever think it's not an accident that some sites jiggle around so much?), need 50 trackers to be (kinda) sure parties aren't screwing each other, have 20x the bandwidth cost of the content that's something else. Also there's the content of the ads. There is a subprime tranch that includes Temu but is best represented by prerolls on YouTube that are best advertising sketchy energy drinks and supplements and worse are outright crypto scams. I can see some humor in Temu but not in the scams. reply cons0le 7 hours agorootparentprevHeck, if online ads didn't move around and pop up in front of the screen, less people would block them. But the reality is that companies are too greedy, and will never draw the line and say \"this is enough\" . I can't afford to subscribe to the dozens of sites I glance at everyday for 2 minutes. Quite frankly as someone that grew up with the \"old\" internet, I don't like the idea of paying for every single site I use. It feels like making every road a toll road. reply madeofpalk 5 hours agorootparent> But the reality is that companies are too greedy I don't think this is true. Ads get worse and more hostile because it so easily turns into a race to the bottom. Worse ads devalue the page and lower the CPM, which leads to websites to add more ads, which lowers everything again. reply shortformblog 7 hours agorootparentprevI am not missing the point. Rather, the point is so small as to not be financially worth it for them. I am saying that The Verge made a business decision to balance ad load and subscriber cost to potentially bring in more subscribers. They probably did the math and realized that charging people $15 a month would not bring in many subscribers, and that they could have charged $5 a month with regular ad load, but they found this $7 sweet spot where they could give people the best of both worlds. And the $50 model means people are more committed long-term making it more valuable for them. I would guess that “reduced ad load” means that they would only put premium advertisers, like the stuff you would see in glossy magazines, in front of those readers. I trust given how careful they were with rolling this out that they did the math and tried to strike a balance to please the most people. reply eqvinox 6 hours agorootparentI'd say that the range of actual consumer behavior is quite wide on this. I wonder if anyone has actual public numbers from any kind of similar situation (which, yes, isn't going to be comparable anyway, but anything even remotely close would be interesting.) From my personal bubble, I know there's a bunch of people that won't even consider a subscription that still contains ads; it's antithetical to their (and my) expectations. Whether they'd subscribe to an ad-free The Verge I don't know either; personally I don't consume The Verge aside from occasionally getting sent a link or two, so I wouldn't. I will also say that, were I interested in any Amazon Prime Video show that has ads, I'd rather torrent it.

Believe it or not, they probably thought about this. Maybe it works for Netflix in a cycle where they were already doubling the ad-free price and differently for a text media company introducing a price. reply nltatsy 5 hours agoparentprevThe difference is that newspapers had tasteful ads. I didn't mind seeing a Rolex or an expensive perfume, exquisitely photographed, in the Financial Times.

Print ads don't get your personal data and sell them to who knows who. Internet ads have become synonymous with this practice. Comparing them to print ads without this consideration is disingenuous. reply 0x0203 5 hours agoparentprevI've said it before, but I feel like I need to keep saying it: If the people actually using/consuming a product aren't willing to pay the cost required to make/produce said product, then that's probably a good indicator that the product doesn't have enough value to justify its existence. If the Verge can't convince enough people to pay for their output, I'd argue it's not worth keeping around. Advertising ruins the producer/consumer relationship and incentivizes behaviors that disadvantage the consumer and push the producer away from their original purpose. If the Verge wants to diversify income, then they should provide a product that has value to a wider audience. That doesn't mean that every single person consuming/using the product needs to pay either. Patreon and similar services have proven that if what you make is of high enough quality and provides enough value, it's possible to convince a large enough subset of the consumers to pay enough to cover the costs of production. Especially with online services where the cost difference between producing for 1 person vs 1000 is nearly negligible. The few can, and often do, subsidize the many. And if that changes over time, then the product ceases to be valuable enough to be worth producing and should simply stop being made. And I'd say this is even true of news and things that people might argue are for the public good. In my opinion, most \"news\" today isn't actual informative news and doesn't really serve the public. But of the vanishing little left that does, if it informs and educates the citizenry in a way that improves the lives and stability of the country as a whole, and if its natural cost is more than can be reasonably covered by willing consumers, then there's a reasonable argument for covering the cost with taxes. Put sufficient legal barriers between the government funding and the content being produced to prevent government manipulation/propaganda and make sure the press can operate unimpeded. My best idea for such a government funded news source is to write into law that said news source's budget is dependent solely upon country population and country GDP, all staffing decisions are made internally, and leaders are decided by citizen vote, but I'm sure there are other ways people can come up with for maintaining a free but government/tax funded press agency. But ad-funded (of which I think even public radio/tv has effectively become), creates perverse incentives that drive the mission away from actually informing and educating. People can still pay for tech reviews, or travel advice, talking head current events opinion shows, or whatever news is in its current form if they want. Privately owned/operated press can still exist if it's useful enough for people to find it valuable and worth the cost. But advertising just ruins everything eventually. reply ghaff 5 hours agorootparentThere are a ton of things that many people would like but aren't willing to pay for.

Ads have been a primary revenue driver for news media going back hundreds of years, including to when the US was codifying the civic value of news into its governing principles. The idea that revenue choice is binary or that if you have to use ads you shouldn’t be in business is a very modern one, and one that’s outside of historical norms. reply 0x0203 5 hours agorootparentThe idea that it's wrong to use slavery as a cheap labor force is also modern and outside historical norms. Just because it's historically prevalent doesn't make something right or even good/acceptable. Some things based on historical norms are good. Some clearly aren't. And it seems to me a bit disingenuous to ignore the technological changes and the speed, pervasiveness, and invasiveness with which advertising is now done compared to the historical context being appealed to. Even if one grants that advertising wasn't \"as bad\" back then, that doesn't make what we have now acceptable. reply kasey_junk 5 hours agorootparentI’m more commenting on the idea that ads ruin things over time.

Now ad revenue is declining. The result is subscriptions and paywalls. reply jillesvangurp 11 hours agoprevIt's why I use Firefox and avoid situations where I might get exposed to annoying ads. I was watching some Amazon Prime recently (the new rings of power season). Pretty OK and completely ad free experience. Except I noticed these weird cuts every few minutes. It took me quite a while to realize that Amazon introduced ads some time ago for Amazon prime and uBlock origin was doing a great job of simply blocking them. Hence the cuts. Same on Youtube. I watch a lot of content there while maintaining zero interruptions by ads. Works great and so far I've never had to pay Youtube to not see ads. I do pay for Amazon Prime. Occasionally. I usually reactivate my subscription when I need it either because I'm ordering stuff or because they have something I want to see. I'll cancel soon again because I don't currently need them and I once again exhausted their limited offerings. Forced ad watching makes it less likely I come back. I don't pay any websites/blogs for subscriptions for articles either. It's not sustainable for me to do pay for all the websites I visit. And me randomly paying only some tiny subset of them doesn't make any sense to me. I'd need some prioritized list. And it would have to be a very short one because I'm simply not rich enough to maintain lots of multi dollar subscriptions per month. And I also don't want to micromanage a lot of payments and subscriptions. The Verge, which was mentioned in the article is a good example of a website that I don't value enough to get anywhere near that short list. They have a lot of competition reporting more or less similar stuff that I wouldn't miss them. In fact, I can't recall reading anything by them lately. I guess not a lot of their stuff makes it to the HN front page. Probably because it's just not that interesting. reply contrast 10 hours agoparentYou’re making a very different point to the article. The article is about how to pay for content, your point is that you don’t want to pay for content at all. reply ulrikrasmussen 9 hours agorootparentYou can use uBlock and pay your content creators via Patreon if they have one. I believe that the ad-based freemium business model is harmful to society and unfixable due to the incentives it creates to engage and enrage rather than entertain and inform. So, I use uBlock to use YouTube for free to explicitly drain it of resources without giving Google any ad income, and then I pay the creators that I like using other platforms. reply jillesvangurp 6 hours agorootparentI'm not a big believer in this. It simply doesn't scale. So I might donate chunks of income to 1, 2, maybe 5 or 10 people like this. What about everyone else? It's not a fair system. I engage with lots of youtube channels, read lots of things on dozens/hundreds of websites. Add a few podcasts to the mix and it starts adding up to quite a lot of mouths to feed with individual donations. It's not reasonable for all of them to expect something from me. At least with Spotify and Netflix there is some kind of rev share thing in place. It's not very fair of course and a bit biased towards rewarding content creators that I don't necessarily like (or are in need of more money). But it's better than having to cherry pick creators. Somehow publishers have resisted creating such a thing for written media. We have this broken model of ad supported media and media outlets taking most of that revenue and paying really shitty wages to journalists, many of whom are working on a freelance basis and get paid pitiful amounts per word. Why do we have all these middlemen? reply ulrikrasmussen 5 hours agorootparentSpotify doesn't solve that problem at all, it just helps you avoid feeling bad about it. I know artists who sell their music on both Bandcamp and on Spotify, and they all say that their income from Spotify is utterly insignificant unless you are already a big and established name with lots and lots of streams. You are not the only one consuming a given podcast or YouTube channel, and even if you don't subscribe to their Patreon, maybe someone who likes it even more will. Sure, some content creators will not get enough income to continue, but is that really a big problem? We have no shortage of musicians, blog authors and podcasters, and if you don't care enough about a podcast to give a little bit of money to it, then maybe you won't miss it that much if it disappears. Advocating for a different market structure than the ad-tech fueled one will of course change the supply side and I am not claiming otherwise. I just don't think it's necessarily going to be a problem, on the contrary it will optimize for content that people love rather than content that just stimulates them. reply aunty_helen 5 hours agorootparentprevPaying 1 is better than 0. You’re assuming support has to scale perfectly to be fair, but that’s a false binary. Creators don’t expect everyone to pay but they rely on _someone_ paying. Refusing because it ‘doesn’t scale’ just reinforces a broken system where nobody pays, creators lose and we end up with the shit quality media and content we have now reply sbarre 5 hours agorootparent> we end up with the shit quality media and content we have now I'll just say that looking back on my life consuming media (that started long before the consumer Internet was around), there has never been a better selection of media that I enjoy than now. I've never watched reality shows or sitcoms, the kind of stuff that dominated mass media for a long time... I have interests that don't necessarily fall into the mainstream, so finding interesting or quality content was hard, and shows/films/docs were few and far between.. But now? The current system, while imperfect, at least allows for every possible topic and niche to be somewhat sustainable. The sheer quantity of media has absolutely grown exponentially so there's definitely a lot more bad media, and media that isn't for me, but in terms of choice for myself, it's incredibly good. Obviously YMMV and this is just my anecdotal experience, but I don't consider the system to be broken (even though, again, it's certainly not perfect). reply boo-ga-ga 9 hours agorootparentprevCan you share how you do this? For example, you've listened to a song on YT a few times, liked it. Do you try to find the artist on Bandcamp or iTunes and buy their album? Or order their merch? How much do you spend on this monthly on average? reply ulrikrasmussen 9 hours agorootparentI buy on average 2-3 albums on Bandcamp every month. This month I've bought 4 already. If I like an artist enough that I want to listen to the full album more than once, then I generally buy it. If it's not available on Bandcamp I use Qobuz as a backup. For videos and podcasts I subscribe to content creators on Patreon. I currently have four subscriptions for a total of around $12, and I give roughly the same amount to each. I also avoid services that are monetized by ads elsewhere and pay for Kagi to get ad-free search. I will avoid all services that offer free tiers with ads and paid tiers without ads as I just fundamentally do not believe that the business model can work at scale without causing harm. I also host my own email as I do not believe that it is possible to provide free email to people without somehow also doing things with their data or attention that goes against their interests. reply sfn42 7 hours agorootparentprevI always find these conversations strange. If you offer content for free I'm not going to pay for it. I don't tip, I don't buy micro transactions in games, I don't pay for discord nitro or buy \"collector's edition\" versions of games or twitch subscriptions or anything like that. Simply, if I don't have to pay I don't. And I certainly won't waste my life watching ads just so someone can earn a fraction of a cent. I don't feel any need to justify that, I don't feel bad about it. These tactics earn tons of money, and if that ever stops they'll stop doing it and do something else instead. Until then I'll happily take advantage of all the free stuff. Someone else wants to donate to subsidize me that's great, go right ahead. I'm gonna keep my money. reply ulrikrasmussen 7 hours agorootparentExactly. Their business is to serve content which, if consumed using software in its default configuration, will give me a degraded experience. When the content has left their server and resides on my hardware, it is up to me - no, actually, it is my human right - to process it in the way I want. It is not my moral obligation to make sure that their messed up business model makes sense on a large scale. The alternative is Black Mirror Season 1 Episode 2. reply frotaur 4 hours agorootparentprevI hate ads as much as the next guy, but this way of thinking feels the most unsustainable of them all. You said it yourself; the only reason you get to watch content ad-free is because other people are either watching ads, or paying for the content. You justify with 'if you offer content for free, I'm not going to pay for it'. Agreed with microtransactions and stuff. But with youtube videos? The content is not actually offered for free. It precisely relies on ads to exist. So the content is offered with ads/with subscription (i.e. not free), and you are using an adblocker to bypass this. So you are just leeching out of the other users, and is not sustainable. reply wkat4242 2 hours agorootparentI don't really care if their business model is sustainable. If they go under so be it, someone else will offer it. Whether it's some hobby bob or whatever. I thought the internet was a lot better when it wasn't run by mega corporations anyway. The thing with ads is: it's not free money. We pay for it. All of us. It's part of the price when we buy goods and services. If advertising wasn't possible, items would be cheaper and we would have more money to pay for content directly. Cutting out the whole advertising industry out of the content payment loop would save so much money. And yeah people would still buy stuff they need because they need it. And stuff they didn't need? Well good then that they're not buying it. Saving natural resources and money. reply sfn42 4 hours agorootparentprevHonestly I don't care. I wouldn't sit through a 30 second ad to earn a cent, and i definitely am not doing it so that someone else can earn a cent.

Amazon tries it, gets some people grumbling, but their bottom line is not affected and in fact goes up from this move because in addition to subscribers they also get ad revenue.

But that's one of the causes of enshittification, everything becoming metrics-driven. reply 0xEF 9 hours agorootparentIndeed, the market gives permission to the offense. The funny part is we should have all learned our lesson from the cable television days. Perhaps it's been long enough that everyone forgot, or maybe most of the market is just too young now, but there was a time in the US when cable television was ad-free. Commercials started sneaking into that with some regularity even though part of the draw to paying for cable tv was that it was commercial free. My brain wants to say this happened around the late 1980's? I might be wrong on that time frame, but at some point, like a frog sitting in a pot of water, the heat slowly rose and we found ourselves boiled to death with more and more commercial interruptions in our paid cable tv channels. Then we watched the same thing happen with the Internet in the mid-2000's. Needless to say, I am a heavy user of ad blockers and Pi Holes. I especially loath sites that want to detect my ad blocker, and throw up a message trying to to guilt me into turning it off. The thing is I am not just blocking the ads, but also trying to block all the tracking that comes with those ads. It's not really just about being annoyed by ads this time around. It's also about the right to privacy. reply miki123211 8 hours agorootparentFrom my (admittedly non-US) experience, people actually get pretty annoyed when they have to watch a long movie or TV show without commercial breaks, especially when there's no \"pause\" feature available. Not so much of a problem on modern TVs / set top boxes, as they usually offer that feature (though things get complicated if you want to do some channel flipping to e.g. quickly check how a sports game is going), but it was definitely a pretty big deal back in the day.

In fact I believe sharing the cultural artifacts I engage with is an essential part of a culture, and that getting in the way of that is morally wrong. So if your paywall gets in the way of _that_, I _will_ work around it. Edit: also, the other side of the problem is that there are too many websites now. When it was Netflix and nearly everything there, I payed for it. I no longer pay for shows and movies, because things got _completely_ nuts. Similar thing with news. Reality is I pay _way_ more for Patreon than most people I know - not because of any moral reasons, but because I can actually afford that. And a typical news site asks as much as what I give to some of my favorite writers and painters. reply redserk 11 hours agoparentprevRegarding The Verge, I wish something like Apple News existed in this space. I'd happily throw in $10/mo into a pool that distributed money towards a bunch of different smaller tech reporting/blogs/YouTube channels.

Does it make great content? I've only watched 3 series and then cancelled because it was annoying (but all three were fairly popular), and the more they progressed, the more underwhelming they got. The premise was always good, but scenario was meh and getting meh-er by the episode, everything was kept superficial. Kind of like to tick a box \"we talked about X\", but without actually exploring the topic. And it was the exact same thing over and over again in 3 separate series - be it the gay footballer in Ted Lasso or the relationship with religion while in climate catastrophe in Extrapolations. No real depth, no real thought provoking discussions, no nothing. Just a quick mention, and jump on to the next topic to gloss over.

I can't find it now - it's impossible to search for. reply n144q 4 hours agorootparentprevThe fact that NYTimes never bothered with Apple News says something about this model. Apple News (or the original Newsstand) might work well for traditional, smaller publishers who are almost struggling in the digital age (most magazines in Apple News would quality), because Apple News brings them traffic and revenue that they may have lost or never get in the first place. Bigger publishers have enough influence to just build their own platform and avoid paying Apple rent. Verge is another such example. Same reason for Xbox Game Pass, Kindle unlimited, etc. You gets lots of fun games from independent publishers, but never expect something like Hogwarts Legacy to launch on Game Pass on day 1 unless it is a first-party studio (and you have the most expensive version of Game Pass). If I want to stretch this a bit more, same thing with app stores. Spotify and Netflix are big enough to say \"if you want to use our app, go through the pain and pay on the web. We are not offering IAP\". Most app developers can't do that. Meanwhile, Epic is big enough that it can pick a fight with Apple. reply eitland 7 hours agorootparentprev> but I like the idea that I get access to a number of sources for one payment.

While some content creators do it for love, art, whatever, others do need an income stream to keep going. I'm fine with blocking annoying ads (pop-ups, forced interstitials, autoplaying audio, …) but basic image-and-some-text-on-the-page adverts are fine, as are sponsored sections (if correctly identified as such) in content (if I've heard it before I can just skip manually). There must be a middle ground somewhere that doesn't irritate most viewers but nets the content makers some income. I'm not against advertising as such, where it is relevant to what I am looking at (or even when it is arbitrary/random), what I object to is the stalking that is inherent in the current adtech world. I wouldn't want Amazon following me into the pub to say “I saw you looking at poo bags the other day, take a look at these beauties” in real life and I don't want it online. Over the top advertising is annoying too, but not nearly as disquieting as the feeling of being followed by hundreds of little corporate drones everywhere I go. I don't mind paying a small amount for things either, like a couple of the podcasts I regularly listen to (though some of those are somewhat unrealistic, I'm not going to pay to a TV subscription or two worth for an ad-free slightly-longer version of a weekly podcast!), but like the point of the article I disagree with paying and still getting adverts probably with the tracking that this implies. reply cuddlyogre 7 hours agorootparentThe problem with allowing \"basic image-and-some-text-on-the-page adverts\" is that you also allow \"pop-ups, forced interstitials, autoplaying audio, …\" and malware attacks since they all pull from the same pool by default.

The ideal is for the advert to be served from the main source, much like a sponsored segment in a cast is just in the cast, no extra external access to do any tracking from.

They had their chance, they decided that the option they wanted was to abuse the viewer with a huge amount of very bad ads on every goddamn site they visited, and now (for some of us), it's over, we're blocking ads.

The whole \"GDPR\" thing is a sham - unfortunately this is the case in many countries, but especially so in the UK. The ICO is one of the most useless \"regulators\" I have ever dealt with, somehow even worse than telecoms regulators. This isn't some sort of subtle and concealed breach of the GDPR that everyone puts effort into keeping quiet. It's blatant, obvious, and in the face of everyone who visits major news websites. If it was enforced, the practice would've quickly stopped. It's about as subtle as committing murder on live TV. If you don't get arrested for that, it's clear that the law you've broken is not being enforced. > You should report sites that do that But let's hypothesize and see what it takes to actually do this: As per the ICO's requirements, you must first contact the organization that has wronged you and give them time to address your concern. They have 30 days to do respond, and could extend it potentially indefinitely by engaging in pointless arguments. They could also make technically flawed arguments in how they're not actually tracking you or collecting personal data, and those will successfully work because there's no technical expert on the ICO's side to review it and call bullshit. You need full-time admin staff to deal with these matters. Assuming you finally get to a stage where you have grounds to make a complaint to the ICO, what are they going to do (if anything)? Well at best they will send a letter, which is not legally binding in any way and will promptly get ignored by the recipient, which is fine because the truth is, both sides are complicit and just want the matter to go away - whether the underlying problem is solved or not is not their concern. In practice, even if the ICO wanted to act (they don't - don't bite the hand that feeds), what would they do? This isn't a single, small offender, this is the entire newspaper industry. They not only have a lot of lobbying power but outright control the narrative. They know it, and that's why they have no fear putting evidence of their GDPR breach on their homepages. Are you ready to hire a full-time admin team to do this (and end up absolutely nowhere, except maybe collecting evidence of this \"regulator\"'s uselessness)? -- GDPR enforcement in the UK (and sadly in a lot of other countries) is and will remain a sham until the issue becomes politically important. The regulator on its own, even with the best of skill and intentions will not succeed in this battle. The only way I can potentially see this changing is if we see continuous and recurrent data breaches of politician's personal data and dirty laundry, but even then the likeliest solution is a two-tier system where politicians are allowed to have privacy while everyone else doesn't. reply andrepd 8 hours agoparentprevWell I'm pretty much an anti-ad radical as well, but you're saying you block ads and you don't want to pay for stuff like subscriptions and similar.

I basically agree with this sentiment, but one place where it can be a tricky balance (not saying that's the case here!) is \"native advertising\". For example, a new game is being released, the publisher collaborates with TheBrink, a hypothetical popular game news site, and for this they get a huge takeover banner advert for the week, increased placement on ad units around the site, a \"behind the scenes\" post written about the game, and an interview with the developers published to TheBrink's YouTube channel. This type of package is absolutely a thing that gets sold. Which bits of this are ads? Well the behind the scenes post and interview could theoretically have been produced anyway, they're within the scope of the site, but in this case they weren't prioritised, certainly not for launch day, it was only by the whole collaboration being paid for that they got made. Are they ads? Yes they are ads. How would a loyal subscriber feel about those parts being hidden from them though? I imagine they would be miffed about that. Native advertising like this has a whole spectrum of quality and the worst native ads are very explicitly ads that have no value to typical readers. However \"good\" native ads are really just a company paying for priority reporting in the style that would otherwise be done anyway, and are probably content that readers/viewers want. How do you resolve this? No idea. If I were paying I'd want to see that content assuming it's good quality. Others would not on the basis of bias or a more philosophical opposition to ads. reply dantyti 12 hours agoparent> However \"good\" native ads are really just a company paying for priority reporting in the style that would otherwise be done anyway, and are probably content that readers/viewers want. That's akin to saying a person wants some of that \"good\" cancer. If I am paying, I am supporting the editorial staff. It's their decision what to report on and how. Paid-for content, even if it's just for priority coverage, compromises the integrity of the editorial staff as well as their ability to curate (not to mention a clear disincentive to be critical of the ad buyer's claims). It starts when TheBrink publishes a high quality behind the scenes piece about a scam mobile game instead of a truly great indie game just because the latter is not as profitable and cannot afford to buy the ad. It ends with the entire catalogue of the publication being paid for by advertisers. Much like some influencer's instagram feed. Paying for access to an ad feed is unacceptible. To add: \"the firewall\" between the editorial and business sides of a publication is the basic prerequisite for ethical journalism, even if it's an entertainment rag. Advertising that masquarades as reporting is therefore the worst and most toxic, i.e., cancerous, of the bunch. So I do not agree that native ads are something that should be desired. reply lazyasciiart 10 hours agorootparentThey didn't say it should be desired. They said it exists, and it is not clear that all users would want to hide all of it. reply ricardobeat 6 hours agorootparentprevPrint magazines were paid, either via subscription or purchasing at a street kiosk, and had advertising in it.

But that wasn’t my point. reply greazy 13 hours agoparentprevI think this is where fine grained terminology is required. The articles/interview you describe could be described as 'paid content'. What the article is discussing is most likely banner ads for what will usually be non related products. One is designed to keep you on the site (paid content) while the other is attempting to go else where. The effect of paid content can not be discounted. It's important to recognize that a paid review or a game or movie can result in a different outcome, even subtly. I remember in the golden days of game review sites it was clear when writers were fudging the reviews because the user experience would be starkly different. The 'we were told to ignore the bugs' excuses always followed because the gig was paid. reply quectophoton 7 hours agorootparent> What the article is discussing is most likely banner ads for what will usually be non related products. This here is key. If I'm reading the synopsis for an anime series on a website whose main topic is anime/manga/novels/etc, and I see an ad in an unobstrusive and non-annoying location talking about this one new anime figurine or plushie or some other merch, you bet I'm going to check it out. These ads don't require cross-site tracking or third-party resources. They can even be shown with the strictest Content-Security-Policy. Even if they send you to a different website. If I'm logged in, and you give me a way to tell you \"I don't like this shit, stop showing me stuff related to this series/artist/etc\" (i.e. a clearly tagged blocklist, not a vague \"I don't like this\" and you guessing what I mean by \"this\"), I'll even help you refine your ads for me. But that's only because I care about this content. And because it's done in a respectful way. For example, I don't mind those classic 88x31 \"affiliate links\" (ads) or blog rolls (also ads, at least in my eyes), or self-promotion sections (ads) in some communities, or when someone I follow on Bluesky posts about how they're selling a thing (also ad). If one of those gets through my adblocker, I won't go out of my way to add a rule for those. But the moment a third-party script is involved, or data selling begins, or there's annoyances like putting random shit between paragraphs I'm reading, or popups, or \"subscribe to the newsletter\"-style popups, I'm out. I'm either blocking your whole site on uBlock Origin, or at DNS level if it was bad enough. TL;DR: I don't care about ads. I care about things that piss me off. reply Timwi 8 hours agoparentprevIf I go to TheBrink to read about game news, and I click on a link that says the article is about that new game, then I get what I asked for. Coupled with a clear indication that it's paid-for content, it should be fine. What's not fine is seeing an ad for the new game when I didn't go to a games news site and didn't click on such a link.

This type of package is absolutely a thing that gets sold. Sure, but does this ever get sold on a site that _doesn't_ already have ads in the first place? You literally mention \"increased placement on ad units\", so I'd argue that if this site is directly supported, they've already violated the principle in a way that doesn't involve \"native ads\", and if they aren't directly supported, this principle doesn't apply to them. I'm skeptical that there are any non-hypothetical examples of sites that charge for access and make deals for \"native ads\" in the form of content but don't have any actual ad units that are displayed to users. If I'm wrong and this is a thing, I don't think that's it's really that hard to solve. When a user signs up for a paid subscription, as part of the sign-up process, show a screen that explains that sometimes the company will partner with sponsors to produce content about their products, link/screenshot to a couple examples to make sure the user understands what you're talking about, and then give them the choice to either have content like that shown or hidden, and then put that as a toggle they can flip whenever they want in their account settings and mention that fact when you prompt them for their initial choice. If companies don't way to pay for a partnership because their metrics show that too many users turn off the publication's sponsored content from showing, that's just a sign that the system is working, since users shouldn't be paying for sponsored content that they don't actually want to see. reply lazyasciiart 10 hours agorootparentAlthough I no longer pay for a subscription and can't be certain, I used to have a paid subscription to The Pragmatic Engineer and I'm pretty sure the paragraph \"brought to you by X, Y and Z\" was still included in each post.

    "commentBody": "The 70% problem: Hard truths about AI-assisted coding (addyo.substack.com)495 points by mooreds 13 hours agohidepastfavorite374 comments neilwilson 11 hours agoAgain one of the few advantages of having been round the sun a few more times than most is this isn’t the first time this has happened. Packages were supposed to replace programming. They got you 70% of the way there as well. Same with 4GLs, Visual Coding, CASE tools, even Rails and the rest of the opinionated web tools. Every generation has to learn “There is no silver bullet”. Even though Fred Brooks explained why in 1986. There are essential tasks and there are accidental tasks. The tools really only help with the accidental tasks. AI is a fabulous tool that is way more flexible than previous attempts because I can just talk to it in English and it covers every accidental issue you can imagine. But it can’t do the essential work of complexity management for the same reason it can’t prove an unproven maths problem. As it stands we still need human brains to do those things. reply dkrich 9 hours agoparentThis seems to apply to all areas of AI in its current form and in my experience 70% may be a bit generous. AI is great at getting you started or setting up scaffolds that are common to all tasks of a similar kind. Essentially anything with an identifiable pattern. It’s yet another abstraction layer sitting on an abstraction layer. I suspect this is the reason we are really only seeing AI agents being used in call centers, essentially providing stand ins for chatbots- because chatbots are designed to automate highly repetitive, predictable tasks like changing an address or initiating a dispute. But for things like “I have a question about why I was charged $24.38 on my last statement” you will still be escalated to an agent because inquiries like that require a human to investigate and interpret an unpredictable pattern. But creative tasks are designed to model the real world which is inherently analog and ever changing and closing that gap of identifying what’s missing between what you have and the real world and coming up with creative solutions is what humans excel at. Self driving, writing emails, generating applications- AI gets you a decent starting point. It doesn’t solve problems fully, even with extensive training. Being able to fill that gap is true AI imo and probably still quite a ways off. reply nottorp 8 hours agorootparent> But for things like “I have a question about why I was charged $24.38 on my last statement” you will still be escalated to an agent because inquiries like that require a human to investigate and interpret an unpredictable pattern. Wishful thinking? You'll just get kicked out of the chat because all the agents have been fired. reply adamc 3 hours agorootparentprevGreat analysis, and I agree it's Fred Brooks' point all over again. None of these tools hurt, but you still need to comprehend the problem domain and the tools -- not least because you have to validate proposed solutions -- and AI cannot (yet) do that for you. In my experience, generating code is a relatively small part of the process. reply marcosdumay 2 hours agorootparentprev> because chatbots are designed to automate highly repetitive, predictable tasks like changing an address or initiating a dispute You know what is even cheaper, more scalable, more efficient, and more user-friendly than a chatbot for those use cases? A run of the mill form on a web page. Oh, and it's also more reliable. reply mistersquid 1 hour agorootparent> You know what is even cheaper, more scalable, more efficient, and more user-friendly than a chatbot for those use cases? > A run of the mill form on a web page. Oh, and it's also more reliable. Web-accessible forms are great for asynchronous communication and queries but are not as effective in situations where the reporter doesn't have a firm grasp on the problem domain. For example, a user may know printing does not work but may be unable to determine if the issue is caused by networking, drivers, firmware, printing hardware, etc. A decision tree built from the combinations of even a few models of printer and their supported computers could be massive. In such cases, hiring people might be more effective, efficient, and scalable than creating and maintaining a web form. reply marcosdumay 1 hour agorootparent> but are not as effective in situations where the reporter doesn't have a firm grasp on the problem domain Hum... Your point is that LLMs are more effective? Because, of course people are, but that's not the point. Oh, and if you do create that decision tree, do you know how you communicate it better than with a chatbot? You do that by writing it down, as static text, with text-anchors on each step. reply jeremyjh 5 hours agorootparentprevYeah, its more like it can generate 70% of the code by volume, rather than get you 70% of the way to a complete solution. 12 week projects don't become 4 week projects, at best they are 9-10 week projects. reply bambax 5 hours agoparentprevWhere AI really really shine is to help an engineer get proficient in a language they don't know well. Simon Willison says this somewhere and in my experience it's very true. If you can code, and you understand the problem (or are well on your way to understanding it), but you're not familiar with the exact syntax of Go or whatever, then working with AI will save you hundreds of hours. If you can't code, or do not (yet) understand the problem, AI won't save you. It will probably hurt. reply dartos 5 hours agorootparentI used to agree, but as an experienced engineer asking about rust and y-crdt, it sent me down so many wrong rabbit holes with half valid information. I used Claude recently to refresh my knowledge on the browser history API and it said that it gets cleared when the user navigates to a new page because the “JavaScript context has changed” I have the experience and know how to verify this stuff, but a new engineer may not, and that would be awful. Things like these made me cancel all my AI subscriptions and just wait for whatever comes after transformers. reply cvwright 3 hours agorootparentI think of AI like a very eager and bright 20 yr old intern who’s really into whatever tech I’m trying to learn. Good knowledge of facts, willing to give anything a try, but not much wisdom. reply dartos 3 hours agorootparent> Good knowledge of facts I haven’t seen this demonstrated in gpt-4 or Claude sonnet when asking anything beyond the most extreme basics. I consistently get subtly wrong answers and whenever I ask “oh okay, so it works like this” I always get “Yes! Exactly. You show a deep understanding of…” even though I was wrong based on the wrong info from the LLM. Useless for knowledge work beyond RAG, it seems. Search engines that I need to double check are worse than documentation. It’s why so many of us moved beyond stack overflow. Documentation has gotten so good. reply tmpz22 2 hours agorootparentprevChatGPT and Claude outputs are equivalent to a 20 yr old intern who goes to MIT? reply adamc 3 hours agorootparentprevNot sure I get how that would work. It seems to me that to do my job I will have to validate the semantics of the program, and that means I will have to become familiar with the syntax of Go or whatever, at a fairly sophisticated level. If I am glossing over the syntax, I am inevitably glossing over the fine points of how the program works. reply mgens 2 hours agorootparentprevYes! Reading some basic documentation on the language or framework, then starting to build in Cursor with AI suggestions works so well. The AI suggests using functions you didn't even know about yet, then you can go read documentation on them to flesh out your knowledge. Learned basic web dev with Django and Tailwind this way and it accelerated the process greatly. Related to the article, this relies on being curious and taking the time to learn any concepts the AI is using, since you can't trust it completely. But it's a wonderfully organic way to learn by doing. reply dogleash 26 minutes agorootparentTell me you're a Cursor advertisement chatbot without telling me you're a Cursor advertisement chatbot. reply fatnoah 5 hours agorootparentprev> Where AI really really shine is to help an engineer get proficient in a language they don't know well. I used GitHub Copilot in a project I started mostly to learn Go. It was amazing. I spent not so much time fiddling around with syntax, and much more time thinking about design. reply osigurdson 4 hours agorootparentprevIt allows you to write a little code in languages that you are not familiar with. However, it is nothing like actually internalizing a language. reply cruffle_duffle 3 hours agorootparentThat’s true. But if you are already an experienced developer who’s been around the block enough to call bullshit when you see it, these LLM thingies can be pretty useful for unfamiliar languages. But you need to be constantly vigilant, ask it the right questions (eg: “is this thing you wrote really best practice for this language? Cause it doesn’t seem that way”), and call bullshit on obvious bullshit… …which sometimes feels like it is more work than just fucking doing it yourself. So yeah. I dunno! reply croes 1 hour agorootparentprevIf you don’t know the language well enough AI could lead you down the path of bad practices and you won’t recognize it. reply vunderba 3 hours agorootparentprevI guess it depends on how you define \"proficiency\". For me, proficiency implies a fundamental understanding of something. You're not proficient in Spanish if you have to constantly make use of Google Translate. Could code assistants be used to help actually learn a programming language? - Absolutely. Will the majority of people that use an LLM to write a Swift app actually do this? - Probably not, they'll hammer the LLM until it produces code that hobbles along and call it a day. Also, LEARNING is aided by being more active, but relying on an LLM inherently encourages you to adopt a significantly more passive behavior (reading rather than writing). reply DanielHB 3 hours agorootparentprevLLMs are a great help with terraform and devops configuration, they often invent things but at least the point at the documentation I need to look up on. Of course everything needs double-checking but just asking the LLM: \"how do I do X\" will usually at least output all the names of terrraform resources and most configuration attributes I need to look up. They are great for any kind of work that requires \"magical incantations\" as I like to call them. reply heelix 5 hours agorootparentprevSo very much this. As I was learning Rust, I'd ask what the equivalent was for a snippet I could create in Java. It is funny. I look at the Java code provided by prompts and go meh. The Rust code looks great. I realize this is probably due to 1) me being that junior level in Rust or 2) less legacy crap in the training model. I'm sure it is both, with more of the former as I work from working to beautiful code. reply cruffle_duffle 3 hours agorootparentprevIt depends on the language and the libraries you will use. Python with a well known library? Sure no problem. Almost any model will crank out fairly error free boilerplate to get you started. Terraform? Hah. 4o and even o1 both absolutely sucked at it. You could copy & paste the documentation for a resource provider, examples and all, and it would still produce almost unusable code. Which was not at all helpful given I didn’t know the language or its design patterns and best practices at all. Sonnet 3.5 did significantly better but still required a little hand holding. And while I got my cloud architecture up and running now I question if I followed “best practices” at all. (Note: I don’t really care if I did though… I have other more important parts of my project to work on, like the actual product itself). To me one of the big issues with these LLM’s is they have zero ability to do reflection and explain their “thought process”. And even if they could you cannot trust what it says because it could be spouting off whatever random training data it hovered up or it could be “aligned” to agree with whatever you tell it. And that is the thing about LLM’s. They are remarkably good bullshitters. They’ll say exactly what you want them to and be right just enough that they fool you into thinking they are something more than an incredibly sophisticated next token generator. They are both incredibly overrated and underrated at the same time. And it will take us humans a little while to fully map out what they are actually good at and what they only pretend to be good at. reply jamil7 11 hours agoparentprevIt’s an old one but I think Joel Spolsky‘s take on leaky abstractions is relevant again in this discussion as we add another abstraction layer with LLM assisted coding. https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-a... reply louthy 7 hours agorootparentAligned with: “The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.” — Edsger Dijkstra The abstraction has never been this leaky or vague — Me reply truefossil 6 hours agorootparentAgree. So far \"the progress\" implied understanding (discovering) previously unknown things. AI is exactly the opposite: \"I don't understand how, but it sorta works!\" reply rob74 4 hours agorootparentprevThat's the purpose that all abstractions strive to achieve, but most of them fall short - and become leaky... reply olvy0 6 hours agorootparentprevThat is a great quote, thank you. reply rossmurphy 6 hours agorootparentprevJoel's blog posts should be hung in the Louvre. reply lxdlam 10 hours agoparentprevTotally agree. The software development is absolutely a fractal. In 1960s we were solving the complexity by using high level language that compile to machine code to enable more people write simple code. This has happened again and again and again. But different generations face different problems, which requires another level of thinking, abstraction, and push both boundaries until we reach the next generation. All of this is not solved by a single solution, but the combination based on basic principles that never changes, and these things, at least for now, only human can do. reply dkrich 8 hours agorootparentInterestingly it seems like we are investing many more magnitudes of capital for smaller and smaller gains. For example, the jump in productivity from adding an operating system to a computer is orders of magnitude larger than adding an LLM to a web development process despite the LLM requiring infrastructure that cost tens of billions to create. It seems that while tools are getting more and more sophisticated, they aren’t really resulting in much greater productivity. It all still seems to be resulting in software that solves the same problems as before. Whereas when html came around it opened up use cases that has never been seen before despite being a very simple abstraction layer by today’s standards. Perhaps the opportunities are greatest when you are abstracting the layer that the fewest understand when LLMs seem to assume the opposite. reply mattgreenrocks 5 hours agorootparentThe real gains in software are still to be had by aggressively destroying incidental complexity. Most of the gunk in a web app doesn't absolutely need to exist, but we write it anyway. (Look at fasthtml for an alternate vision of building web apps.) The issue with LLMs is they enshrine the status quo. I don't want ossified crappy software that's hard to work with. Frameworks and libraries should have to fight to justify their existence in the marketplace of ideas. Subverting this mechanism is how you ruin software construction. reply lxdlam 7 hours agorootparentprevYou mentioned a great point that LLMs are hitting the edge of a marginal gain decreasing point, at least I think so. Many applications are struggling to provide real benefits instead of just entertaining people. Another funny thing is that we are using LLM to replace creative professionals, but the real creativity is from human experience, perception and our connections, which are exactly missing from LLM. reply steveBK123 6 hours agorootparentYes, as I saw someone say - I wanted robots to do my dishes, laundry, and clean up my house so I can spend more time on art.

Chapter 16 is named \"No Silver Bullet—Essence and Accident in Software Engineering.\" I'll type out the beginning of the abstract at the beginning of the chapter here: \"All software construction involves essential tasks, the fashioning of the complex conceptual structures that compose the abstract software entity, and accidental tasks, the representation of these abstract entities in programming languages and the mapping of these onto machine languages within space and speed constraints. Most of the big past gains in software productivity have come from removing artificial barriers that have made the accidental tasks inordinately hard, such as severe hardware constraints, awkward programming languages, lack of machine time. How much of what software engineers now do is still devoted to the accidental, as opposed to the essential? Unless it is more than 9/10 of all effort, shrinking all the accidental activities to zero time will not give an order of magnitude improvement.\" reply Izkata 10 hours agorootparentFrom the abstract that definitely sounds like he meant \"incidental\": Something that's a necessary consequence of previous work and / or the necessary but simpler part of the work. reply mjburgess 10 hours agorootparentIt's Aristotelian language.

But the essential complexity is low, because the idea is simple. Anniversary edition, p182. \"... let us examine its difficulties.

I suppose if we take the opposite of \"essential\" (the core architecture, planned to solve the problem) to be boilerplate (stuff that needs to be done as part of a solution, but doesn't itself really define the solution), then it does apply. It's interesting/amusing that on the surface a coding assistant is one of the things that LLMs appear better suited for, and they are suited for, as far as boilerplate generation goes (essentially automated stack overflow, and similar-project, cut and pasting)... But, in reality, it is one of the things LLMs are LEAST suited for, given that once you move beyond boilerplate/accidental code, the key skills needed for software design/development are reasoning/planning, as well as experienced-based (\"inference time\") learning to progress at the craft, which are two of the most fundamental shortcomings of LLMs that no amount of scale can fix. So, yeah, maybe they can sometimes generate 70% of the code, but it's the easy/boilerplate 70% of the code, not the 30% that defines the architecture of the solution. Of course it's trendy to call LLMs \"AI\" at the moment, just as previous GOFAI attempts at AI (e.g. symbolic problem solvers like SOAR, expert systems like CYC) were called \"AI\" until their limitations became more apparent. You'll know we're one step closer to AI/AGI when LLMs are in the rear view mirror and back to just being called LLMs again! reply arikrak 4 hours agoparentprevAI is a potential silver bullet since it can address the \"essential complexity\" that Fred Books said regular programming improvements couldn't address. It may not yet have caused an \"order of magnitude\" improvement in overall software development but it has caused that improvement in certain areas, and that will spread over time. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet reply snarf21 4 hours agoparentprevThe most valuable thing I want AI to do with regards to coding is to have it write all the unit tests and get me to 100% code coverage. The data variance and combinatorics needed to construct all the meaningful tests is sometimes laborious which means it doesn't get done (us coders are lazy...). That is what AI to do, all the mind numbing draining work so I can focus more on the system. reply jyounker 4 hours agorootparentWhich is also a fantasy, since if you did achieve it, you'd just have tests that verified that all your bugs were in place. reply js8 4 hours agorootparentprevHow do you expect AI to write unit tests if it doesn't know the precise desired semantics (specification)? What I personally would like AI to do would be to refactor the program so it would be shorter/clearer, without changing its semantics. Then, I (human) could easily review what it does, whether it conforms to the specification. (For example, rewrite the C program to give exactly the same output, but as a Python code.) In cases where there is a peculiar difference between the desired semantics and real semantics, this would become apparent as additional complexity in the refactored program. For example, there might be a subtle semantic differences between C and Python library functions. If the refactored program would use a custom reimplementation of C function instead of the Python function, it would indicate that the difference matters for the program semantics, and needs to be somehow further specified, or it can be a bug in one of the implementations. reply macNchz 2 hours agorootparentprevI've been having good results having AI \"color in\" the areas that I might otherwise skimp on like that, at least in a first pass at a project: really robust fixtures and mocks in tests (that I'm no longer concerned will be dead weight as the system changes because they can pretty effectively be automatically updated), graceful error handling and messaging for edgier edge cases, admin views for things that might have only had a cli, etc. reply chubot 3 hours agorootparentprevA bigger challenge, and a “senior engineer” thing, is to write code with small/tractable state spaces in the first place It’s not either/or of course, and AI can help But sometimes it takes another leap beyond the current set of test cases reply 9rx 3 hours agorootparentprevTests are the documentation that explains what your application is intended to do.

Once you write sufficiently detailed unit tests, the AI writes the implementation. reply 9rx 2 hours agorootparentAre we not already more or less there? It is not perfect, to be sure, but LLMs will get you pretty close if you have the documentation to validate what it produces. However, I'm not sure that removes the tedium the parent speaks of when writing tests. Testing is not widely done because it is not particularly fun having to think through the solution up front. As the parent alludes to, many developers want to noodle around with their ideas in the implementation, having no particular focus on what they want to accomplish until they are already in the thick of it.

Most people can't use mice or keyboards with speed, touchscreens are marginally better except all the \"gestures\" are unnatural as hell, and programming is pig latin.

Generative AI can be thought as an interface to the tool, but it's been proven that they are unreliable. And as the article outlines, if it can get to 70% of the task, but you don't have the knowledge requires to complete it, that's pretty much the same as 0%.

Of course they aren’t on their own, people are leveraging generations of improvements and then stacking yet another boost on top of them. Programming today is literally hundreds of times more productive than in 1950. It doesn’t feel that way because of scope creep, but imagine someone trying to create a modern AAA game using only assembly and nothing else. C didn’t show up until the 70’s, and even Fortran was a late 50’s invention. Go far enough back and people would set toggle switches and insert commands that way no keyboards whatsoever. Move forward to the 1960’s and people coded on stacks of punch cards and would need to wait for access to a compiler overnight. So just imagine the productivity boost of a text editor and a compiler.

That's an idealistic view. Packages are leaky abstractions that make assumptions for you. Even stuff like base language libraries - there are plenty of scenarios where people avoid them - they work for 9x% of cases but there are cases where they don't - and this is the most fundamental primitive in a language. Even languages are leaky abstractions with their own assumptions and implications. And these are the abstractions we had decades of experience writing, across the entire industry, and for fairly fundamental stuff.

If you stop the need of having juniors you're never going to get more experienced people. reply jack_pp 9 hours agorootparentLLMs are advancing as well, just not from your/my direct input. Or from our direct input ( considering they learn from our own questions ) and from 100k others that are using them for their work. Juniors today can learn exponentially faster with LLMs and don't need seniors as much. Take me for example, I've been programming for 20 years, been through C, C++, C#, Python, JS, PHP but recently had to learn Angular 18 and Fastapi. Even though I knew JS and Python before hand these frameworks have ways of doing things I'm not used to so I've been fumbling with them for the first 100 hours. However when I finally installed Copilot and had a little faith in it I boosted my productivity 3-4x. Of course it didn't write everything correct, of course it used outdated angular instead of latest (which is why I was so reluctant to ask stuff for it at the start) but it still helped me a lot because it is much easier (for me) to modify some bad/outdated code and get it to where I want it than write it from scratch without the muscle memory of the new framework. So for me it's been a godsend. I expect for stuff that's not as cutting edge as new framework oddities that appeared in the last 12 months it is even more helpful and % of it being correct would be way higher so for juniors that are doing say Python coding on frameworks that have at least 3-4 years and are stable enough the seniors would need to intervene much much less in correcting the junior. reply badsectoracula 8 hours agorootparent> Juniors today can learn exponentially faster with LLMs and don't need seniors as much.

However the current generation of models needs a specific form of training set that is quite different from what a human would produce through direct interaction with the model. For one it needs many more examples than a human would need. But also the form of the example is different: it must be an example of an acceptable answer. This way a model can compute how far it is from the desired outcome. Further research in how to efficiently fine tune models will make this gap narrower and perhaps senior devs will be able to efficiently give learnable feedback through their normal course of interaction reply tempodox 7 hours agoparentprev> very eager junior developer Not only that, but one who is infected with terminal Dunning-Kruger syndrome.

So in effect it would be having less engineers and probably 1 or 2 at best senior engineers and the rest are guiding the AI senior engineer in the codebase. I didn't need to hire any senior engs for a while for my SaaS and only needed good juniors for 3 months. Everyone in the future is going have access to senior engineers building projects. reply foo42 11 hours agoprevI worry about 2 main pitfalls for junior devs, one more tractable than the other. Firstly there is the double edged sword of AI when learning. The easy path is to use it as a way to shortcut learning, to get the juice without the pressing, skipping the discomfort of not knowing how to do something. But that's obviously skipping the learning too. The discomfort is necessary. On the flip side, if one uses an llm as a mentor who has all the time in the world for you, you can converse with it to get a deeper understanding, to get feedback, to unearth unknown unknowns etc. So there is an opportunity for the wise and motivated to get accelerated learning if they can avoid the temptation of a crutch. The less tractable problem is hiring. Why does a company hire junior devs? Because there is a certain proportion of work which doesn't take as much experience and would waste more senior developers time. If AI takes away the lower skill tasks previously assigned to juniors, companies will be less inclined to pay for them. Of course if nobody invests in juniors, where will the mid and senior developers of tomorrow come from? But that's a tragedy of the commons situation, few companies will wish to invest in developers who are likely to move on before they reap the rewards. reply Vegenoid 40 minutes agoparentAnother reason companies hire juniors is because they cannot find/afford seniors. The demand that stems from this reason will increase over time when companies are not hiring \"enough\" juniors (because if we aren't hiring juniors we aren't making more seniors, so they become increasingly scarce and expensive). reply 0xDEAFBEAD 8 hours agoparentprevI think the tragedy of the commons problem for juniors has already existed for some time. Previously, companies were reluctant to hire juniors because they had a tendency to leave after a year or two, once you finished training them up. AI will just make the situation a lot worse. reply jajko 10 hours agoparentprevYes but then as all else this can easily be cyclic. Too few seniors to hire and they ask for ridiculous packages? Well lets train some of them in house, its not like the situation will explode overnight. Weird times ahead, probably, but we will be fine, mostly. reply pcwelder 12 hours agoprev> 3. The \"Trust but verify\" pattern To add on to this point, there's a huge role of validation tools in the workflow. If AI written rust code compiles and the test cases pass, it's a huge positive signal for me, because of how strict rust compiler is. One example I can share is https://github.com/rusiaaman/color-parser-py which is a python binding of rust's csscolorparser created by Claude without me touching editor or terminal. I haven't reviewed the code yet, I just ensured that test cases really passed (on github actions), installed the package and started using it directly. reply aiono 4 hours agoparentI checked the code. The code validates that values are within the range https://github.com/rusiaaman/color-parser-py/blob/ec739c80ba... but the library it wraps already does validation and a lot more checks (see range check here: https://docs.rs/csscolorparser/latest/src/csscolorparser/par...). So the code generated by AI has unnecessary checks that will never be visited. reply eesmith 11 hours agoparentprevYou might look into why rgba_255 return a fixed-length tuple while rgba_float returns a fixed-length list.

Oh well, I guess Claude was confused by the conventions between Rust and Python.

Etc. until a valid solution is found and the result is returned to the user. As an aside, this bug was present in Java for 9 years and would have been caught by formal verification (which admittedly was more difficult at the time): https://research.google/blog/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-n... reply jillesvangurp 10 hours agorootparentThe use of formal methods has historically been limited to very limited niche areas. The volume of code that is covered by formal verification is some ridiculously small percentage of the overall amount of code out there. The reason is probably that it is too tedious/difficult and you need some rare skills to do it. And mostly the categories of bugs it eliminates are not problematic enough. Either way, the amount of people capable of writing code vastly outnumber the people capable of formally verifying that code. I know a lot of programmers without computer science backgrounds that definitely have never been exposed to any of this. I have been exposed to some of this. But that's 25 years ago. And the persons teaching me that lived out his career in academia without ever working on real code that mattered. A lot of this stuff is rather academic and esoteric. Of course, LLMs could change this a quite a bit. A lot of programming languages are optimized for humans. Lots of programmers prefer languages that sacrifice correctness for flexibility. E.g. static typing is the simplest form of adding some formal verification to a language and a lot of scripting languages get rid of that because the verification step (aka. compilation) is somewhat tedious and so is having to spell out your intentions. Python is a good example of a language that appeals to people without a lot of formal training in programming. And some languages go the other way and are harder to use and learn because they are more strict. Rust is a good example of that. Great language. But not necessarily easy to learn. With LLMs, I don't actually need to learn a lot of Rust in order to produce working Rust programs. I just need to be able to understand it at a high level. And I can use the LLM to explain things to me when I don't. Likewise, I imagine I could get an LLM to write detailed specifications for whatever verifiers there are and even make helpful suggestions about which ones to pick. It's not that different from documenting code or writing tests for code. Which are two things I definitely use LLMs for these days. The point here is that LLMs could compensate for a lack of trained people that can produce formal specifications and produce larger volumes of such specifications. There's probably a lot of value in giving some existing code that treatment. The flip side here is that it's still work and it's competing with other things that people could spend time on. That Java issue you mentioned is an example of something that wasn't noticed for 9 years; probably because it wasn't that big of a problem. The value of the fix was lowish and so is the value of preventing the problem. A lot of bugs are like that. reply skydhash 5 hours agorootparentFormalism starts with intent and then removing ambiguity from that intent. Having intent is easy, removing it is not. Especially when you do not know the limitation of what you're using to materialize that intent. Python is easy because it lets you get somewhere because the inputs will roughly be the set of acceptable inputs, so the output will be as expected, and you can tweak as things go (much faster for scripting tasks). But when you need a correct program that needs to satisfies some guaranteed, then this strategy no longer cuts it, and suddenly you need a lot more knowledge. I don't think LLM would cut it, because it doesn't understand ambiguity and how to chisel it away so only the most essential understanding remains. reply eru 10 hours agorootparentprevYou might like property based testing. reply crakhamster01 40 minutes agoprevThis tracks with my experience as a more \"senior\" dev using Copilot/Cursor.

I do think there's a lot of value in going through the loop of struggling with -> developing a better understanding of technologies. While it's possible to maintain this loop with coding assistants, they're undoubtedly optimized towards providing quick answers/results.

Those who seems to get the best results asks for a prototype or framework for how to do something. They don't expect to use the AI generated code, it's purely there as inspiration and something they can poke at to learn about a problem. Most seems to have a bad experience. Either the LLMs doesn't actually know much, if anything about the subject, and makes up weird stuff. A few colleagues have attempted to use LLMs for generating Terraform, or CloudFormation code, but have given up on making it work. The LLMs they've tried apparently cannot stop making up non-existing resources. SRE related code/problems anecdotally seems to do worse than actual development work, but it feel to like you still need to be a fair good developer to have much benefit from an LLM. The wall we're hitting may be the LLMs not actually having sufficient data for a large set of problems. reply skydhash 4 hours agorootparent> Those who seems to get the best results asks for a prototype or framework for how to do something.

I started learning programming in the late nineties as a 9-year-old sitting at a library paying 10 NOK for an hour of internet access (the librarians were sweet and \"forgot\" how long I was sitting at the computer because they saw how much I was enjoying it). And I did the exact same thing described in this article: I grabbed whatever code I could that did something, didn't know how to debug it, and at best I could slightly tweak it to do something slightly different. After a few years I got better at it anyway. I started pattern matching, and through curiosity I found out what more senior developers were doing. Maybe the fact that I was just a kid made this different, but I guess my point is that just because AI can now write you a code file in 10 seconds, doesn't mean your learning process also got faster. It may still take years to become the developer that writes well-structured code and thinks of edge cases and understands everything that is going on. When I imagine the young people that will sit down to build their own first thing with the help of AI, I'm really excited knowing that they might actually get a lot further a lot faster than I ever could. reply skydhash 5 hours agoparentI started learning how to program around 2010.

Bolt.New redirects to StackBlitz, and after more than an hour, there are still spinners stuck on trying to import and deploy the generated code. Sounds like snake oil all around. The days of AI-enabled low-/no-code are still quite a while away, I think, if at all feasible. reply hazrmard 1 hour agoprevI agree with the author. My work involves designing simulations for control. Yesterday, I asked GPT-4o to write a python-only simulation for a HVAC system (cooling tower, chiller on the water side, and multiple zones with air handling units on the air side). It wrote functions to separately generate differential equations for water/air side, and finally combined them into a single state vector derivative for integration. Easy peasy, right? No. On closer inspection, the heat transfer equations had flipped signs, or were using the wrong temperatures. I'd also have preferred to have used structured arrays for vectors, instead of plain lists/arrays. However, the framework was there. I had to tweak some equations, prompt the LLM to re-write state vector representations, and there it was! AI-assisted coding is great for getting a skeleton for a project up. You have to add the meat to the bones yourself. reply ChicagoDave 11 hours agoprevThis mirrors my own experiences with Claude with one caveat. GenAI can get deeper into a solution that consists of well known requirements. Like basic web application construction, api development, data storage, and oauth integration. GenAI can get close to 100%. If you’re trying to build something that’s never been done before or is very complex, GenAI will only get to 50% and any attempt to continue will put you in a frustrating cycle of failure. I’m having some further success by asking Claude to build a detailed Linear task list and tackling each task separately. To get this to work, I’ve built a file combining script and attaching these files to a Claude project. So one file might be project-client-src-components.txt and it contains all the files in my react nextjs app under that folder in a single file with full file path headers for each file.

I find that if you can define your problem with a really clean set of interfaces, it can generally implement them perfectly.

Recently (particularly since Cursor came onto the scene) I'm finding I finish projects 50-60% faster than my estimates. It has been utterly game-changing and time-saving. I question each new bid I do: Should I assume AI will continue to help this much, and adjust my pricing? reply 946789987649 5 hours agoparentprevI've always been a backend developer, but started my own company about a year ago. From that, I had to become full stack and AI has helped dramatically with the learning and implementation. There's a lot of things which would have simply just taken far longer to understand or fix with just stackoverflow/google. And that's just on the coding side, even more on the actual start up side! reply marcosdumay 1 hour agorootparentOh, I know of a handful of people that report this. The quality of their work has gone down dramatically since they started being \"faster\", and it needs rewriting way more often than before LLMs existed. But they do claim they are now much faster. reply kraftman 8 hours agoparentprevI'm one of them. I've been coding for 22 years and now I use copilot all day every day. It gets stuff wrong, but I only ask it things I expect it to do well at, and I find it easy ignore or verify the bad answers. I've never used electron and I got a small electron project up and running considerably faster than I would have otherwise. I did some consulting for a project written in Vue and I know React, I got a good summary of the differences in the concepts, how to layout and structure files, etc. I had to modify a PHP project that was hosting Vue and I used chatgpt to find out where to look in the project to point to where I needed to look in the code to make the changes in the code. Just this morning I needed to use git bisect but I couldnt remember the exact syntax, I could have googled it and gone through the verbose documentation, the stackoverflow reply, or a long blog post. Instead, I got exactly what I needed back in seconds. I had to develop a migration plan for another project, I already had a rough idea of what to do, but I asked chatgpt anyway because why not, it takes seconds. It came up with what I had thought of already, some things I didn't need, and some things I hadn't thought of. reply thiht 7 hours agorootparentThat reads to me as \"slightly more productive\", not \"dramatically more productive\" reply kraftman 6 hours agorootparentI didn't realise we were being that pedantic about the phrasing. I had 3 months to evaluate a project, it took 1 month, I got asked to create a technical document for a migration in 2 weeks, it took 1 week. I wrote a prototype in a framework i didnt know and did it in less time than I could in a framework I know well without AI. reply habinero 8 hours agoparentprevYeah, it's pretty decent when you're doing the nuts and bolts scaffolding part of coding. Something like creating an ORM database table class, where all the fields are predictable and it's just a matter of writing out the right fields in the right format. It's also replaced the really stupid Stack Overflow queries, when Ruby and Python and Javascript have corrupted my brain and I can't remember whether it's bar.lower() or bar.lowercase() or bar.lcase() or lower(bar) or whatever. reply jillesvangurp 10 hours agoprevI'm replacing things that I used to delegate to juniors with generated code. Because it's quicker and better. And there's a category of stuff I used to not bother with at all that I'm also taking on. Because I can get it done in a reasonable time frame. It's more fun for me for sure and I definitely am more productive because of it. My feeling is that this stuff is not bottle-necked on model quality but on UX. Chat is not that great of an interface. Copy pasting blobs of text back to an editor seems like it is a bit monkey work. And monkey work should be automated. With AI interactions now being able to call functions, what we need is deeper integration with the tools we use. Refactor this, rename that. Move that function here. Etc. There's no need for it to imagine these things perfectly it just needs to use the tools that make that happen. IDEs have a large API surface but a machine readable description of that easily fits in a context window. Recently chat gpt added the ability to connect applications. So, I can jump into a chat, connect Intellij to the chat and ask it a question about code in my open editor. Works great and is better than me just copy pasting that to a chat window. But why can't it make a modification for me? It still requires me to copy text back to the editor and then hope it will work. Addressing that would be the next logical step. Do it such that I can review what it did and undo any damage. But it could be a huge time saver. And it would also save some tokens. Because a lot of code it generates is just echoing what I already had with only a few lines modification. I want it to modify those lines and not risk hallucinating introducing mistakes into the rest, which is a thing you have to worry about. The other issue is that iterating on code gets progressively harder as there's more of it and it needs to regenerate more of it at every step. That's a UX problem as well. It stems from the context being an imperfect abstraction of my actual code. Applying a lot of small/simple changes to code would be much easier than re-imagining the entire thing from scratch every time. Most of my conversations the code under discussion diverges from what I have in my editor. At some point continuing the conversation becomes pointless and I just start a new one with the actual code. Which is tedious because now I'm dealing with ground hog day of having to explain the same context again. More monkey work. And if you do it wrong, you have to do it over and over again. It's amazing that it works but also quite tedious. reply NitpickLawyer 9 hours agoparent> this stuff is not bottle-necked on model quality but on UX. Chat is not that great of an interface. Copy pasting blobs of text back to an editor seems like it is a bit monkey work. And monkey work should be automated. I agree wholeheartedly and that's why I recommend cursor to the point I'm being called a shill for them. I have no relationship to them, but they've shipped the first product that actually addresses this! They have a \"small model\" that takes a suggestion in the chat mode (provided by claude3.5 usually but o1 / 4o also work) and \"magic merges\" it into your codebase at the click of a button. It feels like such an easy task, but I bet it's not and a lot of tinkering went into it and the small mdoel they use. But the UX results are great. You start a chat, frame the problem, get an answer, hit \"apply\" and see it go line by line and incorporate the changes into your existing code. Give it a try. reply Quothling 10 hours agoparentprev> The other issue is that iterating on code gets progressively harder as there's more of it and it needs to regenerate more of it at every step. You might know this already, but if you're using the chatbot interfaces it helps quite a bit to prompt it with something along the lines of \"only give me the bits that changed\". There is nothing worse than fine-tuning a tiny bit of some code you didn't bother writing yourself only to have the bot give you an entire prompt's worth of code. reply jillesvangurp 6 hours agorootparentI do that sometimes. But then you get the problem of having to manually integrating the changes. Which is also tedious. reply danielbln 8 hours agoparentprevCheck out continue.dev or (my favorite) Zed. It allows you to generate code in patch format and the editor will apply the changes to the various files itself. Copy pasting from ChatGPT is so 2023. reply jillesvangurp 6 hours agorootparentI don't want to replace my IDE (intellij) because I actually like it and use a lot of what it does most of which is not supported in other tools. I want AI models to work with my tools. Tools like this are alright if your expectations of an IDE are low. E.g. if you are happy using just VS Code or whatever. Unfortunately I'm used to a bit more than that. Jetbrains has been doing some of their AI stuff. But I haven't really looked at it that much. Don't get me wrong; I actually use VS Code for some stuff. But it's just not a replacement for intellij. Not even close. So, not really looking for IDEs with even less features just so I can have some AI. reply demirbey05 11 hours agoprev> the actual software we use daily doesn’t seem like it’s getting noticeably better. %100 agree, I am testing o1 for some math problems.

Here is one of several example studies: https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3613904.3642706 reply agentultra 3 hours agoprevI think the real problem is that people are misunderstanding what programming is: understanding problems. The hard truth is that you will learn nothing if you avoid doing the work yourself. I'm often re-reading ewd-273 [0] from Dijkstra, The programming task considered as an intellectual challenge. How little distance have we made since that paper was published! His burning question: > Can we get a better understanding of the nature of the programming task, so that by virtue of this better understanding, programming becomes an order of magnitude easier, so that our ability to compose reliable programs is increased by a similar order of magnitude? I think the answer AI-assistants provide is... no. Instead we're using the \"same old methods,\" Dijkstra disliked so much. We're expected to rely on the Lindy effect and debug the code until we feel more confident that it does what we want it to. And we still struggle to convince ourselves that these programs are correct. We have to content ourselves with testing and hoping that we don't cause too much damage in the AI-assisted programming world. Not my preferred way to work and practice programming. As for, \"democratizing access to programming...\" I can't think of a field that is more open to sharing it's knowledge and wisdom. I can't think of a field that is more eager to teach its skills to as many people as possible. I can't think of any industry that is more open to accepting people, without accreditation, to take up the work and become critical contributors. There's no royal road. You have to do the work if you want to build the skill. I'm not an educator but I suspect that AI isn't helping people learn the practice of programming. Certainly not in the sense that Dijkstra meant it. It may be helping people who aren't interested in learning the skills to develop software on their own... up to a point, 70% perhaps. But that's always been the case with low-code/no-code systems.

Long thought of as too fragile and prone to damage, this natural resource has been re-engineered into a suite of fortified structural elements known as mass timber: glued, nailed doweled panels and beams able to shore-up everything from large residences to full-scale skyscrapers. The especially articulated roof of the recently expanded main terminal at Portland Airport (PDX) might be its most impressive application yet. Photo: Ema Peter Nationwide architecture firm ZGF implemented glulam (glue laminated) Douglas Fir for this massive nine-acre canopy, not only as an innovative and sustainable solution but also as a nod to local ecology and deeply-rooted cultural traditions. It’s a far cry from the standard glass and steel found at any other airport around the globe. The surrounding region is known for its dense old growth forests and thriving lumber trade. Most of the 3.5 million planks implemented in the project were sourced from smaller family operated and sustainably minded purveyors, as well as indigenous nations, based within a 300-mile radius; accounting for a notable reduction in the new building’s embodied carbon footprint. Photo: Ema Peter “With the new PDX, we wanted travelers to know they were in the Pacific Northwest before they even left the airport. And for locals, we wanted it to feel like home,” says Vince Granato, Chief Projects Officer at the Port of Portland. “Creating that sense of place started with ZGF’s spectacular design, which was brought to life by thousands of local craftspeople.” Photo: Ema Peter Photo: Dror Baldinger FAIA Photo: Dror Baldinger FAIA When it came to finding a way to expand this major hub “in place” rather than build entirely anew and cause significant distributions – the scourge of many other recent airport renovations – the Port of Portland authority called on ZGF to devise a phased construction strategy. Their solution was to create the expansive roof as a way of defining a significantly increased floor area without taking away from vital and well-utilized gates. This new single volume colossus also vastly ameliorates passenger experience; both in terms of practicality and atmosphere. Photo: Dror Baldinger FAIA The curvilinear installation is defined by a “forest” of open lattice structure slats that give way to concave recesses, which allows an ample amount of natural light to filter through. Inside, passengers engage with a series of streetscape and parkland-like plazas and fully-enclosed concessions before reaching their gates in one of four concourses. Biophilic design cues – the bringing of nature indoors as a means of fostering a better sense of well-being – can be found throughout. Everything from the flooring to the finishing in the individual hospitality spaces was also sourced locally. The canopy anchors large glass walls that frame unobstructed tarmac views and even the forests in the distance. Photo: Dror Baldinger FAIA “Everybody loves Portland International Airport,” concludes Gene Sandoval, ZGF Partner. “We had a tall order to evolve a terminal that’s essentially multiple buildings pieced together since the 1950s – and double the capacity while designing an experience passengers and employees will love as much as the original.” Photo: Ema Peter Photo: Dror Baldinger FAIA The largest mass timber building of its kind, Portland Airport’s new main terminal raises the bar in site-responsive and sustainable airport design but also non-disruptive expansion. For the redevelopment of Chicago O’Hare Airport, noted architecture firm Studio Gang is taking a similar approach. The next phase of the PDX mass timber transportation is set for completion in 2026.

When we burn fossil fuels, we use carbon that was stored by dead plants being buried. We take carbon from the ground and dump it in the atmosphere. Plants take carbon from the atmosphere.

So... there actually is a finite number of wooden airports that completely offsets airplane carbon emissions. reply closewith 8 hours agorootparent1 kilo of wood sequesters (temporarily for the most part) about 2kg CO2 equivalent, so for the GP's example of a single seat one-way from Boston - NYC, you'd need to sequester 350kg of wood. To sequester the ~800 Mt of CO2 emitted by aviation annually, you'd need to sequester about 400 billion kilograms of wood.

Burying wood that would have taken decades to decay is not equal to instantly releasing the equivalent amount of carbon. I'm not sure it's physically possible to remove CO2 from the atmosphere at the same rate a plane emits it, which would be the only way to genuinely \"offset\" the emissions. reply ericd 3 hours agorootparentprevThere's a simple way to think about this that doesn't require doing a ton of research and number crunching. Think about the volume of fuel in a single airplane, about 7,000 gallons for a 737, or about 100 55 gallon drums. It's nowhere near exact, but you can roughly equate that volume of fuel to the volume of volume of wood to compare carbon - I'm pretty sure this is being very generous to the energy density of the wood, but it gives you an upper limit on what the wood could be sequestering (I think in reality jet fuel is something like 2-3x as energy/carbon dense per m^3). Now think about how many planes take off every day from an airport, and the volume of n*100 drums. It's just nowhere near in reality, and we're not going to make a large dent via sequestration, the \"finite\" airports is functionally infinite for our purposes. We have to start making carbon neutral fuel. That said, manufacturing concrete is incredibly carbon intensive, so avoiding making the amount we would've needed for this building is a pretty good win. reply katangafor 5 hours agorootparentprevDoes burying wood actually work?

A tree that's been felled in that environment and left above ground will rot very quickly. reply pmayrgundter 8 hours agorootparentprevInteresting point! It looks like Skanska is GC for the Project, and cites it as a 9 acre (!) lumber roofing system[SK], and that it uses 3.5M board foot of Douglas Fir Project Lumber[PL]. Douglas Fir is 3.2 pounds per board foot, or 1.45kg [DFM]. So 1.45 * 3.5M = 5Mkg of lumber for PDX airport. DF has an Embodied CO2 of 1.6kgCO2/kgLumber [DFC]. A little hard to believe? But maybe that's bc a lot of the mass of a tree is left in the ground. Worth following up. 1.6kgCO2/kgLumber * 5MkgLumber = 8MkgCO2 = 8KtCO2 embodiment/sequestration from the PDX roof project. (tho there's a lot more to the project that probably goes in the other direction) Global CO2 emissions from commercial flights is ~60MtCO2/month [CF], so we need roughly 12,000 airports per month, 144,000/yr, to offset flight CO2 emissions. There's 9000 commercial airline airports [NA] (tho obv many smaller than PDX, but they would also represent less CO2 from their flights), so 144,000/9000 is a 16x annual airport rebuild rate we'd need to offset CO2 emissions from the flights they service. So yeah, this is absurd on the face of it. But, how much of the mass of an airport is the roof? If it's like 1/100th the total mass, and you start building airports with all wood (foundation, runways, etc) you'd get to 16% annual rebuild rate to offset flight emissions. Still too high to be plausible. But another 10x somehow and you get to ~1% range of annual airport rebuild rate to offset emissions. Then you'd have something.

But concrete is not so CO2 intensive. Lumber has a +1.6 sequestration factor of CO2 emitted vs built mass, compared with concrete at -0.8. So we'd need runways made mostly of wood, or combined with a Woodcrete that was net sequestering, and then maybe there's a way to make even our most CO2 intensive industries net neutral so long as we rebuild continuously. Also, since construction is about 40% of global CO2 emissions, if it could become a net sequestration as a whole, maybe it could flip the sign to -40% and offset most of the rest of our industrial emissions. This also got me interested in what's a good number for rebuild rate. Found a study that concludes the \"Apparent ecosystem carbon turnover time [T]\" is 43±7 years. So maybe we should be rebuilding our built environment at 2.3%, or probably higher since species have evolved to be more energy intensive, humans especially.

I'm not convinced the wood used in the Portland airport project is net negative in itself, once you factor in the emissions of harvesting, processing and transporting it. I.o.w. leaving the ugly old roof in place would probably have been better, in terms of CO2eq emitted. reply pmayrgundter 5 hours agorootparentI found a more authoritative reference, from the Institute of Structural Engineers, which appears to be a major international organization [ISE]. The Embodied Carbon figure they use is 1.64kgCO2/kg timber as a rule of thumb [ISE-EC], and agrees with what I posted above For processing that yields built lumber, they account in stages, with % CO2 emissions added: A1) Raw Material Extraction, 20-25% A2) Transport to Facility, 8-10% A3) Manufacture, 5-10% A4) Transport to Site, 50-55% A5) Construction, 10-15% A1 to A3 reduce sequestration by 0.28, for a net of 1.36. They then say A4&5 account for 1.5x more emissions than A1-3, so .42kg total factor, for a net sequestration of 1.22kgCO2/kgBuiltLumber. They separate these as the transport is the largest variable between projects. These figures are from Austria to UK. From the reporting, the PDX project is using mostly local wood. So I think they're getting a net sequestration for the roof project. It's really interesting that building with wood has this major sequestration factor. It'd be really something if we could build our way out of the environmental crisis just by switching to wood! :) [ISE] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution_of_Structural_Engi...

If you go with a high speed link that aims to speed up BostonNew York travel, it's more likely that you have trains that skip those stops, because additional stops are much more expensive for HSR from a speeding up and slowing down perspective, from a percentage of time added to trip perspective, and for an inefficient alignment perspective. In my view this is kind of a microcosm of the political problems of the geographically small states of the north east: states like CT/RI/DE especially have very narrow and niche concerns but because of their geographical position have effective veto power over regionally important things like \"how expensive are the tolls to drive between New York and DC?\" and \"can you have HSR between new york and boston?\" reply ciabattabread 4 hours agorootparentIt's not about skipping stops, it's about the amount of eminent domain you'd have to do to eliminate curves thru Connecticut's oldest and richest suburbs.

It cost billions, way more than budgeted, many of the bridges turned out to have construction faults (despite all the cost overruns) so the trains aren't able to actually go fast, and the high-speed trains were bought on a budget and had so many flaws that the Belgians refused to allow them. Now we're stuck with a non-highspeed train on the track that was supposed to be highspeed and cost a fortune to build.

The German railway network (including the high-speed part of it) has loads of issues, and it's hardly working like a dream. That said, the interconnect between large cities is pretty great when it works. For these intermediate distances (around 500 km) it's about as fast as flying would be once you factor in getting to/from the airport (vs the more central train station), being there early etc; and much faster than driving by car. reply wkat4242 6 hours agorootparent> I'm not surprised, building a new high-speed line between the largest cities in the Netherlands must be a nightmare, that's connecting and going through some of the most densely populated areas in Europe. Well, yes and no. Most of it goes through the 'green heart' of the most populated area. There's mostly farms there. The route also goes mostly along existing highways and train tracks so it was just a matter of widening the infrastructure zones that were already there. Holland is very planified so usually these things are already taken into consideration. We don't build housing right besides infrastructure anymore. However, the environmental red tape is pretty heavy these days. The whole country is at a standstill (house building, traffic, farming) due to limits of nitrogen deposits being exceeded. So I think it was more that than actual infringements on people's living space. Some tunnels and overpasses were made, yes.

It's the same vibe, but better executed. reply lordofgibbons 17 hours agoprevI wish we had more pretty architecture like this in the U.S. Our architecture is so utilitarian/corporate and built at the lowest price and just enough to meet building codes. I get why it is the way it is, but I can still wish. reply astrange 16 hours agoparentMuch of the issue is that city planners like it that way. The building codes require it, and when they don't, they'll have design review requirements where the planners will make you change it. There's a common modern look called a 5-over-1 which usually looks like a giant box made out of four different colored Lego sets. The random different colors are forced on them by planners who think it provides \"articulation\". The giant box look is because of double-stair requirements, which the US thinks provides fire safety but don't, and which force all big residential builds to be hotel-shaped. The PNW actually doesn't have these rules, although the rest of the country hasn't noticed yet. reply seanmcdirmid 13 hours agorootparentI think it’s 4 over 1 here in the Seattle area.

(Pretty sure everyone thinks it means # floors though.) 4 is mass timber, which is a newer very promising material.

But that is admittedly very cynical and I'm sorry. Surprised no one has pointed this out to you: Get Global Entry (it also comes with TSA Pre). You'll get to go in the fast TSA lines (no taking belt/shoes off). And international arrivals is a breeze. In fact, since I've got it, I've not had to wait in line even once at the immigration. To give you an idea, I flew into Seattle this year. Went into the Global Entry area. Straight to a kiosk (no line at all). The kiosk took my picture, and figured out who I was and that was it. No customs declaration even (which was weird, what if I do have something to declare?). So: No line. Kiosk takes a picture. Never took my passport out to show to anyone. Good to go. In the old days, you'd have the kiosk scan your passport. And it'd ask if you're bringing in over $800 in goods (just yes/no - no need to itemize). But still, no line. I don't know what they charge now, but it was $100 and lasts 5 years. If you live close to the Canadian/Mexican border, consider getting NEXUS, which gives you the fast lane when driving to these countries. It's only $50, and it includes Global Entry and TSA Pre. Fantastic deal. The down side is the interview locations are only near the border. reply trevoragilbert 16 hours agoparentprevI can't speak to international arrivals (though I can to the rest of the airport, it's gorgeous), but while PDX is international it only has 5 direct international flights other than Canada.

And slow. Get off the plane, go directly to a shuttle bus, drive around a while, then go in and wait in what was clearly never really intended to be an arrivals area. I gather than there are so few international arrivals that it will likely never be upgraded, but I sure would love to see the fancy face scanning electronic passport reader kiosks like other places have. And in a place that is reachable in the main terminal, without the shuttle bus experience. reply jeffbee 16 hours agorootparentIt's a miracle that Portland has direct international service at all. They probably had to bodge on the customs area after the place was built to pick up that route to Vancouver. Also good to keep in mind that a lot of older airports seem kludged together because they were. Fifty years ago passengers were screened at the gate. Then they invented central screening. Then they invented TSA and stopped letting non-passengers into the terminals. reply rootusrootus 15 hours agorootparentI'm very happy they have a direct route to LHR.

(The international part anyway - the domestic terminal is plainer.) reply noisy_boy 9 hours agoprevBeautiful. Also, what about fire hazard? Ctrl+F fire had zero matches. reply snakeyjake 2 hours agoparentWood burns, but modern suppression systems increase the time to evacuate. Fires don't usually (hell, hardly ever) start with the structure wooden or otherwise, they start with the things inside a structure: wiring, upholstery, drapery, etc. By the time the fire gets large and hot enough to fuel itself on the structure all of the occupants are already dead due to carbon monoxide and/or hydrogen cyanide poisoning, so the flammability of the structure is almost irrelevant to occupants. Even in Type 1 (all concrete) and Type 2 (concrete and steel) structures, burning the structure's contents will kill every occupant the same as a building made wholly or partially from wood. That's why large steel reinforced concrete buildings have self-closing doors, smoke extraction systems, and areas of refuge: the building being on fire won't kill you, the smoke from the burning carpeting and paint will. With the Station Nightclub fire, it started at 11:07pm. The wooden structure was compromised to the point that the roof partially collapsed at 11:57pm. All occupants who had not escaped were dead well before the five-minute mark (11:12) when flames were seen exiting the doors and windows with NIST estimating that anyone still inside the structure 90 seconds after initial ignition was already dead. 50 minutes for the wood to burn, 90 seconds for the stuff inside to burn and kill you. All of that being said, wooden structures are more dangerous to firefighters due to the risk of collapse long into the fire as suppression and/or search and rescue operations are occurring. reply Etheryte 8 hours agoparentprevNot familiar with the specific wood composite used in this construction, but generally wood composites fare really well in this regard. You can mix fire retardants into the adhesives and they char, which creates a sort of protective layer. They're not fireproof, but they're both hard to get going and they usually burn very slow once they do. Another good property is that they burn predictably, they don't have catastrophic failures, but gradual ones. reply MeteorMarc 12 hours agoprevGlulam is new for me, online knew CLT: https://seagatemasstimber.com/what-are-the-key-differences-b... reply cozzyd 15 hours agoprevI flew into PDX last weekend and was very pleasantly surprised.

A quick Google search says that species takes 50-100 years to mature reply rootusrootus 15 hours agoparent50-70 years is the typical harvest time in Oregon. This works out fine because we have a large amount of forest, douglas fir is the most productive harvested timber by acre, and they do not harvest the whole forest at once. They typically harvest 1 square mile sections at a time. Here are some pictures to give an idea of the logging pattern: https://imgur.com/a/grid-grid-logging-oregon-ewNJL2e reply tills13 15 hours agoparentprevI believe in this case they aren't waiting for it to mature. They use what's called LVL (laminate veneer lumber) which is basically thin sheets of the wood glued together (think plywood but thicker) and then recut into dimensional sizes. The end product is both stronger and straighter than conventional lumber. And because you don't need a large cross section (almost literally any size will do), you can have a pretty short planting -> harvesting cycle. reply rootusrootus 15 hours agorootparentPDX is not using LVL, they're using glulam.

Let's meet them. Doug O'Laughlin Dec 05, 2024 ∙ Paid 99 Share this post Fabricated Knowledge The Death of Intel: When Boards Fail Copy link Facebook Email Notes More 3 8 Share If you haven’t heard the news, Pat Gelsinger is “retiring.” The reality is this was not a retirement but a firing of Pat. His brief stint of 1386 days was surprising because not only was he the most technically competent CEO of the last few bad apples at Intel, but he was also among the shortest. Pat has by no means been perfect, and the conference at UBS kind of showed the frustrations that the board likely had with Pat. I'd say, the one thing that has definitely come out of the way the Board is thinking about this is, they do recognize and have pushed us that, hey, we made a lot of investments from a capital perspective in foundry, and we need to start seeing some incremental ROIC on those investments. And so and that's what we're committed to do. That's going to be my -- one of my major focuses, definitely, while I'm CFO or as I'm CFO. But of course, in the interim period where I'm CEO, I'll obviously be focused on that as well. Meanwhile, Pat wanted to pursue the big, bold IFS bet, with 100s of thousands of wafers, when the reality is just getting 10s of thousands of wafers is a massive problem as is. Pat has a bit of an optimistic naivety that comes into play, and I am sure it was likely frustrating. But the reality is he’s the single best candidate for the company. More importantly than being suited for the job, he wants to do it. It’s probably one of the most challenging jobs in the world, and he’s playing for the hometeam. The CEOs who got Intel into this mess were much longer than Pat and a worse fit. Meanwhile, the board let most of his predecessor’s activities go unchecked as they sped through disaster. This begs the question—what the hell was the board doing? Today, I will talk about Pat Gelsinger, the Intel board, and an example of when boards and short-termism fail. Yes, maybe splitting up the company would result in a better result for shareholders, but it would be much worse for America. I would liken firing Pat in the final hour of 18A to quitting the final round of chemotherapy in cancer treatment. Instead of seeing the long and painful process through, I think the board will let Intel die and be sold for parts. It’s the correct answer to maximize relatively short-term shareholder value, but it's a nearsighted move that the Intel board specializes in. So, what does that mean for the storied giant? Let’s dive deeper. Today, I’ll discuss the board, Pat, and where Intel is headed. There are so many clues, and I believe the saddest outcome is the most likely here. Meet Intel’s Board of Directors So, it’s time to talk about the board. Remember, we have to consider each board member's key attributes. For this analysis, I’ll be looking at: Semiconductor experience Other company/work experience Tenure at Intel Meet the board members and committees. Frank Yeary (Chairman of Board & Chair of M&A) Frank has been on the Intel board since 2009 and was recently named chair in 2023. He’s the managing member of Darwin Capital and a former Executive Chairman of a corporate advisory firm. He primarily has experience in M&A, 25 of which at Citigroup. He’s a deal guy and was made Chairman of the Board in 2023. He serves on the boards of Paypal and Mobileye. Although his Semiconductor experience looks limited, he’s been on Intel’s board for the entire fiasco and is also the chairman of the M&A committee. Barbara Novick (Chair of Governance & Nominating) Barbara sits on the all-important nominating committee. She co-founded Blackrock in 1988 (what a flex) and has almost exclusively worked there for her entire career. She joined the board in December 2022. She has almost no semiconductor experience, is relatively new, and thus is not at fault. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey (Vice Chair of Nominating) Meet Dr. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, who joined the board in March 2018. She has a doctorate in Medicine from Harvard and seems to be a professional board member. She sits on the GE Healthcare and Merck boards. She’s also been on the boards of GE, Better Therapeutics, Genworth Financial, Beckman Coulter, and Hess Corporation. Her career is not clear to me. She’s a professor of health at the University of Pennsylvania and CEO of one of the largest healthcare philanthropies in the US. She seems to be a professional board member, has no semiconductor experience, and has been around for some of the fiasco at Intel, at least since 2018. Gregory Smith (Chair of Audit and Finance) Meet Greg. He’s the former CFO and EVP of operations at Boeing. He’s been on the board since 2017 and was an interim CEO at Boeing during 2020. He also sits on the American Airlines board and is Chairman there. He sits on the Sierra Nevada Space Corporation board as well. He has almost no semiconductor experience and could probably be directly involved with the Boeing fiasco. He’s been on the board for the entire Intel disaster and, at one point, was interim CEO of Boeing, so he's likely not the most focused member. Dion Weisler (Chair of Talent & Comp) Dion Weisler joined the board in 2020. He also sits on the board of BHP and Thermo Fisher. He was CEO of HP from 2015 to 2019 and has a Bachelor of Applied Science in Computing. He’s relatively new and has some experience in computing but not precisely semiconductor experience. I would consider him a decently qualified candidate, and he has not been on the board for most of the Intel disaster. James Goetz James Goetz is a partner at Sequoia and joined the board in November 2019. He has previously served on networking-focused boards. He has a degree in electrical engineering, is likely semi-technical, and understands the industry. He’s relatively new but likely does not have a technical background. Andrea Goldsmith Andrea Goldsmith joined the board in September 2021. She is a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Princeton. She’s been a CTO and cofounded previous technology companies, including one for high-speed wireless networking. She also sits on the board of Medtronic and Crown Castle. She’s relatively new but qualified in the semiconductor space. She hasn’t been around since the disaster. Alyssa Henry Alyssa joined the board in 2020. She was Square's CEO for 9 months, from February 2023 to October 2023. She previously worked at Amazon, serves on the Confluent board, and formerly was on the Unity board (lol). She’s new and unqualified in semiconductors, and it looks like she’s had a rough career. Nine months as CEO and then out is not exactly a great look. Omar Ishrak The board's former chairman Dr. Omar stepped down in January 2023. He’s been on the board since 2017 and was chairman from 2020 to 2023. He’s the former CEO of Medtronic and retired in 2020. Before Medtronic, he worked at GE. He has no semiconductor experience, and he was around for the entire disaster and was the chairman, the man with the most power to change the board. He’s very much at fault and still on the board. Tsu-Jae King Liu Tsu-Jae King Liu joined Intel’s board in 2016. She’s an engineering professor at Berkeley and sits on the Maxlinear board. She has heavy semiconductor experience but no industry experience. She was around for the entire Intel disaster. Stacy Smith Stacy Smith has been on the board since March 2024 and fills Lip-Bu Tan’s spot. He serves as the chairman of Kioxia and chair of Autodesk. Stacy is one of the few in the industry with semiconductor experience. Sadly, it’s from within Intel. He’s a new seat, and so is not exactly to blame. The thing that does suck is his background is not exactly great. He is the Chairman of the Autodesk board, which currently has an activist investor because it’s poorly managed. He also is on the Wolfspeed Board (which is poorly managed). So he has experience, but his other experiences don’t look that great. The incoming board members are both super technically skilled, but I want to focus on the backward-looking board for this analysis. Eric Meurice and Steve Sanghi are very qualified but just got there. Thoughts on the Board The board is pretty horrific. Most of the people have no technical expertise, and many of the people most at fault for getting Intel to where it is, are still on the board. Let’s take a second to acknowledge that Boeing's EVP of operations is the audit committee head and has been on the board for the entire fiasco. That’s probably the only other American giant having as bad a time as Intel! There are many Medtronic-related members, people with medical backgrounds, and what it looks like to be a professional board member. An average panel of semiconductor professionals would likely be more qualified to manage the board than the current board! The most senior board members (responsible for the disaster) are in positions of power, and the former chairman is still on the board. He should be fired. The lack of semiconductor experience is staggering. Only one person with industry and semiconductor experience isn’t a professor; they joined this year. This is a disaster board, and the blind are leading the seeing. That’s why Pat got fired; the board doesn’t know what it’s doing. Pat’s faults are real, but how could he get objective feedback from this board? What’s more, there’s an interesting and evident dynamic with the new chairman. My quick read on the situation is that the new Chairman got his job in 2023, only 2 years after Pat got the job. And when you’re an incoming chairman, you don’t sound smart by saying, “Let’s continue the strategy that will have to cut to the bone to save the patient.” You sound a lot smarter coming in with a change plan, and given Frank's M&A background, his ideas will likely always be based on M&A, so it’s time to sell the company for parts. So Frank did what deal guys do: He looked for some deals. We’ve heard the rumored Qualcomm buyout and Altera sale, so we know the board is looking for options. But how does that impact Pat? I think the key is actually in a Stratchery Interview. Check out this interview excerpt. Pat Gelsinger: Let me give maybe three different answers to that question, and these become more intellectual as we go along. The first one was I wrote a strategy document for the board of directors and I said if you want to split the company in two, then you should hire a PE kind of guy to go do that, not me. My strategy is what’s become IDM 2.0 and I described it. So if you’re hiring me, that’s the strategy and 100% of the board asked me to be the CEO and supported the strategy I laid out, of which this is one of the pieces. So the first thing was all of that discussion happened before I took the job as the CEO, so there was no debate, no contemplation, et cetera, this is it. The strategy has changed at the top, and now the chairman thinks it’s time for a “PE kind of guy” because IDM 2.0’s grand vision has sailed, and now it’s time for a deal. There are more signs as well. Intel has an activist defense campaign, meaning the board feels pressure. The Qualcomm and Altera rumors were clearly leaked, and Intel is likely looking for outside buyers. The chairman’s strategy is to sell as much as he can. What is confusing is that the recent CHIPs Act funding also has heavy sale restrictions. The vultures are circling, and Pat has said publically, “I’m not that CEO,” so the board decided enough is enough. The board has decided to gut Intel. Four former board members wrote an OpEd about splitting the company in two. The winds of change are clearly to abandon IDM 2.0, and Pat doesn’t fit into that picture. Now, here’s the thing - I do think that gutting Intel makes sense for shareholder value. Hell, selling Altera and accelerating the sale of Mobileye is an obvious move. A sum of the part thesis there probably works, as Intel’s stake in Mobileye, Altera, IFS, and Design all are worth something, and that’s probably higher than the share price today. But the reality is that outcome also sucks and feels extremely short-term oriented. I would argue that this is the right move in the short term, “value creation,” but in the long term, there couldn’t be a worse outcome for shareholders, industry partners, and, importantly, America. This is the board's failure, but I have to ask: who hires them exactly? When Boards Fail The board isn’t qualified. Let’s contrast the above resumes with Pat’s. Pat was the CTO of Intel in its heyday, the chief architect of the i486 that saved the company, and probably one of the most decorated electrical engineers of all time. On the other hand, the board is run by a group of people with no semiconductor experience, and some are legitimate undermanagement scenarios (Boeing, Autodesk, Paypal). The board's chairman has been involved in the entire debacle since 2009. He could have voted against Pat getting the job over Brian Krzanich in 2009. But this is where things get interesting—while boards are a way to govern boards effectively, they are not perfect. The board has almost unanimous votes for “yes” despite royally screwing up the company year after year. And why is that? I will take another step deeper than the board, and that’s the investors. Most large investors vote alongside Glass Lewis and ISS recommendations, the two most prominent proxy solutions for investors. Most GL/ISS recommendations tend to vote with the board and don’t change much unless something drastic happens. If you’re a passive investor, you vote in line with the two proxy powerhouses. Intel’s board has been running on autopilot for a long time. There should have been an activist sooner. The problem (and I have talked to activists) is that the ship is tough to turn around, and the odds are you don’t make money. So, the risk reward is pretty bad, and fixing the company means treading water, not a homerun in equity returns. Ironically, most investors look at the Intel situation and rightfully say, “Wow, that is way too hard,” and that’s the problem. Why fix when you can flee to the 1000s of other company’s stock? The people who left owning the company are primarily passive investors who will vote with Glass-Lewis and ISS. The top 3 shareholders are passive, with 30% of the vote, and going down the list of shareholders, it’s clear there’s not much active ownership in the company. Primecap, UBS, Capital Group could possibly considered passive. But if you start to add Charles Schwab, Invesco, and Van Eck, you get close to ~33%, a tough minority to overcome. The ship captain (shareholders) are asleep, and most who are smart enough to care to know to avoid the neighborhood that’s Intel. Meanwhile, the board made voting recommendations yearly, and Glass Lewis and ISS went with the board. Intel’s board is being run on autopilot, and that’s how we got the list of supremely unqualified board members. This is an excellent example of how boards fail. No one raised their hand to stop the autopilot, and now the formerly greatest American semiconductor company is in shambles. They have fired the technical leader they needed to turn around Intel. There are valid reasons, as Pat’s naive optimism can feel delusional. It never felt like he never truly acknowledged the problem at hand and had visions of old Intel in his head. But he wanted to do the job, and that’s hard to say for most people. Meanwhile, the transcript out today talking about “rightsizing utilization” implies that the Board didn’t like his grand plans (overly optimistic plans) for IFS and saw the product imploding. At the same time, the CEO focused on the loss-making part of the business. But that’s the thing—the profitable part of the business is commoditized and will only worsen. I would argue that it’s a former monopoly that has become commoditized and will soon become worse. It makes sense to focus on the future, and IFS could have been one of two (TSMC) instead of a product group, which is one of many. The moonshot has always been IFS; now it’s time for plan B. And I frankly find Plan B to be uninspiring. Things are changing fast. They just appointed two new board members, the former CEO of ASML and the current interim CEO of Microchip, to the board. This is an excellent step in the right direction, but it’s like hiring a surgeon and an oncologist after the cancer has moved to stage 4. It might be too late, but it sure is the right direction.

    "commentBody": "Intel’s board, and an example of when boards and short-termism fail (fabricatedknowledge.com)320 points by LarsDu88 18 hours agohidepastfavorite232 comments ksec 9 hours agoWe have a whole article on Intel's Board and not a single word on Andy Bryant? Andy Bryant was large part of the reason Pat Gelsinger left Intel in the first place. He has been the Chairman of the Board since 2012 and on the board as Vice Chairman for even longer. So yes, all the strategy and direction of Intel's CEO in the past 10 years prior to Pat Gelsinger can be attributed to him. He also handpicked all the Intel CEO since Paul Otellini. Pat was called number of times to be backed as next CEO to save Intel during and after Brian Krzanich 's era. He said \"no\" every time. Pat agree to be new CEO to replace interim or later official CEO Bob Swan after Andy Bryant's announced his retirement in early 2020. Handing it over to his friend Omar Ishrak. The share-holding part was the reason why Intel cant cut off its dividends the first thing Pat came back. They only wanted Intel to keep handing out those dividends. And ultimately it was the Shareholders or Wall Street, handing out Board Membership to their circles until it is run to the ground. reply brookst 5 hours agoparentWell said. Everyone kept acting like Intel “should be” an innovator but was somehow failing, when the shareholders were running it as a cash cow all along. Rightly or wrongly, they decided a long time ago that it would be more lucrative for Intel to be in decline, and that became self-fulfilling. reply michaelt 1 hour agorootparent> the shareholders were running it as a cash cow all along Those shareholders have seen an average dividend yield of 2.83% [1] in the past 5 years. In the meantime, the inflation rate has been 2.43%. And if you're about to say 'stock buybacks are more tax-efficient' the stock price is down 63% over that period. If you think that's a cash cow, you should see what an amazing deal 5-year treasury bills are, with their jaw-dropping 4% return on investment. [1] https://ycharts.com/companies/INTC/dividend_yield reply jahabrewer 1 hour agorootparentGP probably means the 2010s, during which the board milked the company instead of investing. reply glial 3 hours agorootparentprevThis is another reason that any federal investment in Intel should have strings attached. reply AnotherGoodName 2 hours agorootparentI think Intel should just be bypassed entirely. Each node is such a leap in process it requires entirely new fabs. At that point going with the poorly run incumbent is pointless. A few facts about intel. Wages have been stagnant there for over 20years now. Just recently they had wage reductions across the company and there’s been layoffs for those 20years of stock declines. Tsmc in Taiwan literally pays double on a ppp basis (it’s not even that far off on a direct dollar to dollar basis). Even china has been poaching from intel. Look up the Chinese government funded Lianqiu Lake R&D Center, they are offering more for talent in raw $ terms in a custom built luxury city. And yes I get that if you were born in the USA you probably want to stay there but there’s no hope of intel poaching international talent anymore. Do you know what the current boards plan is? More layoffs and lower wages. Like how the fuck can they compete without talent which they haven’t had for over 20years now. Everyone there knows it’s a stepping stone job. Do the bare minimum in hire and jump as soon as the next opportunity arises. And the government wants to give funding to this short sighted turd. reply sroussey 1 hour agorootparentIntel is hugely bloated. - Intel: 126,000 employees - AMD: 26,000 employees - TMSC: 76,000 employees - NVIDIA: 29,000 employees reply hedgehog 1 hour agorootparentIf you add AMD (design) + TSMC (fab) it's not that far off from Intel (who does both, and sells >3x AMD by units). Clearly there are struggles at Intel but the simple math doesn't explain it. reply AnotherGoodName 1 hour agorootparentprevYou’d need to split that by business segment. Intel has more foundries than even tsmc and the others don’t have foundries. reply tester756 54 minutes agorootparentprevAMD 26K + TSMC 76K = 102k ~=~ INTEL (126K - 15K) = 110k reply sroussey 1 hour agorootparentprevIt does. No share buybacks for example. reply etempleton 16 hours agoprevThe board’s lack of technical or even product expertise struck me when it was announced Gelsinger would abruptly retire. They don’t have the chops to be the wartime board Intel needs. They likely have no idea if Gelsinger was on the right path or chasing a dream. I believe Gelsinger was the right person for the job, but the board wasn’t and isn’t. The board would have had to approve of his plans. They should have known what they were signing up for. For Gelsinger’s part he was probably too cavalier with finances and market sentiment to ever sustain any political capital. reply owenversteeg 12 hours agoparentI agree that the board's lack of technical expertise is an issue, but I think the root issue is - and hear me out, because this sounds ridiculous - the vibes. At the end of the day, a company is a machine to turn employee labor into revenue. Intel has clearly been a sinking ship for years now. What kind of people work at a failing company? What kind of people serve on its board? Is this portrait of the board not a portrait of any other failing business? reply lordnacho 6 hours agorootparent> the vibes I went to lunch the other day with a friend. We had both worked at Intel during our early careers, and we still know people who are there over 20 years later. Of course the topic arose of our old workplace. We had a great time there it should be said. But neither of us stayed on, and it was vibes. Even at that time, as a young guy in university, I thought something was wrong. I couldn't tell what, since I was a young guy who barely knew anything about the business. But I knew that I felt uncomfortable about potentially spending decades at a place where everyone was so relaxed. There was no urgency. People would come in, find a colleague to have coffee with, and that was their day. I checked with the other interns as well, it was really chill. I was working on my thesis, and my team was working on rolling out what would later be called WiFi. Amazingly, part of the strategy was to slow down certain standards, because we were behind in some of the fabs. That didn't seem like what you would do as a cutting-edge technology company. People at the all-hands would ask things like \"should we keep AMD around just for show? So that we aren't a monopoly?\". Well, that problem has been solved now. I got offered a permanent role but never even considered it. reply le-mark 6 hours agorootparentA phenomena so common it has a name: https://medium.com/geekculture/the-dead-sea-effect-d71df1372... reply brookst 5 hours agorootparentprevAs someone who worked at Intel for 5ish years a while ago, I partly agree. There was a fatalism to the culture; a sense that any initiative had to be simultaneously super low risk and guaranteed to generate $1B in revenue within a couple of years. It had to be 100% predictable and planned month by month years in advance, and also exactly what customers would want on day one. The people who “succeeded” were those who could sell that story to the finance org (who essentially made all the product decisions), and who could move onward and upward before the fairy tale collapsed. The disconnect between the aspirational culture (risk taking, tech-forward, customer-focused) and the real culture (risk averse, finance-forward, planning-focused) was extreme. The whole place was like a filter designed to retain only those who had no interest or capability to fix the systemic issues. reply sbarre 3 hours agorootparentThis describes almost every large enterprise I've ever done work for or worked at. reply Retric 2 hours agorootparentIn most giant companies it is a reasonable strategy. The critical difference is most large companies don’t need to innovate. United doesn’t design aircraft, airports, etc they compete with other huge companies in an extremely capital intensive industry and execution is what matters. FedEx, Walmart, Bank of America, etc all need to keep up with their competitors but there’s no need to make risky bets when slow and steady brings in billions of revenue and nothing external is going to drive them out of business quickly. Intel essentially forgot just how ruthless their industry was and got crushed. reply cma 17 minutes agorootparentI think all major airlines have pretty much gotten to the point of bankruptcy without bailouts reply nine_zeros 2 hours agorootparentprev> There was a fatalism to the culture; a sense that any initiative had to be simultaneously super low risk and guaranteed to generate $1B in revenue within a couple of years. It had to be 100% predictable and planned month by month years in advance Ultimately, this is what MBA-style corporations do. They want unfettered predictability and massive revenues from every initiative. They even set up corporate structures to penalize failures. As a result, layers and layers of managers, and managers and engineers are all risk averse. They will be penalized for being wrong, their jobs and livelihoods are put on stake. What does one expect in such an environment? Innovation/risk-taking or politics of self-preservation/blaming/backstabbing? The MBA-style is a failure for innovation and Intel should be a case study in every MBA school. reply AnotherGoodName 2 hours agorootparentprevThe pay is ridiculously low. Lower than tsmc in Taiwan on a ppp basis (not that far off in raw $ terms). Much lower than tiny hardware startups in the USA. Monumentally lower than AMD or nvidia, especially with stock grants factored in. No pay rises for over 20years now. Layoffs on a routine basis. They asked everyone to take a pay cut last year. All of this in an extremely competitive labour market. It’s pretty obvious to anyone that a job at intel is temporary. You take the job and do the bare minimum (because hey you’re paid bare minimum) and keep looking. There isn’t going to be a single employee outside the board at intel who isn’t browsing for a new job given the wage disparity. Everyone knows this. If you have a brilliant improvement for process keep it to yourself and take it to the next job. A low level position at a startup pays more than a senior role at intel at this point. It’s a laughing stock and the most recent statement at the last earnings was more layoffs and wage freezes to give more shareholder value. They already have 0 serious talent and nobody gives a fuck there, reasonably so. “You’re going to lay me off from by far the lowest paying company in tech if I don’t give 100%?” “Ok!”. It’s such a joke of a company and has been for 20 years now and the investors have made it clear they want another 20 years of this. reply AnotherGoodName 1 hour agorootparentDo you want $77k/yr for a job with degree requirements at intel in an extremely high cost of living area or would you rather get well over $200k/yr at a competitor for the exact same job description. Lol. This was one random example out of pretty much any role at intel just to give awareness of how dire 20 years of wage freezes from short term investors becomes over time. https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Intel-Corporation/job-titles/Inte... https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/NVIDIA-Signal-Integrity-Eng... reply nimish 3 hours agorootparentprevCulture eats strategy for breakfast. Intel's innovate or die culture died years ago Inertia has taken its time but the company itself is catching up reply nradov 19 minutes agorootparentprevPeople seeking permanent US residency via an H-1B visa want to work at a failing company. And I don't blame them; from their perspective it's a totally rational choice as long as the company doesn't fire them before they get a green card. reply mrtksn 10 hours agorootparentprevInteresting take, but wouldn't also have the chance to attract the exactly right people too? Renegades, outcasts who dreamed too big for Nvidia or never got the opportunity at TSMC maybe? There are many comeback stories, Apple being a particularly great one. reply rob74 9 hours agorootparentI don't want to belittle Apple's success, but managing the turnaround at Apple didn't require the kind of long-term planning and commitment that investments in semiconductor manufacturing require. reply ChrisMarshallNY 6 hours agorootparentI wouldn't be so sure about that. Apple is a huge hardware machine, and has been, since Day One. They not only have to deal with manufacturing hardware, but also promotion and distribution, which is not for the faint of heart. Most of Intel's work is B2B, while Apple is B2C. Steve Jobs was particularly good at playing The Long Game; something American CEOs generally suck at. reply brookst 4 hours agorootparentWhile it’s true that hardware was a central part of Apple’s turnaround, it was the comparatively simple and quick hardware of designing boards with off the shelf parts (at the time). That’s actually closer to software than the “hire the bulldozers to break ground for the building that is designed from blueprints to house the highly custom machines designed to make the chips using the fab processes that we’re betting the company on” kind of hardware. At its core, Intel (like TSMC) is more of a manufacturing company than a tech company. reply ChrisMarshallNY 4 hours agorootparentI was thinking more about the long-term planning that Jobs was so known for. He would develop product lines that would take years to break even. Not all were able to make the cut. I worked for a Japanese corporation, and most of their initiatives had decade-long timelines. US companies tend to have 3-month-long timelines (I have no idea why /s). reply lotsofpulp 2 hours agorootparent> US companies tend to have 3-month-long timelines (I have no idea why /s). I don’t understand this platitude because the largest and most profitable businesses in the world, US tech and pharma companies, have very long timelines. Amazon took 20+ years to literally build infrastructure, the early investors of Facebook were not looking for a 3 month payday, they invested billions for the 10+ year payday. See the HN threads for when Zuckerberg paid for Instagram and WhatsApp, with so many wondering how he would recoup the enormous investment. Apple probably plowed billions into watches AirPods and M processors for years before it saw a return, going so far as to lend money to TSMC for many years with no guarantee of TSMC being able to make the product they wanted. Tesla, Alphabet’s Waymo bet, Uber, Nvidia, so many publicly listed businesses have a years long timelines Same for US pharma, it takes decades to get a product to market, with a high chance it never does. reply ChrisMarshallNY 2 hours agorootparentEvery single example that you gave, had visionaries behind the long-term pushes. Steve Jobs had a lot of failures. It's just that his successes were so successful, that people forget about the duds. These visionaries don't just have plans, they have fiendish plots, that would make a Grand Vizier hang his head in shame. But they move on, and that's when the \"quarter-miners\" inevitably move in. reply lotsofpulp 56 minutes agorootparentThe formula seems to be “businesses led by people with long term goals + filled with employees capable of executing + luck”. I don’t think “US” is a useful qualifier, publicly listed businesses all over the world have the same short-termism without the right ingredients. reply ChrisMarshallNY 22 minutes agorootparentThe Japanese basically have \"long-terminism\" baked into their corporate bylaws. The company I worked for, is a pretty \"old-fashioned\" one, so may no longer be representative of the standard, but it didn't matter who was in charge. All planning was done in 10/5/3/1 year process; with the goals getting \"sharper,\" as you approached zero. It was not particularly conducive to software development, but worked fairly well, for most of the stuff they made. freeqaz 10 hours agorootparentprevThere are also a lot of geopolitical interests in helping Intel succeed. As much as investors might balk at Intel today, the amount of money that Western governments can toss at the problem is effectively infinite. (Looking at Defense contractors as an example; horrendously inefficient, but tax revenue is effectively perpetually guaranteed to keep flowing.) It's silly to frame it this way, but even though the US and allies pay gobs for planes like the F-35, it's also what continues to allow the stream of taxable money to continue. I view Intel in a similar light. Even if they stay inefficient, there will still be money for a long time because the West needs a way to be self-sufficient. The cost of not having a backup is too high (tens of trillions of dollars when I last looked into it). It's a weird market that doesn't obey a lot of the conventional rules of capitalism. Yes, it would be better if Intel were able to compete without government subsidies, and maybe they will. But even if they don't it's very unlikely they'll totally crater because of how central this \"power\" is, and TSMC will never cede full control of their latest tech until the UN recognizes Taiwan as a distinct entity from China (imo). reply rob74 9 hours agorootparentWell, the current US administration was committed to helping Intel succeed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIPS_and_Science_Act), not so sure about the incoming one. Maybe that also played a part in the decision? reply rolandog 7 hours agorootparentprevExactly. It's a \"too big to fail\" with a touch of \"what are you gonna do, let me go bankrupt?\" situation. reply XorNot 9 hours agorootparentprevThe F-35 is actually an extremely affordable 5th generation fighter aircraft. It is cheaper per unit then some 4th generation aircraft now. reply michaelt 1 hour agorootparentYes, the F-35 costs just $34,000 per flight hour. That's much cheaper than, say, Pat Gelsinger whose total comp was $86,000 per hour in 2021. reply AdrianB1 9 hours agorootparentprevSuch people are not hired by this companies, the hiring process is strongly against them.

Similar to what's happened with Yahoo. PE could buy it, spin out/sell the most distracting adjacent parts of the business, and then focus the core business over the next five years without needing to publicly deliver quarterly updates. It would be a massive PE deal, but not outside the realms of possibility, especially if the stock drops a few more percent. reply AtlasBarfed 15 hours agoparentprevI have been a consistent critic of Intel on here. But a company like Intel can't be spun up/replaced on anything less than even more subsidies and probably 10 years of nondelivery/noncompetitiveness. A chip foundry and chip design of this level takes a long time to reach competence. Hell, if you are 1 generation behind status quo, Intel shows it can take 3 years to catch up, if then. This company isn't a struggling retailer in a sea of retailers (Sears) or some rando restaurant chain selling potato skins, blooming onions, and nachos (TGIFridays). This is a top-line chip fabricator, in a geopolitical environment where supply lines/shipping lines are under threat in the Pacific, demographic collapses in China, Japan, and South Korea are underway, and a president that wants to start a tariff war. National security concerns underline Intels importance. It isn't some chopshop private equity spreadsheet play. If you split it you need functional mission-based companies. Intel has something like a dozen fabs. I would subdivide those into the lines of business their process nodes can serve, from embedded / industrial stuff, board chipsets, whatever. Identify the process nodes desperately needed for economic protection from a hostile/collapsing China (same thing basically in economic impact). We need state of the art, so the latest and n-1 fabs get wrapped up, but we likely need a boatload of second and third tier node production as well. I think Intel's fabs can be split in the n-2 and n-3 nodes into two competing companies, because the US doesn't need monopolies, it needs competition, and that will be the path to far better utilization of subsidies and speeding up production independence from the Asian rim. I cannot believe Intel has failed at integrated graphics for so long. I'd like a competitor to NVidia besides AMD. Setting up functional subsidiaries like this will absolutely not happen with private equity chopshops, all run by the same financial illusionists that have crushed Intel and Boeing. But that's not how the oligarchy works. It'll be something that maximizes concentration of the subsidy check by the same incompetents that \"manage\" Intel right now, and the subsidy will be squandered. I cannot believe a Boeing fuckhead is now the interim CEO. Nothing will go well, these people are survivalist lizards that care about their careers and stock options and parachutes.

Their CPUs were, and are, still competitive with AMD chips, or at least close enough that they can just adjust prices to make up the difference. Fabs are extremely expensive, and an uncompetitive fab is literally just a pit in which you toss money. That's Intel's current problem. reply throwaway2037 9 hours agorootparent> uncompetitive fab I have seen this phrase used a few times here. Is there such a thing? Sure, a fab can be old and produce chips with larger transistor sizes, but there isn't a lack of demand. Only a tiny fraction of ICs need the latest transistor sizes. To be clear, do you any inside information / career experience that you know that existing Intel fabs are losing money? I have not read any such reports in media. As a counterpoint, Europe and Japan are no longer cutting edge in their fabs, but continue to produce many ICs for industry. reply adrian_b 8 hours agorootparentIntel's financial reports show their fabs losing billions every quarter. Nevertheless, it is hard to know how real are these numbers, because the prices charged by the Intel fabs for making Intel CPUs are set internally, so they could be manipulated to move all losses on the fabs from the consumer and server product divisions. Moreover, for the latest Intel fabrication process for which anything is known, i.e. Intel 4, which is used for making the CPU tiles in the Meteor Lake CPUs, it is known that the fabrication yields have been much less than desirable, which had two outcomes, both less profit margins when selling Meteor Lake and the inability to produce as many Meteor Lake CPUs as they could have sold. Both effects have increased the financial losses suffered by Intel during 2024. In general, \"uncompetitive fab\" can mean two things. Either there are things that the fab cannot do at all or the fab has too low fabrication yields at the things that it can do. The Intel fabs are in the second situation. They can do about the same things that TSMC can do, but at much lower fabrication yields, which means much higher production costs. High production costs means low profits and Intel is a company that has been habituated to have huge profits, so it cannot manage well the case when its profit margins are very thin. reply spacemanspiff01 12 minutes agorootparentBut is this an issue of them only building their own chips? (Speaking of which, what does Intel do with old fabs for the past 20 years after moving to a new node?) reply adgjlsfhk1 2 hours agorootparentprev> Only a tiny fraction of ICs need the latest transistor sizes. The problem is that the latest transistor sizes are the ones that have profit margins. 90% of TSMCs chips aren't on EUV processes, but 50% of their profits come from EUV. If you don't have leading (or close to leading) processes, you're completely shut out of the phone, laptop, server, and GPU market.

Personally, I’ve heard nothing but bad things from Intel during Gelsinger’s tenure. He had some lofty ideas, but he clearly wasn’t executing well with Intel’s bread and butter business. Also, I’m not sure good engineers always make good managers. Management is all about delegation. The skillset is really about identifying talent and trusting them to do things competently so you don’t have to worry about the details. That’s pretty much the antithesis of engineering, where you like thinking through the specific details of how things will work.

Meanwhile, the board let most of his predecessor’s activities go unchecked as they sped through disaster. That really captures the spirit of the article. It is pointing out that the people ultimately responsible for getting Intel into a mess are still in charge and have started to flail. That doesn't mean the writer thinks Gelsinger was going to be a great CEO because he is technical. They think that the board is terrible and there is evidence that it hasn't changed.

Because the rest of the package was contingent on high share prices (I think $80 was the lowest target). He got none of it. And the punchline: His total payout during his whole tenure is $46-49M.

While they suck enough that there have passed more than 5 years since I have bought for the last time Intel CPUs (but before that I had spent a lot of money on Intel CPUs and other products), I have not seen any problem that can be attributed directly to Pat Gelsinger. Unlike most companies, Intel publishes relatively detailed roadmaps with years in advance. Since Pat Gelsinger has become CEO, all those roadmaps have been accomplished in time, even if the products have not been as good as they could have been, due to things like low clock frequencies for any new fabrication process at launch (but this is a problem that has plagued Intel for the entirety of the last 10 years) or high intercommunication latencies for the first Intel multi-tile CPUs, like Sapphire Rapids and Arrow Lake, which can be attributed to an unavoidable lack of experience with such designs (because the former Intel management has delayed for too many years the transition to such designs, with jokes about the \"glued\" CPUs of the competition). According to the roadmaps published years ago, the recent years have been intended as transitional years, with the first really competitive Intel products being launched only in the second half of 2025. Only then it would have been possible to judge correctly whether Pat Gelsinger had done a good job or a bad job as CEO. As outsiders, we do not have enough information about what Pat Gelsinger has done. The roadmaps have been reasonable, the main thing that could be criticized is that there have been too many intermediate steps before reaching desirable products. However, it is likely that Intel could not have sustained financially a more abrupt transition. Even with this slower transition that has included the launch of many intermediate products intended to avoid a collapse of the sales, the financial losses have been high enough that they have been used as an excuse to eject Pat Gelsinger. It seems that Pat Gelsinger did not have the power to do a real cleanup of the Intel managers, especially of those from the fabs. For years many of those managers must have lied continuously both to other Intel divisions and in the public presentations. There is no public information that any of those managers have suffered adequate consequences for their actions. Also, it does not seem that he has succeeded to improve the internal cooperation between various Intel divisions. Some internal competition is good, but withholding information and lack of cooperation is bad. At Intel, too many products appear to have been developed independently by different teams, instead of all teams sharing some common designs as a base for their products. reply shiroiushi 16 hours agoparentprev>Also, I’m not sure good engineers always make good managers.

The thing is that technical understanding of MBAs is close to zero. Result will not improve throwing away 15% of the employees (the guy before current director did this). It’s obvious to me as an engineer with experience in operations - the products are not designed for easy production and manual testing takes too long and has bad error coverage.

But being a CEO also requires people skills. Many of us software folks have good intuition about how to make technical projects successful but the way to get there often involves getting other people to cooperate. AKA leadership. That's the tough one. That said I agree that a CEO of a company like Intel has to be technical. I mean we saw what happened to Apple when the CEO came from Pepsi.

Immediately pre-P4, Intel need a better architecture than K6-* or AMD-next (revealed as Athlon). That's not a process problem. Now, Intel needs their leading node to work. That's a process problem. Arguably, none of Intel's business model works if their process is substantially behind TSMC. Consequently, the CEO and board should be 100% focused on returning to process parity. Gelsinger at least had an economically viable plan for that. Without him?

If you are interested in technical and scientific computing, but you cannot afford to spend amounts of $ written with 6 digits or much more, then x86 is the only solution. The only Arm-based CPUs with decent performance are those made by Fujitsu, which are not available at retail. The \"datacenter\" GPUs from AMD and NVIDIA are much too expensive for small businesses or individuals. Even for a bigger business their price is justifiable only when they are busy close to 24/7.

I bought some Intel shares when it crashed last time but the latest events are changing my mind on the prospects of this company. Intel getting to be the best at process happened over years or decades of people and culture. If that's gone there's no way to reproduce it. Looking from the outside it looks like through offshoring, layoffs and culture issues they've basically lost what they had. I think AMD managed to make it through tough times (and Intel way back then as well) because even when the company was struggling financially it managed to maintain people and culture that enabled it to overcome the challenges. But now the times have changed and executives don't see people or culture as leverage, and are happy to get rid of those. You better not need any amazing execution from that point on. reply tgma 13 hours agorootparent> Intel historically was the best at semiconductor manufacturing processes. That's what got it where it got to. Exactly. AMD has been executing perfectly on the CPU side, but they also happened to be a key beneficiary in an unprecedented event in the past few decades: TSMC overtaking Intel in their process which would likely not have happened without Apple betting on them. Intel did not benefit from the stagnation they had which was enabled by their success and monopoly. Internet Explorer 6-level stagnation: from Haswell to ~2018 they successfully shipped the same product over and over again and when AMD pressure started to mount, they basically trickled down higher core counts into cheaper SKUs.

If higher clocks won out because extractable IPC was lower Netburst was the right design. reply Earw0rm 10 hours agorootparentThe problem with Netburst was the clock speed wall. They designed it with a view to continued doubling which has been a trend up until then. It turns out once you go past 3GHz improvements are much, much slower. We hit 3GHz in 2003. If you go back ten years from that, the top speed available was 66MHz, ten years before that and it was 8MHz. Fast forward 20 years and we're just barely scraping 6GHz. reply Earw0rm 5 hours agorootparentDoing the math - even a conservative estimate for 1983 to 2003 is eight doublings.

While also putting out enough heat energy to keep a small town in Northern Canada warm all winter long. reply giantrobot 11 hours agorootparentprevForesight (at the time) told you NetBurst was a dead end though. AMD made a lot of sales from people avoiding NetBurst, ignoring clock speeds and looking at actual performance numbers. NetBurst looked good on benchmarks; code with few/no branches that fit in the L2 cache if not the L1 cache. On real world code consisting almost entirely of branches and pointer chasing the NetBurst chips performed horribly compared to lower clocked Athlons. Intel's promises of 5+ GHz chips got more laughable as the line went on because they were already straining cooling and power supply options at less than 3GHz. reply wbl 4 hours agorootparentNetburst's branch predictor choices survived.

He had some lofty ideas, I don't know if I can say he was doing a good or bad job - it's really hard to say. But were there good things about him that people say? He was the first CEO to say Intel was underpaying. He promised to raise pay, made a deal with the board to do so, and delivered. Most people got something like a 20% pay boost. Still not FAANG level, but compared to the prior CEOs who said \"We pay fair market rates\"... yeah, he won points with a lot of employees for that. He quickly banned stock buybacks. Throughout his tenure he focused on his Foundry plans and improving engineering practices, at the cost of share value. His plan was \"Let's fix our fabs and our efficiency, get back to building world class products, and the financials will take care of themselves\". As opposed to all his predecessors who did stock buybacks instead of investing the money into the company. He convinced the board to cut the dividend to a third of its value - because Intel was paying triple the dividends that its competitors paid. No doubt many didn't like declining stocks, but no one can argue he was trying to artificially prop up the share price. His overall compensation was low.[1] He didn't earn any of his performance based stocks, and didn't try to manipulate those prices for personal gain. In the end he made a little over $10m per year - that includes the severance pay and signing bonus. He was fairly good with transparency. He wanted the world to see the fab's financials when he knew they were poor. The point was to give the world a real number that could be used as a metric of how well Intel is doing. $8B loss this year, with the hope of breaking even in the next few years. This last thing is what probably got him fired because the stock tanked after that (I don't know why - everyone knew it was unprofitable...). Declining revenues are due to Intel products not competing. How much of that is Pat's fault - hard to say. Intel was making poor products for a while, and partly due to a poor fab process - which is precisely what Pat was trying to fix (5 nodes in 4 years is unprecedented, and it looks like Intel will achieve it). Lunar Lake was built on TSMC, and is a fairly decent product. Overall, the gap between AMD and Intel has shrunk. Finally, perhaps the reason people really hated him: The layoffs. But as is often pointed out on HN, if you compare Intel's headcount with comparable companies (AMD, Nvidia), you can see Intel is really wasteful. The revenue per person is much, much lower. You can compare just the Intel Products head count (excluding the fabs). The layoffs had to happen. And there have to be more if Intel wants to be competitive. It can no longer command high margins. So yeah, plenty hate him. But plenty do like him. > but he clearly wasn’t executing well with Intel’s bread and butter business. Nor were the previous two CEOs.

As an atheist, I consider simulation theory to be one of the many manifestation of the innate religious tendencies in humans. It lacks a supernatural component per se (that's debatable, it depends on what is meant precisely by supernatural), but it's a framework commonly used to construct many of the same spiritual systems traditionally seen in religions (our reality was intentionally created, we have a purpose to the creator, we're being watched, we're being judged, etc) reply Zigurd 15 hours agorootparentprevHe's religious but that shows publicly only on his personal social media posts once a week, where he posts a bible verse.

The first, well, https://gunkies.org/wiki/Gordon_Letwin_OS/2_usenet_post does a good job of describing what IBM was doing wrong. By the time Open Source became a thing, IBM clearly had figured it out. The golden rule is this, people are willing to pay a certain amount for a solution to their problems. People don't care how their budget is divided. So if the complement to your solution is open source, you can charge more for the proprietary bit. Better yet, the open source thing with a bunch of support has a better shot than a completely proprietary stack. So open source the complement to your real product. Gerstner somehow \"got it\".

For example whilst there has been apparent technical progress eg on 18A - which is central to Gelsingers track record - it will mean nothing without IFS customers. It wouldn’t take a technical background to evaluate whether Intel is making progress in actually signing firms up for IFS. Will technical progress continue without Gelsinger - surely yes. But a new CEO might also deal with issues that he was clearly slow to such as costs and getting rid of products that are going nowhere. reply AtlasBarfed 15 hours agoparentSurely yes? Intel has been a company of engineering underdelivery and incompetence for a decade now. Huge bonuses and pay to financial management, salary reductions and cheapness on the labor side, your classic American MBA war-on-labor. The fact they cannot deliver a GPU, which is just a big vector processing array fundamentally, has been the long running sign of Intel's incompetence, something they should have had literally 25 years ago when Apples had vector processors and the first 3D accelerators were hitting the PC gaming world. The intellectual talent long fled Intel, and they didn't invest in replacement intellectual talent. Because MBAs don't respect \"talent\". They tolerate it for some function of tolerance, and generally the \"dead sea effect\" is imposed as talent leaves and the managers let the structure rot rather than fix it. Gelsinger obviously didn't have time to fix the intellectual and talent rot, because he probably needed to eliminate three levels of vice presidents to start with. I really celebrate the article's approach. The arrival of massive CEO pay, allegedly because of how important, public, and critical their positions are, never actually comes with detailing of who is in charge and the effect of their decisions.

In fact, not only they can prioritize domestic military/AI development leapfrogging the US giving enough time, but they can provide high tech components to the likes of Russia, Iran, North Korea. And the US wouldn't be able to retaliate as China could simply levy taxes or bans semiconductors exports to the US and whoever sells to them (similar to what the US is doing with Russia after the war in Ukraine started).

Not sure that the link adequately makes its case. The number of people that actually care about Intel Management Engine is extremely small. Intel's real problem is that their products have struggled to be competitive in the marketplace on a price and performance level. reply amluto 15 hours agorootparent> The number of people that actually care about Intel Management Engine is extremely small. I think this sentence, in isolation, actually kind of nails the problem. I realize this isn’t what you and the article you’re replying to have in mind, but: no one cares enough about ME to buy it. After years of development, Intel has a solution to server management (and client management?) that is arguably technically superior to the crappy, power hungry chips from ASPEED and the management stacks from the likes of Dell and HPE that, until very recently, were unbelievably bad. But Intel completely failed to execute! ME should have been a headline feature, made friendly to the point where people would buy Intel systems because of ME. Anyone considering AMD or Ampere or POWER would be annoyed because their organization heavily used ME and Intel’s competitors didn’t have it! But instead, Intel hid the good parts (iAMT) behind annoying SKUs, obnoxious and secretive software and weird proprietary lock-ins. And the result is: no one cares about ME! (Intel has messed up most of its recent features in almost exactly the same way.) reply BobbyTables2 14 hours agorootparentFully agree — always thought the same way. Saw AMT once about 15 years ago — available for free on an Intel banded desktop motherboard. Now I can’t even pay money to use it on my modern PCs… reply nonrandomstring 10 hours agorootparentprevThis is a good point that I cannot disagree with. One more round in the magazine of the Intel footgun. Lack of openness and engagement with customers cuts both ways. The ME tech is great for a market segment of industrial datacentres. If those buyers chose to prioritise energy and management over security, then hurrah to whatever works for them. But as you say, Intel hid it away. Like a guilty secret. They somehow forgot to tell even their most Evil™ customers about the Evil Inside™. Which is jolly suspicious. And they've hidden away other \"features\" that trash security. It may be the number of people who \"actually care about Intel Management Engine is extremely small\", but those who do matter and they make decisions. Yes performance is important but security factors are going to be gaining more and more influence now. So Intel were told time and time again that people want legible, well documented products with no surprises, and they ignored that. reply hakfoo 15 hours agorootparentprevI could see a case for \"we'll sell a few narrow SKUs of non-ME products for an audience that demands it\" -- assuming there are some people who will vote with their pockets for it. It's probably up there with some of the other corner-cases in their product matrix. But I agree, that's noise. There are much bigger problems with their product line: * Adding and removing features (especially AVX, but also the whole market-segmentation nonsense with ECC memory) * The marginal and in some cases negative generation-over-generation performance boosts. * The unlocked wattage situation which screams \"we're pushing an end-of-the-rope product that we can only get to decent clocks by feeding it an entire mains circuit\". (See: FX-9590, Pentium 4 Extreme Edition) Intel might be able to say \"Today's Glysophate Lake CPU is clearly better than the Haswell you bought 10 years ago\", but there will be a lot of mumbling if you ask \"how much better is it than last year's Paraquat Lake\". That doesn't inspire confidence, especially when they have traditionally been the premium brand. reply throwawaythekey 14 hours agorootparentprev> Intel's real problem is that their products have struggled to be competitive in the marketplace on a price and performance level. That's not super true. AMD has had good outlier performance in gaming with the X3Ds for a while, but for regular use something like a 13400f has been as good of a deal as any AMD chip. Arrow lake seems to have definitely made the situation worse for intel though. reply HelloNurse 5 hours agorootparentFor most people. \"regular use\" (and \"gaming\") is the expectation that the CPU doesn't self-destruct. Regaining the faith of users will take years if the best Intel has to say is \"this SKU is unaffected by this flaw\"; less years if they openly switch to more trusted TSMC processes and/or ARM designs. reply BlueTemplar 11 hours agorootparentprevIf it was only IME... But AMD has their own version with the PSP. So we're stuck on Bulldozer hoping for Risc-V or something to mature enough before Bulldozer is completely obsolete. (With Apple obviously never having been an option to start with, and Microsoft keeping to push for the likes of TPM and Pluton, thankfully still optional for now.) reply LarsDu88 15 hours agoparentprevYou do realize that it takes at least 5 years for new products to come to fruition in semi right? And Intel brought GPUs to market under Gelsinger's tenure. This isn't some software startup that just pivots from widget A to widget B or some ad campaign Even Tesla took like 5 years from announcement (after several years of developing a prototype BEFORE the announcement) to bringing the Cybertruck to market, and unlike cars, you need to mostly build the entire assembly line from scratch for new nodes every few years. It will be at least 3 years before we even see the outcome of decisions Gelsinger made at the beginning of his tenure. reply sounds 14 hours agorootparentGrandparent said: > it simply cannot bring itself to make a product that people want To which you responded: > You do realize that it takes at least 5 years Intel could lower the price on their HEDT chips tomorrow.

Do real people actually care about the presence or absence of the IME to such a degree that it would be worth redesigning a bunch of their products and greatly increasing the number of individual SKUs? ... and, your first point \"Intel could lower the price on their HEDT chips tomorrow\". Well.. they could I suppose? They are pretty irrelevant when it comes to HEDT chips anyway though considering how crazy Threadrippers are.

According to the article, splitting Intel would be good (short term) for the shareholders, bad long term, and bad for the country. Intel is still a great asset, but it looks like it is losing its appeal as time passes. CEO of Intel is deemed to be a very challenging position. The board does not seem to know how to turn the ship around. I could see Musk steering that ship. It is technically challenging (Musk seems to thrive in those environments), and it could even benefit the other Musk companies to some extent (XAi, Tesla and even maybe SpaceX). Intel market cap is 94.713B (AMD is 233B, ARM Holdings is 144B... not mentioning NVIDIA), so about twice what Musk paid for Twitter. But if Musk sets his view on Intel, he would not have a hard time to finance the purchase. Actually, he could wait a bit more as the stock can fall even more (today, Intel stock is at the price of Dec. 1996). This is armchair talking/joke, and it would be one more crazy thing on the 2024 bingo card, but from all the crazy things we have seen recently, Musk taking over Intel would look quite normal in comparison. reply impossiblefork 9 hours agorootparentMaybe if he owned the whole thing and could run it as he liked, without having to care about the stock price or paying money to investors, but personally I don't think anyone can do it while also satisfying the stock market.

For anything beyond bug fixes, let's quickly chat to see how a proposal fits into the overall roadmap and avoid any surprises. We're not sure yet what the best setup or exact license is for compatibility between OSL-3.0 and more popular licenses or use as a framework. So we'd ask you to sign a simple CLA that retains your copyright, ensures that TrailBase will continue to forever be freely available under an OSI-approved copyleft license, while allowing for some flexibility and sub-licensing as established by much larger, successful projects such as Grafana or Element. License TrailBase is free software under the terms of the OSL-3.0. We chose this license over more popular, similar copyleft licenses such as AGPLv3 due to its narrower definition of derivative work that only covers modifications to TrailBase itself. This is similar to GPL's classpath exception or LGPL's linkage exception allowing the use of TrailBase as a framework without inflicting licensing requirements on original work layered on top. That said, we ain't lawyers. The author of the license provides a more thorough explanation. If you have any concerns or advice for us, please reach out.

Is the string interpolation straight into the sql from the query string in your getting started docs (https://trailbase.io/getting-started/first-ui-app) safe? It smells a bit. From a quick look (on mobile) I can see that the function takes parameters, but you're not using that. reply chrismorgan 9 hours agoparentparsePath(…).query is a URLSearchParams, so those parameters are just strings, and it’s an untagged template string, so it is indeed a trivial SQL injection vector. And the params argument was right there! I don’t understand quite how you make a mistake like that, but it’s extremely worrying. This is fundamental, basic stuff. The fun aspects of this are that: (a) I could actually imagine trailbase.js contents that would make it not SQL injection: you could have parsePath(…).query.get(…) return objects with a toString() that escaped SQL. This would raise even more questions, and I was sure it wouldn’t be the case, but it’s possible. (b) You could make it work safely, converting interpolation into parameters, by using a tagged template string. This could require only a tiny change: return await query( sql`SELECT Owner, Aroma, Flavor, Acidity, Sweetness FROM coffee ORDER BY vec_distance_L2( embedding, '[${+aroma}, ${+flavor}, ${+acid}, ${+sweet}]') LIMIT 100` ); (You could even make it query`…`, but I think query(sql`…`) is probably wiser. As for the plusses I put in there, that’s to convert from strings to numbers.) This is a concept that’s definitely been done seriously. The first search result I found: https://github.com/blakeembrey/sql-template-tag. reply uwemaurer 8 hours agorootparentit looks like that the query function has a second parameter with a \"params\" array. probably something like this would work then too (didn't test): return await query( `SELECT Owner, Aroma, Flavor, Acidity, Sweetness FROM coffee ORDER BY vec_distance_L2( embedding, '[?,?,?,?]') LIMIT 100`, [+aroma, +flavor, +acid, +sweet], ); it is nice because the query string is constant then and a prepared query could be cached.. reply chrismorgan 7 hours agorootparentSo we’re clear, the tagged template string approach gives you a string that uses parameters properly (see the example in the README of that project that does it); it’s perfectly compatible with prepared-statement caching. And actually on second consideration, you probably can’t use binding parameters here: you’re trying to slot numbers in as JSON values inside a string! Maybe you’d have to write vec_distance_L2(embedding, ?), with parameter JSON.stringify([+aroma, +flavor, +acid, +sweet]). reply uwemaurer 7 hours agorootparentyou are right, great comment! reply trailbase-alt 6 hours agorootparentprev:hide: thanks for pointing out this embarrassing plunder.

I'd noticed he wasn't as often active in Gitlab related threads, and I guess that explains that too. Hope the recovery continues to go well. --- I do think the change in leadership is probably more a continuation of Gitlab moving from a developer focused company to one focused on enterprise sales, so the product is probably going to continue to feel less interesting for me. They were pretty innovative in how open they were, so I hope at least some of that survives. reply mgfist 19 hours agoparentI don't think companies ever use \"health\" as cover to fire someone, even that is a step to far. Usually they say \"personal reasons\" or \"to spend time with family\", or \"mutually beneficial\" etc.. \"Health\" is usually something quite serious. reply jedberg 8 hours agorootparentUsually when a the founding CEO of a public company steps into a strategic non-operations position, it's basically their way of saying \"I'm taking the money and retiring\" without tanking the stock by just leaving. By taking a strategic role, investors are less worried because they know the CEO is still around. But in this case it looks like it is legitimately a health reason. I hope he heals quickly. reply tuananh 18 hours agorootparentprev> On today’s earnings call, I am announcing that I am transitioning from my role as GitLab’s CEO and will serve as the Executive Chair of the Board.

GitLab was the first code host to add more products (CI, security, ops, helpdesk, analytics, etc.) and create a whole suite, and GitHub followed. GitLab also built for the enterprise years before GitHub started to give appropriate love to the enterprise. Some people think that GitLab is a GitHub clone. Quite the opposite! Even if you don't use GitLab yourself, you've been a huge beneficiary of the dev workflow GitLab envisioned and created, and of the competition they've given to Microsoft/GitHub. Competition in this space makes everything better. reply hardwaresofton 12 hours agoparent> GitLab was the first code host to add more products (CI, security, ops, helpdesk, analytics, etc.) and create a whole suite, and GitHub followed. Disclaimer: I've worked with Sid and his team in the past. Few people realize how long it's been since GitLab was a simple clone -- there has been a ton of legitimate net new innovation, and that happened under Sid (and of course all the awesome people working at GitLab). Another thing that's actually insanely under-discussed is how openly GitLab runs and how that's been a successful model for them. I'm not sure I know another open core company that has been so successful in the space of developers who bend over backwards to pay nothing and spend hours of their own time (read $$$$$) to host their own . IMO they are the only credible competitor to GitHub, and they're open core, huge open source orgs, small companies, and large companies trust them (rightfully so), and they've built this all while being incredibly open and to this day you can still self-host their core software (which is a force multiplier for software companies). reply jeroenhd 7 hours agorootparentGitlab used to stand alone in the \"Github replacement\" market, but these days Gitea is quickly closing in on them. I hope the competition will drive Gitlab to continue to compete, but the switch to \"AI everything\" makes me weary for its future. Without Gitlab, Github would've taken years, maybe even longer, to develop what it has become today. I don't think Gitea and its forks would exist. Now if only Github would go the extra mile and copy another feature from Gitlab (IPv6 support)… reply itronitron 6 hours agorootparentprevGitLab is currently marketing itself as the \"AI-powered DevSecOps platform\" which in my view ditches it's history/brand as an open and transparent alternative to GitHub. reply whazor 6 hours agorootparentprevBut GitHub enterprise is not a great product. So the other around, I wouldn't want to call Github a credible competitor to Gitlab. reply mikepurvis 19 hours agoparentprevIndeed. Github Actions runs because GitLab CI walked and Travis crawled. There's a clear evolution through line with how each laid the groundwork for the successor. reply benatkin 17 minutes agorootparentI disagree that GitHub Actions is much more powerful than GitLab. Both can be helped by a YC company, depot.dev, if you literally mean running containers quickly and reliably. GitHub Actions can be easier to set up if you like having stuff outside of your repo and an OCI image. GitLab may not have the actions library that GitHub has but it can pull docker images and that’s a powerful build library. reply tuananh 18 hours agoprev- Previously in 2017, Bill Staples was brought in Marketo for the sole purpose of prepping the company before selling. 2018, Marketo was acquired by Adobe. - 2021, Bill becomes CEO of NewRelic. 2023, NewRelic was acquired.

It's not in a good place, and it's not receiving the attention it needs, for being a core part of their platform. Being required to use GitLab CI causes me pain and frustration on a daily basis. If the other commenters are correct that the new CEO has a track record of pursuing private equity type acquisitions, then I fear GitLab CI is destined to become the next Travis CI. reply cyberpunk 3 hours agoparentWow having gone from gitlab to gh actions I miss gitlab ci massively.

Ironically I was very open to paying for a service, but the “AI AI AI!” lost them at least one sale. reply itronitron 9 hours agorootparentI was at a 'techtalk' recently with over 100 attendees, where Gitlab was a sponsor and the second of two talks. Before either talk the GitLab person gave a short pitch on the whole GitLab AI developer productivity vision and how great they are. There was a short break after the first talk concluded during which about a third of the attendees left, myself included. reply throwaway2037 6 hours agorootparentI am confused. What is the lesson to be learnt here? Did the last two talks look boring? ... And that is why you left? Were people annoyed with pre-talk pitch by GitLab? reply an-honest-moose 2 hours agorootparentPeople heard the AI spiel and lost interest. reply lolinder 16 hours agorootparentprevThis press release makes a big deal out of them counting \"more than 50% of the Fortune 100\" as customers, which goes a long way towards explaining their decline in favor among devs. They're not interested in your sale any more, they're only interested in large enterprises, and are apparently doing very well in that market. reply stackskipton 15 hours agorootparentI doubt 50% of Fortune 100 customers are all in on GitLab. My guess is most of their F100 customers are acquisitions that were using Gitlab and continue to use Gitlab. When my company was acquired by $MegaCorp, I noted one of vendors was like \"trusted by $MegaCorp\" because yes technically, they got a check from $MegaCorp but $MegaCorp was not interested in becoming further customer. reply scaryclam 3 hours agorootparentOr one or two devs in the F100 customers made an account using their work email so they could chuck some OSS prototype code somewhere, or test something out. reply jamesfinlayson 14 hours agorootparentprevYes I've seen it a place I've worked - GitLab is pushing hard on AI right now, and I don't believe it's cheap either. Ironically, the JetBrains autocomplete is better than their DUO plugin - JetBrains is faster and the GitLab plugin causes my IDE to completely lock up at least once a day. reply vundercind 18 hours agoparentprevWow. Almost none of those words would have even been among my third-string choices of words to use to describe gitlab in one short sentence. “The” and “platform” might have made it. reply remram 16 hours agorootparent\"The other code hosting platform\"? reply vundercind 16 hours agorootparent“GitHub for if you compete with MS and someone high in your org is concerned about letting MS host your code.” “GitHub with a worse UI except GitHub’s has been getting worse for years so now they’re both similarly bad so never mind” “Worse gitea but with more features so sometimes it’s better” reply jamesfinlayson 14 hours agorootparentHaving used GitLab Enterprise, I'd describe it as having 99% of the features that you could ever want, but those features are generally executed no more than 75% well. reply progval 11 hours agoparentprevThat's copy-pasted from https://about.gitlab.com/ . I love that it implies there is a more comprehensive DevSecOps platform that isn't AI-powered. reply whatsakandr 16 hours agoparentprevI used to think gitlab was the bees knees, but more recently there's just a lack of user awareness. They've had a open issue for years about failing a job due to not finding artifacts. The logs even say \"ERROR\" I've concluded they're now a marketing organization. reply HdS84 13 hours agorootparentIt's normal to Google \"how to do x in gitlab\" and then there is a ticker in their issue tracker to add x from 2018. GL employees all agrees that it would be great.

With github I have no experience. reply progval 11 hours agorootparentprevThis is common for huge open source projects. However, when you send a patch to Gitlab, they will assign someone to guide you through the process, and the patch will be merged eventually unless you bail out or they outright reject it. reply remram 16 hours agoparentprevOr search. What a useless devops platform if you can't find issue by searching for words that appear in comments. Only words appearing in the issue title/description are found and this is infuriating every day. Can't believe they'd put \"AI-powered\" there when it can't even be used to find exact word matches. reply anotheranon867 12 hours agoprevAnon for reasons. I worked with Bill at Microsoft. Bill was fired from Microsoft along with most of his cronies who almost managed to completely tank Azure. He is the guy responsible for the absolute train wreck that was the Azure portal v2 (post silver light) and v3 (Ibiza). He lied to Scott Guthrie, buried efforts to benchmark or in any way measure CSAT or usability, and stabbed many many people in the back. Dude was also borderline incompetent. His partner and buddy in the whole fraud was Jonah Sterling who managed to continue to get promoted and is one of the top design leaders at Microsoft despite having zero UX/UI/Interaction skills or knowledge and costing Microsoft years of wasted effort and ruining many design careers by overpromoting his directs to boost his own career trajectory. After working with so many Microsoft execs who were either astoundingly incompetent or downright malicious people - it saddens me every time I see another one get named to a csuite of another company. reply corytheboyd 3 hours agoparentIt’s a big club, and you ain’t in it! reply tapoxi 21 hours agoprevSid was diagnosed with osteosarcoma a while back, so hopefully he's on the road to recovery but stepping down isn't usually a sign things are going smoothly. reply kmbfjr 19 hours agoparentThat kind of diagnosis profoundly changes you, I know after having two cancer diagnoses in a year. For him, it may be bad, or it may be just realizing either outcome, time is short. reply stavros 21 hours agoprevI was a huge Gitlab fan until their pricing change. I don't remember the pricing specifics, but the tier breakdown was such that you could introduce GitLab for free to a company that used Github, use it alongside Github, and slowly switch repo by repo, which was a very effective strategy (I used it in a few companies I joined). After the pricing change, you had to start paying immediately (from the 6th user onwards or something), which made it a nonstarter because no company would start immediately paying for a Github replacement they didn't even know they wanted. Together with Github being priced very cheaply, plus having free private repos, plus having the entire OSS world on it (for my OSS projects), I switched to it and never looked back. reply freedomben 18 hours agoparentSame. That pricing change was one of the dumbest moves I can remember from a tech company. It should be the textbook example of a short-term profit grab at the complete sacrifice of long-term strategy. I was a huge gitlab fan and would not have thought much of anything else, but the pricing made that impossible. The product has also suffered greatly as a result of the years of poor decision making at the top. It's one of the most unfortunate outcomes I can recall. reply sofixa 9 hours agorootparent> short-term profit grab They still don't make a profit. So much more a \"try to become profitable in a changing financial landscape that will give us much less runway to do so\" than \"short-term profit grab\" reply righthand 17 hours agoprevGlad I got out years ago after the price dropped and never recovered. Going public was not good for consumers or investors. reply tombert 13 hours agoparentYeah, I am still holding onto my couple shares. I am down about $98, and if this is just a bit to get acquired, I suspect they’re going to force me to sell my shares at their current price. reply andy_ppp 6 hours agoprevI wish Gitlab would spend more time thinking through the best way to do things rather than just adding as many features as they can. From what I’ve seen (my usage of both products) they don’t have a single feature that works as well as GitHub even though they probably have feature parity in theory. reply redeux 19 hours agoprevSo, do we think Staples and the board intend to sell Gitlab to private equity like New Relic? reply tyre 20 hours agoprev> GitLab Inc., (NASDAQ: GTLB), the most comprehensive AI-powered DevSecOps platform reply AzzieElbab 19 hours agoparentThey should place their Git backend on the blockchain to collect all the power stones. reply cyberax 19 hours agorootparentGit is already a blockchain. reply pests 14 hours agorootparentTechnically but not in terms people would describe a block chain.

Not really something Git has been built for. reply keyle 19 hours agoparentprevThanks for pointing that out, that made me gulp and I'm not even sure what 'Sec' they're talking about seeing they were recently featured in a defcon talk. reply HdS84 14 hours agorootparentThey have a sast scanner offering..we tried to use it Basic thinks like \"ignore this slew of reporting because the build is already deprecated\" or \"always ignore this error, false positive\" are missing. The last few years gitlab only did marketing checklist driven development. reply jamesfinlayson 13 hours agorootparentYes, I've used it and the behaviour that we saw was it reporting every issue that had been in the repo ever (including in files that had been deleted). Which I suppose you might want, but every other scanning tool I've used chose the sensible default of scan what is there now. Also, as far as I can, the security centre wouldn't let you download a .csv of current security issues in the repo - the UI lets you do a bunch of filtering, but the .csv always gives you everything, including issues that you've closed. reply HdS84 13 hours agorootparentIt's even worse when you scan your build artifacts, in our case containers. Each build added to the list , with no way to delete all stuff. Filtering and grouping are also missing. We gave up on that and decided to use another tool. My gripe with GL is that all features are like this now. There is no invest into the basic building blocks, just yapping for the next trend. Most customers for GL use it on premise because they want to use it on prem. I would focus on Features that benefit that crowd, but hey I am just an developing not a gilded c suite. reply vundercind 18 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair, having the “Sec” in your “DevSecOps” signify nothing whatsoever is basically the industry standard for companies describing their offerings with that term. reply amatuer_sodapop 19 hours agoparentprevI think AI-powered is fast approaching the \"webscale\" status. reply eddythompson80 19 hours agorootparentIt's already there. Plenty of developer focused docs have been updated to mention AI however possible. I was just reading stripe docs, and was surprised by the number of fairly old features that got a doc update so instead of saying \"For example, if you're selling a digital subscription with a physical item\" to \"For example, if you're selling access to an AI service with a physical item\". Or replacing \"For example, If you're charging for API requests\" to \"For example, If you're charging for LLama AI Model API requests\". Heck, I had to review a doc change at work that was pretty stupid. Like one thing we offer is an S3-compatible endpoint. But someone thought we should clarify that you can upload AI models there too and all our docs should include an \"AI developer\" section for how to upload a blob that also happen to be a model or a lora or whatever. reply mattgreenrocks 19 hours agorootparentHas a real “how do you do, fellow kids?” energy to it. reply eddythompson80 15 hours agorootparentThat’s exactly the feeling I got but didn’t know how to put into words. reply Macha 18 hours agorootparentprevYou don't happen to work at Minio do you?

And no I work at another tech company, but I totally understand how minio decided to go with that marketing. It’s really infuriating and yet understandable. When the AI craze stated, so many people in my company came to me asking “if we can run AI workload”? another thing we offer is fairly generic compute meant for your average web applications or micro service etc. Initially I said “I don’t think so. We don’t have GPUs nor do we have any ability to express hardware requirements beyond CPU and Memory. We’ll need to do some work to include GPU into that”. Then hilariously I learned that you don’t need GPUs or ASICs to be able to run “AI workloads”. If your compute allows you to call OpenAI rest APIs, then you’re also “AI Ready”. reply cedws 20 hours agoparentprevThe what? reply dijit 20 hours agorootparentYou know… the disruptive, game-changing tech company redefining source code hosting for the modern enterprise.

Nothing they’ve done since they were created has ever moved them in a more open source friendly direction, and they’ve broken a ton of promises both implicit and explicit along the way. GitHub OTOH has only become more open source friendly (minus the AI stuff, but I suspect Gitlab is no better on that front). reply flohofwoe 11 hours agorootparentOne feature area where Gitlab is still better for realworld stuff is CI (Gitlab CI vs Github Actions). Yes, you can do most things on both, but Gitlab CI makes a lot more sense. In general, Github still feels like it's built for hobby coders (focusing on simplicity instead of configurability - which doesn't have to be a bad thing) while Gitlab feels like it's built for professional teams from the ground up. reply usr1106 10 hours agorootparentI have used Gitlab CI basically daily for over 5 years and it makes sense. I would need to think hard to come up with something that seems fundamentally wrong. I have never used Github Actions. Can you explain or give some examples what doesn't make sense? reply flohofwoe 8 hours agorootparentIIRC Github Actions started as a 'visual editor' where you would drop and arrange 'Actions' and define the data flow between actions, but what most people want from a CI system is just a script/config file in their git repo which defines what command line tools to run, and to group those commands in jobs dependending on each other so that some jobs can run in parallel (which Github Actions only implemented as an afterthought after users demanded it). To reuse code, Gitlab CI has simple template files which you can import into your toplevel .gitlab-ci.yml, and you have an inheritance system to derive new jobs from other jobs. That's a very simple and powerful system. Code reuse in Github works with above mentioned 'actions' where each action seems to be a whole repository of stuff instead of a single file like in Gitlab CI. Gitlab CI seems to be designed by people who know what they do and what their users need, while Github Actions seems to be designed by architecture astronauts, and has only afterwards and reluctantly been hammered into a shape where it does the things most users expect. reply noirscape 8 hours agorootparentGitHub Actions feels like it was first designed to let people customize the GitHub Pages deploy flow (since GitHub by default only offered Jekyll as a static site generator, and Jekyll is Ruby tooling and not lightweight to run at all) and as a CI tool second, being molded into behaving like one after Travis CI went bad for open source projects.

Not open core, full open source. The main reason for Forgejo is moreso that Gitea as a project was taken over by a company instead of being run as a non-profit. Some of the dev team felt uncomfortable with that and forked it. Personally I haven't seen much reason to switch from Gitea to Forgejo - this is the sort of ideological issue that I'd rather kick the can down the road on until Gitea Ltd goes bad (and in an assumption of good faith, I'll assume that it won't.)

Either way that seems insanely low, if they're expected to be worth $8billion. The gap between profit and revenue seems to high. There might be some potential for Gitlab complement your other business, in which case you may not see the lack of profit as that big of an issue. The problem is that if you can't make those $8billions back in future profit, then you're going to start making changes to the Gitlab offerings until they do become profitable. That might be what the new CEO is suppose to do, pump up those numbers, and make it look like a sane investment. reply jmclnx 19 hours agorootparentprevMaybe IBM since I think Gnome and a few other large projects moved there.

They don't as far as I know. Have a good answer for a gitforge, and the phenomenal CI CD offering that gitlab has would be very marketable to Red hat customers. I would be excited if IBM acquired them and put them under the red hat umbrella, because as history has shown, it may mean that gitlab ends up becoming much more open.

A literal hatchet man reply rkhleung 4 hours agorootparentNot necessarily. In my experience, getting the right person to prepare a company for an IPO or a sale is hard. Most buyers will do due diligence and besides 'slashing costs' and 'growing the company', there is a skill set for getting governance and compliance practices in place and as well as leading the roadshow for the sale which has some similarities to raising private capital. For instance, if you don't already have explicit policies for workplace safety and environmental practices (e.g. what do you recycle, water usage, etc), you will usually need to put these in place. (We invested in manufacturing and these were extremely important to us). If you are located in multiple jurisdictions, you need to be ready to demonstrate that you are in compliance with local regulations and pass the equivalent of \"integration tests\", prove you are in compliance across multiple jurisdictions where their rules may differ or seem to conflict.

Great outcomes: Google, Amazon, or JetBrains ($7B private valuation) buys it. reply mrweasel 6 hours agorootparentWhy would Google want it? They shutdown Google code and Amazon is shutting down CodeCommit. I think it would make more sense for a number of companies to invest in Gitlab, to ensure that there is a 3rd. party tool available, as to not \"force\" users into the hands of Github and Microsoft. That's probably the best case, Google, Amazon, IBM, JetBrains and a few others create a company, with themselves on the board, and tasks that company with buying and running Gitlab. Having Google alone buy it and you may as well just migrate now pending the inevitable disinterest and shutdown. So I guess that I disagree, Gitlab makes more sense as an independent company, that it does as part of companies that already had failed competing products.

Jira and Confluence are decent but BitBucket is like time-traveling back to 2010. We migrated to GitLab with unanimous enthusiasm – so many new features, so many things worked better - and that decision felt better as the years passed where we’d get “is anyone working on this?” updates on the Atlassian tickets for missing BitBucket features which had been years old when I’d voted for them. reply firesteelrain 14 hours agorootparentOur developers want GitLab because it means replacing Bamboo which is an OK product but we have hundreds of build agents that don’t scale for on prem. Each agent is a VM running on VMWare. The pipeline’s are so much better. But GitLab price annually for the same amount of users that we have for Bamboo and BitBucket is higher in licensing fees. We have to do things self hosted because of regulatory and compliance reasons. There is probably a business case to be made for the inefficiency that we see with Bamboo. BitBucket DC is pretty solid and never goes down. It integrates well with all the other Atlassian products like Jira or Confluence.

Email Address * Language Arabic (monthly) Chinese (monthly) English (weekly) French (monthly) Russian (monthly) Spanish (monthly) 05 Dec 2024 125/2024 Vienna, Austria Ukraine’s three operating nuclear power plants (NPPs) have largely restored their electricity production after sharply reducing output last week as a precautionary step due to renewed attacks on the country’s increasingly fragile energy grid, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today. The NPPs – Khmelnytskyy, Rivne and South Ukraine – have nine reactors, of which eight are currently operating while one is in shutdown. Over the past week, most of them have gradually increased output again, even though some units operated below full capacity for several days after the military strikes on 28 November, which affected electrical infrastructure that is essential for nuclear safety. Still, some of the off-site power lines that the plants use both for receiving and transmitting electricity remain disconnected. “A stable electricity grid that provides secure off-site power is essential to ensure nuclear safety at Ukraine’s operating nuclear power plants, which are vital for producing the electricity the country needs, especially during the cold winter months. The operators have demonstrated significant resilience during and after this latest period of grid instability so that these plants can maintain nuclear safety and generate electricity following last week’s output cuts,“ Director General Grossi said. “However, the fragile grid situation remains a source of deep concern and we will continue to closely monitor relevant developments, including with follow-up expert visits to the electrical substations on which the nuclear power plants depend. Once again, I call for maximum restraint, so that no action affecting the external power supply and nuclear safety is taken,” he said. Despite the effects of the military conflict, including frequent air raid alarms, the IAEA teams at the Khmelnytskyy, Rivne and South Ukraine NPPs and the Chornobyl site reported that nuclear safety and security at these facilities is being maintained. At the Khmelnytskyy NPP, the IAEA team members were required to shelter at the site for a short period of time on Tuesday, but without any impact on the site itself. At the South Ukraine NPP, the IAEA team was informed that a total of 17 drones were detected earlier this week, some three kilometres from the site. Ukraine’s largest NPP – the Zaporizhzhya site – has not produced electricity for more than two years. Its six units are all in cold shutdown but still require off-site power for reactor cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions. However, the situation in this regard remains precarious, with both remaining power lines prone to frequent outages. In the latest instances highlighting the precarious external power situation, the ZNPP’s last remaining 750 kilovolt (kV) power line was disconnected between 21-23 November, followed last weekend by a two-day disconnection of the 330 kV back-up power line. Also related to the external power situation, the IAEA team was informed that the voltage stabilizer for the ZNPP’s 750 kV power line, located in an open switchyard outside the plant, was being repaired after it was automatically disconnected by the activation of a protection mechanism. The ZNPP expects to return the voltage stabilizer to operation within the next month. The 750 kV connection was not affected. The IAEA team has continued to closely follow the maintenance activities at the ZNPP, including elements of the safety systems of reactor units 2, 3 and 6. The team also visited unit 1 to observe the repairs conducted last month on one leaking impulse line. The team was informed that gamma radiography had been performed on approximately 30 other locations in unit 1, which identified one more weld that had degraded, but without any leak. Both welds were repaired and tested again. The IAEA team will continue to monitor this issue. The IAEA team continues to be denied access to the external spare parts warehouse and diesel fuel storage facility. However, it has been informed that the diesel fuel storage tank that was damaged more than two years ago has been repaired. The IAEA team at the ZNPP has continued to hear explosions on most days, mostly at distances far away from the site, and no damage to the plant was reported. As part of its comprehensive programme of assistance in support of nuclear safety and security, the IAEA arranged new deliveries of equipment to Ukraine, bringing the total to 86. The State Enterprise VostGok, an uranium ore mining and processing plant in Ukraine, received a dosimetry system to enhance the capacity to monitor individual doses for their staff exposed to ionizing radiation. The equipment was procured with funds from Japan. With funds provided by Denmark, the country’s Hydrometeorological Center and the Hydrometeorological organizations of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine received three portable liquid nitrogen generators. In addition, one Cisco integrated services router with 10 connecting switches was delivered to the Rivne NPP, made possible with funds provided by Ireland. Separately, in partnership with France and Ukraine’s Energoatom, the IAEA assisted in the delivery of spare parts and rubber products needed for the timely maintenance of emergency diesel generators at the South Ukraine NPP. With these deliveries, equipment related to nuclear safety and security worth more than 14 million euros has been delivered to Ukraine since the start of the conflict.

I still don’t understand how the power grid is still functioning and how quickly it is repaired after an outage. I’ve been here since the war started, including some of the worst hit front line cities like Kharkiv and power outages after strikes were always resolved within a 48 hour period max, usually faster. How it’s possible to replace damaged substations within hours, I have no idea. Now I live in a relatively quiet area with a solar inverter battery (similar to the Tesla wall) and I have almost uninterrupted power sufficient to keep my business going. Just have to avoid using heavy appliances like the washing machine when on battery power. reply BMc2020 4 hours agoparentThere's a song called 'Wichita Lineman by Glen Campbell.

Some storms are worse than others, but the world has gotten good are repairing damage fast. Ukraine is drawing on that experience for a lot. Substations are hard only because of quantity. Every power operator has experienced a substation having a catastrophic failure so they keep spares of the big parts on hand so they can restore power in hours when that happens. The only difference here is normally they are doing a few of these per year (and most of that is planned end of life replacements not sudden catastrophic failure) not a few per day. Manufactures of substations have had to scale up their production to meet Ukraine's needs and this is the real hard part. The rest is just normal overtime (that has been going on for several years now), and thus the normal overtime fatigue. reply Moru 4 hours agoparentprevRealy impressive, we have places (north sweden) after the last storm that took 7 days to restore power. reply kvemkon 4 hours agorootparentReminds me of about 7 days of prominent power outage (13.01.2024 - 19.01.2024) during Linux 6.8 merge window.

In my young head it didn't compute with the weekly sectarian violence and suicide attacks. Now when following the war in Ukraine I finally understand how war can be incredibly localized in specific regions of a country with long-range attacks targeting only high-value infrastructure targets. reply touisteur 7 hours agoparentI don't know about Iraq, but residential buildings are routinely bombed on Ukraine, big cities, not sure one can draw parallels here. Spending nights and even being schooled in bomb shelters will take its toll, but from meeting many Ukrainian refugees, many will make light of it, very often wary of complaining while their friends, family, countrypeople, still in-country are still waking up to sirens and explosions. The Ukranian utilities people are relentless, resourceful heroes, keeping power on, under the conditions they're facing. reply myflash13 5 hours agorootparentIraq was much worse. I heard it first hand from a US veteran who served in Iraq and then volunteered in Ukraine. We were driving together through Kharkiv surveying damage and he said: the damage here is nothing compared to what we did to Baghdad. Statistical estimates put civilian casualties in the Iraq war at about 10x the rate of the current Ukraine war. reply dralley 38 minutes agorootparentThis is a category error. Baghdad was subject to capture by an invading force, Kharkiv was never captured. What was done to Mariupol, Avdiivka, Bakhmut, Vulhedar, Popasna, and dozens of other places far exeeds the damage done to Baghdad. reply throwawaymaths 5 hours agorootparentprevRemember some context here: much of what happened in baghdad was localized on the ground internal violence and also the US faffing about getting involved in internal violence. Civilians got targetted and collateralized in ways that are categorically different from a state actor indiscriminately killing civilians from without with limited long range weaponry. There are places in Ukraine, like bakhmut, where it was ground combat and not long range weaponry, where you wouldn't make that side by side comparison with Iraq. reply kamikazeturtles 4 hours agorootparentI find it hard to believe the US cared about civilian life in Iraq when the US military took out Iraq's water treatment facilities in the Gulf war then imposed sanctions to make sure they can't be repaired, killing 500,000 children in only the first 4 years of 12 years of sanctions. Even more chilling is the interview with Madeleine Albright, former secretary of state, where she literally says the 500,000 died Iraqi children was worth it. reply throwawaymaths 3 hours agorootparentNobody said anything about the US caring about civilians. In fact i implied the US targetted civilians. So, the extremeness of your bias is showing. My point is about false equivalences. In support of some extreme ideology, you have basically reached for every false equivalence you could have, without thinking through it at all. reply kamikazeturtles 3 hours agorootparentI find problem with when people chalk up all the civilian deaths to \"sectarian violence\" as if carpet bombing whole cities, including even bomb shelters designated for civilians, hospitals, and press offices ... , doesn't kill civilians. Not to mention all the birth defects from the uranium from all those dropped bombs.

None of Iraq towns or villages are erased. reply varjag 5 hours agorootparentprevThere are no official, broadly recognized statistics for Iraq nor for Ukraine. The lowest Iraq estimate 120k dead civilians or so in the course of decade long conflict. This certainly tracks with estimates of Ukrainian civilian deaths. And while Kharkiv was not thoroughly obliterated it was mainly though the strength of defensive efforts. Other cities were left in a condition that makes any comparison to Baghdad laughable. reply mopsi 4 hours agorootparentMarinka, Ukraine: https://x.com/MFA_Ukraine/status/1632380947734618113 A town of 10 000, completely destroyed, uninhabitable. Current population: 0. With scenes like these, threats of nuclear attack lose potency. Marinka looks indistinguishable from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Bakhmut and other frontline towns didn't fare any better. A group of scientists tracked the destruction with a synthetic aperture radar: “After Hang processed the images and we saw the end result, it looked like a checkerboard or mesh,” Barbot said. “We asked, ‘Why is that?’ and we realized that it’s only the roads that survived. Everything else was collapsed, destroyed, evaporated, and the entire city is completely flattened.” “You can see a neighborhood going away, and then another and then there’s no progress because of a natural obstacle like a river,” Barbot said. “After they’ve bombarded enough stuff, the front line begins to move to the west and the Russian army advances through the crumbles. Eventually the story repeats itself and after a year, there’s just nothing left. It looks like cancer spreading throughout the body.” https://today.usc.edu/ukraine-devastation-cutting-through-th... reply myflash13 4 hours agorootparentTrue but the 10,000 civilians were not all killed while they were living there. Most were evacuated as the battlefield front lines moved towards those towns. In Iraq, there were 10s of thousands of civilian casualties estimated within the first few days of the invasion. That's more than the entire casualty estimate for Ukraine so far. reply varjag 4 hours agorootparentThere's estimated 47k to 100k civilians who have perished in a couple of months in siege of Mariupol, not sure what the \"entire casualty estimate\" you're talking about. reply aguaviva 4 hours agorootparentThere's estimated 47k to 100k civilians who have perished in a couple of months in siege of Mariupol, The outside estimates I've seen from Ukrainian sources say 25k total. Your estimate is 2x-4x higher. How is that? reply dralley 34 minutes agorootparentBecause you aren't using \"estimates\" for Ukrainian casualties, you're using the numbers that have been able to be verified with evidence by third parties. In Mariupol alone there were ~10,000 new graves on satellite imagery and some of them are large enough for multiple bodies, which we know was done in Lyman when those mass graves were excavated. reply aguaviva 16 minutes agorootparentBecause you aren't using \"estimates\" Because you don't know what source I'm referring to, how can you possibly know? mopsi 3 hours agorootparentprev> True but the 10,000 civilians were not all killed while they were living there. Baghdad still stands. Many Ukrainian towns are nothing but a name on a map and a pile of rubble on the ground. I didn't mean to leave an impression as if all inhabitants have been killed, but the towns have ceased to exist as places of human settlement. > In Iraq, there were 10s of thousands of civilian casualties estimated within the first few days of the invasion. Certainly not, that's an insane number. Common estimates put the number of civilian casualties in low thousands for the entire invasion phase that lasted several months, and these figures include deaths from indirect causes such as crime related to breakdown of social order, which contributed roughly as much as the invading force itself, if you trust the data from Iraqi Body Count project. > That's more than the entire casualty estimate for Ukraine so far. Everyone doing estimates stresses that they severely undercount due to lack of access to occupied areas. You are comparing a clearly inflated Iraqi figures against clearly undercounted Ukrainian figures. While formally not civilians, many who have died as Russian combatants were Ukrainian civilians who were forcibly conscripted from occupied areas. These so-called \"mobiks\" alone make up tens of thousands of dead because they were untrained, poorly equipped and expendable. reply dgroshev 3 hours agorootparentprevCan you please provide a source for the 10s of thousands claim? I find it extremely hard to believe, considering the way the war was persecuted. The US did not indiscriminately shell cities with cluster munitions [1], and Iraqi cities are less dense and smaller than commie block filled Ukrainian ones. [1]: Russia routinely fires cluster munitions into densely populated cities, eg https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/features-60941459 reply linuxftw 4 hours agorootparentprevMaybe that's true for Kharkiv, but entire portions of other cities like Bakhmut were entirely leveled, and the bits that remain standing will need to be demolished.

Terror. Destabilization. This lowers GDP, causes frustration, and \"make this just go away\" sentiment. Also, I think it happens out of frustration on the russian side. When the \"three day special operation\" failed, there was a wave of random bombardment of urban areas. On a side note, I do heavily recommend watching 20 days in Mariupol. reply ElectricalUnion 4 hours agorootparent> This lowers GDP Disasters often increase GDP, because money spent repairing damaged stuff moves thru the economy. Of course that doesn't mean this spending is productive or really is making the economy grow. Just one of the reasons GDP, as any other metric, has to be taken with a grain of salt. reply marcosdumay 2 hours agorootparentAn active war provides plenty of damaged stuff to use all the repairing spending you can add on your spreadsheet. A disaster at the same time will just move the resources around. reply mapt 6 hours agorootparentprevI mean... You'd think? That's definitely the motivation behind a lot of bombers. But one of the more resilient findings of 20th century warfare is that terror-bombing does not work to pacify a people's will from the bottom-up, only their pulse.

Only that most residential hits are not in that category. The majority do seem to be misses / redirects. Language is tricky sometimes, I know. But in this case, it really wasn't. reply dralley 22 minutes agorootparentThat... is not obvious at all. When hospitals and supermarkets are being hit repeatedly by multiple \"precision\" munitions, and then (sometimes) the Russians post drone footage of the impacts because they just happened to have been watching that location, and when the Russians have also used video footage of strikes on Syrian hospitals to market the effectiveness of their munitions, it's not crazy to suggest that they engage in terror bombing tactics. reply aguaviva 18 minutes agorootparentThat... is not obvious at all.

The long range “precision” attacks by Russia often just end up randomly killing civilians. Eg: missile strikes on Kyiv blowing up a children’s hospital, or the September strikes on Lviv blowing up a random apartment building and wiping out almost an entire family. You can easily go “what are the chances” even when shahads are flying over your head and the sky is lit up with tracer fire from mobile air defense units after some exposure. reply anelson 7 hours agoparentprevIt is true that war can rage in a country and people not on the frontline can live reasonably normal lives. I returned to Kyiv in August of last year, and lived for over a year during some of the worst air attacks on the country. It’s not so much that there is no danger or the war is far away. I woke up many times to explosions in the distance and air raid alarms in the capital are a daily occurrence. Attacks are absolutely not limited to critical infrastructure. Even if Russia didn’t deliberately target civilian populations (and they definitely do), air defenses don’t vaporize enemy ordnance so it’s going to fall down somewhere, and when attacks are happening in cities then it’s likely that it will land on something populated. It’s more that the odds of being killed or wounded as a civilian in the capital are higher than in a peaceful country but low enough that the mind just gets used to it and you go on with life. I finally left Ukraine a few weeks ago, for fear of how bad the winter will be with the infrastructure bombing. My wife and I moved to Budapest. Believe it or not, we miss Kyiv and want to move back in the spring, war notwithstanding.

As the Russians are experiencing, going after infrastructure and civilian targets is not really giving them much advantage on the battlefield. And with their own logistical and supply challenges, there seems to be a shortage of actual military targets that they go after. Like Ukrainian troops on Russian soil in the Kursk area. It actually looks like the Ukrainians will spend Christmas and the winter occupying the Kursk area. The Ukrainians are using the threat of these weapons extremely effectively. They've hit a few targets that sounded like they mattered but they are mostly holding back. The not so veiled threat to the Russians here is that anything they value within reach is a potential target. That includes command centers, troop concentrations, defensive weapons, air bases, etc. That's actually resulting in them pulling those things away from the battlefield. So, those missiles are doing their job without getting fired. reply ashoeafoot 1 hour agorootparentUkraine can build it,especially drones reply nine_k 5 hours agorootparentprevActing mean lowers both your own morale and the international support.

But if it was retaliation I’m sure it would be ok. reply ethbr1 5 hours agorootparentOne big PR issue is that Ukraine and the West collectively forgot how deterrence works. Russia arguably never really learned.* Preemptive formulation and announcement: \"If you X, we will escalate in Y way. If you do not X, then we will not.\" Instead, there's a hodgepodge of reactive escalation, which is far less effective. The point is to bargain your willingness to escalate into a self-limitation on your opponent's part. F.ex. this war might never have happened if NATO had said, before the post-Crimea invasion, that if Russia further invades territorial Ukraine then it would supply massive amounts of arms to Ukraine. * Russia, on the other hand, apparently never figured out that announcing everything as a red line and constantly making nuclear threats makes such announcements useless. But it seems like authoritarian regimes often have trouble interacting with freer information spaces. reply jfengel 4 hours agorootparentThey didn't forget. They remembered extremely well that both sides can do that. They know that it leads to a feedback loop where the threats escalate. And in a nuclear world, those threats can escalate to annihilation. The result is Mutually Assured Destruction, and choices are made based on whether you believe the other side is in fact crazy enough to commit suicide. Russia knew that the US would supply arms. They also expected that they would be able to conquer the country before that could help. They were wrong, but that came as a surprise to everybody (except perhaps the Ukrainians). The US keeps weighing how much they're going to escalate the threats. They've prevented Ukraine from using their weapons to attack Moscow, precisely because Putin has used Mutually Assured Destruction. Get anywhere near him, and he will use nuclear weapons to destroy the world. Do you believe him? That is literally the most important question in the world right now, because if you guess wrong, the consequences go way, way beyond Ukraine. reply ethbr1 3 hours agorootparent> And in a nuclear world, those threats can escalate to annihilation. They haven't thus far. And the US was a lot more pointed about deterrence (including nuclear escalation threats) in the 60s/70s. The status quo is that Russia frequently threatens nuclear escalation to all sorts of Ukrainian actions, and the West... doesn't threaten anything preemptively. Can you think of one instance thus far where the West preemptively said \"If Russia does X, then we will Y\" for clear Xs and Ys? And then did it? reply jfengel 3 hours agorootparentThe US has said that it stood with Ukraine, and would give money and weapons. It hasn't been specific, but I don't think that increased specificity would have deterred Russia. It's more meaningful to actually do the thing than to talk about it. As you note, Russia's red lines are meaningless. We don't even really take his nuclear threats seriously. The strategy has been to avoid escalation, but just to outlast Russia on its own terms. Russia is running its war badly. They seem willing to spend blood and treasure on it, and no amount of threat is going to stop that. Ukraine just needs to outlast it. What's really going to succeed for them is not that the West failed to make enough threats, but that the US is about to capitulate. Under those circumstances, Ukraine likely cannot outlast it. Some have said all along that the US should have enabled Ukraine to fight to win, rather than outlast. Not a threat, but just going ahead and fighting. Under that theory, Russia would see that it would take more damage than it could afford, and give up. It's possible that this is correct. We'll never really know. The siege strategy seemed viable because the US did not expect to surrender so easily. Giving up in Ukraine wasn't really a major point in this election. But that is how war goes; you do your best with the information you have, and sometimes you fail anyway. reply ethbr1 3 minutes agorootparent> The [Western] strategy has been to avoid escalation This is the part that feels like it's failed. Because the West has escalated, but only reactively to battlefield conditions and without preemptively announcing the steps that will be taken.

Putin is a paranoid coward and fears for his life like few people you know. No he's not going to \"destroy the world\", it would endanger his own life and the palaces he built for himself. No it's not binary, there's a vast, vast gulf between limited nuclear use and a full-on attack on CONUS. In fact, any nuclear use by Russia would likely bring its rapid defeat, since their main allies (India and China) are nuclear armed countries with a border dispute and are very interested in the nuclear taboo staying intact. No it's not \"Mutually Assured Destruction\", the mainstream of nuclear targeting is counter-force disarming strikes, and the US is perfectly capable of winning a nuclear war. \"Winning\" here means ending up in a situation where cities are mostly intact on both sides, but only one side is capable of threatening them. Moreover, being credibly capable of winning a nuclear exchange was (during the Cold War) and is necessary to keep European and Asian allies safe. No, militaries are not deliberately glassing cities if push comes to shove, it doesn't make any military or political sense. You don't kill a hostage to win a negotiation. No, a nuclear war is not a \"suicide\".

You hope that the adversary isn't able to strike hard enough or at enough targets, or is unwilling to go all in on war crimes by destroying civilian infrastructure. Iraqi and Yugoslavian grids were taken down almost entirely in days in the 90s and they only came back because there was a very careful use of weapons and tactics that didn't completely annihilate the gear. And modern equipment is far, far, far less field-repairable then whatever an average Iraqi substation had installed in 1990. It's only going to get worse in conflicts where there's willingness to attack infrastructure because energy infrastructure is fixed in place, delicate, physically large and easy to detect and locate and vulnerable to even small drone-sized attacks, let alone missiles. And that's assuming you have to attack it physically at all and not just remotely disable it somehow. If you have to harden the infrastructure, all you can do really is simplify hugely so you can repair it when attacked (fewer imported Infineon IGBTs, fancy Siemens PLCs, and networked UHVDC switchgear on 2 year lead times) and decentralise to minimise single points of failure and avoid cascading failures. Which is hugely inefficient in physical terms like wasted capacity and losses as well as the human effort required to keep it running, but some places might have some power. Even then, in the next decades, against a state level adversary who could make and deliver, say, drones that can autonomously recognise and attack anything that looks like a ceramic insulator disk or a solar panel, if you can't threaten grave retaliation, you're back to the good old tutting about war crimes. reply DanielHB 7 hours agorootparentI fear such civilian attacks are going to become more commonplace over time. It is well hypothesized that should China invade Taiwan, Taiwan would destroy the three gorges dam and completely annihilate a good chunk of China. It is just as much a deterrent as nuclear weapons, probably worse in this specific case. This is why you can't go for the throat of a regime anymore, even if you have overwhelming force. Because if you do then, well, you are already going to jail for war crimes anyway. reply grues-dinner 6 hours agorootparentI don't know, I think that's always been a possibility. Hitting massive civilian infrastructure has always been kind of a MAD thing. And hard to spin as anything other than a war crime - floodplains covered in civilian bodies looks bad. What seems scarier to me is the newer possibility of a huge number of very small remote attacks that utterly devastate the fabric of civilian systems, but none of them individually look like egregious war crimes. With the right PR, they can be defended as \"limited\" and \"surgical\" attacks denying \"dual-use\" infrastructure. Put all the blame for \"looking suspicious\" onto the locals with advance warning. Solar panels on the roof? Just like a command post. Radio antenna, looks like a communications relay. Fuel tanks? Vehicle pool. You can even give notice of all the strikes, you don't need to bomb them personally, they'll be out of mind without food, water, sewerage, healthcare or heating. For bonus points, then you can blame the defending government for failures of governance when they can't organise, say, waste treatment any more. reply scotty79 3 hours agorootparentWarcrime becomes increasingly a previous century thing.

Building reinforced concrete bunkers around them is something we know how to do. I'm surprised substation makers aren't offering Ukraine models with armored plates (or maybe they are?), a couple inches of steel is expensive but would stop small drones. The wires themself connecting to the substation are cheap enough to replace. Of course the above all comes at a cost. It is much cheaper to put your substations in open air. reply grues-dinner 3 hours agorootparentThat's so completely impractical I don't know where to begin. There are hundreds of thousands of substations in a modern country, and more transformers on top of that. And the bigger substations are huge. An urban 275kV substation could easily be 10 acres in size. \"Wires\" are also not especially cheap or easy to replace either, even at \"low\" voltages like under 33kV. It's not a few feet of twin and earth and an h-clip. And a couple of inches of steel will absolutely not stop small drones if they're designed from the ground up to be anti-materiel devices. Anduril are hawking these right now complete with their wierdly gleeful videos, and if they're the only ones in the world then short my secondary and call me a slagpile. And that's ignoring weapons anyway in use like those tungsten filled rockets that just shred everything in the area.

It's not blanket, there are questions of purpose and proportionality. If, for example, you strike a single civilian substation because by doing so you take out the power supply to a critical defence radar and are then able to attack an otherwise defended military target, then it's hard to argue that's a war crime. Any more than bombing civilian infrastructure like roads and railways. Doing it as part of a deliberate campaign of terror whose main purpose is to harm and intimidate civilians is probably a war crime, although it's very easy to fig leaf it if there's any way that attacking the infrastructure impedes war production directly. Doing it proportionately in retaliation is less likely to be. reply mrweasel 8 hours agoparentprevThat is a big question, a few things you can do: * Air gap EVERYTHING. * Extremely careful screening of employees. * Constant security training of staff. * Anti air defence. * Bury your cables. reply sam_lowry_ 8 hours agorootparentThe grid had some redundancy from Soviet planners, but has been optimized over 30 years.

You can put some Gepards or a missile battery around a nuclear plant. Good luck protecting 1000s of wind turbines or solar panel installations. And this isn't just theory: the nuclear power plants are the pretty much the only thing still running in Ukraine.

Then your ability to repair various wind/solar sites also is very probably way better because few want to work on a damaged nuclear plant (especially with all local population running away as far as possible), spare parts (nuclear-grade) are less commonly available in other industries, the site may once more become a target because it isn't one-among-hundreds... reply mpweiher 4 hours agorootparentThe amount of missiles you need to penetrate the defenses and actually get through the extremely hardened/resilient shell of a nuclear power plant is invariably more usefully spent elsewhere. A group of terrorists once attacked a French nuclear plant. Admittedly only with an anti-tank missile, so smaller warhead, but apparently they had a hard time finding the scorch marks. The containment of modern reactors is designed to withstand an airplane strike, which is at least an order of magnitude more powerful than the warheads of cruise missiles or tactical ballistic missiles. Whereas you can probably take out solar panels with a hand-grenade, which you can lob directly or carry via drones. Don't even need to expend a suicide drone, just have it drop the grenade. And once again: apart from actually not being well supported logically, your theory is also contradicted by the real world evidence on the ground. reply bluGill 4 hours agorootparentprevNuclear plants have generally not been attacked.

Many people in the US own something that could be used and we are not even under attack. While most home depot generators deliver dirty power the better ones can provide stable 60hz (US uses 60hz not 50) - those could be used to provide the 60hz to the grid (it wouldn't be worth everything needed to actually do this, but in theory could). there are a lot of \"solar generators\" that also can provide stable frequency.

I think environmentalists do have a strong point here: If a country like Japan (known for stability and diligence) can not be trusted to be able to prevent meltdowns (flooding was a known risk after all), how could you ever suggest them as primary power source in countries where regulation and monitoring would be a corrupt shitshow, like Italy, Spain, Africa etc? reply throwaway2037 5 hours agorootparentYou raise some interesting points.

Note that actual numbers reflect this: Last Italian referendum about nuclear power was 94% (!!) against (admittedly shortly after Fukushima). > Also, sarcastically, Africa is not a country, but 50 countries with a wide variety of development. I know, my statement is about all of them. Operating nuclear plants requires long-term (centuries, not decades) trust in safety culture, regulators and operating companies. Which african nation would you suggest as a paragon for nuclearization? Egypt? South Africa? (note: this is a trick suggestion; electrical power management in South Africa is the most embarassing, corrupt shitshow you could ever imagine in a somewhat industrialized state). reply renewiltord 7 hours agorootparentprevThat looks bad. Why would the environmentalists take the position that they did then? reply NortySpock 6 hours agorootparent(A) not all environmentalists take a non-nuclear position. Be careful painting with a broad brush (B) some people's opinion is based on emotional reaction to a technology rather than a cold calculus of how much a technology could do to reduce global warming effects and reduce humans environmental impact. reply renewiltord 5 hours agorootparentI was curious about the \"not all\" since it depends whether \"not all\" is 0.1% or 99%. So I did this: 1. Google for \"largest environmental organizations\" 2. Select the top 5 3. Search for their position on the subject Here's what I found are the top five largest according to a rudimentary Google: 1. Laudato Si' Movement \"In addition to being unsustainable and failing to contribute to climate objectives, nuclear power is also proven to be a dangerous, dirty and expensive source of energy\" 2. WWF: \"Nuclear energy cannot, and must not, be considered part of the urgently required energy transition.\" 3. 350.org \"Nuclear: a deadly and costly distraction\" 4. Climate Foundation (couldn't find anything) 5. Greenpeace \"Nuclear power is dirty, dangerous and expensive. Say no to new nukes.\" I think the environmentalists don't like it, man. I think I've seen enough. Nuclear power must be pretty bad if it is so broadly hated. Or the environmentalists are fools.

People like to crow about \"nuclear provides the baseload we need\", but this is ill-informed nonsense; \"providing baseload\" is a privilege you get to enjoy if you are the source with the lowest marginal cost (which is absolutely not a given for nuclear power), and sure, you can operate a reactor in load-following mode by turning it off half the time but then the already bad economics become even worse. What you actually need is dispatchable power (thats cheap to install per GW, like gas) and/or more storage or better grid connectivity. 2) There is a lot of pushback from the population at large (especially in countries were regulators and operators are more corrupt/less trusted), building out nuclear plants is much more time consuming and expensive and the resistance against new sites is immense. Alienating half your support base by suddenly championing nuclear power for basically no reason is also a no-go. reply renewiltord 2 hours agorootparentYeah, this makes sense.

For what's currently being made, the cost of PV+batteries is already on par with nuclear. reply frafra 6 hours agorootparentCost != price/value. You can produce energy cheaply at noon, but it has little value compared to electricity produced at 18:00. The higher the share of renewables in the electricity mix, the more storage is needed, and it grows faster than linearly. You can also not stock electricity in advance for months in northern areas. There are a lot of factors to keep into account, and the cost of electricity production is often a minor one, when considering the total price. reply ben_w 5 hours agorootparent> You can produce energy cheaply at noon, but it has little value compared to electricity produced at 18:00 Batteries literally solve this problem more cheaply than nuclear. And given the speed with which people have actually been building both reactors and batteries, this specific issue is also being solved with batteries faster than with nuclear, too. > The higher the share of renewables in the electricity mix, the more storage is needed, and it grows faster than linearly.

    "originBody": "0 Vulnerable U Posts Inside ExxonMobil's Alleged Hack-for-Hire Campaign Targeting Climate Activists Inside ExxonMobil's Alleged Hack-for-Hire Campaign Targeting Climate Activists Exxon Lobbyist Under Investigation for Hacking and Leaking Environmentalist Emails Matt Johansen November 27, 2024 Why it matters: A hack-for-hire operation linked to ExxonMobil targeted over 500 climate activists and journalists, showing us how corporations can now deploy nation-state-level cyber capabilities against their critics. This case shines a light on the industrialization of digital warfare in corporate disputes, with massive implications for advocacy and journalism. The big picture: The operation combined mercenary hackers, professional PR firms, and legal teams to weaponize stolen information in courts and media. Code-named “Fox Hunt,” this effort goes deep into the cybercriminals playbook, complete with phishing campaigns and layers of plausible deniability built into the architecture. By the numbers: 500+ environmental activists and family members targeted 28,000+ malicious URLs deployed 100+ phishing attempts sent to high-value targets $10+ million/year in revenue from Exxon to DCI Group, the PR firm allegedly involved How it worked: Target List Creation: The DCI Group, Exxon’s public relations and lobbying firm at the time, allegedly compiled a list of targets, including activists and attorneys involved in climate litigation. Outsourced Hacking: The list was handed to Israeli private detective Amit Forlit, who outsourced the hacking to India-based BellTroX InfoTech Services, a notorious hack-for-hire firm. Phishing Campaigns: BellTroX sent sophisticated phishing emails designed to mimic colleagues and friends, successfully breaching email accounts. Weaponization of Stolen Data: Hacked emails were leaked to media outlets and used in court filings to discredit environmental advocates and bolster Exxon’s legal defenses. Timeline of period of a sample of spearphishing juxtaposed with certain key events in the #ExxonKnew advocacy campaign. source: https://citizenlab.ca/2020/06/dark-basin-uncovering-a-massive-hack-for-hire-operation/ Timeline of Key Events 2015: Reports surface that Exxon scientists knew fossil fuels contributed to climate change but downplayed the risks publicly. November 2015: New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announces an investigation into Exxon, sparking the #ExxonKnew campaign. 2016: Stolen Rockefeller Family Fund memo leaks to media, used to paint climate litigation as a politically motivated vendetta. 2018: Exxon lawyers cite hacked documents to argue against lawsuits filed by state attorneys general. 2022: Aviram Azari, an associate of Forlit, is convicted in the U.S. for hack-for-hire schemes. Between the lines: The operation's timing aligned perfectly with key events in climate change litigation against Exxon, suggesting coordination between hackers and legal teams. What they're saying: Exxon denies involvement, calling allegations \"conspiracy theories\" DCI Group: \"We direct all our employees and consultants to comply with the law\" Fallout for Activists The hack-and-leak operation disrupted key preparations for lawsuits modeled on historic tobacco litigation. Attorney Matt Pawa, who drove much of the anti-Exxon litigation, said the leaks turned his life upside down: “Those documents were directly employed by Exxon to come after me with all guns blazing.” Matt Pawa Activists described a chilling effect, with Kert Davies of the Center for Climate Integrity noting that the leaks “sent a shudder through the environmental community.” What's next: The FBI investigation continues, while advocates push for stronger legal frameworks to address hack-for-hire operations. The bottom line: This case exposes how corporate disputes have moved from boardrooms to cybersecurity battles, with massive potential impact on advocacy and journalism. Go deeper: Read Citizen Lab's full investigation into Dark Basin and their connections to BellTroX. Longer form thoughts: What we're witnessing isn't just corporate espionage – it's the industrialization of digital warfare. As Reuters reports, Exxon, facing existential threats from climate litigation, apparently decided to go full Metal Gear Solid on its critics. But here's the genius (and I mean that in the Machiavellian sense): they built a perfect plausible deniability machine. The Architecture of Modern Corporate Warfare: Client (allegedly Exxon) -> PR Firm (DCI Group) -> Israeli PI (Forlit) -> Indian Hackers (BellTroX) This is what we’ll call the \"four-layer burrito of blame.\" Each layer provides insulation from legal and reputational risk. It's brilliant and terrifying. The Economics Follow the money: $10M/year from Exxon to DCI Unknown millions to Israeli/Indian hackers Potential billions saved in climate litigation The ROI here is insane. For the cost of a few executive salaries, Exxon potentially derailed multiple state-level lawsuits and gained tactical advantage in ongoing litigation. Why It Works Asymmetric Warfare: Advocacy groups lack the resources to combat such sophisticated campaigns. Perfect Information Arbitrage: Stolen documents provide insider knowledge for strategic advantage. Legal Weaponization: Data obtained via hacking is used in courts under the guise of legitimate evidence. This is peak late-stage capitalism meets cyberpunk reality. We've created a world where: Corporations can deploy nation-state level cyber capabilities Legal systems are unprepared for weaponized stolen information Plausible deniability can be purchased as a service This isn't just about Exxon. We're seeing the emergence of a new business model: Industrialized Digital Espionage as a Service (IDEaaS?). And like all good SaaS businesses, it scales beautifully. What's Next? More sophisticated cutout structures AI-powered targeting and social engineering Blockchain-based payment systems for better opacity Increased regulatory scrutiny (too little, too late) The Bottom Line: The game has changed. The next great corporate advantage might not come from better products or services, but from better information warfare capabilities. And that is terrifying to me.",

It was really interesting because at the time the conclusion of our security consultants was that the attack was just random commercially-motivated prospecting. Then the Citizen Lab Dark Basin report came out years later and it was clear they were after our internal comms, so they could milk a decade of emails for anything that looked bad when taken out of context. Yikes. After the attack we put a 3 month retention limit on most emails and messages. I recommend this to anyone doing sensitive work! You miss the old emails sometimes but it's worth it. I think it's possible we'll learn more soon about who hired our hackers, which is exciting! It was almost certainly a major American ISP, or the lobbying umbrella group they created. It's my optimistic read that blowback from this case has already eroded the practice of dirty tricks like these. More lobbyists and companies getting caught would strengthen the effect. Since I left Fight for the Future I've been working on a Signal alternative that feels more like Slack, for teams facing similar threats. Hopefully something comes of that too! reply tmpz22 2 hours agoparentAny reason you can’t dump an air gapped archive and put it on a physical device in a deposit box? Best of both worlds should you truly need to access it. Or are depositions also a concern? Funny enough I just did a business law presentation on Comcast Corp v FCC (2010). Thanks for doing what you could for Net Neutrality reply michaelt 1 hour agorootparentNah, the value of having access to 3-month-old e-mails is that they're indexed in gmail, so if someone asks how much we paid for that widget 18 months ago you can get the original quotes in an instant. Whereas if the data is in a bank vault, you ask the same question and the reply is \"IDK, I think it was about $50-100?\" reply holmesworcester 16 minutes agorootparentExactly. reply holmesworcester 2 hours agorootparentprevIt was a pleasure! We lost nominally in the end (except in California and outside the US) but we built enough awareness to give the ISPs a fear that blatant violations would rock the boat and lead to worse outcomes for them, like more state laws or tougher agency rules when Democrats regained power. I do regret not pushing harder for federal legislation though! On airgapped email archives, yes, the subpoena threat model is real too. That also happened to us because of some other dirty tricks by ISPs in the same campaign! Fake FCC submissions opposing net neutrality were being created with blatantly stolen user data; like, not people being tricked into singing a petition but just straight up identity theft. We documented all of this and pitched some state AGs on looking into it. New York did, which was awesome, but they ended up subpoenaing everyone including us! We were psyched about this overall of course since it was our idea, and they did end up finding out who did it which was awesome (Broadband for America, the umbrella lobbying group for the telcos) but it was a huge amount of work to comply with the subpoena. The retention limits reduced that burden. Another reason to have them! I would also say that, if you do create an airgapped archive and store it in an appropriately paranoid way, you are likely to never ever bother to dig it out of storage before the SSD melts into uselessness. You'll miss the ocassional old email but not enough to go digging for it. reply lukan 42 minutes agorootparentIf you really don't need old email, then don't bother, but for the chance that you do need them sometimes, but don't want to store everything in an internet connected place - it would be an option setting up a old laptop for this(maybe with Thunderbird), where you can remove the wifi chip for this air gapped use case. (In most older laptops they are easy to remove and not soldered on.) Then regulary exporting all the needed files, either just copy them with a USB stick and more secure would be burning CD-R's for each data transfer. And it likely helps having an exotic linux system on the laptop, so a windows USB worm won't replicate there if you use the pragmatic USB data transfer variant. reply DaiPlusPlus 16 minutes agoparentprev> After the attack we put a 3 month retention limit on most emails and messages.

Or even Sarbanes-Oxley? reply holmesworcester 10 minutes agorootparentGreat question. IANAL but my understanding is that outside of some specific regulatory requirements in specific industries you're free to put these policies in place as long as you do it before you have any expectation that you're going to be sued. That's another reason to bite the bullet and put these policies in place now: once you actually have a specific fear of being sued it's maybe too late, because at that point changes to your retention policy could be construed as interfering with the legal process. You can also have your policy exempt certain categories of documents (like financial records) and that's okay too as long as you're consistent about it. reply j_maffe 3 hours agoprevCan we change to the more reliable source, on which this article is based?https://citizenlab.ca/2020/06/dark-basin-uncovering-a-massiv... reply pera 2 hours agoparentThis is a more up-to-date article: https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exxon-lobbyist-inves... reply austin-cheney 2 hours agoparentprevThis citizenlab article is so much better.

And where do people buying oil products sit? reply vegetablepotpie 2 hours agoparentprev> We are essentially all complicit. With statements like these it’s important to take into account proportionality and scale. Whereas a member of the public may have been aware of climate change after James Hanson’s congressional testimony in 1988, ExxonMobil had its own climate research division in the ‘70s and knew about the dangers of climate change at-least ten years prior [1]. They sat on these findings and in the ‘90s actively engaged in PR and misinformation campaigns to delay action on climate change. They have been incredibly successful at this and the US has no policies to limit fossil gas extraction or burning. [1] https://drilled.media/podcasts/drilled reply jl6 1 hour agorootparentI am aware, and that behavior is despicable, but I still don’t believe that this puts all the responsibility for climate change on oil companies generally or Exxon specifically. The public at large have known for centuries that burning fossil fuels creates locally systemically significant pollution, and we do it anyway. We have known for decades now that it creates globally systemically significant pollution, and still we burn it anyway. A few thousand greedy, profiteering, unscrupulous oil bosses would not have gotten away with doing it had there not been a few billion consumers paying them to do it. At some point, the blame must also be treated as systemic. What happens in the scenario where Exxon is found guilty and given the corporate death penalty that some have asked for? Their assets would be confiscated and passed to some new owner. The government maybe? Whoever gets them, will they shut them down? No, they’ll keep those wells pumping, under some new brand name, because the demand for oil is systemic. If Exxon is culpable for paying a hacker to commit a crime on their behalf, then the population at large are culpable of paying Exxon to pump oil on our behalf. reply triceratops 1 hour agorootparentI'd have much more sympathy for this point of view if Exxon and co had loudly shouted about the dangers of climate change from the rooftops and the public at large still ignored them. They did the opposite of that, in fact, and continue to do. So I have no sympathy for any oil companies if they ever face any punishment. A vanishingly unlikely prospect by the way. reply gruez 1 hour agorootparentprev>The government maybe? Whoever gets them, will they shut them down?

It's a sensitive subject, and I feel this is very much in good faith. I think there's two important points you made that I'd like to address: 1. Failures to apply meaningful penalties / punishment to transnational corporations 2. Individual culpability for oil consumption To start, I think it's worth looking at how punishments for corporate wrongdoings might look in a brighter world. Not having faith in the system is _completely_ understandable, and I think it can be easy to forget what it is we _do_ want after being shown what we _don't_ want over and over. Off-the-cuff, I envision something like the forced closure and seizure of all Exxon assets by the federal government. These assets could be sold off to pay for the settlements of the multiple class-action lawsuits against Exxon focused on public health and environmental wrongdoing[1][2]. I'd love to see criminal charges for those at the top There are past examples of companies doing wrong and being forced to close \"with prejudice\", or not being allowed to restructure into another entity with a different name. A famous example is the forced closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI)[3]. Another is Purdue Pharmaceuticals, which was restructured into a public beneficiary trust that would administer payouts to \"opioid creditors\" or people who suffered from the opioid epidemic[4]. And hearteningly, there are also examples of executives facing jail time. Enron[5] is the most famous example, and though there are critiques that it wasn't far enough, Skilling was a fall guy, etc., it serves as a good reminder that even within our system today, there is already precedent. Theranos is another example of criminal proceedings against executives[6]. All this is to emphasize that though pessimism is understandable, optimism can help us push the system in the right direction, and doesn't have to mean having all the answers. Now we can look at individual culpability. I wanted to look at this point second because I think it becomes more approachable once we've seen what widespread change can look like. I don't have citations, or evidence to bring here. Just my own experience. I find it much easier to start taking personal responsibility when I know that there is some effort being made to offer me a mode of life where I don't induce second order demand for oil (i.e. I need to buy groceries, those groceries may come packaged in plastic). I find it much easier to take a freezing half-mile walk to the store when I see the companies inducing oil demand many orders of magnitude beyond what I'll ever use or need begin to face consequences.

Their understanding of climate change back then was good enough to have a damned decent roadmap for how things were going to play out over the next fifty years. They were capable of projecting what was going to happen, the likely regulatory changes that wold be needed to mitigate climate change, and how that would affect them. One would expect the average CEO would literally kill for a roadmap of the future. They had it, and more. Exxon, ARCO, and others even made early R&D investments that helped pioneer terrestrial solar power, not to mention their extensive R&D capabilities more broadly. Sticking with the metaphor, they had the map and some of the most important tools for the journey ahead. Fifty years were long enough even a financial moron could have developed a long-term transition plan that avoided stranded assets and massive losses. And they--and their people--weren't financial morons. Hell, much of their capital equipment and facilities investments had expected lifespans of a similar length. They had everything needed to create the mother of all soft landings. Hell, they could have engineered an outcome where they came out well ahead. Being able to rebrand yourself as the company that chose to sacrifice itself to save the world buys you a hell of a lot of goodwill you can leverage for subsidies in Washington. We’d have paid them for it and thanked them for the privilege. It couldn’t have been that much harder than convincing an entire political party that the problem didn’t exist. Oil companies convincing the public they were shitty companies that needed to be reborn? If they focused on the dying part of rebirth, that wouldn’t have been a very difficult sell even back then. Only someone who failed upwards could have been gifted a hand like that and still manage to choose the worst possible path for both the world and their own company. All they managed to do was delay the transition and make it more expensive for their company and the world. reply immibis 2 hours agorootparentprevnext [10 more] [flagged] triceratops 1 hour agorootparentI would not do the same.

Just because you lack morals you shouldn't assume everyone else does too. reply Evil_Saint 2 hours agorootparentprevNo. No I wouldn't. reply goatlover 2 hours agorootparentprevOnly if you're a sociopath. But I also don't buy the framing that oil companies are murdering people when they're providing the energy society needs. Fossil fuels have largely powered the modern world. That doesn't excuse covering up the science and the need to transition either. But there's tradeoffs and nuance to all this. Was solar and battery technology good enough in the 70s and 80s to start transitioning then? Would the public have accepted a nuclear transition? For that matter, are there climate models predicting deaths on the order of 1 billion? Do they even make such predictions? reply triceratops 1 hour agorootparent> That doesn't excuse covering up the science and the need to transition either That's what we're calling sociopathic behavior. Not drilling oil and gas. reply jeromechoo 2 hours agoparentprevI agree with you but the only time execs were held personally responsible that I can remember is Enron and that was on insider trading charges. There is so much plausible deniability and near unlimited appeals built into the system that it would take mountains of evidence and several hundred Lina Khans for an actually responsible executive to be tried for something like this. reply stuaxo 2 hours agorootparentWell, there is this Vietnamese billionaire https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-68778636 And Iceland put bankers in jail after the financial crisis https://www.vox.com/2015/6/9/8751267/iceland-capital-control... reply SpicyLemonZest 1 hour agoparentprev [–] This seems like a confused analysis. As Enron and FTX both show well, personal criminal responsibility for high level executives and a \"corporate death penalty\" already exist and get used when circumstances warrant. The decision to use them is just made through a structured system of laws and penalties, rather than a subjective sense of which executives you feel are bad. reply gruez 1 hour agorootparent>As Enron and FTX both show well, personal criminal responsibility for high level executives and a \"corporate death penalty\" already exist and get used when circumstances warrant. Hardly. Enron and FTX fell because they were insolvent, not because a \"corporate death penalty\" was levied on them. reply SpicyLemonZest 46 minutes agorootparentPurdue, then, although a \"corporate death penalty\" executed in response to non-government-induced insolvency still seems relevant to me. The biggest proximate effect of shutting down a company is that all its employees become unemployed, so it's not something you'd generally want to do when there are other options on the table. reply sofixa 43 minutes agorootparentprev [–] > As Enron and FTX both show well, personal criminal responsibility for high level executives and a \"corporate death penalty\" already exist and get used when circumstances warrant Really not comparable. Enron and FTX were both insolvent due to Ponzi scheme-esque levels of fraud by their executives. The executives were sued for misleading investors and outright fraud, including securities fraud. Boeing killing people with negligence, or Chevron poisoning millions through negligence, resulted in nothing. Personal responsibility for executives only exists for defrauding investors or tax authorities, which is wildly insufficient. Corporate death penalty only exists if the company is literally insolvent, and even them it might get rescued (GM), which is wildly insufficient. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "commentBody": "Kagi Teams (kagi.com)178 points by icar 6 hours agohidepastfavorite144 comments palata 5 hours agoI have been using Kagi for around two years. If I don't find the results I want, I sometimes try Google and I don't find results there either. Difficult to say if Kagi gives better results, but what's for certain is that it doesn't give worse results. I am happy to pay 120$/year to support the business model. reply Glant 5 minutes agoparentThe only time I really go to Google is when searching for a product or local business. Google excels there, but that's obviously because they have several decades of business-provided information. Kagi does great with 99% of my searches. reply throwayaw84330 4 hours agoparentprevI've been using it since ~2022 and can't go back. I think it definitely has better results: whenever I'm using a new machine or a different computer without it, I notice the low quality of results immediately; and quickly side-quest to find a way to log in to Kagi. The freedom of clicking on the first few search results without thinking whether or not those are ads and/or scams is priceless; a calm and premium experience. reply baliex 3 hours agorootparentI’ve been using it for a couple of years and would add that it’s probably the density of high quality results that’s better, rather than the best results being better than Google. In other words, there are fewer low quality results which raises the average quality of the results you’re presented with reply hubraumhugo 6 hours agoprevI can't think of any other product that makes it to the HN frontpage so consistently. I guess Kagi really hits the bullseye in terms of HN as a target audience. reply larme 5 hours agoparentIt indicates how much does google search suck nowadays. reply mvavassori 5 hours agorootparentI know that everybody here likes to bash on Google but i tried ddg, bing, qwant, brave search, all the other niche ones (searx, swisscows, etc...), and i found Google to be still better than all of them, especially for technical stuff. reply petra 4 hours agorootparentThe kagi experience isn't great, limited number of results, for example. I can't say I get a feeling they are much better than Google day to day. But the fact you can use kagi to filter out links with ads/trackers inside them,means sometimes great results rise up, and that can be very valuable. reply aaravchen 4 hours agorootparentI thought the same, and still get annoyed when I get \"no results\" back, but almost every time when I then try to use Google I get nothing but totally inapplicable results I had to sort thru. Google made the news a number of years ago about this, they found people really don't like to see \"no results\", so Google silently drop terms, even if they're quoted, when it can't find enough results otherwise. Primarily I've found the source of issues like this are the lack of indexing anymore, and it's not just Kagi. A lot of tech discussions now have their own Forums or Discourse that are poorly promoted and (seem to?) have a robots.txt that says not to index them. I often have to manually go to those sites to run searches and find results from years ago. Also a lot of prohects keep moving away from Forums or equivalent, and using Discord, Matrix, or IRC, none of which end up searchable. No one is going to use those the same way no one is going to call you on the phone, and everyone just has to keep asking the sme questions if they do use it, so I always take that as \"we don't support this software/product anymore\" and rarely expect to find anything technical about it. reply monkmartinez 5 hours agorootparentprevI am 100% in agreement, between SearXNG and Google I can find darn near anything. Kagi was ok, it seems to really prefer reddit for the types of things I was searching for. I was also super conscious about the number of searches I had left in my plan. F-that. I type random stuff into the omnibar all day. Leaving Kagi as just enough friction to go to kagi, type a search, etc. that I didn't want to deal with it. reply dgacmu 2 hours agorootparentI found the limited number of searches really.. hm. It took up too much of my brain space worrying about it. The new $10 all you can eat plan is so much better in that regard. I don't think I would still be using it if they hadn't introduced that. reply Xelbair 4 hours agorootparentprevit doesn't change the fact that google of today is worse than google of 10-15 years ago. reply newsclues 5 hours agorootparentprevgoogle was better years ago. Google search quality regressed. id pay for the old google search. reply paulcole 5 hours agorootparentWhat specifically is better than Google today? reply newsclues 3 hours agorootparentThe google algorithm from about 15 years ago. I think the code is still running, just not publicly. Give me access to that! reply paulcole 1 hour agorootparent> The google algorithm from about 15 years ago. I doubt this is true given how the content on the web has changed. It is fun to be nostalgic though! reply newsclues 1 hour agorootparentNo, I believe it is true because it’s harder to find what I was looking for and it’s clear that the algorithm is skewed for political reasons and likely also economic reasons. reply cmrdporcupine 5 hours agorootparentprevI've been paying for Kagi for the last few months and I guess the compliment I could give is: I have it on some machines but not the other and I don't really notice? when I'm on the kagi one other than ... no ads and no ads-ranked results Which, frankly, I'm willing to pay for. I think it's a good product. reply monkmartinez 4 hours agorootparentI don't have ads on my SearXNG instance and I find that its comparable to Kagi. Have you tried searching with SearXNG? reply prophesi 4 hours agorootparentHow much maintenance does running a private instance take, and would you say it should be fine to run from your own IP? I've been using Kagi for ages, but I wouldn't mind a fallback that does better than DDG. reply monkmartinez 4 hours agorootparentNot much? I mean, I set it up initially to use as an LLM search tool for agents. That required me to use a specific version of SearXNG due to a JSON bug. My exact docker command is here: docker run -d -p 9017:8080 --name searxng_data -v \"${PWD}/searxng_data:/etc/searxng\" -e \"BASE_URL=http://localhost:9017/\" searxng/searxng:2024.8.31-769b2ed03 I run this from the directory where I want to store the data on windows (hence the weird PWD thing). I also use cloudflare tunnels and have the internet facing website, https://sear.mydomain.com, pointed at http//localhost:9017. I set up all my cloudflare tunnels with email authentication. My token lasts a month (but is configurable to whatever time frame you like). My traffic is strictly mine, so it seems to be working ok. Its basically no maintenance after this setup. I can mess with all the settings (except results format) from the main interface. reply carlosjobim 4 hours agorootparentprevWhy go though all that hassle when you can easily use Kagi? reply monkmartinez 4 hours agorootparentBecause I can configure exactly which search engines to index, no ads, use it for my local LLM's for search, better image search (maybe not better, but totally different results), a bazzillion tweaks and mods. I don't have to pay Kagi for the same results or keep track of how many searches I have left. reply dexterdog 4 hours agorootparentprevWhat is the hassle? I set it up once and just use it. When I hear about search engines that I don't think I want in my mix I go in and turn it off. reply carlosjobim 4 hours agorootparentI looked into it before Kagi existed and you needed to be a sys admin or developer to be able to use it. It's not for the general public. reply cmrdporcupine 3 hours agorootparentprevI mean, it's something I'd consider. I have a little ARM SBC here that I run Plex and Immich etc on. But Kagi makes it very easy for a not terrible price -- not much more than the monthly power bill for a little server -- and they also do more than just grab from other search services as they _do_ have their own crawler (unclear how much it's used for results?) and have LLM stuff which isn't terrible. Also as a former Google employee... I dig the idea of contributing funds for some competition in this space. reply IgorPartola 5 hours agorootparentprevTo be precise, it might indicate how much Google sucks specifically for the HN audience. I have never seen Kagi mentioned outside of HN. Not that I disagree that Google has ruined the web lately but let’s not assume that this means Kagi will eat their lunch just yet. reply move-on-by 4 hours agorootparentI’m a happy Kagi user. I set it up on my wife’s phone… she was relieved when the trial was over and I set Google back up. I’m starting to think this line of thought is more accurate than just ‘Google sucks now’. It depends on your demographic. I think Google has become so optimized for people who click on ads that they have alienated people who do not. I never click on ads. Back when I used Google, if I searched for something specific and saw both the ad and the search result I wanted- I just scrolled down to the search result. My wife would just click on the ad, and I think most people do. Beyond that specific example, she clicks on other types of ads as well. For me, I just see them as invasive and hostile. I’m not the type of user Google cares anything about, and maybe that’s why I perceive a drop in quality results. reply IgorPartola 3 hours agorootparentI think that’s precisely why you perceive it. I am actually curious if anyone has done a large scale rigorous study in perception of search quality among average users. reply netdevphoenix 5 hours agorootparentprevMonopolies are not easy to defeat. Look at how bad IE was and how much better FF and Chrome were. Both were free and yet IE still dominated for a very long time. reply dvngnt_ 1 hour agorootparentprevit probably wont because it's a paid service. most normal people have been have been shifting their search habits. tiktok (banned soon), youtube, reddit (though many use google to search reddit since their native search isn't good) reply cosmosgenius 4 hours agorootparentprevKagi is not mentioned true, but there are always talks w.r.t using site, intitle, time (before 2018 eg) filter to improve search. That indirectly can be considered as \"having low quality\" from one POV. reply IgorPartola 3 hours agorootparentI would post that most lay people, the ones who make Google their money, know nothing about those tools Google has/used to have. reply croo 5 hours agoparentprevOr they know how to advertise to their target audience well. reply daft_pink 5 hours agoparentprevit just works really really well. reply iLoveOncall 5 hours agoparentprev> I can't think of any other product that makes it to the HN frontpage so consistently Despite having so little paying users. Not even 35,000 lifetime paying users. They can really thank the HN echo-chamber, because without it they would have been forgotten a long time ago, nobody knows about Kagi outside of here. reply raincole 5 hours agorootparentDepending on your perspective. For \"next Google\", 35k subscribers is nothing. For a search engine, which has been assumed to be free for the whole decade, 35k paying users is a miracle. reply iLoveOncall 4 hours agorootparentMy perspective is \"tech startup\" that reaches the front page of HackerNews on a weekly basis. There are plenty of billion dollar companies that make users pay for something that has always been free (note taking apps just off the top of my head). reply kingstoned 4 hours agorootparentprevSubscriber count is not a measure of quality or importance of the service category. Hacker news is less popular than TMZ or the DailyMail, but it is not a lower quality news website. reply RavlaAlvar 4 hours agoprevI just moved to Kagi last month. Here’s my experience: Searching for real time information that happens within a day is way worse than google. I realise how much I missed the shopping search of Google. Google map is still irreplaceable. Google search has better UX, I particularly missed the favicon that identified the site next to URL. Image search is also way inferior reply esperent 4 hours agoparentYou picked the exact three things that Google does better than Kagi: Maps, Shopping, and realtime information. I'd also add local business information to this list. But you didn't mention the things that Kagi does better than Google which is in my experience: everything else. Google is still \"free\" though so there's nothing stopping you from adding !g to your Kagi shopping searches. reply nzealand 3 hours agoparentprevKagi provides a fantastic summarizer. I have a bookmarklet for Kagi's Universal Summarizer, and if a long article or video doesn't immediately tell me \"what it's gonna tell me\" then I just click it. javascript:Object.assign(document.createElement(\"a\"), {href: `https://kagi.com/summarizer/index.html?url=${encodeURIComponent(window.location)}`, target: \"_blank\"}).click(); Protip: Youtube changed something recently, and now I think you have to show the transcript and watch/wait a little bit before Kagi can find the transcript and summarize the video. reply JumpCrisscross 4 hours agoparentprev> Searching for real time information that happens within a day is way worse than google This is fair. On the other elements, I’ve found Kagi to be superior. In particular, having shopping results separated from recommendations (and summarising them with quick answers). As for favicons, uprank or even anchor your favourite domains [1]. That’s what the favicon was proxying. [1] https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/website-info-personalize... reply MaPi_ 4 hours agoparentprevThere is a setting to turn on the favicon somewhere reply RavlaAlvar 2 hours agorootparentThanks, just found it reply mikkelam 3 hours agoparentprevI agree on the first part. Having used kagi for about 6 months it often lacks behind on recent things. I find myself automatically adding !g on such queries reply freediver 2 hours agorootparentCan you share an example or two of this? reply RavlaAlvar 3 minutes agorootparentI was trying to search the shooting of the united CEO one hour after it happened, and it didn’t show me anything about this news or discussion. reply cube2222 5 hours agoprevNice! Happy user of Kagi for over two years here. Suggestion: it would be cool if the Teams plan included a “personal” plan you can use with a personal account for each member. 1Password does it this way - if you have 1Password at work, you can “link” your personal account to it to get a family plan free of charge - but it’s linked for just this purpose, your employer doesn’t get access to your personal 1Password. This is great to keep professional and personal accounts separate. reply sshine 5 hours agoprevI particularly like the Teams pricing model: - Professional ($10/user/month): Unlimited search - Ultimate ($25/user/month): Unlimited search plus LLMs You can mix and match users on different tiers. So you don't need to splurge on LLMs for everyone. Still, I'm only using Kagi Search and not any of their LLM Agent stuff. I am still waiting for better pay-per-use LLM access, rather than $15-20/mo subs. reply nicce 5 hours agoparent> I am still waiting for better pay-per-use LLM access, rather than $15-20/mo subs. I am from the other side. My LLM bill would be hundreds of dollars in month if I would use APIs but these flat prices really work for me. reply sshine 3 hours agorootparentI don’t know how I could generate that much LLM traffic without building an AI product that drove automated traffic. With current API pricing, my consistent, daily personal use amounts to at most $2-3/mo. reply nicce 2 hours agorootparentIf you work with large input contex all the time, it will quickly add up. reply joshstrange 5 hours agoprevI must be missing a minimum team size? Because if there isn’t one then why would anyone pay for “individual Ultimate” over “Team Ultimate” when they are the same price but you get more with the Team version? reply cube2222 5 hours agoparentI might be blind, so apologies, but could you point at the difference please? Based on a cursory look Team Ultimate is the same as individual Ultimate, feature-wise. reply joshstrange 5 hours agorootparentI guess I'm not clear on if: - AI Assistant with access to leading LLM models, grounded in Kagi Search - Universal access to: - OpenAI - Anthropic - Google - Meta - Mistral Are the same thing or different things. Like do I get their AI Assistant which uses those models under the hood or do I get a web chat interface with those models directly? reply cube2222 3 hours agorootparentYou get a web chat interface with those models directly, both in the individual and team version of ultimate. reply cmeacham98 5 hours agoparentprevI don't see one on the pricing page either: https://kagi.com/pricing?plan=team However, based on that page, the team plan cannot be prepaid annually for a discount, so if you are willing to do that the individual plan is 10% cheaper. reply nicce 5 hours agoparentprevYou pay only for the active users. At least for me the individual and Team Ultimate have exactly the same price? reply timvdalen 4 hours agoprevWhat's the difference? Is it just being able to manage billing in a central place? The actual offering and price seem identical to just giving people their own account, right? reply carlosjobim 1 hour agoparentIsn't that an important difference for enterprise? reply killparty 6 hours agoprev> access to all premium LLMs in the world That's a bold claim reply senko 6 hours agoparentThey list Claude, OpenAI GPT, Mistral, Gemini and Llama: https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/assistant.html#llms-available-... It's a fair assesment, unless you're nitpicking about \"all\" in there. reply paradite 6 hours agoparentprevI would be surprised if at any point in time there are more than 5 LLM providers who are widely considered premium (close to SOTA in my interpretation). reply potamic 5 hours agoprevVery interesting going after enterprise. How do you pitch to a CFO that you now need to pay for a web search license on top of Copilot/AI Assistant or whatever? reply smodo 5 hours agoparentKagi has been slowly positioning itself as the single point of entry for both search and AI. They offer some LLM integrations and are working on making the whole experience well integrated. Not a bad idea, just quite hard to pull off when Microsoft starts pushing Bing and Copilot to their enterprise clients more aggressively. reply carlosjobim 4 hours agoparentprevIn a business setting $10 per month per person is nothing if it increases productivity. reply rustcleaner 5 hours agoprevWould love to use kagi, but they (Google) block Mullvad from specifically the registration page. Anonymity > decent search 8 days a week! reply dewey 2 hours agoparentIf that’s your treat model: fair, but not processing payments if a user is on a VPN is very understandable. You don’t want users to use you as a credit card validation service. reply xvector 6 hours agoprevFunnily enough, deleting all of my raise/pin/lower/block filters dramatically improved the quality of my search results. Enjoying Kagi a lot more now. reply __jonas 5 hours agoparentHuh, how come? That would be a big selling point for Kagi for me, getting rid of w3schools, \"geeksforgeeks\" etc. and have things like MDN pushed to the top without having to specify it in the search query. reply rustcleaner 5 hours agorootparentYes I like that. Let's go further: What Kagi needs is to use AI to figure out what domains are full of 'commercial' activity (buy/cart buttons, ads, telemetry, SEO, login-walls, etc), give those domains a 'commercial' score from 0 to 1, and then when the user slides the Kagi® Commercial Control Slider™ down, nothing with a commelcial score above that point shows up. If the user slides it to zero, the kind of sites which should be the supermajority of results should be the non-commercial non-monetizeable geocities-tier passion project sites built by, and forums frequented by, obsessed autists. It's the only way to fix search: designs which are detectable attempts at monetization should be nerf-able by the user. A new search game must be set up where seeking money kills your site rankings in search. I only care about sites where the webmaster is paying and working to tell me something he cares about, for free, because he is obsessed. No I don't want to buy your stupid product/service, I don't have money to spend and spending it on anything except survival and advancement is counter to my strategic interests. I want autist site and forum results, I do not want marketing-driven money making results... period. If the site makes money, it prima facie doesn't have my interests at heart. This heuristic works really well for me. reply pbronez 5 hours agoparentprevHaha that’s pretty interesting. I only have a very few of these adjustments configured. Mostly I boost sites that I subscribe to. For example, I use this to put Encyclopedia Brittanica results above Wikipedia when the former has a matching article. Similarly, I prefer all3dp results for 3d printing searches. reply jjtheblunt 5 hours agoparentprevExcellent reply hyperknot 5 hours agoprevWhat's the difference between using Kagi and Perplexity? On X everyone talks about Perplexity, on HN, about Kagi. Do they both search -> put results in an LLM as input text? reply bogwog 4 hours agoparentKagi is a regular search engine, like Google. They started to bundle some optional AI features with the subscription, but I personally never use them. Perplexity is yet another AI startup trying to find a way to monetize LLMs. Will they survive when the bubble pops? Idk. Do I trust them with my data? Fuck no. Just look at all the advertising they're investing in and ask yourself how they plan to make that money back. reply hobofan 5 hours agoparentprev> On X everyone talks about Perplexity Must be your X echo chamber. I haven't heard about Perplexity in ages. > Do they both search -> put results in an LLM as input text? No. Kagi does have optional LLM-based answers, but at the core they present as a search engine and not a chatbot like Perplexity. reply hyperknot 4 hours agorootparentProbably. Still, I find Perplexity extremely useful for giving me a one sentence answer based on reading 10 reddit threads. reply Hydrocarb0n 5 hours agoprevI'm a Kagi subscriber, It is good, I am finding myself using perplexity.Ai quite about now it's very good. reply shadowvoxing 4 hours agoprevMore free advertising for Kagi. A little sus they make it on the front page so much. reply sshine 3 hours agoparentWhy suspicious? There is a high alignment with the company and the hacker news demography. reply tstrimple 6 hours agoprevI've moved on from Kagi. Their service is absolutely better than Google, but not at least $120 / year better than Google. Especially when you have to deal with the plugin and private browsing nonsense that introduces a ton of friction. reply frereubu 6 hours agoparentOnce you've set up the plugins and private browsing API keys there's no more friction is there? I found the iOS Safari extension buggy for a bit, but I haven't had any issues for quite a while now. The price does make me wince once in a while though. What are you using instead? reply senko 6 hours agorootparentI'm happy with the price but Firefox randomly logs me out in private mode (maybe after an update? too infrequent to be able to spot the pattern, but it's there), which is a bit annoying. reply frereubu 5 hours agorootparentFunny - I'm using Firefox too and haven't had that issue for quite a while now. I don't search in private mode all that much though. reply senko 5 hours agorootparentI do almost all browsing (except for services where I need to be logged in) from private mode. For the ones where the app needs to know me, I have separate profiles (multi-account containers ftw!). Nothing especially sensitive, I just consider it basic online hygiene. reply tstrimple 5 hours agorootparentprevThat's what I dealt with. It seemed like roughly 50% of the time I'd have to re-auth for private browsing searches. Across multiple devices this becomes even more of a pain in the ass. reply stavros 4 hours agorootparentCan you not just use the URL with the token that signs you in automatically? reply senko 4 hours agorootparentFor some reason you can't just add a custom search engine url to Firefox, you need to have an extension. Kagi has one that swts up the engine and injects the token, but it sometimes breaks so I need to uninstall/install it. Really a minor annoyance tho. reply stavros 4 hours agorootparentOh wow, I forgot about that. I tend to add a bookmark and then make that a search engine, but yeah, that will require you to type the bookmark's character every time. Annoying that you can just add your own engine URL. reply 9Ljdg6p8ZSzejt 3 hours agorootparentThere is this firefox extension I have used before: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/add-custom-se.... It lets you configure a custom search engine, so you could add the Kagi token url to it, and have a logged in search engine in both regular and private browsing. Unlike the kagi extension, I haven't had issues needing to reauth when using it. reply piva00 6 hours agoparentprevI'm completely on the opposite camp, the quality of life I get from using Kagi instead of Google is definitely worth $120 to me. I spend more on some video streaming service and that's purely for entertainment, a search engine is my portal to finding information on the web, that's much more valuable than watching some films and series. I regularly compare results for the same query between Kagi and Google just to check if still makes sense, 18 months in and every single time I do this comparison I feel more validated to pay for it. Of course, totally personal experience but I've got so used to the quality of results from Kagi that Google has become almost unusable in comparison. reply sksrbWgbfK 5 hours agorootparentI'm in the same camp since I subscribed. I became a 10x developer because my search results are way more accurate and I don't waste time anymore when filtering spam. I would estimate that I used to waste 1 hour per day while looking for what I wanted. It's not a cheap tool, but $10 for gaining 20 hours a month is something that I can live with. An AI equivalent would be the JetBrains AI for the same price which seems to be integrated to CLion but I'm still not completely sold about it. reply j_bum 5 hours agorootparentprevWhat field are you in, or what type of searching do you regularly do? I’m also curious about the LLM integration with Kagi. I currently pay for a Claude subscription but would be happy to drop that and pick up the $25/mo Kagi if LLM access was similar. Is there a dedicated chat app? Interface? reply pbronez 5 hours agorootparentThey have a dedicated chat interface at https://kagi.com/assistant You can access this from any search bar by adding !expert to your query. That’s the general case… there’s also !code for development questions and you can create your own more focused flavors. You can provide custom instructions and set up multiple assistant flavors. For example, you can have one that highlights controversial information about a topic, another one that jokes about everything, etc. All the assistants have optional web access. They use Kagi search to look up relevant information for you. You can apply a search lens to restrict web results to particular domains. You can set the assistant to use different LLM APIs. They currently support Anthropic (Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus), OpenAI (GPT 4o, GPT 4 mini), Google (Gemini Pro), Mistral (Pixtral, Large) and Meta (Llama 3.1 405B). Kagi maintains their own LLM benchmark. Their goal is to (1) ensure that models haven’t ever seen the questions before and (2) emphasize reasoning and instruction following, which they’ve found to be most important for the assistant. https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/llm-benchmark.html reply api 6 hours agoprevTwo years with Kagi, sometimes go months without using Google. Stay pure. Kagi plus a few good LLMs (I use local ones via ollama because I do that, and also Claude sometimes) gives you research capabilities that are as good as the pre-enshittification Internet and often better. I use LLMs like brainstorming partners and research assistants and then use Kagi to search for real data to verify results and make sure the LLMs aren't hallucinating. Going back to Google I'm sometimes shocked at how absolute trash it is. I'm sure they're maximizing their internal KPIs. Of course I know the real problem with Google is that I'm not the customer. reply sshine 6 hours agoparentTwo years with Kagi, I never visit Google once. When I install Linux on a new computer, I install Firefox from its package manager, log in with Firefox Sync, and this switches my default search engine to Kagi. So I never once visit Google, not even to download Firefox. I just tried going to Google, and it is simultaneously satisfying and saddening to be met with a cookie disclaimer pop-up: Saddening because I'm reminded that ubiquitous search access comes at the cost of tracking, and satisfying because I never once visited Google on this one-year old computer (after which the pop-up disappears). reply dantyti 4 hours agorootparent>search access comes at the cost of tracking don't you have your identity (through payments) tied with every search query you make when using kagi? reply sshine 3 hours agorootparentYes, but I trust them. Specifically, I trust the CEO and founder. If I didn’t trust anyone, I’d visit DuckDuckGo using uBlock Origin via a Mullvad VPN paid for with coinjoined crypto. reply stavros 4 hours agorootparentprevThey'd have to show a cookie banner if they tracked you, so, unless they're breaking the law, no. reply ryan-duve 5 hours agorootparentprevWhich Linux distributions are you installing on a new computer that doesn't come with Firefox installed already? reply sshine 3 hours agorootparentDefault NixOS using the graphical installer. reply ElectricalUnion 4 hours agorootparentprevNot OP but Raspbian afaik is one such distro. reply berdon 5 hours agoparentprevWhen I accidentally use Google I’m instantly surprised and delirious. The difference in both search quality and advertisements is astounding. Been using Kagi since its beta and I’ve never used Google intentionally since. reply neoromantique 3 hours agoprevDropped Kagi after being a happy user and annoying all my friends about it for years. Sadly integration with Yandex is a deal breaker and a total violation of trust, sad. reply alde 5 hours agoprev [–] Stopped paying for Kagi after finding out that they are using Yandex for some part of the search results and are paying Yandex 2% of their revenue for that. For the unaware, Yandex Search is tightly integrated with the Kremlin. reply lolinder 4 hours agoparent(Locked) discussion on the Kagi feedback page: https://kagifeedback.org/d/5445-reconsider-yandex-integratio... Apparently this has been happening for a long time but only recently drew attention when they announced integrating images. The founder cites the 2% number as if it's supposed to make it all okay, but when it comes to principled objection to funding Russian propaganda, it's hard to argue that we should be okay as long as the number per subscriber is small. I've been a Kagi subscriber from the beginning and am up for renewal, and I've got to say here (since I can't say so there now that it's locked) that this is giving me pause. I've fought back against boycotting Russian-founded companies before (anyone remember when JetBrains came under fire?), but this is Yandex, not some little company that happens to have a Russian founder. Edit: I just want to draw attention to the fact that this subthread was the top comment and now has been downranked to the bottom. Whether that was moderator action or algorithmic, I disagree with the decision. reply 7373737373 4 hours agorootparentVery good point about the lack of principled objection - that's pretty much anyone needs to know about this business - if they put anything else (in this case the idea of \"being the best search\") - over doing the right thing, it doesn't deserve to exist. When a founder's/owner's moral attitude is this unprincipled, supporting their company will only make the problem worse. \"Immorality scales with the business\". We are seeing this with Reddit and fake users. Kagi owners, employees and (prospective) users should ask themselves: \"what good would even the best search engine be, if the world is already corrupted?\" You will find what you support. reply bilekas 4 hours agoparentprevWow I didn't know this .. and I just recently started a paid subscription. I'll have to cancel it now but that is a real shame. reply dyml 4 hours agoparentprevVery unfortunate and caused me to cancel my subscription immediately. Any alternatives that people can recommend to someone who throughly enjoyed Kagi? I really hope they reconsider their arrangement. reply carlosjobim 2 hours agorootparentI heard Yandex has pretty good search results. reply rustcleaner 4 hours agoparentprevConsidering I am highly skeptical of the western elite apparatus today, this is positive news to me. Yandex beats Bing (ddg) hands-down and gives Google a run for its money. reply Veen 4 hours agorootparentIt is prudent to be skeptical of the \"western elite apparatus\", but it is positively insane to consider the Russian apparatus preferable. I understand why some people dislike their government and country, but I don't understand why doing so makes them blind to the even more egregious failings of other states. reply 7373737373 4 hours agoparentprevShameful, I will not be renewing my subscription if they don't change this. reply Thinkx220 4 hours agoparentprevThanks for the heads up. I will probably begin paying for Kagi now. Yandex is far less censored than Google and less of my data will flow into US intelligence services. reply F7F7F7 4 hours agorootparentKremlin vs Capitol Hill. It’s not the coin flip you want us to think it is. With that being said, I’m still a big fan of Kagi. reply Thinkx220 4 hours agorootparentIt's a non issue if you don't live in Russia. Also not a coin flip. If you are outside of Russia using Russian based services is objectively better. reply skeeter2020 4 hours agorootparentyou pay for a service, which in turn pays for a Russian service, which is in bed with the Kremlin and used as a propaganda machine for an invasion of a sovereign nation. The two-step may be convenient for you but depending where you land it is definitely an issue, even if you don't live in Russia. reply TeMPOraL 31 minutes agorootparentBe thankful that it's not China doing the invasion, because you'd all have to stop buying anything except maybe local produce, and boycott all brands, foreign and domestic alike, because approximately everything is ultimately made in Chinese factories, thus contributing money to the Chinese government and its propaganda machine. reply JumpCrisscross 4 hours agorootparentprev> non issue if you don't live in Russia You really think the CIA has no use for non-American rubes? reply simion314 4 hours agorootparentprev>It's a non issue if you don't live in Russia.

What’s the source for that? This was a good nudge to check in on how close Yandex is to the Russian government. Answer: way closer than they were 5 years ago. Russia basically nationalized them, and routinely modifies search results to align with the government’s preferences. https://www.zois-berlin.de/en/publications/zois-spotlight/th... reply jks 4 hours agorootparentThe Kagi founder mentions 2% in a response to a feedback thread https://kagifeedback.org/d/5445-reconsider-yandex-integratio... reply Trasmatta 4 hours agoparentprevThank you, I was about to subscribe until I read this.

After lengthy negotiations and in the face of mounting political and legal pressure, in February 2024 Yandex announced the sale of its business in Russia to an investment fund consisting of investors with close ties to the Kremlin I'm sure the Kagi team is reading this thread: you need to seriously reconsider your business relationship with the Kremlin. I somehow doubt the quality of your search is so dependent on that one search provider to make the (apparent) 2% of subscription prices worth it. reply yesfitz 4 hours agoparentprevWhat do you use instead? reply drakonka 4 hours agoparentprevThank you; I've been a subscriber and missed this news.

It's not wrong to point out that the reasoning used to diss Kagi because of Yandex association is knee-jerk nonsense, because following a principled argument would lead one to making much harder changes to their purchasing choices. reply carlosjobim 55 minutes agorootparentprevBecause the alternatives are American in this case. Also \"whataboutism\" is a bizarre expression and a bizarre argument. reply lolinder 4 hours agorootparentprev [–] I'm concerned that they're paying Yandex—I have friends in Ukraine and friends that wish they could safely be home in Ukraine, and I can't fund a company that is complicit in Putin's wartime propaganda that seeks to keep the Russian people on board with his brutal invasion of my friends' country. It would help somewhat if the founder could clarify whether funds are going to Yandex Russia or the newly split-off Nebius. If it's the latter I could at least satisfy myself that I believe the companies to be sufficiently distinct. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "title": "I spent a year building an Android course for the elderly",
    "originLink": "https://kopiascsaba.hu/blog/teaching-elderly-people-to-use-android/",
    "originBody": "Home Blog About Services Portfolio Testimonials Contact Social Home Blog About Services Portfolio Testimonials Contact Social Teaching Elderly People to Use Android - Lessons Learned This is my story about an adventure into online teaching, video course making, and choosing a hard-to-reach audience, who desperately needs help. The Story The story began one day when one of my elderly relatives asked me to help her with something she couldn’t achieve on her Android smartphone—sending a photo or something similarly mundane. It was not the first time my help was needed, and surely it wouldn’t be the last. I thought: isn’t there a course that teaches beginners how to use their phones? I would like to teach her how to fish instead of just giving her fish here and there. It turned out there wasn’t. I know many elderly people among my acquaintances who struggle with basic smartphone “operations”: Sending a photo? Installing an app? What I found is, that often, it’s not even these tasks that are the problem, but something deeper: feeling paralyzed or humiliated by the interface. Many struggle to understand when they can scroll, swipe, or long-tap, among other gestures. And of course, apps, file management, and all the bells and whistles are even more intimidating to some. As I pondered this, I thought: why not create one myself? So I did. The Work I would have never guessed that it would be this much work to create a video course. But in the end: I wrote a detailed 400-page script. I spent crazy amounts of time shooting different phones and accessories (ports, buttons, how to charge, etc.). I recorded the “talking head” segments—my talking head. I captured all the classes as screen recordings. I recorded all the audio dubs that were needed. I edited all of these together (insane amount of work). Meanwhile, I learned the fundamentals of the film industry (lighting, audio, setup, post-processing, editing…). I built a complete Android app (in Flutter, which I love) with 11 chapters of exercises covering menus, text editing, gestures, etc. Publishing wasn’t easy either. Countless hoops, registrations, copywriting, verifications, logos, images, icons, styles, and brainstorming were needed before it was ready for consumption. (Appstore, Course page, Ads, etc.) It took about a year of full-time work, resulting in around 100 classes spanning 8+ hours. I enjoyed most of it, as I like editing media and batch processing. It was also fun. The Idea The idea is to teach elderly people how to use an Android device without any prior knowledge. I don’t assume they know how to turn it on, or which button is the power button, or how to tap a button or scroll. Nothing. Tools I used Davinci Resolve to edit the videos and FFmpeg heavily to mass-normalize audio. By the way, I wrote a 34-page long intro to ffmpeg for complete beginners as well, if you are interested in such rabbit holes:) Since I needed a lot of intros and titles, I created a script to batch render a Fusion composition from Davinci Resolve. Oh boy, scripting Davinci is no fun. Struggles and their solutions One thing became apparent: marketing the course would be extremely hard. It’s a catch-22. Most of my audience can’t “register” or “pay online”, so reaching this very important group—who lack much IT knowledge (the very thing I aim to improve)—is quite a challenge. I quickly realized that while I am a software engineer, I am not a salesperson. Creating headlines, and advertisements, and using advanced tools like Facebook/Google Ads Manager is quite a task, and it’s outside my expertise. In theory, there’s a great audience for this course, but reaching them will be a challenge. There were interesting moments as well. I gave out free coupons in Facebook groups but found only bots. Also, when Facebook decided they wanted my ID card to verify my account, I closed the ads account. Reasons. Boundaries. Avoiding the Chicken-Egg Problem Creating the course’s table of contents and determining the order of topics was very tricky. I couldn’t assume any prior knowledge; I had to assume the student knew nothing. I couldn’t just say, “Open the contacts application,” because the user might be missing many prerequisites, such as: “Yeah, but my phone isn’t on. How do I turn it on?” “Yeah, but my screen is black. How do I turn it on?” “Yeah, but I see this (the lock screen) and can’t get past it.” “Yeah, but what is an app? How do I find it? How do I start it?” “Yeah, but how do I interact with this piece of glass in front of me? What do I touch? What do I grab? What do I swipe?” You see? I had to break down the entire dependency tree and create a linear progression of easy-to-follow, understandable steps. And there are factors, that complicate things: Setup wizard you say? Each phone manufacturer has a different “setup wizard” when you first turn on your phone. You’d think that’s all right, you are used to it (assuming a tech-savvy reader), but there are many among us for whom it’s not so obvious. I might show an example, but if it looks different for them, or the questions are in different order they will have a harder time to follow. In the end, I decided to show them 4 different examples, and by the end of that they’d see the most important questions and get “the hang of it”. Launcher app Many manufacturers change the launcher app, so the app list might come from the bottom, from the left, or who knows where. Handling icons is customized as well. I needed to show multiple examples and explain in detail how to find how theirs work, as I can’t possibly know. Trying to teach fishing here… Overall L+F, settings app Also, many manufacturers customize the settings app or the overall look and feel, that is just enough to make it hard to follow. For the settings app, I trusted that they’d be able to find the search and search for the key parts. But I also showed them where that setting is generally. Installing the companion app Also, since they don’t yet know how to install an app, they can’t install the companion app either. But the companion app would be an essential tool for them to freely exercise, a playground where they are safe to experiment, and where they get explanations and tutorials on the most essential skills, such as typing, gestures, menus, sharing, and so on. Here I had two options, since it is quite early in the course where I already show and would encourage them to use the companion app. The first option is to ask them to ask someone who is in “in the know” already, to install the app. Even more, on the course page’s “gift” section, I explain to the potential client how to prepare, so that their loved one can learn easily and uninterruptedly. So hopefully, they already get it if their children buy it for them, or they can ask someone to help them just a little with this. But, if that fails, the fallback is the good old “click here, tap here, do this, do that”. Can’t do much more with this. I showed them how to install the companion app, but I can’t give any explanation yet as they are not there yet. Naming the course Originally, I called the course “Android From Zero”. How clever, right? Yeah, nope. It turns out it is a double self-sabotage. First, my audience probably has no idea what “Android” is (at all, let alone in our context). Will your grandma ever search for “How to use Android”? My guess is no. Even if she did, there was no chance she would find my course. The search term “Android” + “course” is so packed because everyone creates courses on how to develop for Android. Java, Kotlin, Flutter, and other technologies and their fans are all competing in this space. Aiming at users instead of developers mentioning any of that is impossible. Hosting Initially, I chose Udemy. It’s a safe, easy solution with a huge user base. I couldn’t deal with the complications of self-hosting back then. While I benefited from its platform, not many people found the course. Also, Udemy’s huge price cuts made it a joke business-wise. Moreover, Udemy limits advertising opportunities and provides poor analytics. For instance, it truncated external search terms, so I would see “google.com,” but the important details were missing. Come on! The result Today, the course is called Smartphone How-To, and it is hosted at https://smartphonehowto.com. Since I need to target the elderly audience separately from their children, there is a page just for them that shows why this course can help their parents: https://smartphonehowto.com/gift. I truly believe there are millions of elderly people out there who could benefit from this course, which teaches them step by step—from unboxing to using apps—how to operate their Android smartphones. If you have parents or grandparents who struggle with smartphones, or if you have suggestions on how I can improve the marketing for this course, I’d love to hear your feedback! Cheers!

Just a couple first impressions from your site... loading it on a phone, the first thing I see is this: https://imgur.com/4maP1vV (1) The entire contents of the site is completely covered by a cookie warning. This is honestly quite annoying even for an SWE like me, never mind your target audience. I know at least one older person who doesn't understand these cookie modals at all and refuses to touch them. They either continue using the site in the background without accepting/rejecting(!), or if that's not possible they just leave the site. I'd suggest you carefully check whether you actually need this modal at all. If the only cookies you use are technically necessary, then (based on my layman understanding of the law) you don't need to show it. If you absolutely must use tracking cookies, then maybe consider a more subtle approach that allows the user to continue reading the page without deciding. (2) \"Join Now\" makes it sound like I'm signing up to a subscription, rather than making a one-off payment. reply kcsaba2 18 hours agoparentThank you so much for the feedback, that pesky banner indeed. I have fixed both issues. I mean the banner is still annoying, but way smaller. reply cruffle_duffle 18 hours agoparentprevPeople should just stop including those warnings. Unless they are a google, FB or some other juicy politically rich target for the EU to make an example of, they are a complete waste of time. Nobody is going to hassle you about it. reply Jaxan 5 hours agorootparentOr they just stop with all this nonsense by not having third party tracking cookies in the first place. Legitimate usage of cookies doesn’t need such a banner. reply codazoda 14 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately, this isn’t true. There is at least one organization out there launching privacy suits to extract settlements from small players. reply tommica 13 hours agorootparentWow... Do you know the orgs name? reply atoav 11 hours agorootparentI am just going to leave this here: https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ Yeah, you better comply. And it is also pretty simple — if you don't so anything that requires that you get informed consent from your users you don't need to ask them. Each combination of personal datum and purpose requires such consent if it isn't a strictly needed purpose (legitimate interest). Example: If you have an online shop you can e.g. collect someones address for the purpose of shipping — if they order and enter there address the user implicitly gave you their informed consent that they agree to you using that address to ship the product to them. Logical: when they order and pay money it can be assumed they want to give their address for that purpose. They did not give you consent to sell that same address off to the highest bidder. If that is what you need to do, you would have to explicitly ask them to whom you want to sell that data and what they plan to do with it — same data, but different purpose. Not legitimate interest since you don't strictly need to do that to sell a product. And you better have a clear wording describing that purpose otherwise you collected uninformed consent and that is worth zlich. If you feel like you need to trick users into agreeing, that is what the law aims to prevent. IP adresses and such have also been ruled personal data. Server side logging for technical purposes is legitimate interest, but storing the same data anywhere (not only cookies!) for the purpose of ad tracking requires you to get the users informed consent before collecting the data. You can assume that if it can be used to personally identify a user in a sea of users, it is personal data, even if it needs to be used in conjunction with other data to reach that identifiability. Also: if there is a million \"No\" switches with two menu layers and one green \"Accept\" button: you created a nice toy there, but it didn't gather informed concent from your user and is therefore utterly useless. Informed consent must be given freely. If you make one easier than the other it hasn't been given freely. If you visually code one as the good/default and the other as the bad/meaningless/complicated choice, the choice was not made freely. Play stupid games, win stupid prices. The law is pretty clear on all that, lived reality hasn't cought up yet and people pay real money for that. I recommend that you just read the law, it is probably worth to read instead of copying what everybody else (including the big ones) are doing. reply meigwilym 7 hours agorootparentBut isn't the cookie banner for asking permission to use third party cookies? I don't think I ever have seen a cookie banner asking if I agree to my data being sold. reply noirscape 6 hours agorootparentWhy do you think website operators want to place those third party cookies on your PC? There's only one legitimate use for them, which is for ancient corporate login workflows that shouldn't exist anymore. Every other use of them generally is just for targeted advertising, and with it sale of data, or using them for internal analytics. Usually they don't really mention the selling data part upfront; it's hidden somewhere in the giant modals that they make you click through. There's also the related problem that Google is an information guzzler, and anything that enters it's ecosystem has a chance to get used by them for advertising, meaning that these giant modals also get shown for webpages that use Analytics. That last one is how you often see sites without ads get those giant modals. Arguably they should've been blocked by the user agent years ago, and Mozilla has already done so. Google however cannot do so with Chrome because of their conflict of interest in the ad market; the UK has determined that if Chrome kills third party cookies, all their replacements would just punt Google into unfair competition. It's probably the strongest argument I can think of as to why Chrome should be split off from Google - a browser that cannot meaningfully protect a user against bad actors because of the operator being a monopolist bad actor shouldn't be used at all. Mere (same site) login cookies require no modals or confirmation since the user implicitly consents to them when they authenticate (most users expect their login to be preserved when they changes pages and/or reload the site.) That said, it's still considered a courtesy/good practice to inform users before placing them regardless. reply lancesells 2 hours agorootparentI would imagine 95% of cookies are not selling data but giving your data away in exchange for the other services. 1. Because they are using GA4 feeding info to Google. 2. Because they have some advertising pixel / api set up feeding info to Meta. I would guess sites like Hubspot, Salesforce, or Github might actually be selling data. reply atoav 6 hours agorootparentprevYeah but the law didn't invent cookie banners, people who (intentionally mis-)interpreting the law did. Then in the public eye it got reduced to \"You need a cookie banner\" and people jumped on the bandwagon, because other sides had them so apparently you need to have them too. Many of those cookie banners are factually at odds with current EU law. But hey everything is a cargo cult these days. Legally the law is just: You have to ask for informed consent that has to be given freely for each purpose. How you ask and how you inform is not defined precisely, except for negative examples what isn't considered informed consent or freely given consent etc. If someone just clicks \"Accept All\" that person wasn't informed. So cool that you made them click, but you could also just have left it away, since it didn't give you the thing the law required you to get. That means real datahogs would probably need to inform people in a many slides long presentation or a feature length film before they could actually get even close to receiving something resembling informed consent. That is ofc totally unpractical and would hurt their business of data-hogging. Now the EU came at this with the base assumption that prvacy is a right that needs to be protected in a way that it cannot be simply given away without informed free consent. So if it hurts databogs, that is one of the intended side effects. If my friends Pizza place wants to put ads onto my website that is entirely possible without any tracking he can give me a JPEG or a video and I put it onto my website as static content.

Neither did about half of the millennials, so why don't they need similar help? I don't think the qualifier is age, rather it is prior computer experience. I am elderly, and only started using a smartphone (as opposed to feature phone) about four years ago, but I have had my hands on computer keyboards for over 50 years, so learning to use all the basic features of a smartphone didn't require any help. Likewise, many millennials did grow up using computers. If you already understand basics on a PC like bootup, shutdown, login, system settings, installing a program, starting a program, finding a program, copy/paste, upload/download, the smartphone should not present much of a challenge. Otherwise, learning a smartphone is mostly just learning how to use a computer. reply VyseofArcadia 5 hours agoprevWhat I have discovered about teaching[0] is that some people just don't want to learn the fundamental interaction principles.

Long-press to turn on a powered-off phone is not a standard. Even I don't know how to turn these devices on, so I do a combination of multiple short presses, multiple long presses until it works. Powering the phone off via the button won't work on modern phones, since the hardware power button has become the tool to invoke an assistant. You need to swipe down the notifications twice and use the software power button from there. In this room I have 6 Android devices from different manufacturers. Then there are so many OS differences between all the vendors, that it becomes almost impossible to teach someone who doesn't know how Android generally works if it isn't on their own device. But I congratulate him for doing these videos and hope that the elderly manage to learn from the course. reply piltdownman 6 hours agoparent// Powering the phone off via the button won't work on modern phones, since the hardware power button has become the tool to invoke an assistant. ALL versions of Android OS allows you to set the power button back to power on long-press - you just have to go back into settings to change it; although the Pixel range had a recent update change to Gemini as default. Similar to the double-tap for quick camera. reply qwertox 1 minute agorootparentI prefer it this way, long press = assistant, double press = camera. And I believe that the elderly would also prefer this, if they do actively use an assistant to ask questions. I have hot-word detection turned off, so I think the button is a good compromise. reply kelvinjps10 3 hours agoparentprevIf you press it long enough, it will shutdown, even if you didn't touch anything in the assistant. reply qwertox 5 minutes agorootparentI just held it for around 25 seconds on a Pixel 8 and it did nothing (except for starting the assistant). I think if you hold it even longer then it does some kind of reset, which isn't a clean shutdown. I don't mind the repurposing of the power button. I prefer it being used for something else, since I don't power it off very often. The only thing which bothers me a bit in the repurposed state is that the power-off menu includes an emergency button, which is now hidden behind a couple of levels of swiping and clicking. And accessing it from the lock screen again varies among vendors. reply Dalewyn 11 hours agoparentprev>the hardware power button has become the tool to invoke an assistant.

(I was a little late, not until my mid thirties.) I especially love reading manuals from the things I purchased. However, I noticed that a lot of people my age didn't share my interest in this area. I helped as often as they would let me, but to a man, they just weren't willing to take the time to get interested. They just wanted their stuff to work. They also had no idea of all the features their products were capable of performing. (Cellphone anyone?)

I can't imagine my mum would use anything other than Play and Chrome, so it feels a little 'too far' for me, confusion for the sake of it? Also a suggestion - pretty much everyone uses WhatsApp in the UK, mostly everyone I know will be in a WhatsApp group with their parents (and/or grandparents!). Definitely worth adding that as a module! reply kcsaba2 18 hours agoparentThank you! Yeah, you are partly right about that (they are not there for confusion's sake).

I don't know of any higher authority on what to call it actually. Technically that \"app\" (it is an android app just like any other) is called a launcher, i went with desktop, but I also like home screen, and I think I probably use these terms interchangeably in the course.

Others have more smartphone experience and I think I use the words home screen (my mom I think) and start screen (my grandma). It's like you mention a word and see how they react to it: do they get what concept you're referring to from the word's components? Do they repeat it back to you later, did it stick, or do they at least understand it the next time you say it?

The bribery scheme helped McKinsey and McKinsey Africa net approximately $85 million in profits, the DOJ said. Prosecutors also unsealed a guilty plea by Vikas Sagar, a former senior partner at McKinsey who worked in the subsidiary's South African office and participated in the yearslong bribery scheme. This photograph shows a logo of American multinational corporation McKinsey & Company on the first day of the Mobile World Congress (MWC), the telecom industry's biggest annual gathering, in Barcelona on February 26, 2024. Pau BarrenaAfpGetty Images A subsidiary of top global consulting firm McKinsey & Company agreed to pay nearly $123 million to settle claims that it bribed government officials in South Africa, the U.S. Department of Justice said Thursday. Federal prosecutors also unsealed a 2022 guilty plea by Vikas Sagar, a former senior partner at McKinsey who worked in the subsidiary's South Africa office. Sagar, 56, of Johannesburg, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, to one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The subsidiary, McKinsey Africa, paid bribes to officials at two state-controlled utility companies in South Africa between 2012 and 2016 in order to secure lucrative consulting contracts, the DOJ said in a press release. Prosecutors said McKinsey Africa obtained confidential information from the two companies, Transnet SOC Ltd. and Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., about the contracts during the bidding process. Then it submitted multimillion-dollar consulting engagement proposals, knowing that other South African consulting firms it had partnered with would pay part of their fees as bribes to Transnet and Eskom officials, the DOJ said. The bribery scheme helped McKinsey and McKinsey Africa net approximately $85 million in profits, according to prosecutors. McKinsey Africa has entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ related to a criminal charging document, called an information, charging McKinsey Africa with one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, prosecutors said. The deferred prosecution agreement requires McKinsey Africa to accept responsibility for the allegations. \"McKinsey Africa engaged in a serious and long-running bribery scheme to secure contracts by corrupting government officials,\" Chad Yarbrough, assistant director of the FBI Criminal Investigative Division, said in the press release. \"This misconduct is a blatant violation of law and a breach of public trust. No matter what country the crime occurs in, the FBI will always work closely with our international partners to root out corruption,\" said Yarbough. \"McKinsey welcomes the resolution of these matters and the closure of this regretful situation,\" McKinsey Africa said in a statement Thursday. \"McKinsey is a very different firm today than when these matters first took place,\" the subsidiary said, adding, \"We fired Mr. Sagar soon after learning of these issues, returned our fees with interest, cooperated with the authorities, and made significant upgrades to our risk, legal, and compliance controls to ensure McKinsey sets the standard across our profession.\" Read more CNBC politics coverage Wealthy Americans are still ducking the IRS crackdown on non-filers Executives seek more protection after killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Thompson, says risk management firm Kroll McKinsey unit will pay $123 million to settle claims it bribed South African officials UnitedHealthcare CEO slaying suspect may have taken bus from Atlanta to New York 'Deny,' 'defend,' 'depose': UnitedHealthcare CEO killing shell casings had words written on them Subscribe to CNBC PRO Subscribe to Investing Club Licensing & Reprints CNBC Councils Select Personal Finance CNBC on Peacock Join the CNBC Panel Supply Chain Values Select Shopping Closed Captioning Digital Products News Releases Internships Corrections About CNBC Ad Choices Site Map Podcasts Careers Help Contact News Tips Got a confidential news tip?

    "commentBody": "McKinsey unit will pay $123M to settle claims it bribed South African officials (cnbc.com)171 points by donsupreme 22 hours agohidepastfavorite120 comments languagehacker 22 hours ago\"McKinsey is a very different firm today than when these matters first took place\" No they are most certainly not. Corruption is in McKinsey's DNA. Outside of the specific harms that McKinsey has caused across the country and across the world, management consulting groups in general have been utilized to sidestep legal protections against corporations within a shared industry colluding against each other. Companies like McKinsey, Bain, Accenture, etc., have been instrumental in the rapid increase of executive compensation, flat comp for workers compared to inflation, intentionally unsafe practices and corner-cutting to save money, and just generally creating as many negative externalities as possible in the name of feeding the beast that Milton Friedman created with his rhetoric about the primacy of the shareholder. A good read on this topic is \"When McKinsey Comes to Town\" by Forsyth and Bogdanich. There's a whole chapter dedicated to the South African bribery scandal. Sagar was not just a bad apple -- the company itself is the rot. reply chasd00 16 hours agoparentAh McKinsey, my favorite story was from my sister who worked there some years ago.

Unfortunately we are unlikely to see accountability locally for whoever actually paid this bribe. The background is that this was part of the program of State Capture enabled by our former president (Jacob Zuma) and a very dubious family from India: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gupta_family. Our country was basically sold to the highest bidder - people speak of 'ten lost years'. reply DAGdug 19 hours agoparentWonder if Rajat Gupta, the former CEO of McKinsey who was incarcerated for sharing insider information, and the corrupt Gupta family, were connected in any way (they’re from the same inbred trading caste in India, a country that is sadly notoriously corrupt). reply hilux 14 hours agorootparentAFAIK, they are not. Gupta is a very common name in India, and Rajat Gupta is from West Bengal. reply fakedang 10 hours agorootparentprevBarring the insider trading case (where Rajat Gupta was largely an smaller accomplice to most of Rajaratnam's scheme), Rajat's rags to riches story is actually extremely inspiring.

Probably why it wasn't even hard to pass the law. reply ip26 18 hours agorootparentWhy? The explanation I've heard before is that when you need anything from a thoroughly corrupt government, as simple as a building permit or a visa for a foreign employee involved in a project, officials will simply not process your request without a bribe. They believe it is owed. End of story. I don't like the explanation in the slightest. But I do see how it might shut down opportunity if you can't overpower the obstacles, and aren't willing to bribe. The utility of US laws against bribing foreign officials is to break down the expectation by those officials of a bribe. But, from a game theory point of view, if China is willing to bribe, this becomes much less effective. reply unix_fan 16 hours agorootparentThe same happens in Latin America as well. If you want to get through the layers of bureaucracy without being stuck for years in a process, you have to pay up. And it has to be a well-connected government official. That’s mostly the reason I don’t bother with anything entrepreneurship related here. reply chasd00 16 hours agorootparentprevYou can’t put a house over your head and food in your kid’s plate with morals. reply highcountess 15 hours agorootparentprevBecause there is no mechanism in basically all of Africa that would put some kind of limit on it. No strong governmental institutions, no moral framework, no religious framework. And to the contrary, the African continent is largely antithetical to western/European moral, ethical, and philosophical limitations. People just assume Africans are the same as Europeans and Asians, etc. because they’ve had it hammered into their minds all their lives, but reality is that we are all quite different and that’s good in some ways and bad in others, but it’s different. reply abdulhaq 9 hours agorootparentErr totally wrong the entire north Africa has strong religious frameworks, and take Egypt as an example of a powerful government. Plenty of other places too. reply blackhawkC17 8 hours agorootparentPowerful government doesn’t imply strong institutions that uphold rule of law.

We are not talking about North Africa here, we are talking about South Africa and South Africa like places, which would mean sub-Saharan Africa, not Egypt or Algeria or Tunisia. You lack refinement and do not contribute anything useful, and may want to reflect on why you have that contrarian compulsion. No one is talking about North Africa. All the intelligent people here know we are talking about Africa in the context of South Africa.

Certainly not the lawmakers reply sharpshadow 22 hours agoprevAmazing the punishment is a bribe itself. reply some_random 20 hours agoparentDo you genuinely believe that fines are the same as bribes? reply simpaticoder 16 hours agorootparentI never really thought about it, but yes, a fine without an admission of guilt is precisely a bribe. Consider the trade: you pay X dollars and in return they bury whatever evidence they have against you and you don't go to jail. Doesn't that describe a bribe to a cop or a judge or a prosecutor? As a corrallary I find it interesting that the media reports fines not as a fraction of net worth, but rather as an absolute amount. Clearly this serves the interest of both briber (who wants to be seen as punished more than it is) and the bribee (who wants the revenue, no matter how little it harms the briber). reply which 19 hours agorootparentprevWhen a decently sized percentage of it goes to \"independent monitors\" almost entirely run by ex-DOJ revolving door types, yeah. See https://www.forbes.com/global/2010/0607/companies-payoffs-wa... And some think that FCPA enforcement and huge fines targeted at European companies like BNP Paribas motivated the creation of the EU tech extortion apparatus. reply some_random 19 hours agorootparentIf you're going to argue that then it's not a bribe it's extortion which is very much a different thing. reply diffeomorphism 4 hours agorootparentprevThe fines are more public. But low fines are otherwise pretty indistinguishable from \"here is some money for you to look elsewhere\". As explained in other threads, McKinsey made almost the same amount of profit (adjusted for inflation) as the fine. So the message is: - the effective fine (profit minus fine) is approximately 0, if you get caught. - if you don't get caught, you get a profit of 120M. reply therobot24 22 hours agoparentprevpayment isn't bad, just need to make sure everyone gets their cut reply curtis3389 19 hours agoprevRemember the name McKinsey.

Plenty of companies do actions (like Uber) where they lose money for market share. So, penalizing McKinsey by making them forfeit profit isn't as big a punishment as it may seem. It's a bit akin to if you were to steal a car, sell it, pay yourself a fee for that action and then have to return any money beyond that fee to the owner of the car. It's clearly a net gain for you still. reply FactKnower69 19 hours agorootparentprevapply your critical thinking skills before posting. $85M in 2014 dollars is $113M in 2024 dollars, and something tells me McKinsey didn't just leave the money sitting in a high yield savings account all this time reply some_random 18 hours agorootparentOh so still less than the $123M fine? As for what they did with the money, I get the point that they could have reinvested it and made additional profit but I find it way too speculative to be worth discussion especially when the $85M number doesn't appear to be the marginal value of the bribe and is possibly inflated already. reply swifthesitation 21 hours agoprevWhen the settlement cost is just the price of doing business... you know they made many times more than the fine. reply paulddraper 21 hours agoparentYou think they made more than $123M profit from this??

Unless you're talking about other hypothetical bribes that we don't know about. reply lesuorac 19 hours agorootparentMixture of time value of money and interest/inflation. You take that 85 Million and invest it (likely into growing a business unit but lets ignore that) and over 10 years it becomes greater than 85 million. reply brailsafe 16 hours agorootparentprevI might be splitting hairs here, but they say $85M in profit, not revenue, so presumably that would be margin on top of whatever they paid people to do nothing, and the fine is a portion of revenue that otherwise wouldn't have gone to them, of which $85M was profit. Otherwise though, McKinsey was awarded $209M in federal gov contracts in Canada over 12 years, so the numbers themselves don't seem relatively outrageous in terms of what McKinsey makes news for. reply FactKnower69 19 hours agorootparentprev$85M in 2014 dollars is $113M in 2024 dollars, and something tells me McKinsey didn't just leave the money sitting in a high yield savings account all this time reply pluc 21 hours agoparentprevIt's a fee not a fine reply londons_explore 8 hours agoprevSo why is this money paid to the US government?

They're usually pervasively, profoundly corrupt across many levels and will often actively encourage a culture of massive bribes by creating a regulatory environment so stifling that no other means of getting any project or major process done exists. Often they'll simply ignore their own laws to stop investment projects until someone coughs up money on an extra-official basis. I'm not talking about these governments honestly and in good faith creating and applying regulations for the well-being of their own nation.

It's a good question to ask why Chinese companies are allowed to get business in Africa with bribery, and the US then doesn't allow its companies to compete on a level playing field with China. Why should the US take a stance at all? Why not let South Africa deal with it? It's not harming the US, is it? reply vkou 15 hours agorootparentForeign companies bribing foreign officials who operate in the US can also be sanctioned. And if they don't operate in the US, it's not the US's business to police something a company that has no presence in it does. It's very simple and consistent. Americans and American companies are subject to American laws. People and companies who are in America are also subject to American laws. If you are neither American nor in America, you are not. Nearly every country in the world follows a very similar set of rules regarding jurisdiction. reply tzs 6 hours agorootparentThat doesn't really address the question they asked, which is more about whether or not it should be illegal rather than whether or not it is consistent. Your earlier comment justified it being illegal on the grounds that US companies bribing foreign governments is anti-competitive against other US companies that do not do so. That's an economic justification, not a moral justification. But if we are considering it economically rather than morally then we do have to consider what happens in the case of a foreign country where bribery is common and there are companies other than US companies that are competing there. In that case not allowing US companies to bribe does indeed level competition among US companies--they all lose equally to non-US companies. Is that actually a better economic outcome than allowing US companies to bribe (and thus compete with foreign companies) in countries where bribery is normal? That's a complicated question. It also might be a national security question if we continue heading into a new cold war kind of world. Is it better to have US companies operating in countries the US would like to influence even if those companies have to bribe to do so, or for US companies to stay out and cede influence to companies from countries on the others sides of that cold war? reply crazygringo 4 hours agorootparentprev> Nearly every country in the world follows a very similar set of rules regarding jurisdiction. Actually, no. As a general principle, countries do not pass/enforce laws regarding potential criminal activity that their citizens commit against citizens of other countries while in those other countries. To take an extreme example, if you murder a citizen of a foreign country while in that foreign country, your home country is generally not going to charge you with murder. If you come back home, they may extradite you to that foreign country at that country's request, since you broke the law there. But because you were in the foreign country and the victim was also foreign, it's not within domestic jurisdiction. Laws against bribes paid abroad break this rule. And in 2022 it was found that only two countries in the world actively enforce bribery outside their borders -- the US and Switzerland [1]. So no, your assertion that this is how nearly every country in the world operates, is completely false. It's actually a gigantic exception.

Zuckerberg - by open-sourcing these powerful models, he's effectively commoditising AI while Meta's real business model remains centred around their social platforms. They can leverage these models to enhance Facebook and Instagram's services while simultaneously benefiting from the community improvements and attention. It's not about selling AI; it's about using AI to strengthen their core business. By making it open, they get the benefits of widespread adoption and development without needing to monetise the models directly. reply paxys 1 hour agoprevBenchmarks - https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1h85ld5/comment...

Hype!! reply 85392_school 1 hour agoparentFYI, due to Llama's naming scheme, there is no such thing as Llama 3.2 405B. 8B/70B/405B models are either Llama 3, 3.1, or 3.3 (except for 405B which wasn't initially released), while Llama 3.2 only contains 1B, 3B, 11B (vision), and 90B (vision) models.

He’s a builder, and I think that yields some intrinsic drive towards creativity and disruption. Even with “metaverse” being a laughingstock, they’re still aiming for something ambitious. Each new Quest generation makes me think there may be a chance they pull it off. Now, do I think he’s a great person? No, not really. Do I agree with most of his decisions on how he treats his users? Hell no, and that’s not changing. But if you compare him to somebody like Sundar at Google - a weasley MBA who was first and foremost a corporate ladder climber - the difference in ambition is night and day. Sundar made it to the top already, his only vision now is to stay at the top, and that means pleasing Wall Street, everything else is secondary. There is no grand technical ambition with him, there never was. This goes for pretty much all non-founder CEOs. You could say the same things about Tim Apple, Andy Jassey, and other henchmen in waiting who made it to the big chair. I think it comes down to the fact that founders get where they are by having big ambitions and taking risks, the MBA to CEO path is just craven corporate knife fighting with other MBAs. Regardless, I think this is 50% Zuckerberg changing, 50% the other big companies are mostly run by ladder climbers. reply guybedo 2 minutes agorootparentprevtwo things to keep in mind though: 1/ Yann Lecun probably is the one pushing for open source 2/ Mark isn't doing this for the greater good and for humanity.

The community creates quantized variants of these that can run on consumer GPUs. A 4-bit quantization of LLAMA 70b works pretty well on Macbook pros, the neural engine with unified CPU memory is quite solid for these. GPUs is a bit tougher because consumer GPU RAM is still kinda small. You can also fine-tune them. There are lot of frameworks like unsloth that make this easier. https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth . Fine-tuning can be pretty tricky to get right, you need to be aware of things like learning rates, but there are good resources on the internet where a lot of hobbyists have gotten things working. You do not need a PhD in ML to accomplish this. You will, however, need data that you can represent textually.

And if you had the resources you probably _still_ probably wouldn't _want_ to rebuild it yourself, it seems awfully expensive when you could instead spend those resources elsewhere. Fair point about the license, people have different definitions for what \"open source\" means. reply do_not_redeem 38 minutes agorootparentThat's true for most people for ordinary software too. How many people actually build Linux or Chromium from source? Building Chromium takes more RAM and HD space than most people even have. Yet the world gets immense value from the few who do. I wouldn't want to live in a world where WebKit and Chromium were closed source. You can run a Chromium fork without having to build it yourself. And compute costs will come down over time. reply fabiospampinato 11 minutes agorootparentLinux and Chromium seem at the edge of the current scale of \"ordinary\" open-source software. I think perhaps one should also take into account how much money would be needed to be able to build the thing in reasonable time. Building Chromium sounds awful, but I'm not sure I'd really need to buy another computer for that. If I did I'm sure I wouldn't need to spend billions on it, most probably not even millions. For LLaMa I definitely don't have the computer to build it, I definitely don't have the money to buy the computer, even if I won the lottery tomorrow I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have enough money to buy the hardware, even if I had enough money to buy the hardware I'm still not sure I could actually buy it in reasonable time, nvidia may be backlogged for a while, even if I already had all the hardware I probably wouldn't want to retrain llama, and even if I wanted to retrain it the process is probably going to take weeks if not months at best. Like I think it's one of those things where the difference in magnitude creates a difference in kind, one can't quite meaningfully compare LLaMa with the Calculator app that Ubuntu ships with. reply copperx 29 minutes agorootparentprevPerhaps an individual couldn't.

Run Docker Containers Access Portainer Interface Downsides of OnePlus 6T as a Home Server Install Docker natively on Android Phone and use it as a Home Server In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of installing Docker on your Android phone, specifically using a OnePlus 6T with postmarketOS. I also wrote another blog post explaining how you can run this phone without a battery, allowing it to run forever as long as it remains connected to a power source. If you’re interested, feel free to check it out! This guide can be adapted only for phones on the postmarketOS device list. Please note that this process will erase all data on your phone, so it’s important to use a device you don’t need. Let’s get started! What do you need for this tutorial? link An Android phone (OnePlus 6 or OnePlus 6T is recommended) Fastboot installed on your PC (see step 2) PostmarketOS boot and img files (see step 3) Step 1: Enable Developer Mode and USB Debugging link Enable Developer Mode and USB Debugging Start by activating Developer Mode on your Android phone. Go to Settings, tap on “Build number” repeatedly until you see a message indicating that Developer Mode has been enabled. Then, go to Developer options and activate OEM unlocking and USB debugging. Step 2: Install Fastboot on your PC link Install Fastboot on your PC To proceed with the installation, you’ll need to have Fastboot installed on your PC. Visit the official Android SDK Platform Tools page and download the package. Extract the files and add the platform-tools folder to your system’s environment variables (instructions vary depending on your operating system). Step 3: Download PostmarketOS Files link Download the PostmarketOS boot and img files for your specific phone model. Visit the postmarketOS website, locate the appropriate files (I am using phosh 22.12), and download them. Extract the files and place them in a single folder for easy access. Step 4: Enter Fastboot Mode link Restart your Android phone and boot it into Fastboot mode. This can typically be done by pressing the volume up, volume down, and power buttons simultaneously on Oneplus 6t. Once your phone is in Fastboot mode, connect it to your PC using a USB cable. Step 5: Flash PostmarketOS link Be aware that each device has its own specific guide for installing PostmarketOS (they are mostly similar). Make sure to carefully read and follow the instructions for your specific phone model on the postmarketOS website before flashing the system. This guide is for oneplus 6t. Flash PostmarketOS on Your Phone by opening a command prompt or terminal window on your PC and navigate to the folder where you saved the PostmarketOS files. Execute the following commands one by one: fastboot erase userdata fastboot erase dtbo fastboot flash boot boot_file_name.img fastboot flash userdata img_file_name.img Replace “boot_file_name” and “img_file_name” with the actual file names you saved earlier. Once the flashing process is complete, restart your phone. PostmarketOS ist installed now on your phone! link Step 6: Initial Setup and SSH Activation link When your phone restarts, you may be prompted for a PIN. Use the default PIN, which is usually “147147.” Connect your phone to a Wi-Fi network. Open the Console app on your phone and activate SSH to control the phone from your PC. Run the following commands in the Console app on your phone: sudo apk update sudo service sshd start sudo rc-update add sshd Step 7: Connect to Your Phone via SSH on your PC link On your PC, open a command prompt or terminal window and connect to your phone via SSH using the following command: ssh user@IP_Address_of_the_phone The default username for SSH is “user,” but you can verify this by running the “whoami” command on the Console app of your phone. The IP_Address_of_the_phone can be found by typing “ifconfig” in the Console app and looking for the IP of wlan0. Step 8: Install Docker on your Android Phone link Now that you’re connected to your phone via SSH, you can easily install Docker by running the following commands: sudo apk add docker sudo service docker start sudo rc-update add docker default To verify that Docker is installed correctly, run: sudo docker ps DONE! Run Docker Containers link With Docker successfully installed on your Android phone, you can now run Docker containers and use your phone as a home server. Let’s try running the Portainer container as an example: Run the following command to start the Portainer container which will download the Portainer image and start the container.: sudo docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest Portainer provides a web-based interface for managing Docker containers and it is easy to use. Access Portainer Interface link Open your web browser on your PC and type in the IP_Address_of_the_phone, followed by “:9443”. This will take you to the Portainer interface running on your Android phone. You can now manage and monitor your Docker containers through this interface. Congratulations! You have successfully installed Docker on your Android phone and set up a Docker container. You can now explore various Docker images and run them on your phone to expand its capabilities as a home server. I am currently using several containers on my home server, and if you’re interested, in the picture below you will see the memory usage. This method serves as an excellent alternative to Raspberry Pi. While I haven’t personally tried a Raspberry Pi before, I believe this phone is more capable, with the added advantage of an integrated screen and battery, which are not available with a Raspberry Pi. Downsides of OnePlus 6T as a Home Server link No Ethernet Support: The server relies entirely on Wi-Fi, which may lack the stability and speed of Ethernet. No External Drive Support: Storage is limited to internal memory (256GB), making it unsuitable for large-scale storage tasks. However, you can connect to an external NAS for additional storage. navigate_before How to migrate a VM from KVM to Proxmox Turn Android Phone to Batteryless Home Server navigate_next © 2024 CrackOverflow Privacy & Policy Donate Us",

Then yes, you have a regular Linux (although based on musl, instead of usual glibc) on which you can install Docker. If you are going to setup a server on a phone, it might indeed be a good idea to avoid Android, mainly because of how aggressive the OOM killer can be with background apps. On Android, killing a background app is not so much of an issue (caveat: [1]), they are designed for this. But you don't want your service or even your ssh deamon to be killed by Android. Now, I don't know how running the phone 24/24 7/7 plugged in is going to last in the long run, especially concerning the battery. Has someone tried this?

The OnePlus 6/6T are also supported by Mobian [0], which is just regular glibc-and-systemd based Debian, and so a pretty familiar Linux server experience. > it might indeed be a good idea to avoid Android It's a good idea to avoid Android because of kernel security as well. Old Android devices always use out of date Linux kernels even when using custom ROMs, and when running (containerized) network services you really depend on the security of your Linux kernel to keep those things properly isolated. Both PostmarketOS and Mobian do bring current mainline Linux support to these devices, so you can be quite a bit more confident in your kernel that way. It's a shame PostmarketOS and Mobian don't really support many newer devices well. Last I checked the OnePlus 6(T) were still the highest performance devices that had okay support. The Snapdragon 845 - a 2018 flagship SoC - in the Oneplus 6/6T made them real high performance device to repurpose for a long time. In 2024 though it's now beaten in performance by the Raspberry Pi 5 or RK3588 based Armbian based devices. Those SBCs of course already have much better I/O and more straightforward ways to get a supported Linux running on them (and don't require disconnecting the battery with custom soldering). So you need to be really committed to reusing your old hardware to go down this route.

Nowadays in most phones you can limit charging to e.g. 80%, which is much lighter on the battery. Additionally, the battery works as a heat sink (or heat store really considering it's just a solid slab of dense material) so expect more throttling when it's not there. reply nine_k 47 minutes agorootparentIf you have an old phone that would otherwise go to garbage, likely its battery is not in a great shape anyway, and server-like loads are mostly incompatible with being battery-powered.

Curious why this is a non-issue for a UPS -- is it the scale, type of battery (lithium ion vs lifepo4), quality, charge cycle, a bit of all of the above? reply ssl-3 2 hours agorootparentUPSs still typically use lead acid batteries. These don't particularly mind being at ~100% SoC for years at a time (they like staying charged), which is very good for this application. And it's easy to keep them at around 100%. For instance: For a nominal 12v battery, one can very nearly just feed it 13.8v (plus or minus some temperature compensation) and have results that are actually pretty good and close-enough to 100%. And when things go very wrong, lead acid batteries tend not to catch on fire. It's a natural fit for UPS duty. The lithium batteries in cell phones are a different thing. They hate being at 100% SoC and degrade fairly quickly in that state. They can be pretty happy at around 50% SoC, but it's hard to actually keep them there because of the way the voltage ramps [don't] work with lithium chemistries: It's almost flat through the middle of the curve. And cell phones don't let us do that anyway: It'd be great if there was a \"Compute mode: Just do your best to keep this battery near 50%\" setting to click on, but there is not. (And we could hack that in, except: We don't own our phones.) And when things go wrong, they can become exothermic in ways that are not exactly ideal for an unattended device sitting on a shelf. reply UniverseHacker 2 hours agorootparentI use a chargie device which is a hardware level charge limiter reply ssl-3 2 hours agorootparentCute. I didn't know those existed, and they do make sense. It's only solving part of the problem though: Sure, it can keep the charge at around a self-reported 50%. But the device itself doesn't necessarily have a good idea of what 50% even means, especially as the months and years tick by and cells age, unless it is allowed go closer to the extremes (closer to 0 and closer to 100, sometimes). The reasons for this get weird. Near the edges of the curves (0 and 100), the BMS can use voltages to figure out where things are. This works well. In the middle of the curve, voltages are damn near flat and cease to be an indicator of state-of-charge, so the BMS counts coulombs instead. This works too (for awhile). Except they're not ideal batteries. They age even if they're not being used at all, and shit happens just as it does for any other non-ideal entity. So on a long-enough timeline, even a perfect coulomb counter doesn't necessarily have any way to accurately report state of charge. The way that this problem is dealt with on a phone that actually gets used like phones get used is that the BMS can reset the coulomb counter during the peaks and dips of a normal charge cycle, based on voltage. But charge cycling doesn't happen even with a Chargie-equipped phone sitting on a shelf and running Docker containers, does it? reply actionfromafar 1 hour agorootparentPut a wall plug timer on it, charge it 50% of the time. reply freedomben 56 minutes agorootparentYou should definitely add a /s lest anybody take this seriously. It's quite funny though. Especially recommended if you're hoping to burn your house down. For people that didn't know, this is probably the fastest and riskiest way to destroy your battery quickly reply ssl-3 1 hour agorootparentprevNo. reply pomian 24 minutes agorootparentprevLike your comments. Question. How does a BMS count coulombs? I mean what is the technology used? reply __MatrixMan__ 3 hours agorootparentprevI think some devices can now be configured to just charge partially (or come that way by default and then tell you that the partial charge is 100%). So this may not be a an issue in all cases, but... I dedicated an Nvidia shield K1 to be a Sonos interface. Just mounted it to a monitor arm and left it plugged in for something like four years. The mount was this beefy metal thing, a little steel cage for the tablet, but as soon as I unscrewed it enough to remove the tablet from the mount the tablet undramatically exploded. It ballooned to a width that was thrice the original thickness of the tablet, pushed the plastic apart, and it was clear that the case was never going to come back together again. I was afraid to touch it, lest it rupture. It seems like it would only be a terrible idea beyond a certain scale. The pillowing battery is just assisted disassembly. And now it's easy to get the battery out. reply selectodude 3 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not a non-issue.

Surely UPS batteries are similar. reply pmontra 2 hours agorootparentMy UPS manual says 3 years. They have a different chemistry than phone batteries. On the other side, they should be quite similar to car batteries which could live much longer that 3 years, but they spend most of their time waiting in a parking slot and then a few starts per day or less. An UPS doesn't work like that. reply bityard 1 hour agorootparentA good UPS will perform regular load tests to gauge battery performance/degradation. They switch over to battery power around once a week and measure voltage before, during, and after. So even if the power goes out, they are still being exercised _somewhat_. reply bityard 2 hours agorootparentprevUPS batteries tend to have lead acid batteries, and the lifespan on those is generally between 3-5 years.

At 60%, the battery will drop to 45% percent before recharging to the specified percentage for coulomb counter drift compensation. Most lithium UPS avoid this by using LiFePO4. Moto G04 with 128GB Storage (UFS - 400MB/s read/write), 4GB RAM and 2TB capable SDcard UHS-I slot is just 90 USD. ZRAM is enabled by default at 2GB and 2GB storage swap, it's adjustable under \"RAM boost\" setting. Disabling the app background killer is one toggle away for Termux. No root required. Wi-Fi does around 350Mbit with no buffer bloat, and supports simulatenous softAP and station mode with a dedicated DHCP by enabling hotspot without mobile data. This is useful for out of band management, e.g if Wi-Fi AP goes down, there is a small hiccup though. You can combine Speedify and Tailscale (for NAT) to have 99% uptime with seamless failover since there is a mobile modem in there. ;) The Type-C port is dual role and will charge from a powered hub in host mode. However connected devices power is disrupted for a split second if the charger is removed, so the phone isn't really a UPS for external peripherals unless you don't mind the brief reconnection. I do hope a Pi A+ or something similar and popular exist in the future at a reasonable price, considering that we have phones that are cheaper than the Pis while missing GPIO but adding camera, speaker, screen, case, charger, LTE, and a headphone jack which was also removed on the Pi 5 (USB DACs aren't consistent with pipewire). Mini PCs vary and they aren't really portable, hard to setup headless, especially projects utilizing an easy DIY approach like the Pi-hole or kit/pre-flashed SDcards. For comments comparing a new Pi with used PC: used Pis exist and are a lot cheaper after shortage. reply sintezcs 3 hours agoprevThere is a Russian meme that instantly comes to my mind: https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/brea...

This means you can get a home server for free. Android phones aren't exactly the fastest thing in the world, but they're probably fast enough for a lot of servery things, and even a relatively small 128GB internal disk can still stream a fair number of movies if they're generously compressed with H264 or something. 2) Power consumption. My phone charger that I'm using right now peaks at 20W, and idles at considerably less than that when the phone is fully charged. That's getting into \"guilt-free\" territory; you can leave this plugged in and not really have to worry about your bill spiking as a result. reply Lerc 47 minutes agoprevI'm curious to know if there is a good way to do this on a phone with a broken screen. I have accumulated a few phones with 3+ gig of RAM, a decent number of moderately good ARM cores, but with broken screens. Essentially this means all control with the device has to be on the few buttons, and the USB, and all feedback must be through USB (or maybe audio) How transplantable are screens between phones?

Android and Termux have their limitations. Granted, I was running a full KDE session in Termux on a 2016 phone, but I saw Android OOM-kill random processes in Termux. You probably don't have a swap partition on your Android phone. Android apps are designed to be killed when in background, and Android avoids killing the app at the foreground, but Android doesn't know some processes running in Termux shouldn't be killed. This could happen if something on your server suddenly uses more RAM than anticipated. On a regular Linux distro, you can have a swap file and/or teach the OOM to not kill some critically important services, like ssh for instance. reply __jonas 2 hours agoparentprevThis is for running inside qemu, the OP says \"Install Docker Natively\", I don't think it's silly, not really the same thing reply IshKebab 2 hours agoparentprevA simple 18 step process!

I want something reliable that has good autonomy and good and reliable call quality. I would not want the phone to leave me behind in an emergency for instance. But the PinePhone is none of this: terrible phone quality, the modem on my device is unreliable, the autonomy is okayish. I also had a PinePhone Pro that died: big improvement except the autonomy was much worse and it would strongly eat. I believe that's what killed it, actually. With good hardware, I would be happy with a Linux mobile OS. But I don't use WhatsApp, I don't have a banking app, I don't pay with my phone, and have no proprietary app in general. Things like Wi-Fi calling would probably not work neither, but I don't have this with my old Android phone neither.

I viscerally HATE all the news sites that look like your project. I've sought alternative sources of news with a more old-school look, without success. I used to think it wasn't just the pictures. I found the average quality of reporting went down, along with a rise in clickbait headlines and stories, around the same time mainstream outlets adopted the new format. I figured that may have been part of what conditioned me to hate it. But now I realize the cosmetic factor really is quite substantial. I like being able to digest lots of information in front of me at once, and the words on the HN site pack in better density (I guess it turns out not every photo is worth a thousand of them). Yes, the timber roof photo looks great. But too many of your crowdsourced pictures feel almost generated, rather than authentic to their associated piece, and I find them distracting.

Surely every single thread that got even modest engagement on HN since the beginning of the place disproves your take? reply PaulHoule 46 minutes agorootparentHN is unusual because it is that way. There's nothing wrong with that. But let's put it this way. If I find a popular article on a ScienceX site I often find it links to a journal article which may or may not be open access, let's assume that it is. Posting to HN I will usually post the open access article. Posting to Mastodon or Bluesky I will usually post the ScienceX link because those platforms can find an image in those articles but can't find an image in a paper in Nature. (Note on those platforms I get replies like \"this is over my head\" when I post a real paper whereas nobody in HN wants to admit that vulnerability) If somebody makes an HN clone which merges in images, those images are going to have a big impact on people's engagement with that clone. reply password4321 5 hours agoprevThanks for being willing to stick your neck out by putting your own spin on things!

I wrote a short essay yesterday about how to think about these mysterious outbreaks [1]. Briefly, the most common outcome is they are determined to be an endemic disease. Less likely is an emerging infectious disease. The most concerning possibility is something novel or highly unexpected. [1] https://caitlinrivers.substack.com/p/understanding-mysteriou... reply tptacek 17 hours agoparentThis is a great article, and for anyone that wants a cheat sheet for the thread (and to double check my read): * The \"endemic disease\" bucket describes things like cholera and known influenza strains, and what we're seeing is hazy reporting of flare-ups that happen in low-resource areas around the world on the regular. * The \"emerging infectious disease\" bucket describes stuff like Ebola, which is scary but we've got something like a reasonable history of responding and containing to it, if we take it seriously. * \"Novel\" is C19, or the first outbreaks of Ebola at the time, the point presumably at which we'd start thinking about novel precautionary measures applied preemptively. reply itsaride 17 hours agoparentprevThe article says it's an area where malnutrition is endemic, couldn't it just be a flu variant that's killing already vulnerable people? reply gosub100 17 hours agorootparentStarving people are more likely to eat bush meat, which is one way viruses can jump from one host species to another. reply jonny_eh 19 hours agoparentprev> Less likely is an emerging infectious disease. The most concerning possibility is something novel or highly unexpected. What's the difference between an emerging and novel disease? reply JumpCrisscross 19 hours agorootparent> What's the difference between an emerging and novel disease? Novel is new. Never before seen. SARS-Cov-2 was a novel virus. Emerging means identified but changing [1]. The Covid variants were EIDs. So are antibiotic-resistant strains. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_infectious_disease#Cl... reply etiam 19 hours agorootparentI don't exactly want to dispute that, but I would like to remark it's not entirely clear-cut. SARS-CoV-2 response could be as rapid as it was in no small part because two decades of research on SARS-CoV more or less was applicable, and looking at genetic similarity alone contemporary variants of SARS-CoV-2 are now more different from the original strain isolated in Wuhan than that strain is different from SARS-CoV. So was the threat from pathogenic Coronaviruses really novel? To a degree, and depending on what aspects one chooses to emphasize maybe. Also, I'd say the pathogen itself doesn't necessarily need to do the changing in the context of emerging diseases. I'd take it to mean they have potential to become more prevalent or have a more significant impact, but that could easily also be due to changes in conditions, including human behavior. reply JumpCrisscross 18 hours agorootparent> I would like to remark it's not entirely clear-cut Are you saying this as an epidimeologist? (I'm not an epidimeologist. I've only studied the math.) > looking at genetic similarity alone Epidimeology is the study of disease in a population. You can't look at the virus alone. The dividing line between emerging and novel is brighter than between emerging and existing. It has to do with whether the population has pre-existing immunity. SARS-CoV infection conferred no immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Getting infected with the Alpha variant, on the other hand, conferred immunity to Omega. > I'd say the pathogen itself doesn't necessarily need to do the changing in the context of emerging diseases. I'd take it to mean they have potential to become more prevalent or have a more significant impact, but that could easily also be due to changes in conditions, including human behavior Literally in the Wikipedia. \"EIDs may also result from spread of an existing disease to a new population in a different geographic region, as occurs with West Nile fever outbreaks.\" reply etiam 20 hours agoparentprevAre you willing to hazard a guess how long it will take to get material analyzed to determine which of your categories this is in? reply cmriversepi 20 hours agorootparentThe first round of test results should come in Friday or this weekend. The longer it goes undiagnosed, the more we tip into categories 2 and 3. reply etiam 20 hours agorootparentThanks. So basically, if it's any of numerous reasonably well-known but very local diseases a fluid's probably going to go colored in some field test kit and say which one, else it could be something known (and often of known substantial concern for large-scale contagion) but too rare or understudied to have cheap robust quick tests yet so that has to be shipped to a real lab (probably with very high biosecurity rating), and if the lab doesn't recognize what they're seeing in their electron microscope and has to do fundamental research first to get a good biochemical profiling it's something truly expanding the boundaries of known infectious pathology? Something like that? reply losteric 20 hours agoprevSo as I understand it: - Panzi is an isolated, hard-to-access area where malnutrition, prior epidemics, and seasonal flu have already weakened the population. - Poor healthcare infrastructure and delayed medical intervention have amplified deaths. - There is no evidence of rapid or widespread transmission. (see first point). - Samples have been retrieved for testing. At this point, there is no information on transmission vector (assuming it’s even a disease) reply giarc 20 hours agoparent300+ cases is quite a few when you consider that many will not be reported. reply hvenev 20 hours agoprevDespite the sad context, this seems refreshing -- an alert is raised due to a real and serious concern. reply autoexec 19 hours agoparentIt is nice that things aren't so bad that nobody is even keeping an eye out for things like this.

We've learned from experience that no matter how many people start dying, huge parts of the population will not take it seriously and that governments will only care about keeping the workers busy making money for their employers even while those employers refuse to provide them with PPE or sick time. Nobody trusts the CDC as it is, and that will only get worse with the coming administration. I'm just hoping that this isn't anything new, and that it doesn't spread very far. reply NotSammyHagar 16 hours agorootparentI disagree about trusting the CDC, I have no reason not to trust them. They'll do their best job to understand threats, avoid making confusing statements. But if there is a threat and people are dying in hospitals in large numbers without much information, they'll do their best to make health safety precautions, but they will probably make some mistakes. This is pretty common in science too. reply autoexec 11 hours agorootparentThe CDC never had the trust of many people to start with, but their repeated failures at communication didn't do them any favors. They also repeatedly allowed themselves to be bullied and manipulated. For example, they changed the recommendation to stay home 5 days after testing positive, but that change wasn't based on any new evidence that would contradict their old recommendation. reply 123yawaworht456 19 hours agorootparentprevnext [12 more] [flagged] cthalupa 19 hours agorootparent> it is safe to say now that the events of 2020-2021 were a mass hysteria.

Are you wiling to recognize that reality can sometimes have conflicting qualities -- e.g. there can be simultaneously \"too much of a reaction\" against a perceived threat; but also \"some kind of serious response was needed; no one could possibly have known at the time what the optimal response would have been; sometimes it's better to err on the side of caution\"?

The virus is real but isnt spreading human to human (it obviously was at this point) Bonus: Thinking the virus came from a lab doing research on that exact virus in proximity to the first cases was a conservative conspiracy instead of an obvious first guess 3. The virus is spreading human to human but not through the air (it obviously was highly probable given respiratory symptoms) 4. Masks dont work 5. Masks do work 6.

The science said masks do not protect you and that is why experts initially said so. Then, they figured that this is not what people wanted to hear. People wanted to be told what to do to be safe and would not take “we do not know” as an answer. Politicians latched on this, the media latched on to this, and somehow it became a partisan issue. The path of least resistance was to just shut up, wear a mask and wait for the hysteria to subside. reply bdangubic 7 hours agorootparent> and somehow it became a partisan issue. this wasn't a partisan issue in the beginning. it only became a partisan issue when 50% of the population started getting the \"scientific information about efficacy of wearing masks\" via Mary from Pennsylvania on \"X\" same with the vaccines. the loudest pro-vaccine politicians (e.g. DeSantis) after seeing posts on \"X\" from our PA/MT/MO experts decided it would be super beneficial to their political career to make that a partisan issue as well :) reply NotSammyHagar 16 hours agorootparentprevYes, good points. Politicians and the public and all of us can have trouble when it's a rush situation with deadly consequences and the experts make their best prognosis based on previous times in some part - then they revise best practices as they gain knowledge. This happens all the time but it's not usually so visibly combined with conspiracy theories about controlling people and all that kind of crazy stuff. America is so influenced by foolish postings on social media and popular, but not fact-based TV networks.

You can't exactly grab a few hundred people, and run an experiment where you deliberately infect a bunch of them with a brand new, deadly disease to really pin down the transmission mechanism.
