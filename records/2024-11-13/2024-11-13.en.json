    "commentBody": "No GPS required: our app can now locate underground trains (transitapp.com)814 points by dotcoma 17 hours agohidepastfavorite269 comments rossant 10 hours agoMaybe ten years ago, I read a blog post by, I think, a French company called snips, that explained how their app used the pressure sensor to detect when the train entered or leaved a station. It turned out there was a very clear signal due to the sudden pressure increase or decrease when the train entered or left the tunnel between the stations. Edit: found it. https://medium.com/snips-ai/underground-location-tracking-3e... reply coumbaya 6 hours agoparentAnother tidbit: on high speed trains (maybe on regular trains too idk) the 'door flange' which is actually a hollow pneumatic tube (it can detect spike in pressure that's how the train know it's trying to close the door on somebody's hand) get's pressurized higher before entering the tunnel, to mitigate the \"slam\" effect due to the difference in pressure. reply the-rc 5 hours agoparentprevEven before that, there was a Google Maps experiment using the compass (magnetometer) to infer train movement, but IIRC the accuracy of that depended on the network's current (DC vs AC) and even the vintage of the cars. reply LukaszWiktor 10 hours agoparentprevVery few Android phones have a pressure sensor. reply plantain 9 hours agorootparentVery many do - https://m.gsmarena.com/results.php3?chkBarometer=selected reply LukaszWiktor 9 hours agorootparent> Your search returned 653 results. When you remove the filter, it returns 12177 results. So only ~5% of phone models include a barometer. reply yccs27 8 hours agorootparentThat's all phones ever, not current/popular models. When you restrict it to the last 10 years, you get about 12%, and of the 70 most popular models almost a quarter are equipped with a barometer. reply lolinder 4 hours agorootparentFor an app as popular as Transit this is a purely academic exercise—25% of the most popular models is way too low to be worth building their detection around, even if they could assume that all of their customers use the most popular models (which they obviously can't). reply stavros 3 hours agorootparent25% of popular models doesn't mean 25% of phones currently in circulation. If the iPhone has a barometer (which it does), that's already a huge share of phones out there. reply lolinder 33 minutes agorootparentI'm in favor of Transit trying to reach more than 25% of the most popular phone models even if doing so would get them 75% of the population. reply hluska 2 hours agorootparentprevThe conversation was about Android. reply azinman2 2 hours agorootparentBut the point stands, it’s about the distribution of phones not how many models support it. reply michaelmior 2 hours agorootparentprevIt may be too low, but I'd imagine the app could also look for other Transit users nearby and as long as one of them has the appropriate sensor, this might be sufficient. Probably still not something you want to rely on since it would be pretty annoying to have a feature not work when you're alone on a train. reply cbhl 1 hour agorootparent> the app could also look for other Transit users nearby That seems unlikely in an environment with no cellular / wifi signal. Theoretically possible, but expensive for battery and probably disallowed by the OS. reply thruway516 1 hour agorootparentprevDoes the current version of their app run on 25% of the most popular models? This update runs a classifier on your phone. I imagine that would be no less restrictive than the barometer requirement. reply lolinder 32 minutes agorootparentMost classifiers are nowhere near as heavy as the LLMs that are trending right now. The article doesn't specify, but I would be surprised if the resource requirements are especially onerous. reply antonkochubey 7 hours agorootparentprevHuh?

You get way better and faster Z position with barometer than with only GPS. reply telgareith 5 hours agorootparentprevMaybe it'll help achieve a lock faster- but theres nothing else needed for GPS besides GPS. The military really doesn't like dependencies. reply traverseda 5 hours agorootparentNot a faster lock, air pressure is actually more accurate on the z axis for the most part. GPS is not great at height, and including an extremely accurate barometer is a big help. reply umeshunni 3 hours agorootparentWhy is GPS not great at height? If you know your location is x,y and you have an elevation map, you can map x,y to an altitude z, right? reply sgarman 7 minutes agorootparenthttps://ciechanow.ski/gps/ bobmcnamara 45 minutes agorootparentprev> Why is GPS not great at height? Because the SATs only give you a pseudorange distance between you and the sat, so each say is most accurate solving for distance to/from that sat, and much less helpful resolving angle to the sat. With a clear SkyView, around just under half of the sats are hidden by the earth. This means that you get a full 360 degrees of data that can be near the horizon helping resolve lat/long. But only about half of that sky is helpful for altitude. The birds you can't hear directly below the earth would be the most helpful for improving the altitude fix if you could hear them. Baro is handy because you can take the absolute altitude from GPS as a low frequency baseline and use the baro for high frequency changes. Then when GPS says we teleported +200 feet when a new sat comes into view, we can temper that that with baro information. reply ianburrell 55 minutes agorootparentprevOne problem is that using position to get altitude would require a detailed elevation map and that would use a lot of storage space or require internet. But elevation maps are not detailed enough and position is not accurate enough to get accurate elevation. Think about standing on trail along steep slope. The position not being that accurate is fine since you know you are on trail. But altitude could vary wildly going up or down slope, or even up or down trail. It is probably similar to GPS vertical accuracy, but were going for more accuracy that barometer provides. reply Wowfunhappy 3 hours agorootparentprevI know nothing about this, but I imagine two people at the same latitude and longitude could be at different altitudes. A trivial example would be people on different floors of a skyscraper—although I suppose gps works poorly indoors anyway. Still, even outdoors there are peaks and crevices, and on a steep slope a very trivial change in lat/lon could lead to a major change in altitude. reply ScottEvtuch 1 hour agorootparentprevI would imagine it's because your distance to the satellites changes more when you move along the ground than when you move up and down the same amount. reply avidiax 32 minutes agorootparentThis is the basic reason. https://www.ncesc.com/geographic-pedia/why-is-my-gps-elevati... reply dorfsmay 3 hours agorootparentprevDo you then use the internet to find the local pressure, or only use it to calculate changes in altitude? reply CamperBob2 3 hours agorootparentprevGPS itself is one hell of a dependency. What the military (and pretty much everyone else) wants right now is redundancy. reply BurningFrog 1 hour agorootparentprevGPS already gives you altitude in addition to longitude and latitude, so I don't understand what the air pressure adds. reply tqi 1 hour agorootparentVertical error for GPS is about 2X to 3X more than horizontal error[1], so the barometer helps correct that.

Edit: at least the excellent Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite gives me a barometer signal indicating 102570 Pa right now. reply LukaszWiktor 8 hours agorootparentTrue. Flagship smartphones, and some rugged models do have a pressure sensor. reply maven29 8 hours agorootparentprevJust like the heart rate monitor, this was also moved into smartwatches for optimizing revenue from those who truly need it. reply resoluteteeth 6 hours agorootparentAre you saying that smartphones used to have heart rate monitors but they were removed to force people to buy smart watches? reply astrange 6 hours agorootparentAny phone that can record 120fps video has a heart rate monitor, if you can calibrate it. reply connicpu 5 hours agorootparentprevI forget which generation it was now, but many years ago I had a Samsung Galaxy phone that had a sensor that could measure your heart rate if you put your finger over it reply superhuzza 5 hours agorootparentThe Galaxy S7 definitely had this feature. The problem is, it was basically useless. The main use case for heart rate monitoring is continuously throughout the day/night, or during exercise. A watch is very good at this. An optical sensor on the back of your phone is not. Periodically checking your heart rate by holding your phone in a specific way is not a useful feature for that many people. reply chucksmash 1 hour agorootparent+1. If a phone has a stopwatch, you can get your bpm at a given moment with a finger and a multiplication (or patience). Given the limited real estate on a mobile phone it's crazy to devote any space for something so trivial. reply 6510 4 hours agorootparentprevFor me, just having something that you can check 1 time per year is much better than nothing. The anecdote: I was working two heavy manual labor jobs 7 days per week and felt absolutely fantastic, glowing with power. Turned out the heart rate at rest was 180 lmao. Like a rabbit. Took a few days off, it dropped below 70. reply idiot900 4 hours agorootparentIf your heart rate at rest is truly 180, you have an arrhythmia and need to see a doctor. reply 6510 3 hours agorootparentIt should decline some 60 sec after physical activity. I think I measured after 10-15 minutes. Fatigue, dehydration, lack of sleep, a diet with lots of coffee. I just added those to the todo list. I went home to sleep (and confiscated the heart rate meter), the next morning it was around 100 bpm which is still terrible shape. Over the day it sunk to 80, over the 2nd day to 70, 3rd a bit lower. Back at work it would barely elevate. The moral of the story: Don't work out 11 hours per day for 6 months straight. reply telgareith 5 hours agorootparentprevIt's not a separate sensor- 30fps on an iPhone was more than enough. Turns out, when you have a known luminance, white balance, and frame-rate... the DSP to grab heart rate from a finger is trivial. reply fragmede 9 hours agorootparentprevyou wouldn't need all of them to have it, just enough so that wifi beacons in-between train stations could get added to the bssid - gps coordinate map. Though if the vendors wanted work with you, you could just tell them wifi bssid and the gps coordinates of them and the rest of it would just work. reply Normal_gaussian 9 hours agorootparentThere are unlikely to be wifi basestations detectable in between stations, because these are underground trains. reply _kb 8 hours agorootparentYou don’t need fixed base stations. Just infra on the train that rolls bassid based on location data the train already has. This would silently hook into native location services already on devices without additional sensing or models trained on other sensor data. reply bluGill 5 hours agorootparentprevThere should be - everyone on the train wants connectivity. Even if there is wifi on the train, that wifi needs something to connect to. reply fragmede 9 hours agorootparentprevunless installed by the system operator, which is why they'd know the gps coordinates for them I'd have to have missed the title of the post, not read the post itself, not read GP's comment, not thought about why there'd be a pressure change, to have missed that particular detail. I appreciate you trying to be helpful though. :) reply ripe 5 hours agoprevCan we take a moment to appreciate the engaging, conversational tone of the writing?

It'shuman driver Not in any even remotely modern system that will have a high degree of automation and if there's a driver, they're only closing and opening doors, and telling the train to get going. reply AndrewSwift 11 hours agorootparentI just took a one day initiation with the SNCF for driving trains in France. I assumed that everything would be automated but in fact nothing is. They explained that they regularly face situations that require human intervention (several times a day), and that even a little automation would reduce the level of attention on the part of the conductor. The conductor is required to interact with the controls at least every 30 seconds to avoid setting off alarms. reply maeln 10 hours agorootparentThe SNCF is for regional and national train (with the exception of the RER) where the possibility of having a cow coming on the rail is non-negligible ... or a hot air ballon landing on the rail and stopping the Nantes-Paris lines for a whole morning :D . So I think it is a much, much harder environment to automate. Paris do have some metro line that are fully automatic (line 1 at least) and both Rennes metro lines are fully automatic. It is much easier to control the environment around a metro and ensure that nothing can go on the rails, and have surveillance system to check if, if it does happen, it is detected ASAP. reply Lance_ET_Compte 3 hours agorootparent\"Leaves on the line.\" https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the-railway/looking-af... reply rossant 9 hours agorootparentprevParis metro lines 1, 4, and 14 are automatic at the moment. reply sofixa 9 hours agorootparentprev> The SNCF is for regional and national train (with the exception of the RER) where the possibility of having a cow coming on the rail is non-negligible ... or a hot air ballon landing on the rail and stopping the Nantes-Paris lines for a whole morning :D .

Even the non-fully automatic lines use heavy automation (e.g. lines such as 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13). reply bluGill 4 hours agorootparentprevMost train systems around the world are not automated. Even though electronics can do better than a human driver, most trains have a human driver. (in subway systems you should be able to keep all dangers off the track so the safety problem is much easier than roads where kids might be playing in the street. But this requires platform screen doors which is also rare) The real advantage of automation though is without a human driver it becomes cheap to run a lot of trains that are not very full and that makes your system nearly as convenient as driving in the suburbs. reply sofixa 4 hours agorootparent> Most train systems around the world are not automated All modern ones (in an urban/suburban context, which is what the post and thread are about; interurban is a bit more mixed, but every high speed line is highly automated too, because at those speeds there simply isn't the time for a human to react) are. > The real advantage of automation though is without a human driver it becomes cheap to run a lot of trains that are not very full And you can also have a very high frequency (60-90s intervals), which is impossible with manual operations. This increases capacity, on top of the convenience. reply lpribis 11 hours agorootparentprevNot true for a lot of (widely used) systems. Both the NY subway and London Underground are manually driven for the majority of lines. reply lmm 10 hours agorootparentEvery London Underground line built after 1906 is automatically driven - the human driver just pushes a button and the train drives itself to the next station. reply iggldiggl 9 hours agorootparentThat makes it sound as if they'd been automated right from 1907, which most definitely isn't the case – on most line automation only happened very recently. (The Victoria Line was automated right from its opening in 1968, then the Central line was automated in the 90s, the Jubilee and Northern lines in the 2010s and the subsurface network is currently under way.) Also if we want to quibble, at least a few sections of the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines (which are still completely manually driven) were opened after 1906. reply sofixa 9 hours agorootparentprevLondon Undeground has high degree of automation (driver presses a button, train drives itself optimally to the next station). Paris has the same, and also a number of lines (1, 4, 14, and soon 15) which have no driver at all. NYC Subway is an outlier in how obsolete everything is. reply rangestransform 3 hours agorootparentThe NYC train drivers union continue to fight against one person train operation and automation, to them the subway is more of a jobs program than transportation reply porphyra 1 hour agorootparentWe should automate the trains and repurpose the train staff to be conductors patrolling the trains to assist individuals in need and help in an emergency. That way, the jobs are saved, and the trains get more pleasant to ride! reply sofixa 2 hours agorootparentprevI saw that, I saw trains with more than one MTA person onboard, and saw some construction work which had 30 workers sitting on their phones and 2 working (passed by multiple times that day, the ration never changed). Grand Paris Express' president also talked about this, and compared the 2nd avenue subway to the Grand Paris Express (well, one cost $4.45 billion for 1.8 mi / 2.9 km and 4 stations; the first line of GPE, 15 south is 33km, 16 stations, and costs ~8 billion euros so it's a really bad comparison), and has said that if he had to do things the way the MTA do it, GPE would have gone nowhere. reply rangestransform 2 hours agorootparentI will literally volunteer to canvass for anyone who runs on busting NYC public sector unions reply ThePowerOfFuet 10 hours agorootparentprevThe comment to which you replied specifically said \"Not in any even remotely modern system\"; neither of those are remotely modern, _especially_ not NYC.

The user already knows whether or not they are on a train, you don't need to tell them. Just show the predicted location of the train they should be on separately from their last known GPS position. Of course it would be difficult to market that alone as a novel innovative AI feature. reply devit 6 hours agoprevWouldn't dead reckoning with the accelerometer and gyroscope in addition to their machine learning improve this significantly? (constraining motion along the known tunnel path when in a moving train, constraining the user to be within the train stopping rectangle when detecting a train starting to move) Or is the hardware in smartphones too inaccurate even with the extra information? reply pbmonster 5 hours agoparent> Wouldn't dead reckoning with the accelerometer and gyroscope in addition to their machine learning improve this significantly? The thing that should help the most would probably be the hall sensor/magnetometer/compass. That should output decent dead reckoning. Doing this just with the gyroscope will work very well for short movements, but it will be close to useless on long, gentle curves. Unfortunately, those MEMS gyroscopes drift quite a lot over tens of seconds. Not a problem if you can do sensor fusion with the magnetometer (reckoning) and the accelerometer (where is \"down\"), but the latter can't be used on a fast train, acceleration/deceleration of the vehicle and forces in curves make finding gravity challenging. No idea how well a compass works inside a subway tunnel. But maybe I'm wrong, I just have experience trying an \"artificial horizon\" app on an aircraft - and here, the accelerometer is completely useless for \"down\". A single maneuver with some Gs and the horizon has no idea what the pitch angle is. Noisy magnetic environment, GPS off? It also doesn't know where it's going. reply porphyra 1 hour agorootparentI wonder how well magnetometers would work inside metal trains full of electric motors. reply porphyra 1 hour agoparentprevUsing the IMU seems hard as true signal of the train's gradual acceleration is likely drowned out by the noise of vibrations and the person's natural movements. I guess every time the train is stopped, you can calibrate the bias of the IMU if the user is standing/sitting sufficiently still, but even then the dead reckoning would drift a lot. reply bluGill 4 hours agoparentprevThat is what they are doing. Dead reckoning is generally very inaccurate though, so by recognizing when they are on a train they can greatly increase accuracy because they know exactly where the train is. reply crazygringo 3 hours agorootparentIs it? The article doesn't say so. It says they use the accelerometer for detecting the user's current mode of transportation, not the distance. It says they use the train schedules to figure out the current location of the train, based on when it started moving and how long it's been moving. They don't mention anything like dead reckoning anywhere, unless I missed it? reply KTibow 3 hours agoparentprevYeah while the solution they implemented is very interesting it doesn't actually \"predict your location in a subway tunnel using your phone’s vibration signature\" reply zephyreon 4 hours agoprevAs a user of Transit (thank you for such a great app!) this was always one of my biggest annoyances.

This would require on-train equipment but typically the trains know where they are and could translate that into the required gps satellites and timestamp signatures to allow any devices onboard to acquire a \"gps\" signal and decode the location using timestamp variation. I don't believe any of those are encrypted and transmit ~1000-10000 time per second on 1500-1600mhz spectrum which is fairly simple to reproduce using even a cheap SDR kit. It could also work with 0 input from the train's telemetry - in much the same way as the app - the device would get a reference gps signal (or wifi/BLE when it knows it's in the station), then with a built-in accelerometer (which it has the luxury of direction + stability if it's mounted in the train car) it can determine with greater accuracy where the train is and how far it's moved. reply Aurornis 5 hours agoparent> I think you can \"spoof\" gps satellite timestamp transmissions with single transmitter inside the train.

I’m curious about the failure cases. Are they caused by exceptional circumstances, such as the train moving more slowly than normal or skipping a station?

Also interesting that the motion type prediction (\"is this a moving train?\") generalizes to underground trains in other cities. I see they support the the largest cities in Sweden and Norway, wonder if there are any plans for Copenhagen, Denmark? reply O-stevns 1 hour agoparentWhile I understand your question is about the Transit app in general, I'd just like to mention in correlation to the article that my team and I worked with one of the public transport operators in Denmark, to utilize the motion predictability feature found in Android and iOS SDK's, so I can enlighten you with some details regarding that. Our conclusion was that the feature didn't work in the danish metros for reasons we never got to deep dive into. It's most likely related to the fact that many of the metro stations are built in concrete, as such there's no GPS data in most of them unless you're very close to or on the surface and no motion data. I'd be surprised if they got this particular feature working but who knows... maybe if we had looked into the raw sensor output we might have been able to work something out. In the end we made a solution to help determine when you're moving or not by utilizing beacons. reply dotcoma 11 hours agoparentprevLet them know you’d like CPH !

I don't know why the London Underground lags that of other cities? Knowing the next station is usually a solved problem that doesn't need a smartphone, because that's displayed in the train itself and called out on speakers. But once you are on the platform and you need to ask the route planner what the fastest route is to a specific station (It could be walking to the surface and taking a bus, so it's not as simple as looking at the subway map) - then you are out of luck if platforms don't have 4/5G coverage! reply vinay427 8 hours agoparentThe usual answer that will be thrown around to justify this is that London has the oldest underground metro system, whether that’s relevant or not. It doesn’t seem very relevant when even the deepest stations in Prague (which are newer but much deeper than most of London) have later added 5G throughout tunnels with download speeds of ~200 Mbps between stations. I suspect the UK just doesn’t have modern standards for mobile internet service, as it isn’t limited to TfL services in London. There isn’t even reliable mobile coverage on stretches of the West Coast Main Line rail corridor in England, which is outdoors and connects the UK’s most populous cities. Much of London isn’t particularly reliable either on most mobile networks, in my experience. Meanwhile, in cities like Prague or Washington I can often get mobile download speeds outdoors of 400 Mbps - 1-2 Gbps. reply DrBazza 6 hours agoparentprevHalf the LU tunnels are barely larger than the train, the other half are cut'n'cover.

Somehow my running app knows my stride length but may refuse to count the distance travelled when gps was out. reply sorenjan 3 hours agoparentTo get position from accelerometer data you have to integrate it twice. Accelerometer data is noisy, and integrating noise quickly leads to large deviations. That's why you need some kind of absolute position reference, like GPS, to not get bigger and bigger errors. Here, they seem to estimate which stations they are at or between, and use that as absolute references. Your running app is using accelerometer data to recognize when you're taking a step, and combining that with GPS data to measure how far you're running. So if it measures 100 meter using GPS and counts 100 steps during that time, your step length is 1 m. Garmin watches uses this to measure your running distance on treadmills, but they want you to calibrate it by running with GPS on a flat surface outdoor first. I don't know if any watches or apps use this in combination with GPS to make better position estimates when the GPS reception is poor, my guess is no because it's really only useful for distance, not position, and generally when running outdoors you're not running in completely straight lines. But it should be possible to estimate distance and combining it with their routing software to guess which way you took for short parts of the course. reply killingtime74 9 hours agoparentprev(guessing) Stride length is a scalar, path is a vector?

And then you'd need to spoof different signals for different regions of the subway, because your signal sources aren't really in the orbit. Sounds to me this could be very complicated and expensive. I wonder if it would even be possible because you'd need to have the same signal spoof the correct positions to everyone who hears that signal. reply dietr1ch 10 hours agorootparentNo, you need 3 satellites because they are far enough that their position and time gives you too much uncertainty. If the entire sphere where I could be fits within 5m I guess I don't need other satellites and their time to start intersecting spheres. reply _flux 6 hours agorootparentI don't understand this. As far as I know, the satellite basically sends its identifier and precise time, and from this information (combined with the information in GPS calendar that tells the locations of the satellites) the recipient can determines its own location. How could it be possible to determine the location from a single timestamp and information about which satellite it belongs to? I suppose if the recipient already has a fix, then it could perhaps survive with less than 3 satellites by making some assumptions, but I imagine this will result in lower quality location information.

The app also knows where the train is, so it knows where you are as well. It won't know which train car you are on, but that normally doesn't matter. This probably is wrong if trains for both directions stop at the same time from opposite sides of the same platform and you get on the wrong train. However this is a rare enough case that we can ignore it - but very annoying if you are that person (this case happens to most transit riders once or twice in their life). Even when this happens there often is other location data scattered around so you would likely only ride a stop or two before the app realizes you are on the wrong train and can reroute you. reply snodnipper 8 hours agoprevI worked for signalbox.io and they had this for the London Underground ~8 years ago.

    "originBody": "November 12, 2024 I had to pause some of my work getting a current-gen AMD graphics card running on the Pi 5 and testing a 192-core AmpereOne server to quickly post on the M4's efficiency. I expected M4 to be better than M1/M2 (I haven't personally tested M3), and I hoped it would at least match the previous total-system-power efficiency king, a tiny arm SBC with an RK3588 SoC... but I didn't expect it to jump forward 32%. Efficiency gains on the Arm systems I test typically look like 2-5% year over year. The M4 mini I just bought reaches 6.74 Gflops/W on the HPL benchmark. I can get 283 Gflops at 42W, versus 264 at 66W on my M1 Max Mac Studio (for a round 4.00 Gflops/W). The chip isn't the fastest at everything, but it's certainly the most efficient CPU I've ever tested. And that scales down to idle power, too—it hovers between 3-4W at idle—which is about the same as a Raspberry Pi. This is total system power draw, too—not just the CPU. And the system I bought includes 10 Gigabit Ethernet and 32 GB of RAM; most systems I've used consume 4-6W just running the 10 GbE controller! In 1.25U of rack space, you could run three Mac minis, idling around 10W, giving almost a teraflop of CPU performance. (Not to mention there's a fast GPU/NPU, 10 GbE, and tons of high speed Thunderbolt IO in the back.) If only they didn't put the power button on the bottom. You can check out all my top500-benchmark results on GitHub, and follow my progress testing out the M4 mini here.

Perhaps necessary because of space restraints and in that case understandable. But that is entirely different to good design and I cannot really buy the \"use case explanation\". Many leave their devices on their desk and Apple always had a problem with just letting devices turn of completely, there are regularly problems with it. And they do drain power on idle, which is a frequent complaint. Yes, we are that insane to use a lot of Apple devices for business in some departments.

The total system draw does not include the power supply - it will have its own losses esp on low end, still likely in the 80s reply phillco 20 hours agoparentprevAfter buying one, I actually like it. I know exactly where it is, and can reach for it by feel more easily; I could never tell you whether the power button was on the left or right side of the old Mini/Studio without checking each time. It's also larger, more satisfying tactile/clicky, and concave compared to the old button (which was rounded into the outside curve, not particularly be satisfying to press). I think the old one being so small and indistinct feeling, and also being so close to the cables meant you would never try to reach for it blindly. You do have to lift it up a bit, but the device is so light you can do that with the same finger you're using to push the button (of course you need another finger to push the top of the mini _down_). I think neither old nor new button were really meant to be used more than occasionally, since you typically wake your Mac from the keyboard, and both designs reflect that. I do sympathize that the new version could be less flexible in different mounting positions though. (that said, I'd bet Jobs/Ive Apple would never have shipped this, unless the height underneath was exactly perfect for even the larger fingers to fit) reply atonse 17 hours agorootparentJobs and Ive had their head scratchers. Like the Magic Mouse with the bottom charging port, or the Cube with all its cables coming in from the bottom. reply derefr 15 hours agorootparentThe GP's same argument also applies to the Magic Mouse, as it happens: > It's a way of signaling how the product should be used. In the Magic Mouse's case, it came out just on the cusp of wireless mice becoming \"a thing.\" Most people, if they were allowed, would have just left the mouse tethered to a computer by its charging cable at all times, since that's what they were used to. But Apple thought you'd be happier once you stopped doing that. So someone (Ive?) decided to make it so that you couldn't charge the Magic Mouse and use it at the same time. This did two things: 1. it forced people to try using the Magic Mouse without any cable connected, so that they would notice the added freedom a wireless mouse affords. It was a \"push out of the nest.\" 2. it made charging annoying and flow-breaking enough that people would put it off as long as possible — which would make people realize that the Magic Mouse's battery lasted for weeks on a charge, and so you really never would need to interrupt your flow to charge; you'd just maybe leave it plugged in to charge when you leave work on a Friday night (and even then, only when it occurs to you), and that'd be it. --- One could argue that the truly strange thing, is that Apple has never changed this design, 15 years and one revision later. That's an entire human generation! Presumably people these days know that peripherals can be wireless and have long battery life. But consider: Apple's flagship mousing peripheral — the one shown next to the Magic Keyboard in all product marketing photos — is the Magic Trackpad, not the Magic Mouse. The Magic Trackpad is the first-class option for multitouch interaction with macOS; some more-recent multitouch gestures don't even work on the Magic Mouse. (The Magic Mouse never got \"3D touch\", for one thing.) In other words, the Magic Mouse is basically a forgotten also-ran at this point — something just there on the wall in the Apple Store for those few people who can't stand the idea of using a desktop computer through a giant trackpad. Which leads to an interesting question: what is the user-profile for the person who buys (or is bought) a Magic Mouse in 2024? Well, probably one major user-profile is \"your grandpa, a retiree from a publishing company, who's been using the same computer he brought home from work 20 years ago, until it broke last week — that computer being a Power Mac G5 with a Mighty Mouse; and who has never had a laptop, and so never learned to use a trackpad.\" And if the Magic Mouse user is your grandpa... then said user probably does still need the cord-cutting lesson that the Magic Mouse \"teaches\"! reply afavour 13 hours agorootparent> it made charging annoying and flow-breaking enough that people would put it off as long as possible — which would make people realize that the Magic Mouse's battery lasted for weeks on a charge At a certain point this just reads like Apple apologia. They made a mouse you can’t use while it’s charging as a means to advertise how long the battery lasts? What? reply azinman2 12 hours agorootparentBut it’s not an apology, it’s the right design decision. The battery charges to a usable amount extremely quickly, and if you could plug it in all the time most would, which defeats the point. reply afavour 4 hours agorootparent> if you could plug it in all the time most would, which defeats the point The point of a mouse is to be a usable mouse. If folks care enough for it to be wireless then they can use it that way, but if they don't what's actually wrong with using it plugged in? Screams iPhone 4 era \"holding it the wrong way\". Baffles me why you'd want to provide fewer options for your customer to charge their wireless mouse in order to make them do it the \"right way\". reply derefr 6 minutes agorootparentIf you want to always drive a car with the parking brake on you can — it's your car — but if a driving instructor sees you doing it, they'll give you a demerit. Because you're massively hobbling the car vs. its design space. > in order to make them do it the \"right way\". To be clear, Apple likely didn't want to force people to always use the mouse that way; what they were likely aiming for was a \"silent tutorial\" — like the Super Mario Bros 1-1 \"goombas hurt you, while mushrooms are something you want\" thing. It's just that, in a hardware product, there's no good way to force someone to do something a certain way the first time (in order to teach them), without forcing them to always do it that way. ryandrake 4 hours agorootparentprevWhy should Apple care if I want to leave the device plugged in all the time? How does this choice remotely affect them? Same with this power button: why should Apple care whether or not I power off the device when I’m done using it and turn it back on in the morning? This all just seems like pointless behavior control. reply lelaurent 4 hours agorootparentprevIf you’re using it for gaming, it would be preferable to leave it plugged in to avoid the danger of the battery running empty.

Every product is designed with a specific usage in mind. This is designed to be wireless, hence all of the ways in which it enforces and enables that. The battery lasts a very long time, so even in your work bag it should be fine (although are you then plugging into many different computers to associate it?)

Wireless mice definitely are nicer to use, and you can usually make them charge fast enough that a five minute charge while you take a short break is enough to get you through the day to a proper charge.

This is one of the reasons I’ve started putting all of my devices on power strips with physical switches that de-energize the AC mains.

The normal orientation is fine for most people who want things to be as simple as possible (ie, most Mac users). There is very little reason to ever turn it off. If you still do that frequently for some reason, just leave it in a locatino where the button is still easy to access. reply creddit 17 hours agorootparentprevThe case is also going to radiate heat and turning it upside down will make that less efficient.

Playback works well - up to 60fps. However, export to H.265 creates a lot of Swap. Rendering went with 15-18fps. All videos on a SMB network drive but the GPU was the bottleneck for rendering. Swap was even around 24GB with 5 videos which I tested first. Using 4x4K it went 9 GB before stabilizing at around 2GB. No effects or grading whatsoever - plain 4K60 SDR videos. One single SDR 4K clip renders to 8K at 25fps. Using Superscale 2x makes that 0.5-1fps. For 8K rendering you may be better off with 32GB RAM minimum or trying the M4 Pro model maybe with 24GB.

The M4 CPU isn't really stressed out most of the time. Only multicam and HLG conversations it maxes out. Once I patched my old Dell T1650 BIOS for ReBAR support yet the iGPU of the i5 1135-g7 had similar GPU performance for video as the Intel Arc A380 in the desktop PC. The old PCIe3 speed limited its performance. I heard others reported a smoother replay experience with Apple silicon compared to even a RTX4090. I get some delays when fast scrubbing through a 9 multicam 720p timeline and just 360p proxies. Still impressed compared to what I was used to.

The ancient i5-3570 only allowed 2GB ReBAR, BTW. GPU-Z says ReBAR / 4G is activated and working, Intel Arc Driver does not see it but seems to use it. Some part of the BIOS had to be manually fixed, AFAIR. The PC was given for free, the CPU €11 yet overall I wouldn't recommend the process just for the result.

Because Apple hardware and macOS isn't giving you any advantages over a generic piece of hardware running a Linux distribution. The hardware costs more and is less upgradable than off-the-shelf hardware. Servers should not run desktop environments because they are a waste of resources and widen the attack surface due to having more components installed and running.

I'm not sure how much of those efficiency gains are a product of the design constraints that Apple is not beholden to (external memory, x86 backwards compatibility, other aspects of the AMD64 architecture, etc.), the slightly better process nodes, or superior design. I'm honestly dying to know, but I guess we won't find out, and as far as the products go, it doesn't really matter that much. The end result is a pretty good deal. As a mainly non-Apple user I see the following caveats for my own uses: - I'd love to see better Linux support. (As far as I know, Asahi Linux only covers the M1 and M2 lines, and as amazing of a project as it is, last I looked, it's neither upstreamed nor exactly what one might consider first class. Maybe it's getting there now, though...) - I'm worried about the SSD situation still. It seems like it hasn't amounted to much (yet), but some use cases might be more impacted than others, and once the SSD does finally fail, the machine's dead. This is not how things work in most PCs, even mini PCs, and it's a bit of a hard pill to swallow. - The pricing is great at the baseline, but it gets progressively worse as you go up. The Apple M4 Pro Mac Mini has a baseline price of $1,399.00, which I think is pretty decent for a high-end computer with 24 GiB of RAM. But, it maxes out at 64 GiB of RAM, which is less than half of what I have in my current main machine, and believe me, I use it. That 64 GiB of RAM upgrade costs $600. For comparison, the most expensive 64 GiB DDR5 RAM kit on PCPartPicker is $328.99. Don't get me wrong either, I understand that Apple's unified RAM is part of the secret sauce of how these things are as efficient and small as they are, but at least for my main computer I really don't need things to be this compact, so it's another tradeoff that's really hard to swallow. But on the other hand, for people happy to use macOS as their primary operating system, the M4 line of Macs really does look the best computer Apple has ever produced. (For me, it is rare that I feel compelled to even consider an Apple computer; the last time was with the original M1 Mac Mini, which I did buy, although after some experimentation I mainly just use it for testing things on macOS rather than as a daily driver machine.) There really aren't many caveats especially since the base memory configurations this time around are actually reasonable. I suspect these things could be great on homelab racks if the longevity issues don't wind up being a huge problem. reply JohnTHaller 19 hours agoparentThe SSD in the new small Mac Mini is replaceable, though it is proprietary (not standard NVMe) and uses different physically sized and shaped drives that are incompatible with each other physically between the M4 base version and M4 Pro version. reply MBCook 19 hours agorootparentPlus it’s not like it’s designed to be user accessible.

I am fairly sure this thing is the fastest out there. reply jchw 19 hours agorootparentI don't think there's enough high quality benchmark information to really make a statement like that, but most importantly, I care about both single-core and multi-thread performance. I don't really have any workloads that only use one thread. Comparing the M4 with PC CPUs will be hard. Typically when comparing two PC CPUs, to make the comparison more realistic, you'd set some reasonable similar constraints, like using the same memory kits and so on. However, even without considering overclocking, the actual performance of a given CPU can vary massively depending on the thermals, power delivery, memory and so forth. (It can vary by over 50%. I didn't check but you should be able to see this on benchmark charts that allow user submission.) (However, for what it's worth, I always do at least a bit of mild overclocking personally. Nothing extreme, but what does fit within the power and thermal budget is basically just free performance at the cost of some efficiency, a trade-off I'm happy to make for my main desktop machine.) reply jeffbee 19 hours agorootparentNah that's all pointless trivia. It is dark inside the box. Nobody gives a rip whether the mini is faster because it's got better ram or if it's faster because it's got better arithmetic logic. So you do not have to control things like memory because you don't have a choice anyway. reply jchw 19 hours agorootparentYou don't really seem to understand the point of benchmarks. You're trying to compare the performance between two devices to quantify which one is better at some specific task in some scenario. The tricky part here isn't that people care whether the CPU is better or not, the problem is that on the PC side you can fix the variables between CPUs so that you can just look at the value of individual CPUs, but you can't do that when comparing across PCs and Mac devices. So what do you pick to compare with? There is no correct answer, but there are some answers that are more sensible than others. e.g. you probably don't want to jump massively into another price class. If money is no object and you just want ridiculous multicore performance it's going to be pretty hard to beat EPYC. Yes, the single core performance is going to be worse; it won't probably be the best even among PC parts, but many use cases gladly take that tradeoff. reply rgovostes 20 hours agoprev> If only they didn't put the power button on the bottom.

It's certainly not a deal breaker, but I do find it mildly annoying. The ideal for me would be to have the button easily accessible on the front or top, and have it behave like other devices I use: a short press to sleep/wake, and a long press to initiate shutdown. And when I'm getting up from my desk, I could give it a quick tap to put it to sleep and lock it.

Assuming they refer to the full chips rather than the binned ones, each generation of pro chips has the following number of p and e cores:Model# p-cores# e-cores|--------|-----------|-----------|M2 Pro84| M3 Pro66| M4 Pro104Thus m3 pro has more e-cores and less p-cores than m2 pro thus the big increase in efficiency, while the m4 pro has more p-cores than m2 pro thus the increase. It is all about tradeoffs and, honestly, the result is pretty much expected when you count the cores. I assume there is some improvement per generation, but if the number of cores is not constant, the latter is gonna drive most of the variance generation to generation. reply pier25 17 hours agorootparentYou're only considering the CPU though. reply freehorse 17 hours agorootparentThe numbers in the article cited by the above commenter are about the CPU. reply pier25 16 hours agorootparentYou mean the link I posted? They compare both CPU and GPU. reply scottyah 19 hours agoparentprevIt makes sense that the Pro model is less efficient since it's more focused on performance. reply MBCook 19 hours agoparentprevWait wait wait. That’s comparing a M4 Pro (middle level) to a M3 Air. The Air is a lower power machine with the low spec processor. There is no M4 Pro Air. They have to be using a MacBook Pro. That likely has a bigger display, a display capable of getting way brighter, showing more colors, better speakers, all sorts of other stuff. That’s not a very valid comparison. If anything, the fact that the M4 Pro gets so close to the M3 is impressive. The M3 was on a process that was known to run hot. I strongly suspect that every M4 chip is more efficient than the equivalent M3 chip. reply pier25 18 hours agorootparentThere are multiple comparisons vs multiple chips on both CPU and GPU.

And I think $100 for 10 GbE is surprisingly reasonable for an upgrade from Apple. For comparison, 10 GbE Thunderbolt adapters typically cost about $200 - and while 10 GbE PCIe cards can be bought for less, they tend to be much less power efficient and generate a surprising amount of heat. I actually think it's very commendable that Apple even gives the option to upgrade to 10 GbE on a mass market desktop. I was recently looking to buy a non-Apple Mini PC, and while 2.5 GbE is very common now, 10 GbE is still relatively rare. The options I found were to go with a Minisforum MS-01, which is considerably more expensive than the base M4 Mac Mini w/10 GbE upgrade, or to order something slightly sketchy from Aliexpress. So as soon as Apple announced the new M4 Mac Mini, I went with that instead. reply knodi 19 hours agoprevI dream of Linux on this Mac mini. reply dmitrygr 19 hours agoparentVMs work and you get amazing perf.

Can't upgrade any of the internals, doesn't run Linux easily, no way to use any of the internal components separately, or rebuild them into a different form factor. Imagine being able to directly mount these to VESA behind a dashboard. I have an old M1 Mac Mini I'd love to use as a NAS, but the disk is slightly too small and you can't upgrade it, so it's just useless to me instead.

Thank you! lazyatom 7 hours agoQuite a few comments now about how you can use forwarding or mailing lists to achieve something similar. There are definitely plenty of relatively-simple ways to _distribute_ incoming emails to multiple recipients. But once the messages end up in your personal inbox, it's pretty hard for the other people you are collaborating with (or your family in the scenario here) to participate in the rest of conversation, unless you're willing to be extremely diligent with Cc/Bcc-ing. It's also certainly possible to use things like labels or messages-left-in-draft to try and avoid stepping on each other's toes and coordinate responses. But again, you've got to be diligent. What Jelly aims to do is make it _easy_ for non-technical people (and technical people who want something that \"just works\") to share email smoothly, without having to build the rules themselves or make sure everyone sticks to the system to keep it working well. reply mroset 21 hours agoprevDoes anyone use a tool like this for shared family email? As the kids are getting older and there's email communication from daycare and school and extracurriculars and everything else, the method of \"all communication about X goes to one parent\" is not really scaling. Just using one shared gmail could also work, but requires more communication around \"are you handling that response or am I?\". It seems like fundamentally the same problem as this tool is solving, but when it's for family instead of business, even $30/month starts to feel pretty pricey. reply jmcphers 19 hours agoparentI use Fastmail for this. Here's what we do: - My wife and I each have our own email addresses - We have a third email address that we share with the school (etc.); this email address is not a real inbox but a forwarding address that sends mail to the first two - When email is sent TO this address, the default is to reply FROM the address - When email is sent FROM this address, an Auto BCC rule sends a copy to the other spouse In this way we both get our own personal email addresses, but we have a shared address that goes to both of us, and we know if an email sent to that address has been replied to, what the reply was, etc. reply tjbiddle 15 hours agorootparentJust wanted to give another shout to FastMail. I'm a super happy user. I originally switched over for business reasons as it had a lot of features I liked. The past year, I exported my gmail history to it and setup forwarding so now I'm 100% on it for personal and business. So much cleaner. Paid service - but with all the features + privacy of not being on Google (Well, anything going to my gmail still goes through - but slowly moving away) + they have excellent and fast customer support - all makes it worth it. reply satyamkapoor 6 hours agorootparentprevHi, I don’t really get where to configure the auto bcc rule when sending emails from third email address.

We both have accounts within the school platform. So, what usually happens: 1. Both of us get email 2. One of us sees email before other, may or may not do something about it 3. Possibly one of us fwds the email to the other, creating two copies in one inbox. 4. It's not always clear if (2) results in something happening. And by that I don't mean in (2) that one of us said we would do it. Instead, I'm thinking one step further: we needed to pick a Parent-Teacher conference. How do we know we did it? 5. At some point we might archive/delete emails 6. Many of these emails contain admin dates. Things like half-days, dismissal changes, etc. Usually with dates/times that then need to go into a calendar. So, we try to send each other calendar invites (from personal Gmails) to handle. #6 is often the real problem. We're looking into the Skylight Calender. Some people swear by it.

However, there is always _some_ complexity when introducing a new solution. The simplest solution is generally what people already know and are comfortable with. With that in mind, what benefits does this provide over something like Slack or Discord for small teams? I get those aren't email, but I'd assume the protocol isn't the selling point? As someone who struggles to answer this question myself, I'm genuinely interested in hearing the process which led to this being created. reply cade 19 hours agoparentThe short story is that Good Enough has put a handful of (hopefully) delightful things into the world: https://goodenough.us/ Putting things into the world means getting emails. Being a team means juggling said emails about things amongst several people. Enter the Shared Fastmail Account. \"Oh! A new email. Click. Oh, this isn’t really for me. Mark as unread. Or did someone else already read this, mark as unread, and think it was for me? I guess I will go talk to...\" And, you know, two dozen variations on that theme. It sucked as a way to work together. what benefits does this provide over something like Slack or Discord for small teams? We use Slack at Good Enough. It’s nifty. We even have a Jelly + Slack integration (and we use that too)! That said, the problem I described isn’t really solved by Slack. (Maybe Discord if you’re in a space that can funnel interactions there, but obviously there’s a lot of businesses who aren’t, and there’s a lot of drawbacks to using Discord as your only communication medium.) Email is still widely used and wildly useful. We think being able to collaborate on emails as a team, with clear expectations about who is handling what and visibility on all the back and forth, is really helpful. We’ve been using it to scratch our own itch from day one, and we suspect it will be of interest to others as well!

I'm guessing any replies sent through Jelly would be invisible to someone looking at gmail. reply mlettini 22 hours agoparentGreat question! Two things: 1. Jelly has a way to follow conversations and get notifications about replies and comments. So everyone can follow the convos they care about via Jelly notification emails sent to their personal team email. 2. For teams on our higher tier Royal Jelly plan, we have an IMAP feature that can sync mail sent out of Jelly back into your Gmail. It says \"Coming soon\" on our price table, but it's a working feature in alpha right now, and we already have some customers using it. We'd be happy to help any team get that set up if they need. reply johtso 19 hours agorootparentThe IMAP feature sounds interesting, but as someone who would be interested in exploring the service, but wouldn't be happy going \"all in\" with no way of switching back without losing data, it's a shame it's only planned as a feature in the higher tier. Being able to try a service \"risk free\" seems really important. To start replying to emails in a new service and then lose them if it doesn't work out doesn't sound like a reasonable option. reply lazyatom 7 hours agorootparentThe higher tier also has a trial period, so you can go all-in using the sent mail sync, and then all-out, should you wish. We (Good Enough) would rather help an unhappy customer exit cleanly, than keep you stuck using software you don't like. If this is the only thing stopping you from using the service, get in touch with us and hopefully we can reassure you about how committed we are to helping you leave Jelly with all your data intact, if it turns out to be the best thing for you. reply mathstuf 21 hours agorootparentprevJelly looks really nice for replacing Google Groups for some things at $DAYJOB. However, having to look at yet another website for tasks is annoying. I'm about 90% of the way to \"everything through `mutt`\", so regressing back for such a steep price increase seems…hard to swallow.

    "originBody": "November 12, 2024 Five Unusual Raku Features Junctions, whatevers, hypers, and more! Logic for Programmers is now in Beta! v0.5 marks the official end of alpha! With the new version, all of the content I wanted to put in the book is now present, and all that's left is copyediting, proofreading, and formatting. Which will probably take as long as it took to actually write the book. You can see the release notes in the footnote.1 And I've got a snazzy new cover: (I don't actually like the cover that much but it looks official enough until I can pay an actual cover designer.) \"Five\" Unusual Raku Features Last year I started learning Raku, and the sheer bizarreness of the language left me describing it as a language for gremlins. Now that I've used it in anger for over a year, I have a better way of describing it: Raku is a laboratory for language features. This is why it has five different models of concurrency and eighteen ways of doing anything else, because the point is to see what happens. It also explains why many of the features interact so strangely and why there's all that odd edge-case behavior. Getting 100 experiments polished and playing nicely with each other is much harder than running 100 experiments; we can sort out the polish after we figure out which ideas are good ones. So here are \"five\" Raku experiments you could imagine seeing in another programming language. If you squint. Junctions Junctions are \"superpositions of possible values\". Applying an operation to a junction instead applies it to every value inside the junction. > 2|10 any(2, 10) > 2&10 + 3 all(5, 13) >(1&2) + (10^20) all(one(11, 21), one(12, 22)) As you can probably tell from the alls and anys, junctions are a feature meant for representing boolean formula. There's no way to destructure a junction, and the only way to use it is to collapse it to a boolean first. > (1&2) + (10^20)so (1&2) + (10^20)so (1&2) + (10^20) > 0 False > 16 %% (3&5) ?? \"fizzbuzz\" !! * * The real interesting thing for me is how Raku elegantly uses junctions to represent quantifiers. In most languages, you either have the function all(list[T], T -> bool) or the method [T].all(T -> bool), both of which apply the test to every element of the list. In Raku, though, list.all doesn't take anything, it's just a niladic method that turns the list into a junction. > my $x = .all all(1, 2, 3) > is-prime($x) all(False, True, True) This means we can combine junctions. If Raku didn't already have a unique method, we could build it by saying \"are all elements equal to exactly one element?\" > so {.all == .one}() True > so {.all == .one}() False Whatevers * is the \"whatever\" symbol and has a lot of different roles in Raku.2 Some functions and operators have special behavior when passed a *. In a range or sequence, * means \"unbound\". > 1..* 1..Inf > (2,4,8...*)[17] 262144 The main built-in use, though, is that expressions with * are lifted into anonymous functions. This is called \"whatever-priming\" and produces a WhateverCode, which is indistinguishable from other functions except for the type. > {$_ + 10}(2) 12 > (* + 10)(2) 12 > (^10).map(* % 2) (0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1) There's actually a bit of weird behavior here: if two whatevers appear in the expression, they become separate positional variables. (2, 30, 4, 50).map(* + *) returns (32, 54). This makes it easy to express a tricky Fibonacci definition but otherwise I don't see how it's better than making each * the same value. Regardless, priming is useful because so many Raku methods are overloaded to take functions. You get the last element of a list with l[*-1]. This looks like standard negative-index syntax, but what actually happens is that when [] is passed a function, it passes in list length and looks up the result. So if the list has 10 elements, l[*-1] = l[10-1] = l[9], aka the last element. Similarly, l.head(2) is the first two elements of a list, l.head(*-2) is all-but-the-last-two. We can pass other functions to [], which e.g. makes implementing ring buffers easy. > my @x = ^10 [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9] > @x[95 % *]--; @x [0 1 2 3 4 4 6 7 8 9] Regular Expressions There are two basic standards for regexes: POSIX regexes and Perl-compatible regexes (PCRE). POSIX regexes are a terrible mess of backslashes and punctuation. PCRE is backwards compatible with POSIX and is a more terrible mess of backslashes and punctuation. Most languages follow the PCRE standard, but Perl 6 breaks backwards compatibility with an entirely new regex syntax. The most obvious improvement: composability. In most languages \"combine\" two regexes by concating their strings together, which is terrible for many, many reasons. Raku has the standard \"embed another regex\" syntax: /+/ matches one-or-more of the foo regex without foo \"leaking\" into the top regex. This already does a lot to make regexes more tractable: you can break a complicated regular expression down into simpler and more legible parts. And in fact this is how Raku supports parsing grammars as a builtin language feature. I've only used grammars once but it was quite helpful. Since we're breaking backwards compatibility anyway, we can now add lots of small QOLs. There's a value separator modifier: \\d+ % ',' matches 1 / 1,2 / 1,1,4 but not 1, or 12. Lookaheads and non-capturing groups aren't nonsense glyphs. r1 && r2 only matches strings that match both r1 and r2. Backtracking can be stopped with :. Whitespace is ignored by default and has to be explicitly enabled in match patterns. There's more stuff Raku does with actually processing regular expressions, but the regex notation is something that might actually appear in another language someday. Hyperoperators This is a small one compared to the other features, but it's also the thing I miss most often in other languages. The most basic form l>>.method is basically equivalent to map, except it also recursively descends into sublists. > [1, [2, 3], 4]>>.succ [2 [3 4] 5] This is more useful than it looks because any function call f(list, *args) can be rewritten in \"method form\" list.&f(*args), so >>. becomes the generalized mapping operator. You can use it with whatevers, too. > [1, [2, 3], 4]>>.&(*+1) [2 [3 4] 5] Anyway, the more generalized binary hyperoperator l1 > l23 applies op elementwise to the two lists, looping the shorter list until the longer list is exhausted. >>op>> /[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] > [10, 20] [11 22 13 24 15] > [1, 2, 3, 4, 5][1, 2, 3, 4, 5] >>+>> [10, 20] [11 22 13 24 15] # Also works with single values > [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] > 10 [11 12 13 14 15] # Does weird things with nested lists too > [1, [2, 3], 4, 5] > [10, 20] [11 [22 23] 14 25] Also for some reason the hyperoperators have separate behaviors on two hashes, either applying op to the union/intersection/hash difference. Anyway it's a super weird (meta)operator but it's also quite useful! It's the closest thing I've seen to J verbs outside an APL. I like using it to run the same formula on multiple possible inputs at once. (20 * 10 > (21, 24)) > (10, 100) (1790 17600) Incidentally, it's called the hyperoperator because it evaluates all of the operations in parallel. Explicit loops can be parallelized by prefixing them with hyper. Pair Syntax I've talked about pairs a little in this newsletter, but the gist is that Raku hashes are composed of a set of pairs key => value. The pair is the basis type, the hash is the collection of pairs. There's also a ton of syntactic sugar for concisely specifying pairs via \"colon syntax\": > my $x = 3; :$x x => 3 > :a a => \"$x\" > :a($x) a => 3 > :3a a => 3 The most important sugars are :key and :!key, which map to key => True and key => False. This is a really elegant way to add flags to a methods! Take the definition of match: method match($pat, :continue(:$c), :pos(:$p), :global(:$g), :overlap(:$ov), :exhaustive(:$ex), :st(:$nd), :rd(:$th), :$nth, :$x --> Match) Probably should also mention that in a definition, :f(:$foo) defines the parameter $foo but also aliases it to :f, so you can set the flag with :f or :foo. Colon-pairs defined in the signature can be passed in anywhere, or even stuck together: > \"abab\".match(/../) ｢ab｣ > \"abab\".match(/../, :g) (｢ab｣ ｢ab｣) > \"abab\".match(/../, :g, :ov) (｢ab｣ ｢ba｣ ｢ab｣) # Out of order stuck together > \"abab\".match(:g:ov, /../) (｢ab｣ ｢ba｣ ｢ab｣) So that leads to extremely concise method configuration. Definitely beats match(global=True, overlap=True)! And for some reason you can place keyword arguments after the function call: > \"abab\".match(:g, /../):ov:2nd ｢ba｣ The next-gen lab: Slangs and RakuAST These are features I have no experience in and certainly are not making their way into other languages, but they really expand the explorable space of new features. Slangs are modifications to the Raku syntax. This can be used for things like modifying loop syntax, changing identifiers, or adding actors or DNA sequences to the base language. I barely understand RakuAST. I think the idea is that all Raku expressions can be parsed as an AST from inside Raku itself. > Q/my $x; $x++/.AST RakuAST::StatementList.new( RakuAST::Statement::Expression.new( expression => RakuAST::VarDeclaration::Simple.new( sigil => \"\\$\", desigilname => RakuAST::Name.from-identifier(\"x\") ) ), RakuAST::Statement::Expression.new( expression => RakuAST::ApplyPostfix.new( operand => RakuAST::Var::Lexical.new(\"\\$x\"), postfix => RakuAST::Postfix.new(\"++\") ) ) ) This allows for things like writing Raku in different languages: say Q/my $x; put $x/.AST.DEPARSE(\"NL\") mijn $x; zeg-het $x Bonus experiment Raku comes with a \"Rakudo Star\" installation, which comes with a set of blessed third party modules preinstalled. I love this! It's a great compromise between the maintainer burdens of a large standard library and the user burdens of making everybody find the right packages in the ecosystem.

Just curious, how do you count 5 concurrency models? Based on your link, I'd count three: Promises, Supplys, and Channels (and I probably wouldn't call them different concurrency models, since they're all basically actor-driven. But that may just be quibbling). And 3 approaches for concurrency doesn't feel like all that many compared to other languages (cf. JavaScript, which has at least that many). Or are you counting the \"low-level APIs\" as concurrency models too? If so, that doesn't seem right. Any high-level abstraction will necessarily be built on something lower-level, and there's no reason to wall-off the lower-level API from end users – so long as it's marked as \"should be avoided in user code\", as those APIs are in the docs you linked. Or maybe I'm just overthinking a joke :) Either way, thanks again for the post. Here's hoping it helps motivate me to actually blog a bit more myself! Reply Report Comment and Subscribe",

    "commentBody": "Unusual Raku Features (buttondown.com/hillelwayne)246 points by leontrolski 21 hours agohidepastfavorite137 comments tolmasky 15 hours agoI implemented something similar to the compositional regular expressions feature described here for JavaScript a while ago (independently, so semantics may not be the same), and it is one of the libraries I find myself most often bringing into other projects years later. It gets you a tiny bit closer to feeling like you have a first-class parser in the language. Here is an example of implementing media type parsing with regexes using it: https://runkit.com/tolmasky/media-type-parsing-with-template... \"templated-regular-expression\" on npm, GitHub: https://github.com/tolmasky/templated-regular-expression To be clear, programming languages should just have actual parsers and you shouldn't use regular expressions for parsers. But if you ARE going to use a regular expression, man is it nice to break it up into smaller pieces. reply b2gills 11 hours agoparent\"Actual parsers\" aren't powerful enough to be used to parse Raku. Raku regular expressions combined with grammars are far more powerful, and if written well, easier to understand than any \"actual parser\". In order to parse Raku with an \"actual parser\" it would have to allow you to add and remove things from it as it is parsing. Raku's \"parser\" does this by subclassing the current grammar adding or removing them in the subclass, and then reverting back to the previous grammar at the end of the current lexical scope. In Raku, a regular expression is another syntax for writing code. It just has a slightly different default syntax and behavior. It can have both parameters and variables. If the regular expression syntax isn't a good fit for what you are trying to do, you can embed regular Raku syntax to do whatever you need to do and return right back to regular expression syntax. It also has a much better syntax for doing advanced things, as it was completely redesigned from first principles. The following is an example of how to match at least one `A` followed by exactly that number of `B`s and exactly that number of `C`s. (Note that bare square brackets [] are for grouping, not for character classes.) my $string = 'AAABBBCCC'; say $string ~~ / ^ # match at least one A # store the result in a named sub-entry $ = [ A+ ] {} # update result object # create a lexical var named $repetition :my $repetition = $.chars(); #= [ B ** {$repetition} ] $ = [ C ** {$repetition} ] $ /; Result: ｢AAABBBCCC｣ A => ｢AAA｣ B => ｢BBB｣ C => ｢CCC｣ The result is actually a very extensive object that has many ways to interrogate it. What you see above is just a built-in human readable view of it. In most regular expression syntaxes to match equal amounts of `A`s and `B`s you would need to recurse in-between `A` and `B`. That of course wouldn't allow you to also do that for `C`. That also wouldn't be anywhere as easy to follow as the above. The above should run fairly fast because it never has to backtrack, or recurse. When you combine them into a grammar, you will get a full parse-tree. (Actually you can do that without a grammar, it is just easier with one.) To see an actual parser I often recommend people look at JSON::TINY::Grammar https://github.com/moritz/json/blob/master/lib/JSON/Tiny/Gra... Frankly from my perspective much of the design of \"actual parsers\" are a byproduct of limited RAM on early computers. The reason there is a separate tokenization stage was to reduce the amount of RAM used for the source code so that further stages had enough RAM to do any of the semantic analysis, and eventual compiling of the code. It doesn't really do that much to simplify any of the further stages in my view. The JSON::Tiny module from above creates the native Raku data structure using an actions class, as the grammar is parsing. Meaning it is parsing and compiling as it goes. reply xigoi 15 minutes agorootparentWhy are they called regular expressions if they can parse non-regular languages? reply tolmasky 4 hours agorootparentprevI don't think we disagree here. To clarify, my statement about using \"actual parsers\" over regexes was more directed at my own library than Raku. Since I had just posted a link on how to \"parse\" media types using my library, I wanted to immediately follow that with a word of caution of \"But don't do that! You shouldn't be using (traditional) regexes to parse! They are the wrong tool for that. How unfortunate it is that most languages have a super simple syntax for (traditional/PCRE) regexes and not for parsing.\" I had seen in the article that Raku had some sort of \"grammar\" concept, so I was kind of saying \"oh it looks like Raku may be tackling that to.\" Hopefully that clarifies that I was not necessarily making any statement about whether or not to use Raku regexes, which I don't pretend to know well enough to qualify to give advice around. Just for the sake of interesting discussion however, I do have a few follow up comments to what you wrote: 1. Aside from my original confusing use of the term \"regexes\" to actually mean \"PCRE-style regexes\", I recognize I also left a fair amount of ambiguity by referring to \"actual parsers\". Given that there is no \"true\" requirement to be a parser, what I was attempting to say is something along the lines of: a tool designed to transform text into some sort of structured data, as opposed to a tool designed to match patterns. Again, from this alone, seems like Raku regexes qualify just fine. 2. That being said, I do have a separate issue with using regexes for anything, which is that I do not think it is trivial to reason about the performance characteristics of regexes. IOW, the syntax \"doesn't scale\". This has already been discussed plenty of course, but suffice it to say that backtracking has proven undeniably popular, and so it seems an essential part of what most people consider regexes. Unfortunately this can lead to surprises when long strings are passed in later. Relatedly, I think regexes are just difficult to understand in general (for most people). No one seems to actually know them all that well. They venture very close to \"write-only languages\". Then people are scared to ever make a change in them. All of this arguably is a result of the original point that regexes are optimized for quick and dirty string matching, not to power gcc's C parser. This is all of course exacerbated by the truly terrible ergonomics, including not being able to compose regexes out of the box, etc. Again, I think you make a case here that Raku is attempting to \"elevate\" the regex to solve some if not all of these problems (clearly not only composable but also \"modular\", as well as being able to control backtracking, etc.) All great things! I'd still be apprehensive about the regex \"atoms\" since I do think that regexes are not super intuitive for most people. But perhaps I've reversed cause and effect and the reason they're not intuitive is because of the state they currently exist in in most languages, and if you could write them with Raku's advanced features, regexes would be no more unintuitive than any other language feature, since you aren't forced to create one long unterminated 500-character regex for anything interesting. In other words, perhaps the \"confusing\" aspects of regexes are much more incidental to their \"API\" vs. an essential consequence of the way they describe and match text. 3. I'd like to just separately point out that many aspects of what you mentioned was added to regexes could be added to other kinds of parsers as well. IOW, \"actual parsers\" could theoretically parse Raku, if said \"actual parsers\" supported the discussed extensions. For example, there's no reason PEG parsers couldn't allow you to fall into dynamic sub-languages. Perhaps you did not mean to imply that this couldn't be the case, but I just wanted to make sure to point out that these extensions you mention appear to have much more generally applicable than they are perhaps given credit for by being \"a part of regexes in Raku\" (or maybe that's not the case at all and it was just presented this way in this comment for brevity, totally possible since I don't know Raku). I'll certainly take a closer look at the full Raku grammar stuff since I've written lots of parser extensions that I'd be curious have analogues in Raku or might make sense to add to it, or alternatively interesting other ideas that can be taken from Raku. I will say that RakuAST is something I've always wanted languages to have, so that alone is very exciting! reply ogogmad 6 hours agorootparentprevI imagine this could be understood as making use of a monad. Right? The main problem with generalised regexes is that you can't match them in linear time worst-case. I'm wondering if this is addressed at all by Raku. reply jerf 4 hours agorootparentA \"monad\" is not really a \"thing\" you can make use of, because a monad is a type of thing. Think \"iterator\"; an iterator is not a thing itself, it is a type of thing that things can be. There is probably a monad you could understand this as being, a specific one, but \"monad\" itself is not a way to understand it. And just as you can understand any given Iterator by simply understanding it directly, whatever \"monad\" you might use to understand this process can be simply understood directly without reference to the \"monad\" concept. reply antononcube 5 hours agorootparentprev> I imagine this could be understood as making use of a monad.

Sign me up for leaving the industry before I ever have to maintain a Raku codebase. reply 7thaccount 4 hours agoparentThat's a fair reaction to the post if you haven't looked at any normal Raku code. If you look at any of the introductory Raku books, it seems a LOT like Python with a C-like syntax. By that I mean the syntax is more curly-brace oriented, but the ease of use and built-in data structures and OO features are all very high level stuff. I think if you know any other high level scripting language that you would find Raku pretty easy to read for comparable scripts. I find it pretty unlikely that the majority of people would use the really unusual stuff in normal every day code. Raku is more flexible (more than one way to do things), but it isn't arcane looking for the normal stuff I've seen. I hope that helps. reply maleldil 2 hours agorootparentSure, but the fact that weird stuff is possible means that someone, at some point, will try to use it in your codebase. This might be prevented if you have a strong code review culture, but if the lead dev in the project wants to use something unusual, chances are no one will stop them.

And it's a bit funny because I'm usually against unnecessary complexity, and here's a language that seems to have embraced it and become a giant castle of language features that I could spend weeks studying. Maybe it's because Raku's features were actually well thought-out, unlike the incidental \"doesn't actually buy me anything, just makes the code hard to deal with\" complexity I have to deal at work day in and day out. Maybe if Java had a few of these features back in the day people wouldn't've felt the need to construct these monstrous annotation soup frameworks in it. reply b2gills 11 hours agorootparentJava inspired the Design Patterns book. Every Design Pattern is a workaround for a missing feature. What that missing feature is, isn't always obvious. For example the Singleton Design Pattern is a workaround for missing globals or dynamic variables. (A dynamic variable is sort of like a global where you get to have your own dynamic version of it.) If Raku has a missing feature, you can add it by creating a module that modifies the compiler to support that feature. In many cases you don't even need to go that far. Of course there are far fewer missing features in Raku than Java. If you ever needed a Singleton in Raku (which you won't) you can do something like this: role Singleton { method new (|) { once callsame } } class Foo does Singleton { has $.n is required } say Foo.new( n => 1 ).n; say Foo.new( n => 2 ).n; That prints `1` twice. The way it works is that the `new` method in Singleton always gets called because it is very generic as it has a signature of `:(|)`. It then calls the `new` method in the base class above `Foo` (`callsame` \"calls\" the next candidate using the \"same\" arguments). The result then gets cached by the `once` statement. There are actually a few limitations to doing it this way. For one, you can't create a `new` method in the actual class, or any subclasses. (Not that you need to anyway.) It also may not interact properly with other roles. There are a variety of other esoteric limitations. Of course none of that really matters because you would never actually need, or want to use it anyway. Note that `once` basically stores its value in the next outer frame. If that outer frame gets re-entered it will run again. (It won't in this example as the block associated with Foo only gets entered into once.) Some people expect `once` to run only once ever. If it did that you wouldn't be able to reuse `Singleton` in any other class. What I find funny is that while Java needs this Design Pattern, it is easier to make in Raku, and Raku doesn't need it anyway. reply kasey_junk 6 hours agorootparentIf you mean Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable OO software by Gamma et al, it was published in 1994. Java came out in 1995. The Patterns book was originally a C++ text. All programming languages have design patterns, they aren’t patterns as in “templates you should follow”, they are patterns as in “concepts you will see frequently for solving classes of problems”. The Design Patterns book was a bestiary not a guide to replacement features. reply TOGoS 3 hours agorootparentJava does have a particular blend of features and lack of features that has led to the bloated, boilerplate-laden, inflationary framework ecosystem around it that is worse that I've seen in any other language. Lack of stack-allocated structs leads to object pooling. Lack of named arguments combined with the tediousness of writing `this.x = x` over and over, along with the reflection system that Java does provide leads to IoT frameworks that muck about in your private variables and/or generate objects \"for you\"[1]. Lack of a way to mark object trees as immutable short of duplicating all the constituent classes leads to everyone generally assuming that everything is and moreover should be mutable, necessitating complex systems for isolating changes to object graphs (e.g. the way Hibernate supports transactions). Etc, etc. I wrote a list of these things somewhere. [1] \"It does X for you\" is a phrase I've heard too many times from coworkers trying to sell me on some framework that we didn't need. \"Oh yeah, it does an easy job for me an in exchange I have an incomprehensible spaghetti mess to deal with, thanks.\" Being the only person in the room who notices the complexity monster growing bigger and bigger is a never-ending source of frustration. Record classes alleviate the pain of writing immutable data object classes but are unfortunately late to the party. reply orbisvicis 6 hours agorootparentprevI'm not so sure every design pattern corresponds to a missing feature. For example, what feature would the Observer design pattern correspond to? reply chucksmash 3 hours agorootparent\"Design patterns are really Band-Aids for missing language features\" comes from a 1996 Peter Norvig presentation[0][1]: > Some suggest that design patterns may be a sign that features are missing in a given programming language (Java or C++ for instance). Peter Norvig demonstrates that 16 out of the 23 patterns in the Design Patterns book (which is primarily focused on C++) are simplified or eliminated (via direct language support) in Lisp or Dylan. [0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern#Critic... [1]: slide 9 of PDF https://www.norvig.com/design-patterns/design-patterns.pdf reply jerf 4 hours agorootparentprevThe feature that Observer would correspond to is simply Observers. Some of the patterns may happen to correspond to different names, but they don't all need different names or weird mappings, many of them are just \"and now it's a feature instead of a set of classes\". That said, while the point \"a design pattern is a feature missing from a language\" has some validity on its own terms, the implied \"and therefore a language is deficient if it has design patterns because those could be features\" is nonsense. A language has some set of features. These features have an exponential combination of possibilities, and a smaller, but still exponential, set of those are useful. For every feature one lifts from \"design pattern\" and tries to put into the language, all that happens is an exponential number of other \"features\" are now closer to hand and are now \"design patterns\". This process does not end, and this process does not even complete enumerating all the possible useful patterns before the language has passed all human ability to understand it... or implement it. Moreover, the argument that \"all design patterns should be lifted to features\" ignores the fact that features carry costs. Many kinds of costs. And those costs generally increase the cost of all the features around them. The costs become overwhelming. reply kazinator 3 hours agorootparentprevIn a language with a sufficiently expressive object system or other features such as macros we could turn the Observer pattern into a library. To get objects to participate in the pattern we then just somehow declare that they are observers or subjects. Then they are endowed with all the right methods. Simple inheritance might be used, but if your Observer or Subject are already derived then you need multiple inheritance to inject the pattern to them. Or some other way of injecting that isn't inheritance. In C++, the CRTP might be used. Language features don't necessarily make the design pattern's concept go away, just the laborious coding pattern that must be executed to instantiate the pattern. Writing a design pattern by hand is like writing a control flow pattern by hand in a machine language. When you work in assembly language on some routine, you may have the concept of a while loop in your head. That's your design pattern for the loop. The way you work the while loop pattern into code is that you write testing and branching instructions to explicit labels, in a particular, recognizable arrangement. A macro assembler could give you something more like an actual while loop and of course higher level languages give it to you. The concept doesn't go away just the coding pattern. The meaning of \"pattern\" in the GoF book refers not only to concepts like having objects observe each other, but also refers to the programmer having to act as a human compiler for translating the concept into code by following a detailed recipe. Because GoF design patterns are all object-based, they're able to use naming for all the key parts coming from the recipe. When you read code based on one of these patterns, the main reason why you can see the pattern is that it uses the naming from the book. If you change your naming, it's a lot harder to recognize the code as being an instance of a pattern. reply Pannoniae 6 hours agorootparentprevevents/reactive programming? reply agumonkey 5 hours agorootparentand further down the research path, chemical programming (forgot the name of the languages) reply redrobein 11 hours agorootparentprevI think it has to do more with familiarity than complexity.

Good programmers need to develop a mental model of how a language works. Needing to do geometric sequences as syntax like that is clearly a parlor trick, a marginal use case.

What other numbers will do something I didn't expect when I put them in? What other patterns will it implement?\" Yes, you can read the docs, and learn, but we also know this interacts with all sorts of things. I'm not telling you why you should be horrified, I'm explaining why on first glance this is something that looks actually quite unappealing and scary to a certain set of programmers.

Basically creating a Domain Specific Language. Raku isn't necessarily that language. What it is, is a language which you can modify into being a DSL for solving your hard problem. Raku is designed so that easy things are easy and hard things are possible. Of course it goes even farther, as some \"hard\" things are actually easy. (Hard from the perspective of trying to do it in some other language.) Lets say you want a sequence of Primes. At first you think sieve of Eratosthenes. Since I am fluent in Raku, I just write this instead: ( 2..∞ ).grep( *.is-prime ) This has the benefit that it doesn't generate any values until you ask for them.

Regarding their utility, at their most useful level (in my experience), junctions provide for things like: $string ~~ “this”|”that”|”other” This is the same as writing $string eq “this” || $string eq “that” || $string eq “other” They have many other uses but that’s the most common one that I tend to see in practice. reply Joker_vD 2 hours agorootparent> I’m not sure that I see the connection that you are making here. Can you elaborate? Back when I had to write PowerShell scripts, I constantly found that piping an array to some command would almost always make that command to be invoked once for every item in array, instead of being invoked once and given the whole array as a single input. Sometimes it's the latter that you need, so the workaround is to make a new, single-element array with the original array as its only element, and pipe this into the command. reply ab5tract 1 hour agorootparentGot it, that makes sense based on the link. In Raku, the equivalent would be: my @a = [1,2],; The connection to junctions is still not very clear to me, however. A junction doesn’t really have any correlation to a single element version of a list. As a super-position of potential values, it doesn’t have many correlaries in other languages. For example, part of the original concept of junctions involved parallel evaluation of junction elements in an expression but that turned out to be less useful than hoped for in practice. reply Joker_vD 51 minutes agorootparentAn array in Powershell, when piped to a command, automatically get this command invoked for each of the array's element and the results are combined into a new output array, which can be piped further. A junction in Raku, when given as an argument to a function, automatically applies this function to each of the junction's element and the results are combined into a new junction as a result. I don't know, seems like a pretty clear parallel to me. And since the Powershell's behaviour is quite often undesirable, I agreed with the original commenter that perhaps the junctions could also be somewhat annoying to use instead of just working normal lists: after all, \"s in ('this', 'that', 'other')\" is about just as clear as \"$string ~~ “this”|”that”|”other”\" but doesn't require support for magical self-destructuring containers in the language. reply postepowanieadm 9 hours agoprevAhh, perl operators! My favorite was goatse operator: =()= that assigned(no pun intended) length of an array if I recall correctly. reply ab5tract 6 hours agoparentI dream of a day where one can post a Raku article on HNN and not encounter a comments section full of digressions into discussing Perl. There is some sense to it by means of comparison, but the constant conflation of the two becomes tiresome. But in that spirit, let's compare: The =()= \"operator\" is really a combination of Perl syntax[^1] that achieves the goal of converting list context to scalar context. This isn't necessary to determine the length of an array (`my $elems = @array` or, in favor of being more explicity, `my $elems = 0+@array`). It is, however, useful in Perl for the counting of more complex list contexts on the RHS. Let's use some examples from it's documentation to compare to Raku. Perl: my $n =()= \"abababab\" =~ /a/g; # $n == 4 Raku: my $n = +(\"abababab\" ~~ m:g/'a'/); # $n == 4 # Alternatively... my $n = (\"abababab\" ~~ m:g/'a'/).elems; That's it. `+` / `.elems` are literally all you ever need to know for gathering a count of elements. The quotes around 'a' in the regex are optional but I always use them because I appreciate denoting which characters are literal in regexes (Note also that the regex uses the pair syntax mentioned in OP via `m:g`. Additional flags are provided as pairs, eg `m:g:i`). Another example. Perl: my $count =()= split /:/, \"ab:ab:ab\"; # $count == 3 Raku: my $count = +\"ab:ab:ab\".split(':'); # $count == 3 While precedence can at times be a conceptual hindrance, it's also nice to save some parentheses where it is possible and legible to do so. Opinions differ on these points, of course. Note also that `Str.split` can take string literals as well as regexes.

This attempt to fuse higher-order functional programming with magic special behaviors from Perl comes off to me as quixotic. HOP works because you're gluing together extremely simple primitives—ordinary pure functions. You can build big things fearlessly because you perfectly understand the simple bricks they're made of. But here: magic functions—which behave differently on lists-of-scalars vs. lists-of-lists, by special default logic—that's not a good match for HOP. Now you have two major axes of complexity: a vertical one of functional abstraction, and a horizontal one of your \"different kinds of function and function application\". reply j16sdiz 14 hours agorootparentDoing High-Order Programming in perl is not something new. There is a full book about it: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-Order_Perl Whats nee in Raku is putting them together with other experimental features as first class citizens reply b2gills 13 hours agorootparentprev>> magic functions—which behave differently on lists-of-scalars vs. lists-of-lists by special default logic ... That is completely the wrong way to think about it. Before the Great List Refactor those were dealt with the same by most operations (as you apparently want it). And that was the absolute biggest problem that needed to be changed at the time. There were things that just weren't possible to do no matter how I tried. The way you want it to work DID NOT WORK! It was terrible. Making scalars work as single elements was absolutely necessary to make the language usable. At the time of the GLR that was the single biggest obstacle preventing me from using Raku for anything. It also isn't some arbitrary default logic. It is not arbitrary, and calling it \"default\" is wrong because that insinuates that it is possible to turn it off. To get it to do something else with a scalar, you have to specifically unscalarify that item in some manner. (While you did not specifically say 'arbitrary', it certainly seems like that is your position.) Let's say you have a list of families, and you want to treat each family as a group, not as individuals. You have to scalarize each family so that they are treated as a single item. If you didn't do that most operations will interact with individuals inside of families, which you didn't want. In Raku a single item is also treated as a list with only one item in it depending on how you use it. (Calling `.head` on a list returns the first item, calling it on an item returns the item as if it had been the first item in a list.) Being able to do the reverse and have a list act as single item is just as important in Raku. While you may not understand why it works the way it works, you are wrong if you think that it should treat lists-of-scalars the same as lists-of-lists. >> This attempt to fuse higher-order functional programming with magic special behaviors from Perl comes off to me as quixotic. It is wrong to call it an attempt, as it is quite successful at it. There is a saying in Raku circles that Raku is strangely consistent. Rather than having a special feature for this and another special feature for that, there is one generic feature that works for both. In Python there is a special syntax inside of a array indexing operation. Which (as far as I am aware) is the only place that syntax works, and it is not really like anything else in the language. There is also a special syntax in Raku designed for array indexing operations, but it is just another slightly more concise way to create a lambda/closure. You can use that syntax anywhere you want a lambda/closure. Conversely if you wanted to use one of the other lambda/closure syntaxes in an array indexing operation you could. The reason that we say that Raku is strangely consistent, is that basically no other high level language is anywhere near as consistent. There is almost no 'magic special behaviors'. There is only the behavior, and that behavior is consistent regardless of what you give it. There are features in Perl that are magic special behaviors. Those special behaviors were specifically not copied into Raku unless there was a really good reason. (In fact I can't really think of any at the moment that were copied.) Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. So you saying that it is magic is only really saying that you don't understand it. It could be magic, or it could be advanced technology, either way it would appear to be magic. In my early days of playing with Raku I would regularly try to break it by using one random feature with another. I often expected it to break. Only it almost never did. The features just worked. It also generally worked the way I thought it should. The reason you see it as quixotic is that you see a someone tilting at a windmill and assuming they are insane. The problem is that it maybe it isn't actually a windmill, and maybe you are just looking at it from the wrong perspective. reply maxwelljoslyn 13 hours agorootparentThat concept of \"strange consistency\" reminds me of my experience writing Clojure, for some reason. reply tincholio 9 hours agorootparentNil punning in Clojure gives you that kind of experience, for example.

    "originBody": "Free-Range Kids Mom Jailed for Letting 10-Year-Old Walk Alone to Town \"I was not panicking as I know the roads and know he is mature enough to walk there without incident,\" says Brittany Patterson. Lenore Skenazy11.11.2024 4:40 PM Share on FacebookShare on XShare on RedditShare by emailPrint friendly versionCopy page URL Media Contact & Reprint Requests Brittany Patterson (Brittany Patterson) It was dinnertime on October 30, 2024, when police handcuffed Brittany Patterson in front of three of her four children and drove her to the station in Fannin County, Georgia. She was then fingerprinted, photographed, and dressed in an orange jumpsuit. Hours earlier, around noon, Patterson had driven her eldest son to a medical appointment. Her youngest son, 11-year-old Soren, intended to come along but wasn't around when it was time to leave. \"I figured he was in the woods, or at grandma's house,\" says Patterson, who lives on 16 acres with her kids and her father. (Her husband works out of state). There is no shortage of family in the vicinity. Patterson's mother and sisters live just two minutes away. Soren, however, was not playing in the woods. He had decided to walk to downtown Mineral Bluff, a town of just 370 people. It's not quite a mile from his house. A woman who saw him walking alongside the road—speed limit: 25 in some places, 35 in others—asked him if he was OK. He said yes. Nevertheless, she called the police. A female sheriff picked up the boy and called Patterson. \"She asked me if I knew he was downtown and I said no,\" says Patterson. Patterson was upset that Soren had gone to town without letting anyone know, but says there was hardly reason to worry. \"I was not panicking as I know the roads and know he is mature enough to walk there without incident,\" she says. The sheriff disagreed. \"She kept mentioning how he could have been run over, or kidnapped or 'anything' could have happened,\" recalls Patterson. The sheriff drove Soren home and left him with his grandfather. After returning to the house, Patterson scolded her son—and that, she thought, was that. But at 6:30 p.m. that night, the sheriff returned with another officer. They told Patterson to turn around and put her hands behind her back. As three of her kids watched, Patterson was handcuffed. The sheriff took her purse and phone, put her in the cruiser, and hauled her off to jail. To Patterson, none of this made sense. She had grown up in the area with plenty of unsupervised time to wander and play and was raising her kids that way, too. \"The mentality here is more Free-Range,\" she says. Patterson was soon released on a $500 bail. The next day, a case manager from the Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) came out for a home visit, and even went to interview Patterson's oldest son at his school. The case manager told Patterson that everything seemed fine, but declined to comment to Reason. A few days later, DFCS presented Patterson with a \"safety plan\" for her to sign. It would require her to delegate a \"safety person\" to be a \"knowing participant and guardian\" and watch over the children whenever she leaves home. The plan would also require Patterson to download an app onto her son's phone allowing for his location to be monitored. (The day when it will be illegal not to track one's kids is rapidly approaching.) Patterson did not want to be compelled to track her son. Recalling a similar case, she contacted attorney David DeLugas. DeLugas is the head of ParentsUSA, a nonprofit that often provides pro bono legal help to parents wrongly arrested and prosecuted for child neglect. A GoFundMe has been established to help ParentsUSA cover the Pattersons' legal expenses. As Patterson's counsel, DeLugas called the assistant district attorney (ADA) to discuss the case. He recorded the conversation, which is legal in Georgia. The ADA told DeLugas that if Patterson would sign the safety plan, the criminal charges would be dropped. DeLugas responded that if Patterson had to sign a safety plan simply because her son walked someplace without her knowing his exact location, it would stop him from visiting friends or having any independence whatsoever. But the ADA maintained that Soren had been in danger, and thus a safety plan was necessary. The matter was left unsettled. With safety plans, the veiled threat is that if you don't sign, your children could be taken away, says DeLugas. In this case, he says, the unspoken deal seems to be: Sign it and the state won't prosecute. If the state does prosecute, Patterson could face a reckless conduct charge, a $1,000 fine, and a year in jail. DeLugas would like to see Georgia pass a law that permits the authorities to check up on kids and then leave them be as long as they aren't hurt, in distress, or in actual, immediate danger from an identifiable source. Meanwhile, as if this case could not get weirder, DCFS just mailed Soren a birthday card signed by the case manager. Soren turned 11 over the weekend. Birthday greetings do not change the facts. Patterson knows that refusing to sign the safety plan could get her in trouble. But she is resolute. \"I will not sign,\" she says.",

In other hand despite the US has never been the role model of safety or courteousness towards each other yet the seemingly increasing trend of gun and drug related violence could cause short circuit in the head of those overloaded, especially when they are responsible and scrutinised by a litigious society for any and every tiny mishap with inflated theoretical consequences that should have been precluded with tenths of seconds reaction time and infallible divination. reply DoodahMan 20 hours agoparentprevyep, we're old fogies now. at age 9 my best friend and i would ride our bikes about 5 miles to the beach. no cell phones. no arrests. no problems. we'd ride our gas-powered scooters to the gas station for slushies. we too played in the woods. i don't understand what changed or why kids today can't do anything on their own. it does not seem good for their development, which in turn does not seem good for the future of our country. reply ranger_danger 19 hours agorootparentIt could be that mass perception of crime levels is higher than it actually is (statistics say it has only gotten better over the years), possibly due to the number of negative media stories produced all day every day. Keep in mind that the \"majority of people\" are not informed skeptics like you and me, they can barely use a computer and largely believe what biased mass media tells them to believe.

That's too much of a generalization. There are obviously people who do think that way. But there are also a lot who do not, including the mother, who said \"I was not panicking as I know the roads and know he is mature enough to walk there without incident.\" This situation is ridiculous, of course. But the USA is huge, and you can probably find pretty much any or every attitude and approach to life here. reply spwa4 21 hours agorootparentIt's not based on this incident, it's based on this incident happening and on the fact that there are laws making this possible, plus zero checks on the people doing it. Nobody saying \"this is insane, stop it\". This was voted in, in theory, by the majority of the US population. Oh, and of course that they're doing it. After all, they're not doing this of their own volition. They're paid by the government. In other words, by the majority of the US population. reply andrewl 18 hours agorootparentWell, the mother who was arrested doesn't agree with the policy. I wouldn't be surprised if she is saying it's insane, and it should be stopped. She got a lawyer to help push back against the charges. This was voted in, in theory, by the majority of the US population. The laws vary state by state, and probably by region within states. So this seems to be a law in Fannin County, Georgia. It might not even apply to all of Georgia, much less the entire country. It certainly does not apply in the city I live in. It might apply in other parts of the state I live in. And it would not have been put to the entire country for a vote. reply nine_k 22 hours agoparentprevSee, the USA has 350 million people, and fifty states with materially different local norms. With this scale and amount of variety, \"one in a million\" freak incidents ought to be registered all the time. But, being freak incidents, they get amplified and thus seem to represent the entire country in the eyes of distant observers, foreigners, or just people from far enough away within the US. Ironically, this is the same mechanism that magnifies every freak incident in daily life and gives it disproportionate news coverage. It's sometimes useful to draw attention to a rare problem, but more often it's just to pump up the audience's emotions and thus drive up \"engagement\" (views, coincident ad impressions, contextual ad clicks). This magnification, if not dampened by some rational thought, leads to people, including officials, mortally afraid that \"anything could happen\" with an unattended child on the street, and over-reacting; jail time for a parent is definitely worse for a kid that walking alone on the streets for some time. But again, talking about \"the USA lifestyle\" is about as productive as speaking about \"the European cuisine\". The lifestyle is highly varied; I myself is not a fan of transactional suburban SUV lifestyle, hence mine, and that of my neighbors, is vastly different. reply krisoft 22 hours agorootparent> With this scale and amount of variety, \"one in a million\" freak incidents ought to be registered all the time. I’m not sure “one in a million” and “freak incident” is the right mental model with this case. What is noteworthy that a whole series of people, most of them professionals, thought an unatended child walking is noteworthy and they should do something about it. The busybody who thought they should report it, then the sherif who thought they should respond to that report then further thought they should do something about it and then further thought to go back and arrest the parrent, then the other officer who didn’t say “hey what are you doing, are you ok?”, then the child protection services who recommended the tracking app, and then the prosecutor who provides the legal muscle to back this insanity. Yes it might be a one in a million freak event that all these people assembled themselves into a conga line of crazyness. But they had these beliefs even before the boy started walking. How many others have similar ideas to them? You think these 5 are the only ones? reply nine_k 21 hours agorootparentI agree that the idea that streets are dangerous for kids before 12 is not very sane, and much more widespread than I would like it to be. It depends though; now the police in NYC is efficient, and the crime level reasonably low, but 20 years ago the situation was different. IDK how things are in Georgia. What I refer to as a \"freak accident\" is the jail time. I would expect issuing an official warning at most. The problem is that this state of mind is that of the voters. It's not imposed by some oppressive authoritarian ruler, it's self-inflicted. Democracy, sadly, makes the unwholesome traits in people as visible as the most virtuous traits. E.g. Switzerland, the poster child of the most real democracy on this planet, only gave women voting rights in 1950s-70s, completely democratically. reply tppiotrowski 22 hours agorootparentprevThis mechanism is the source of fear for foreigners who believe they will be the victims of a mass shooting if they visit the USA. reply blackeyeblitzar 22 hours agoparentprevIt’s not an obsession with “USA” but with government agencies. The police but also child protective services (called different things in different locations) create these kind of sham protections. It ends up creating a chilling effect by scaring parents into acting differently and depriving their children of much needed independence that is critical to their development. But worse, when a parent gets into trouble for it, they end up being shamed and humiliated in ways that really affect their happiness and psychology. Imagine if you are told that some person from a random agency, usually of low intelligence and low empathy, will come check in on your children every week and humiliate you by forcing you to report to them. It is an inhumane deprivation of parental rights, but also an excess of government. As a taxpayer, I absolutely hate that we waste money on this type of thing when we’re in debt. reply xattt 20 hours agoparentprevThere’s elements at play where adults with childhood neglect and/or sexual trauma sublimate their understandably strong emotions into current safety initiatives for children.

For all of the happy survivor stories like yours (and mine), the reality is that the rate of child accidental deaths has steadily decreases over the past few decades as parents (and society) became more protective.

If you look at all the factors, I'm not sure there's a net benefit. Edit: I decided to look up the CDC statistics to see if there is any net benefit, but total childhood mortality rates have been increasing in the US. Measuring accidental deaths is extremely flawed, if that were a good target then we should keep all children indoors. No bike riding, no swimming, no tree climbing, just keep them inside on a screen all day long and accidental deaths will continue to drop. reply llm_trw 22 hours agorootparentDon't forget that there are a lot fewer kids today. One only need to look at how a single kid is parented vs four. I had a hilarious example at the park where the single child had constant supervision while the fourth kid of the same age was left alone to do whatever until she hurt herself and started crying. In between she ate dirt, sand, jumped in a puddle, threw stones at the local wild life, ate the single kids snacks, and finally fell off a ladder and busted her nose.

The list of these targeted changes is extremely long, but some top mentions: - Safer car and booster seats. Cribs, toys, and other household items. - Advances in healthcare and access to vaccinations. - Better education for caregivers around drowning prevention, safe sleeping practices, etc. - Childproofed products like wall outlets, cabinet locks, baby gates, etc. - Stricter rules and education on smoke and carbon monoxide detection. - Road safety initiatives ranging from seatbelt and child restraints laws to anti-DUI programs. - Improved consumer protections and communication of product recalls.

(Are parents actually being protective as they feed more sugar to their kids?) As has our consumption of GMOs. It's also decreased as government-mandated product, automobile, and housing safety standards have increased (which is different from parents becoming more protective!).

There is no way this sherrif did not know both the kid and the mom at least indirectly, and no way MOST kids in the area don't travel a mile on their own routinely, many every day, and no way this sherriff is not aware of this norm, and this is some personal and/or brown/yellow-people bs. Maybe or maybe not driven by the sherrif directly but like a neighbor wants the property they live on or something. This has \"make someone go away\" (for whatever reason) smell. Though they are just as guilty for being willing to perform even if it was someone else's direction. Like when a business just mysteriously can't get a normal permit in a tiny town where the entire staff of the department is Frank, the brother in law of the guy that owns half the town or the competing business across town, or their personal house near by and they just don't want the view. All impossible to prove and no one to complain to to even try. I grew up in a comparative metropolis of ZOMG SIX THOUSAND(1) people and kids younger than 11 routinely travelled a hell of a lot further than a single mile by themselves, in the US. This is not crazy or dangerous or abnormal in the slightest in such a setting. In fact it's practically unavoidable in that setting. But Hey we were white and in the north-east version of rural instead of Mexipino-looking in the south-east version of rural. (I seem to remember a figure more like 10-12k when I was there, but the census figures on wikipedia and say just under 6k for that time frame. Maybe these rural people avoid cooperating with the census, maybe the figure I heard included more of the general area than strictly the borders of the town, maybe I just never heard any such figure since we are talking late 70s and me only 7 to 12.) reply etimberg 22 hours agoprevThis kind of incident is a microcosm of everything that's going wrong in the western world reply nicolas_t 22 hours agoparentThat particular bit of insanity is mostly restricted to the US.

One is that many people here likely had a more free roam childhood and this kind of behaviour from law enforcement and society in general is quite peculiar and off-putting. Being socially outcast because I let my child walk to the store is one thing. Being actually arrested and threatening to remove the parent of a child in the name of their safety is another. Another part is the data / justification for this behaviour. From 1999 to 2010 at least, it seems that motor vehicle accidents are the number one cause of teenagers dying. Then it's homicide and suicide. Homicides are mostly committed by people the person knows. I don't have a full complete data set here but ~85% of homicides against youth are committed by family members or people that know the family. Not strangers.

The deputy noted that the child could be \"kidnapped\". You will see claims like \"800,000 children are kidnapped every year\". The media loves to drum up fear. The vast majority of these cases are custody disputes. Actual cases of children being kidnapped by strangers? Fewer than 100 per year, probably a lot fewer [1]. This is a small rural town. That makes it less likely just because there are fewer strangers. Not that there aren't dangers from known people and family members but that's a risk regardless.

For most roads in the US, this is not the case. There might be a shoulder. There might not. There often won't even be a curb. So you're walking on uneven ground. So you could get hit by a car but this isn't a high speed road. Common sense should rule here. Like don't the police have better things to do? And the DA? Or DCFS?

Unfortunately, we can’t quite claim that title … despite the software reporting 4 GHz. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzy24LkL_4Q&feature=youtu.be Table of Contents Introduction Raspberry Pi OS + NUMA Patch Liquid Nitrogen Cooling Raspberry Pi “Amplified” ElmorLabs AMPLE-X1 Crystal Oscillator ElmorLabs ECB Conclusive Thoughts Introduction We tried everything to make our Pi the fastest Pi in the world. That includes changing the operating system, subzero cooling with liquid nitrogen, boosting the power circuitry, and even swapping out the crystal oscillator.In this blog post I try to share some of the findings and insights from the several weeks of Pi hacking in collaboration with ElmorLabs. Let’s start where we left off: in SkatterBencher #77 I overclocked the Raspberry Pi 5 to 3 GHz with a slightly improved air cooler. It appears that the PMIC voltage controller is a key limiting factor for achieving higher frequencies. Not only does the PMIC impose voltage configuration limitations but we also saw the Pi shut down at high power consumption levels. Therefore, I decided to beef up the power circuitry using the ElmorLabs AMPLE-X1. But I’ll get back to that later, because the first concern for maximizing performance is the operating system. Raspberry Pi OS + NUMA Patch In preparation for the record attempt, it’s important to prepare the operating system first. Coming from Ubuntu in my SkatterBencher guide, there’s two things we can improve: Change to the official Raspberry Pi OS, and Apply the NUMA patch The official Raspberry Pi operating system can easily be downloaded from the website. Alternatively, you can also use the Raspberry Pi Imager software which does all the hard work for you. I first learned about the NUMA patch when discussing Raspberry Pi overclocking on the Tom’s Hardware Guide The Pi Cast #181 a couple of months ago. It boils down to this: NUMA emulation enables the BCM2721 memory controller to better utilize parallelism in physical memory chip organization. I followed Jeff Geerling’s guide on enabling the NUMA patch. Combining the Raspberry Pi operating system and applying the NUMA emulation patch improved the benchmark performance significantly. Liquid Nitrogen Cooling The next step of preparing the Raspberry Pi for higher voltages and frequencies is ensuring we have superior cooling. Preferably, extreme cooling like liquid nitrogen. The place to be for liquid nitrogen testing in Taipei, Taiwan, is of course the ElmorLabs office. The Raspberry Pi 5 has a small-footprint PCB with quite a lot of tall components spread around the PCB. So, we can’t use a regular container like our AI LN2 container or the ElmorLabs Volcano. However, we found this tiny chipset LN2 pot. This container is heavy enough that it can just sit on top of the SoC and provide enough cooling even at ambient. After all, the SoC is barely using any power. I first ran Geekbench at 3200 MHz as a performance sanity check and I achieved 1000 in single-core and 2000 in multi-core in for the first time. Then, I tried increasing the operating frequency with low ambient temperatures of 20 degrees Celsius. However, as you can see, with ambient temperatures I could only set the clock to 3600 MHz. Once I tried 3700 MHz the Pi would lock up. Reducing the temperature to minus 40 degrees resulted in the same type of crash: the Pi just locks up at 3.7 GHz. Strange! I also hooked up the ElmorLabs EVC2 to talk to the Renesas PMIC directly and elevate every voltage rail. However, none of them seemed to have any impact on the maximum clock frequency. For those interested: the Raspberry Pi 5 only starts having operating problems around -90 degrees Celsius. Not bad at all! Hitting a frequency wall at any temperature is rather odd behavior because any modern SoCs should normally scale with both temperature and voltage, unless there’s an external bottleneck imposing a limit. But the lack of temperature scaling suggests that perhaps there would also be a lack of voltage scaling. But, there’s only one way to find out! Raspberry Pi “Amplified” In the SkatterBencher guide, I mention that the Raspberry Pi is shutting down in high load scenarios which use the NEON instructions. “If we have a closer look at the PassMark benchmark, we find that the benchmark crashes specifically at the NEON sub-test. […] If we track the current, voltage, and power of the VDD_core during the workload, we find that the NEON subtest is significantly more power-intensive than any other benchmark. We can see peak current exceeding 15 amps and the power consumption exceeding 18 watts. When the benchmark crashes, the Raspberry Pi shuts down, and we can’t even communicate with the PMIC unless we manually press the power button. This suggests the instability is not caused by too high frequency, but perhaps some other mechanism such as over-current or over-temperature protection. Based on the voltage telemetry provided by the Python script, it doesn’t seem like it’s an under-volt issue. However, unfortunately, the PMIC debug options are not available at the moment.” SkatterBencher #77: Raspberry Pi 5 Overclocked to 3000 MHz To address this problem – as well as the 1.2V voltage limit – we need to beef up the power circuit. And, once again, ElmorLabs comes to the rescue with the Ample-X1 Power Card. ElmorLabs AMPLE-X1 The ElmorLabs AMPLE-X1 is a power card that uses a single-phase step-down buck converter. It is optimized for operating from a 12V power supply but can work with down to 4.5V input. It achieves up to 91.7% efficiency and the parameters can be monitored and controlled digitally by connecting it to EVC2. To hook up the AMPLE-X1 to the Raspberry Pi 5, we need to perform some hard-to-reverse and definitely-warranty-voiding modifications. Remove the inductors of the 4-phase SoC to disconnect the PMIC from the SoC. Scratch off the PCB mask to expose more of the copper plane for Vcc and Gnd. Solder thick, short wires between the Raspberry Pi and the AMPLE-X1. Make sure the AMPLE-X1 is set by default around 1.0V (it can provide up to 5.0V!) Once that’s done, it’s time to try if the Pi still boots up. This is not guaranteed because sometimes the SoC has two-way communication with the PMIC to ensure correct bootup procedure. Luckily, it works. The important step is to turn on the AMPLE-X1 power to the SoC before connecting the USB Type-C to power the other rails and initiate bootup. Now, we can use the ElmorLabs EVC2 to adjust the output voltage as well as monitor the output current and power. You can use the EVC2 on a secondary system, like a Windows laptop, or use the unofficial Linux package available for download from the ElmorLabs discord here: https://discord.com/channels/514312075686838282/830630797962641468/1204348733249159218 (backup). Here’s an example of the AMPLE-X1 peaking at 25.5W during a Passmark run. With the beefed-up power circuit, we can now increase the voltage to get higher frequency. We tried increasing the voltage from 1.2V all the way up to 1.55V. Unfortunately, we didn’t achieve a single additional step of MHz. This is, unfortunately, aligns with the lack of temperature scaling. But why? Crystal Oscillator There are many reasons why the SoC frequency wouldn’t scale with temperature or voltage. For example, it could be a PLL locking problem like we’ve seen with Intel Tiger Lake. Or it could be that a specific IP block linked to the Arm cores is also getting overclocked. Or, it could be a specific PLL ratio being unstable. Unfortunately, most of these issues are hard to debug without the proper development tools. However, we can try one last thing to see if maybe the Arm core PLL is causing issues: swapping out the crystal oscillator. The idea is simple: we swap the fixed crystal oscillator with a variable oscillator. That allows us to change the PLL ratio for frequencies exceeding 3.6 GHz. ElmorLabs ECB The default clock crystal is a 54MHz crystal which is on the backside of the PCB. It can be removed with some heat. Next, we replace it with the ElmorLabs External Clock Board. Now, we can adjust the input clock lower or higher than the default 54 MHz. Upwards, we immediately ran into a limitation of around 56 MHz. However, downwards adjustment was much easier, and the Raspberry Pi 5 could go as low as 46 MHz. With 46 MHz, we can set the Arm frequency to 4000 MHz. As you can see, the Broadcom vcgencmd tool also reports as 4 GHz. But of course, the real frequency is much lower because the crystal oscillator reference clock is lower. The actual frequency is 4,000 / 54 x 46 = 3,407 MHz. Again, we run into the same frequency wall as we saw with temperature and voltage adjustments: about 3.4 GHz for benchmarks and 3.6 GHz as maximum configurable frequency. Oh, I did try to run Geekbench at the fake 4 GHz and, good news, it was able to catch the result isn’t legitimate. Great job! Conclusive Thoughts So, that’s basically it … we’ve tried everything we could reasonably come up with to push the Raspberry Pi 5 to 4 GHz. But despite the much lower temperatures, much higher voltages, and even a different crystal oscillator … 3.6 GHz is the highest possible frequency. But all things considered, I’m still very happy to have put in the time and effort to learn about Raspberry Pi overclocking. It gave me the opportunity to learn more about Linux and ARM, as well as pursue really advanced hardware modifications. I see this experience as a pivotal work forming a foundation for future experiments. I want to thank Jon from ElmorLabs for all the help and tools provided for this overclocking experiment. Without his help, this project would not have been possible! I thank you for reading and the Patreons for the support.

It was basically and advertisement for Elmor Labs and everything was “swap out a part for an Elmor part configured to do the same thing”. The cooling was basically for show given the temperature- and voltage-independent scaling wall; the proper place to go would have been an ARM-based development house to use the debug tools, they’re certainly available. I’m not a Pi guy and I don’t know if the dev samples/hal/device trees have been released yet, but another option is to set up a bare metal environment and bring up the clock buses one by one to a different multiplier and see if you can reproduce it manually executing neon instructions in a tight loop. reply jdenning 19 hours agoprevI won a science fair when I was a kid doing this with a 286; it worked great except for all of the condensation :D reply redundantly 18 hours agoparentYo, Imma need you to provide more details, this sounds super awesome!

The nerd/hacker acorn doesn’t fall far from the nerd/hacker tree. Same reason I had a spare 286 lying around reply mrguyorama 2 hours agorootparentprevHow did this work? 286 didn't have free clock scaling. Cooling it could make it use less power I guess, by lowering internal resistances, but that won't make it run faster, it's still running based on the clock rate. More importantly, a hot CPU wouldn't perform worse, it would just break at some point when a computation got the wrong result. reply remlov 2 hours agorootparentHow did this work? By swapping crystal oscillators with a higher frequency. reply alsetmusic 2 hours agorootparentAnd just yesterday, I was remembering a 6th grade science experiment that involved a radar gun that my father \"borrowed\" from a police dept (I suspect he paid to borrow or bought it outright and didn't tell me) and how that was somewhat sophisticated compared to the projects of other kids. Really put me in my place with this one. Nice work. reply mrguyorama 34 minutes agorootparentprevOlder CPUs didn't have a range of performance. They either worked at a clock speed, or didn't. If you put in a very high rate crystal, the CPU would either work at that higher rate without cooling, or not work without cooling. Clock speed was a constant. >I didn’t even measure the clock speed - just wrote a little program (I think it was in QBasic) that calculated factorials or something (don’t remember the details), then measured performance difference between no cooling, ice water, and liquid nitrogen. >My measurement technique was extremely simplistic - how much wall clock time does it take to do this computationally-intensive task. It ran faster with ice water, and even faster with the liquid nitrogen (until it died from condensation). There is no world in which a 286 has a program that runs \"slow\" without cooling, and fast with cooling. If a clock speed \"needs cooling\", it's because the CPU crashes otherwise. If jdenning changed the crystal, THAT'S what increased the CPU speed. They seem adamant that wasn't the case though. reply redundantly 18 hours agorootparentprevDude, that's cool!

It would be better to phrase it as \"outside of turbo mode it operated as a 4mhz 8086, with turbo it operated faster (usually the CPU's actual rated speed)\". reply _nalply 10 hours agorootparentHah that reminds me of the way of a supermarket chain to shill rebates.

There was an external clock chip that generated the exact frequency needed for the CPU; sometimes there was another setting for a reduced speed for compatibility. If you changed this clock, you’d also disturb all the other I/O that depended on it. I can see why you won! In the early 80s, just building the clock circuitry to generate arbitrary frequencies for the CPU only would have been quite an engineering feat. reply copperx 16 hours agoparentprevHow did you overclock it?????? reply burnte 15 hours agorootparentYou replace the crystal on the motherboard with a faster one.

It ran faster with ice water, and even faster with the liquid nitrogen (until it died from condensation). I truly don’t understand why this anecdote seems to be offensive - but let me assure you, I’m claiming no scientific discovery or prodigious understanding of cpus here. It was neat - computers, liquid nitrogen, color charts.. in the early 90s. That kind of shit got you scholarships back in the day. reply northwest65 17 hours agorootparentI think it's because CPUs don't run faster just because they're colder, they run faster when you overclock them. Often to get them stable at higher clock speeds you need more voltage, which at some point demands more cooling to mitigate that. AFAICT doing interesting but ultimately trivially complicated stuff as a youngster can still result in scholarships etc, Ahmed Mohamed comes to mind. reply jdenning 17 hours agorootparentPerhaps that generation of cpus was very insufficiently cooled? This is before people even really put much of a heat sink on a cpu. The code did run faster with ice water, and faster again with liquid nitrogen. It was a high school, county-level science fair. I don’t know how things stand today, but at the time “will a computer run faster with better cooling?” was a perfectly acceptable level of scientific inquiry for a 14 year old. I’m truly sorry if my childhood anecdote has inadvertently spread misinformation on this topic :) reply michaelt 8 hours agorootparent> Perhaps that generation of cpus was very insufficiently cooled? This is before people even really put much of a heat sink on a cpu. The 286 came out in 1982 but it wasn't until ~2000 (with the release of the Pentium 4) that thermal throttling was introduced. From ~1995-2000 if the CPU got over temperature, your PC just turned off immediately. And prior to ~1995 if you ran a CPU without a heatsink it could overheat and destroy itself. We just had to be careful not to do that :) reply danieldk 12 hours agorootparentprevAlternative theory: you also ended up cooling the crystal oscillator, which subtly influenced clock speed. At any rate, sounds like a really fun high school project! reply travisjungroth 15 hours agorootparentprevPeople get upset when their understanding of the world conflicts with evidence, especially the scientifically minded. reply emptiestplace 14 hours agorootparentI mean, this tends to be true, but what evidence are you referring to? reply travisjungroth 12 hours agorootparentThe evidence relayed by the person I replied to, that as the chip was cooled the performance increased. reply emptiestplace 10 hours agorootparentAlright, that's an interestingly chill take on 'evidence'. reply travisjungroth 6 hours agorootparentNever has someone described my personal epistemology so succinctly! reply exe34 7 hours agorootparentprevthe singular form of evidence is not anecdote. I think it's an interesting conundrum myself. as others have pointed out, the story as it was told is not consistent with the physics and current knowledge of what things were like in those days: CPUs did not yet do thermal throttling and simply cooling a CPU from that time doesn't make it go faster. somebody else mentioned the possibility that the cooling did something to the crystal oscillator, but I think there are another two explanations that either alone or in combination might explain what happened: unreliable narrator (OP was very young when the memory was formed) and external influence - his dad or teacher might have done the overclocking which might have been beyond his understanding and therefore notice at the time. either way there's no reason to take anecdotes uncritically. reply travisjungroth 6 hours agorootparent> the singular form of evidence is not anecdote It is in Bayesian reasoning. reply exe34 4 hours agorootparentthat's right, and you don't just update your posterior to match the one dodgy data point at the expense of decades of evidence. reply ruszki 4 hours agorootparentThat’s right. Did somebody investigate the same thing and had different results? Because in this thread there are only theoretical explanations why it cannot be, and not experiments. So in short, there is only one data point. reply exe34 3 hours agorootparentWhat conclusions do you believe it is reasonable to draw in light of this? Is your position significantly different from what I said: > either way there's no reason to take anecdotes uncritically. > Because in this thread there are only theoretical explanations why it cannot be No, the explanations are referring to the mountain of evidence based on the physics of the chips and the known characteristics of the chips of the time. That's not theoretical, that past observations. reply ruszki 2 hours agorootparentShow me those observations. Without that your word is just another anecdote. reply exe34 2 hours agorootparentwhat would you accept as evidence? does it need to be certified by a notary public? reply ruszki 40 minutes agorootparentYou know well that a single study about the temperature response of the given CPU is enough. mrguyorama 25 minutes agorootparentprev>I truly don’t understand why this anecdote seems to be offensive - but let me assure you, I’m claiming no scientific discovery or prodigious understanding of cpus here. You are stating that providing better cooling to a 286 improved it's performance in the terms of calculating faster. This is, flatly, false. If you have a 286 clocked at 8mhz, it doesn't matter how much you cool it, it will still run at 8mhz, and still only execute the same number of instructions per clock. To make a 286 perform more calculations per second, you MUST increase it's clock rate, directly, by installing a faster oscillator. Running at a high clock rate reduces the time each gate in the circuit has to settle to a state, high or low. This can cause the CPU to have what it experiences as \"random\" gate flips, that will eventually crash it. To fix this, you can increase the voltage, which can force the gates to stabilize faster. This creates more heat. This heat is what more cooling can extract. In modern CPUs, the voltage, clock speed, and cooling can all be varied independently (within limits) to acheive whatever is desired: quietest/coolest performance, fastest clock, highest performance, etc. This is not true on a 286. If the CPU does not crash with a faster oscillator, extra cooling will not increase it's performance. reply gosub100 16 hours agorootparentprevI am not claiming to be offended, just pointing out the fine line between \"Dad's science project\" and \"Child's science project\".

I have a personal \"hot desk\" at home. I want to be able to plug in any laptop to the large monitor, and have the wireless keyboard/mouse on that desk instantly work. And when I leave the desk with my laptop, I don't want that keyboard/mouse connected anymore. This has been impossible so far, because even USB bluetooth dongles still require each host computer to pair (and un-pair) with the keyboard/mouse. I am going to try your solution, and I will plug the USB input into the large monitor on my desk. Then any laptop that plugs into that monitor should have access to the wireless keyboard/mouse. Thank you for creating and sharing this! reply clort 14 minutes agoparentmany Bluetooth USB dongles have NVRAM, you can write the link key for a device (eg the keyboard or mouse) into the NVRAM and then when connecting, the dongle doesn't ask the Host computer for the key. I have used this to dual boot with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse in the past. I think the technique would be: pair in machine A (A has a link key). Then, pair again in machine B with the same dongle. Write that key into NVRAM, and machine A considers the device paired but it never gets asked for the key so just works if you plug the dongle into either machine. I don't know how the monitor thing works, does it act as a USB hub? I guess you can just leave the Bluetooth dongle plugged in there.. reply bahaaador 1 hour agoparentprevMy pleasure, @reeddavid! I’m excited that you might find a use for it. Just a quick note: you may need an external power source for the RPi if you’re switching between devices frequently. One popular request I’ve received is for certain RPi models (those with multiple USB ports as host) to act as a KVM, allowing them to serve as a USB host for multiple PCs simultaneously with easy switching—perhaps through shortcuts or physical buttons on the RPi. I’ll need to give it more thought, but it seems feasible with minimal changes. I already have some ideas for better state management for the devices! reply mmh0000 1 hour agoparentprevAll of this is being insanely overcomplicated. Throwing more complexity at a simple problem might be \"fun\" from a nerd's POV, and, TBH, building this USB device sounds fun. But entirely unneeded while introducing more points of failure. A simple solution to your problem: 1. Get a monitor with a built-in USB hub (nearly all of them?). Consider getting a USB-C monitor to reduce the number of cables to 1. 2. Don't use Bluetooth (for a keyboard, for multiple reasons, like needing the keyboard available in early boot). Get a keyboard/mouse with an external USB dongle like Logitech's Unify or Bolt, Corsair's SLIPSTREAM, or any of the other billion options that exist. 3. Plug keyboard/mouse into monitor, plug random computers into monitor. Bam. Unified mouse and keyboard without any pairing. reply derefr 19 minutes agorootparentSo your solution to solving one tiny flaw with the GP's otherwise-working setup is to... throw away their monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and spend many times money than an RPi-with-a-hat costs to replace them? All because you're offended by the complexity of... what? • The idea of a device that acts as a stable host for Bluetooth devices, while presenting as a wired USB hub to an upstream USB host controller? • The particular implementation here, which is a hacky proof-of-concept of the idea (and which could, in practice, be reduced to a single chip embedded into any USB-C-dock product if there was demand)? • The entire concept of Bluetooth? --- Also, I would like to point out that, given that this is HN, it's more than even odds that the GP has: • multiple monitors (so using a monitor with a built-in hub is likely untenable) • and also, that their laptops are probably Macbooks, and their mouse and keyboard are therefore very likely a Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad [for which there is no 1:1 substitute that does non-Bluetooth wireless while still offering the same features]; • and that, given what they've said, they're likely already using a Thunderbolt hub to talk to those multiple monitors + all their USB devices through \"one cable\" (and all they really want is to add one more USB connection to this dock to make it act like a \"Bluetooth dock\" too); • and that they likely have a big deep sit-stand desk, that they'd be cluttering/making it hard to put things on the 90% of the free \"middle space\" on, if they had to run actual wires from the keyboard and mouse over to the dock. reply FredFS456 1 hour agorootparentprevA cheap USB switch would also work, that would reduce the switching to switching monitor inputs and pressing the button the USB switch reply vel0city 35 minutes agoparentprevI've had many BT mouse and keyboards which supported multiple pairing profiles on the device.

Would this work? I’d buy one. I currently have to use Synergy to share peripherals between two MacBooks. reply jasomill 1 hour agoparentMagic Trackpad 2 and (Mac) Magic Keyboards appear as USB HID devices when connected to a computer via Lightning-to-USB (-A or -C) cable. One annoyance is that macOS automatically Bluetooth pairs with these devices when connected via USB, overwriting any existing pairing, but this shouldn't matter for purely wired scenarios. For switching Bluetooth devices more generally, observe that most Bluetooth controllers are USB devices; with a bit of effort — mostly just copy/pasting the device pairing keys across all connected hosts — they can be switched just like any other USB peripheral (YMMV with \"intelligent\" USB KVM switches that virtualize USB HID device connections). IME the connection delay is a couple seconds longer than switching wired USB HID devices directly, but entirely reasonable for typical KVM use cases. Note here that \"most Bluetooth controllers are USB devices\" even extends to internal Wi-Fi/Bluetooth combo cards, which are commonly M.2 key A or E (= PCIe + USB 2.0 + …), or M.2 key A or E preinstalled on a mostly passive PCIe adapter, with a separate cable connection to a USB port or motherboard USB header used exclusively for Bluetooth. This turns out to be a surprisingly useful implementation detail: on one of my work desktops, I'm currently virtual USB-switching the Bluetooth controller on an Intel BE200 PCIe card between a Linux host and a Windows VM running on that host, while keeping Wi-Fi connected to the host. I have a matching hot key set up in each OS to attach/detach the Bluetooth controller from the VM and simultaneously DDC switch the monitor input between the host (iGPU) and guest (PCIe dGPU passthrough), and it works great. Coincidentally, the Bluetooth devices I'm using in this configuration are a Magic Trackpad 2, a Magic Keyboard, and a Magic Mouse (the mouse was the motivation for using Bluetooth over USB in the first place, as, unlike the other Apple input devices, it's physically impossible to use when connected via USB). reply vel0city 31 minutes agorootparent> even extends to internal Wi-Fi/Bluetooth combo cards This is becoming untrue pretty rapidly. I've got a pile of Intel WiFi/BT modules both on my desk and in my computers and none of them have USB connectors anymore. Used to be pretty much always true, now only really true for those older cards. reply yencabulator 2 hours agoparentprevAt least older models of Apple Magic Trackpad work over USB just fine.

I am not a fan of IT GESTAPO, and everything should be measured, butbif I learned one thing it is that people will do the dumbest, riskiest shit if left tontheir own devices. Also: if you work with certain customer data a good way to not only loose your job, but a ton of money would be to e.g. put that data into your shadow IT that might be running on some servers somewhere. E.g. people constantly asked us to use Zoom \"because it is free and works\", but we were in the public sector and a contract with them that guaruantueed the privacy of our clients would have costed a significant fraction of our yearly IT budget — and we are required by law to have such a contract. When you then ask those people if they want to part with that money suddenly nobody is so adamant anymore. reply ChrisMarshallNY 1 hour agorootparentThis is true. I suspect that a lot of these massive breaches, was because some less-technical person loaded the customer data onto an unsecured AWS instance, while they were running measurements on it. reply ChrisMarshallNY 1 hour agorootparentprevWe wrote optimized C++ software.

My company's IT department is Windows clickops people who hire other Windows clickops people. When something goes wrong that requires the command line, they spend five figures on a consultant to fix it. Ditto for the few dozen Linux machines in the company. Some of our departments, including mine, run Macs. I can't count the number of times I've had someone from IT tell me \"OK, now click 'Start'…\" or whatever the Windows convention is these days. All they'd have to do is hire one guy who knows the command line, and one guy who knows how to support Macs. There must be a hundred people in the IT department, but they keep hiring the same type of people over and over.

Another thought around this is that I don't even think there's anything intrinsically insecure about BT as an attack vector but most likely some old policy based on security issues that existed in the early days of Bluetooth. Or at least I don't know of any, but I'm no expert in this so I would love to hear other people's insights here. reply wongarsu 2 hours agorootparentSecure bluetooth requires manufacturers to get the cryptography right. Even big brands like Logitech have gotten that wrong in recent memory, allowing attackers both to decrypt what you type [1] and to inject keystrokes [2]. And these are long-lived devices, even if vulnerabilities get patched in newer devices there are still plenty of 5 year old or older mice and keyboards with outdated firmware floating around. Not to mention the possibility of 0-days known to your attacker. Wired connections are inherently more difficult to attack. In security critical applications banning bluetooth is perfectly reasonable.

The best way to correctly fight Shadow IT is to provide equipment and services so good nobody would even care using something else. reply wongarsu 2 hours agorootparentI'm always a proponent of just spending some money on your office equipment. Even a $90 mouse and $200 keyboard costs less than a tenth of a percent of salary of an average office worker, never mind developer (amortized over a very conservative 5 year lifespan). Give people the option to choose between 2-3 sanctioned models, throw in some vertical mice and split keyboard options and you can even brag about how much you care about your employees' health. Some people will always want to bring their own equipment, but a lot of it is caused by penny pinching or lack of options reply vel0city 20 minutes agorootparent> Give people the option to choose between 2-3 sanctioned models It quickly grows past the 2-3 sanctioned models. Everyone wants something not on the list, lots of bickering of \"why was that model chosen?\", etc. Well that pre-approved model is $150, this is only $175. Bob got that $175 model, this is only $200, it's not that much. Jenny got that $200 model, this is only $250. Jenny's got a $250 keyboard? I gotta upgrade, here's this $300 model... Wait did the company just buy Bill a 55\" 4K display? I need that too... Suddenly your $150/person budget has exploded to replace everyone's equipment for $1,000+ otherwise it's just not fair someone else got more. Personally I'm fine with me buying and owning my own kb+m. Maybe give a once a year or two office hardware stipend or whatever. Then otherwise make basic stuff available for free. If you're wanting a $200 keyboard you're probably wanting a particular $200 keyboard, and it's probably not one of those 2-3 approved models. reply kelvinjps10 1 hour agorootparentprevBut what they offer is crap, I like that my company let's me change the equipment reply ChrisMarshallNY 3 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience, the IT section didn't trust anything they didn't approve, themselves.

I think while the company IT department will not love you, as long as you don't show up in one of their dashboards, it's pretty unlikely they will care. For years. Even if someone does bug you, I doubt it will amount to much other than being forced to adhere to the policy. As long as you ensure it doesn't look too much like you did it on purpose. (I would at least recommend a nice case for the device and picking innocuous USB IDs. Might be able to make it seem like a reasonable looking product, like a normal wireless keyboard receiver.)

Same here, though I've never been in a significantly restrictive place with no authority (in current long-term DayJob I have some involvement in decisions wrt what restrictions are appropriate, and what exceptions to them are appropriate). If someone is in a truly restrictive environment, they should take care. A deliberate breach of policy could be a job terminating excuse, or at least further justification, if someone wants them out of the way for any other reason, and in such circumstances a workaround and a breach will be seen in the same light. reply baq 2 hours agoparentprevThe clever IT department will put hot glue in all USB ports. reply Eisenstein 2 hours agorootparent99% IPA will make it removable easily without dissolving it and will not damage any of the electronics. reply bongodongobob 2 hours agoparentprevNo, it's just a USB device at that point.

You would put it in HCI mode, pair whichever Bluetooth devices you wanted to pair with it (keyboards, mice, etc.). Then on the next reboot it would put itself back into HID mode, where all the paired devices would appear as USB HID devices. And therefore your keyboard would be available even during pre-boot, at the BIOS setup program. Once the operating system finished loading, it would send the adapter the command to switch to HCI mode, and the adapter would then re-appear as a normal bluetooth adapter. Under BlueZ, this operation was done by a command called hid2hci. I have several (even Apple used to do this), but they stopped being a thing during the 2.0 EDR era (therefore zero support for LE keyboards). In fact, if you google these keywords (\"HID proxy\", \"HID2HCI\", ...) you will find that there are several much older projects to also replicate this using RPi Zeros. I personally would like one which extends the concept to audio devices, serial ports, etc. so that I can use them from OSes without BT stack. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "Mike Dash; Updated by Ellen Wexler Siberian summers do not last long. The snows linger into May, and the cold weather returns again during September, freezing the taiga into a still life awesome in its desolation: endless miles of straggly pine and birch forests scattered with sleeping bears and hungry wolves; steep-sided mountains; white-water rivers that pour in torrents through the valleys; thousands of miles of icy bogs. This forest is one of the last and greatest of Earth’s wildernesses. It stretches from Russia’s Arctic regions to as far south as Mongolia, and east from the Urals to the Pacific: millions of square miles of sparsely populated nothingness. When the warm days do arrive, though, the taiga blooms, and for a few short months it can seem almost welcoming. It is then that man can see most clearly into this hidden world—not on land, for the taiga can swallow whole armies of explorers, but from the air. Siberia is the source of most of Russia’s oil and mineral resources, and, over the years, even its most distant parts have been overflown by oil prospectors and surveyors on their way to backwoods camps where the work of extracting wealth is carried on. Thus it was in the remote south of the forest in the summer of 1978. A helicopter sent to find a safe spot to land a party of geologists was skimming the tree line 100 or so miles from the Mongolian border when it dropped into the thickly wooded valley of an unnamed tributary of the Abakan River, a seething ribbon of water rushing through dangerous terrain. The valley walls were narrow, with sides that were close to vertical in places, and the skinny pine and birch trees swaying in the rotors’ downdraft were so thickly clustered that there was little chance of finding a spot to set the aircraft down. The Lykov family lived in remote regions of the Siberian taiga for more than 40 years—utterly isolated and more than 150 miles from the nearest human settlement. Amzanyta via Getty Images However, peering intently through his windscreen in search of a landing place, the pilot saw something that should not have been there. It was a clearing on a mountainside, wedged between the pine and larch and scored with what looked like long, dark furrows. The baffled helicopter crew made several passes before reluctantly concluding that this was evidence of human habitation—a garden that, from the size and shape of the clearing, must have been there for a long time. It was an astounding discovery. The mountain was more than 150 miles from the nearest settlement in an area that had never been explored. The Soviet authorities had no records of anyone living in the district. The four scientists sent into the district to prospect for iron ore were told about the pilots’ sighting, and it perplexed and worried them. “In the taiga, it’s less dangerous to run across a wild animal than a stranger,” as Russian journalist Vasily Peskov wrote in Lost in the Taiga: One Russian Family’s 50-Year Struggle for Survival and Religious Freedom in the Siberian Wilderness. Rather than wait at their own temporary base, ten miles away, the scientists decided to investigate. The group’s leader, a geologist named Galina Pismenskaya, said they “chose a fine day and put gifts in our packs for our potential friends”—though, just to be sure, she recalled, “I did check the pistol that hung at my side.” Lost in the Taiga A Russian journalist provides a haunting account of the Lykovs, a family of Old Believers, or members of a fundamentalist sect, who in 1932 went to live in the depths of the Siberian Taiga and survived for more than fifty years apart from the modern world. Buy As the intruders scrambled up the mountain, heading for the spot pinpointed by their pilots, they began to come across signs of human activity: a rough path, a staff, a log laid across a stream and finally a small shed filled with birch-bark containers of cut-up dried potatoes. Pismenskaya told Peskov: Beside a stream there was a dwelling. Blackened by time and rain, the hut was piled up on all sides with taiga rubbish—bark, poles, planks. If it hadn’t been for a window the size of my backpack pocket, it would have been hard to believe that people lived there. But they did, no doubt about it. … Our arrival had been noticed, as we could see. The low door creaked, and the figure of a very old man emerged into the light of day, straight out of a fairy tale. Barefoot. Wearing a patched and repatched shirt made of sacking. He wore trousers of the same material, also in patches, and had an uncombed beard. His hair was disheveled. He looked frightened and was very attentive. … We had to say something, so I began: “Greetings, grandfather! We’ve come to visit.” The old man did not reply immediately. … Finally, we heard a soft, uncertain voice: “Well, since you have traveled this far, you might as well come in.” The sight that greeted the geologists as they entered the cabin was like something from the Middle Ages. Jerry-built from whatever materials came to hand, the dwelling was not much more than a burrow—“a low, soot-blackened log kennel that was as cold as a cellar,” with a floor consisting of potato peel and pine-nut shells, wrote Peskov. Looking around in the dim light, the visitors saw that it consisted of a single room. It was cramped, musty and indescribably filthy, propped up by sagging joists—and, astonishingly, home to a family of five. As Pismenskaya told the author: [The] silence was suddenly broken by sobs and lamentations. Only then did we see the silhouettes of two women. One was in hysterics, praying: “This is for our sins, our sins.” The other, keeping behind a post … sank slowly to the floor. The light from the little window fell on her wide, terrified eyes, and we realized we had to get out of there as quickly as possible. Led by Pismenskaya, the scientists backed hurriedly out of the hut and retreated to a spot a few yards away, where they took out some provisions and began to eat. After about half an hour, the door of the cabin creaked open, and the old man and his two daughters emerged—no longer panicked and, though still obviously frightened, “frankly curious.” Warily, the three strange figures approached and sat down with their visitors, rejecting everything that they were offered—jam, tea, bread—with a muttered, “We are not allowed that!” When Pismenskaya asked, “Have you ever eaten bread?” the old man answered: “I have. But they have not. They have never seen it.” At least he was intelligible. The daughters spoke a language distorted by a lifetime of isolation. “When the sisters talked to each other, it sounded like a slow, blurred cooing.” Peter the Great’s attempts to modernize the Russia of the early 18th century found a focal point in a campaign to end the wearing of beards—which was anathema to Karp Lykov and the Old Believers. Universal History Archive / Getty Images Slowly, over several visits, the full story of the family emerged. The old man’s name was Karp Osipovich Lykov, and he was an Old Believer—a member of a fundamentalist Russian Orthodox sect, worshiping in a style unchanged since the 17th century. Old Believers had been persecuted since the days of Peter the Great, and Lykov talked about it as though it had happened only yesterday. For him, Peter was a personal enemy and “the Antichrist in human form”—a point he insisted had been amply proved by the czar’s campaign to modernize Russia by forcibly “[chopping] off the beards of Christians.” These centuries-old hatreds were conflated with more recent grievances; Karp was prone to complain in the same breath about a merchant who had refused to make a gift of 26 poods of salt to the Old Believers sometime around 1900. As the geologists filled him in on what he’d missed, he used a similar lens to form opinions about current events: The events that had excited the world were unknown here. The Lykovs did not know any famous names and had heard only vaguely about the past war. When in recalling the “first world war” with Karp Osipovich the geologists engaged him in conversation about the last one, he shook his head: “What is this, a second time, and always the Germans. A curse on Peter. He flirted with them. That is so.” Things had only gotten worse for the Lykov family when the atheist Bolsheviks took power. Under the Soviets, isolated Old Believer communities that had fled to Siberia to escape persecution began to retreat ever further from civilization. During the purges of the 1930s, with Christianity itself under assault, a Communist patrol had shot Lykov’s brother on the outskirts of their village while Lykov knelt working beside him. He had responded by scooping up his family and bolting into the forest. The Lykovs' homestead seen from a Soviet reconnaissance plane, 1980 That was in 1936, and there were only four Lykovs then—Karp; his wife, Akulina; a son named Savin, who was around 9 years old; and Natalia, a daughter who was only 2. Taking their possessions and some seeds, they had retreated ever deeper into the taiga, building themselves a succession of crude dwelling places, until at last they had fetched up in this desolate spot. Two more children had been born in the wild—Dmitry in 1940 and Agafia in 1944—and their knowledge of the outside world came entirely from their parents’ stories. The family’s principal entertainment, Peskov noted, “was for everyone to recount their dreams.” The Lykov children knew there were places called cities where humans lived crammed together in tall buildings. They had heard there were countries other than Russia. But such concepts were no more than abstractions to them. Their only reading matter was prayer books and an ancient family Bible. Akulina had taught her children to read and write using sharpened birch sticks dipped into honeysuckle juice as pen and ink. When Agafia was later shown a video of a horse on the geologists’ television set, she recognized it from her mother’s stories. “A steed!” she exclaimed. “Papa, a steed!” But if the family’s isolation was hard to grasp, the unmitigated harshness of their lives was not. Traveling to the Lykov homestead on foot was astonishingly arduous, as Peskov would later learn firsthand. On his first visit to the Lykovs in the 1980s, the writer—who would appoint himself the family’s chief chronicler—noted that “we traversed 250 kilometers [155 miles] without seeing a single human dwelling!” Isolation made survival in the wilderness close to impossible. Dependent solely on their own resources, the Lykovs struggled to replace the few things they had brought into the taiga with them. They fashioned birch-bark galoshes in place of shoes. Clothes were patched and repatched until they fell apart, then replaced with hemp cloth grown from seed. The Lykovs lived in this hand-built log cabin, lit by a single window and warmed by a smoky wood-fired stove. The Lykovs had carried a crude spinning wheel and, incredibly, the components of a loom into the taiga with them. A couple of kettles served them well for many years, but when rust finally overcame them, the only replacements they could fashion came from birch bark. Since these could not be placed in a fire, it became far harder to cook. By the time the Lykovs were discovered, their staple diet was potato patties mixed with ground rye and hemp seeds. In some respects, Peskov wrote, the taiga did offer abundance: “Beside the dwelling ran a cold, clear stream. Stands of larch, spruce, pine and birch yielded all that anyone could take. … Bilberries and raspberries were close to hand, firewood as well, and pine nuts fell right on the roof.” Yet the Lykovs lived permanently on the edge of famine. It was not until the late 1950s, when Dmitry reached manhood, that they first trapped animals for their meat and skins. Lacking guns or even bows, they could hunt only by digging traps or pursuing prey across the mountains until the animals collapsed from exhaustion. Dmitry built up “astonishing endurance” and could hunt barefoot in winter, sometimes returning to the hut after several days with a young elk across his shoulders. More often than not, though, there was no meat, and their diet gradually became more monotonous. Wild animals destroyed their crop of carrots, and Agafia recalled the late 1950s as “the hungry years”: We ate the rowanberry leaf, roots, grass, mushrooms, potato tops and bark. We were hungry all the time. Every year we held a council to decide whether to eat everything up or leave some for seed. Famine was an ever-present danger in these circumstances, and in 1960 it snowed in June. The hard frost killed everything growing in their garden, and by spring the family had been reduced to eating leather shoes, bark and straw. Akulina chose to see her children fed, and in February 1961 she died of starvation. The rest of the family were saved by what they regarded as a miracle: a single grain of rye sprouted in their pea patch. The Lykovs put up a fence around the shoot and guarded it zealously night and day to keep off mice and squirrels. At harvest time, the solitary spike yielded 18 grains, and from this they painstakingly rebuilt their rye crop. A Russian press photo of Karp Lykov (second left) with Dmitry and Agafia, accompanied by a Soviet geologist As the Soviet geologists got to know the Lykov family, they realized that they had underestimated their abilities and intelligence. Old Karp was usually delighted by the latest innovations that the scientists brought up from their camp, and though he steadfastly refused to believe that man had set foot on the moon, he adapted swiftly to the idea of satellites. The Lykovs had noticed them as early as the 1950s, when “the stars began to go quickly across the sky,” and Karp himself conceived a theory to explain this: “People have thought up something and are sending out fires that are very like stars.” “What amazed him most of all,” Peskov recorded, “was a transparent cellophane package. ‘Lord, what have they thought up—it is glass, but it crumples!’” Even at the end of his life, when he was in his 80s, Karp held grimly to his status as head of the family. His eldest child, Savin, dealt with this by casting himself as the family’s unbending arbiter in matters of religion. “Savin was strong in his faith, but he was a harsh man,” his own father said of him, and Karp seems to have worried about what would happen to his family after he died if Savin took control. Certainly the eldest son would have encountered little resistance from Natalia, who always struggled to replace her mother as cook, seamstress and nurse. The two younger children, on the other hand, were more open to change and innovation. “Fanaticism was not terribly marked in Agafia,” Peskov wrote, and in time he came to realize that the youngest of the Lykovs “had a sense of humor and irony and knew how to poke fun at herself.” Agafia’s unusual speech—she had a singsong voice and stretched simple words into polysyllables—convinced some of her visitors she was slow-witted. On the contrary, she was markedly intelligent, helping Savin with the difficult task, in a family that possessed no calendars, of keeping track of time. She thought nothing of hard work, either, excavating a new cellar by hand late in the fall and working on by moonlight when the sun had set. Asked by an astonished Peskov whether she was not frightened to be out alone in the wilderness after dark, she replied: “What is there to be afraid of?” Surviving in the Siberian Wilderness for 70 Years (Full Length) Watch on Of all the Lykovs, though, the geologists’ favorite was Dmitry, a consummate outdoorsman who knew all of the taiga’s moods. He was the most curious and perhaps the most forward-looking member of the family. It was he who had built the family stove, and all the birch-bark buckets that they used to store food. Perhaps it was no surprise that he was also the most enraptured by the scientists’ technology. Once relations had improved to the point that the Lykovs could be persuaded to visit the Soviets’ camp, downstream, he spent many happy hours in its little sawmill, marveling at how easily a circular saw and lathes could finish wood. “It’s not hard to figure,” Peskov wrote. “The log that took Dmitry a day or two to plane was transformed into handsome, even boards before his very eyes. Dmitry felt the boards with his palm and said: ‘Fine!’” Karp Lykov fought a long and losing battle with himself to keep all this modernity at bay. When they first got to know the geologists, the family would accept only a single gift—salt. (Living without it for four decades, Karp said, had been “true torture.”) Over time, however, they began to take more. They welcomed the assistance of their special friend among the geologists—a driller named Yerofei Sedov, who spent much of his spare time helping them to plant and harvest crops. They eventually accepted blankets, wool socks, grain and even a flashlight. Once, when Agafia was asked why she would use a battery-powered flashlight when she wouldn’t accept matches, she “didn’t know how to respond,” wrote Peskov. “She only confirmed that matches were indeed a sinful thing.” Meanwhile, the sin of television, which the family encountered at the geologists’ camp, “proved irresistible for them”: On their rare appearances in camp, they would invariably sit down and watch. Karp Osipovich sat directly in front of the screen. Agafia watched, poking her head out from behind a door. She tried to pray away her transgression immediately—whispering, crossing herself—and once again stuck her head out. The old man prayed afterward, diligently and in one fell swoop. Perhaps the saddest aspect of the Lykovs’ strange story is the rapidity with which the family went into decline after they re-established contact with the outside world. In the fall of 1981, three of the four children followed their mother to the grave. According to Peskov, their deaths were not, as some have speculated, the result of exposure to diseases to which they had no immunity. Both Savin and Natalia suffered from kidney failure, most likely a result of their harsh diet. But Dmitry died of pneumonia, which might have begun as an infection he acquired from his new friends. The Lykovs' graves. Today, Agafia is the only surviving member of the family of six. His death shook the geologists, who tried desperately to save him. They offered to call in a helicopter and have him evacuated to a hospital. But Dmitry, in extremis, would abandon neither his family nor the religion he had practiced all his life. “We are not allowed that,” he whispered just before he died. “A man lives for howsoever long God grants.” When all three Lykovs had been buried, the geologists attempted to talk Karp and Agafia into leaving the forest and returning to be with relatives who had survived the persecutions of the purge years, and who still lived on in the same old villages. But neither of the survivors would hear of it. Agafia did accept one invitation around this time. The Soviet government offered to take her on tour across the country, and she agreed to go. Her father stayed behind, but she spent a month on the road, soaking up everything she had missed. When the trip ended, she returned to her old life. “It’s scary out there,” Agafia told Vice in 2013. “You can’t breathe. There are cars everywhere. There is no clean air. Each car that passes by leaves so many toxins in the air. You have no other option but to stay at home.” Soon after Agafia’s sojourn, Karp Lykov died in his sleep on February 16, 1988, 27 years to the day after his wife, Akulina. Agafia buried him on the mountain slopes with the help of the geologists, then turned and headed back to her home. The Lord would provide, and she would stay, she said—as indeed she did. “The taiga reclaimed her,” author Isabel Colegate wrote in A Pelican in the Wilderness: Hermits, Solitaries and Recluses. “She felt it was her home.” Agafia Lykova receiving medical care in 2016. She continued to live in remote locations after her father’s death, though she has traveled on rare occasions. Yekaterina Romanova / Komsomolskaya Pravda via AP More than 30 years later, this child of the taiga lives on in the wilderness. However, as her health has declined—she turned 80 earlier this year—she has started accepting more help. Lately, much of that help comes from the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who paid for a new wooden cottage to be built for her several years ago. She also acquired a satellite telephone, which she uses daily, and volunteers frequently travel to her isolated home to deliver supplies and help her manage daily affairs, particularly during the cold winters. Agafia will not leave. But we must leave her, seen through the eyes of Sedov on the day of her father’s funeral: I looked back to wave to Agafia. She was standing by the river break like a statue. She wasn’t crying. She nodded: “Go on, go on.” We went another kilometer and I looked back. She was still standing there. Get the latest History stories in your inbox?

But extrapolating this general difference of perspective to some narrative that it's all unjust \"phobia\" is just disingenuous. reply tim333 5 hours agoparentprevYour link has few details of indigenous population decimation. The \"Indigenous peoples of Siberia\" Wikipedia link seems to have more. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_Siberia reply riehwvfbk 5 hours agoparentprevYour link does not say what your summary says. The Wiki article just says the Hakassi joined the Soviet revolution (presumably happily) and moved from nomadic to modern livelihoods. No mention of a massacre. Now, I am not saying that a massacre didn't happen. But it also didn't happen they way you are implying. This wasn't \"the Communists oppressed poor tribesmen\" but rather \"imperialistic 18th century power steamrolls some natives\". I can name a few more imperialistic powers of the period that did the same or worse. Also, the Hakassi culture is descended from Mongols, not Finns. Why are they more Finnish than Russian? That's right, because they are not. In fact, Hakassia is nowhere near Finland (it's in the middle of Siberia), but linking to the Finnish Wikipedia makes it seem like another little European country attacked by the Ogre Horde. Lastly, you say that tiny Finnish stub article has more details than the Russian Wikipedia, and that is simply not true. In addition to the main article, there is a link from it specifically to a standalone article about Hakassia's inclusion into Russia, which is described as \"painful\": https://ru.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%....

Who wants to read about a normal life of a normal russian, frankly? It’s likely not a snark, but it is nothing more than just a complex sort of klukva^ either. Subj is a completely non-standard story of a single person from early 20th century. You can find similar hopelessness in London, Hemingway, Le Guin. The prevalent dynamics in Russian culture is that you get education, skip draft, go to work, have kids, buy some things and die from bad healthcare at 60-70. Pretty normal shit that is too boring for a narrow-font-magazine headline. Personally it doesn’t offend me, but it’s just cringe(?) most of the time. Off, odd, klukva. Nothing rings true to me in this subthread, which is just a pile of stereotypes.

Quite a lot of western commentators were just as surprised as Putin to discover that Putin commanded a force that managed to lose its own tanks to local farmers. The difference is we got out the popcorn, and he got filmed anxiously gripping his own desk for 12 minutes. Since then Putin has put his country into a war economy, and now it is a war of attrition because Ukraine is given just enough support to not lose but not enough to win either — Biden is both afraid of Russia winning and also of Russia escalating it if they lose too hard. This war will go on until the west gets tired of supporting Ukraine or decides that escalation is a risk they're willing to take or Russia collapses under the weight of the war economy or Ukraine develops nukes; but I don't mean \"the USA\" when I say \"the west\" despite the fact that most current support comes from the USA, as many European countries have been building up their militaries both in reaction to what Putin did and in anticipation of Trump taking the US out of NATO. reply moktonar 4 hours agorootparentYou base your logic on the assumption the Putin will never use the nukes. Funny because the USA is the _only_ country that used nuke until now. reply ben_w 3 hours agorootparentI count that under \"decides that escalation is a risk they're willing to take\". We can all see the claims and threats made by the Russian government, we know they want us to fear their nukes, that's why the US government has been concerned about escalation. I personally think there's a 75% they can't use any of their nukes and a 92% they can't use a strategically decisive number of nukes. But I'm doing armchair analysis here, and even if I wasn't those odds are only sufficient for me privately to not worry, they're not enough for a government to not plan for the worst. I'd be more worried if the US was more hawkish and cavalier about this. reply tim333 9 hours agorootparentprevThey didn't expand a war to the east, they expanded democracy, human rights and a defensive alliance to the east. reply grugagag 6 hours agorootparentThat’s an existential threat to Russia.

I imagine the Russian people would be quite happy to have a regular democracy. Which is one reason Putin isn't very keen on one in Ukraine. reply selivanovp 5 hours agorootparentUkraine never had any glimpse of regular democracy. For 30 years it was just a state when one or the other oligarchical clan was able to install its puppet on the throne to decide who's looting the majority of profits in their pockets. Right now Zelensky totally usurped power, his political opponents were either killed of forced to flee the country, total mass media control installed, everyone who tried to argue were raided and taken under control or had to flee the country, religion rights are taken away, churches are raided and the right people are getting installed. Borders are crossed and mined, everyone who's trying to flee the country are getting hunted and killed if there's no way to catch them to send in trenches. Russian language, that is the mother tongue for 80% of population and Zelensky himself is forbidden in schools, and any other public services. We have a classic case of nationalists dictatorship being installed and turned the country in the same shit hole that Germany became in the late 1930's with storm troops having population under control by force. That's why Putin isn't very keen on what's going on in Ukraine. reply grugagag 2 hours agorootparentSpeak of Putin’s political opponents for a bit.

The threat is more countries breaking apart from the sphere of influence and Putin’s plan falling apart completly. Had there been another plan, make prosperity by other means then yes, this whole thing would not be any threat, they’d have embraced it and played along and won on different fronts: they almost had the entire Europe dependent on gas. But then Mr Putin blew it. reply libertine 5 hours agorootparentprev> That’s an existential threat to Russia. This is repeated over and over again, but doesn't make it true: it is an existential threat to a corrupt regime, not to Russia. Russia will be fine without the regime. It may have some rough times, but in the long run, it will be fine. Putin's regime isn't Russia, and Russia isn't Putin's regime. Just like the propaganda narrative: \"Oh Russia tried democracy for a couple of years and it was awful! Democracy doesn't work in Russia!\" Reforming institutions and culture isn't something you do in a few years. Look at the process Ukraine is going through to join the EU.

It intensified after 2013-2014 and hasn't been true at all during ~1995-2010. It clearly comes from Putin's government insecurity about their comparative performance, rather than from any Russian cultural trait. reply selivanovp 11 hours agorootparentQuite contrary, it has nothing to do with Putin’s government, or state propaganda, but with centuries long Russian culture, that you can’t be taken seriously if you teach someone how to properly do things, but doing the same or even worse yourself. USA is just a relatively recent example of politicians that tell you, for example, “you can’t invade other countries” while invading one after another themselves, “you can’t mess with elections in sovereign countries”, while messing with elections all over the globe etc. So Russians just can’t respect neither those people nor take seriously their words. reply InDubioProRubio 4 hours agorootparentSo if america wouldn't have invaded iraq, russia wouldnt have invaded chechnya and the cause comes before the effect and the excuse for bad behaviour comes before the whataboutism and it all makes way more sense. reply bdjsiqoocwk 10 hours agorootparentprevYeah but.

A deep rooted sentiment of inferiority, that triggers every time you say something bad about their country, which they hate, and respond by attacking the country they admire but can't admit.

It's an easy and the most glaring example of lecturing people to do one thing, but doing the opposite themselves. 2. It was actually the country, that Russia wanted to be like during 80s and 90s, USA was a role model, but turned out to be full of shit. And the waking call happened, when USA bombed and shred to pieces Yugoslavia. >If I say \"Russia invaded Ukraine\", why do I always get the response \"but the USA..\" Once again, reasons are obvious if you're aware of the history. 1. USA can't lecture anyone about invading or annexing other countries, as USA invades one country after another just in the last few decades, and right now occupies Eastern part of Syria that's full of oil, and publicly brags that it's their oil. BTW, not o hard to notice a recent rhetoric in USA mass media and among politicians, that it's all about Ukraine resources and who gonna get what depending on the outcome of the war. 2. The war in Ukraine is a direct result of USA meddling in their elections in 2004 and 2013-2014, and desire to bring their military bases after the puppet government was installed. Russia was fine with sovereign Ukraine, even with a puppet like Yushchenko we were able to negotiate and live more or less peacefully, but military bases idea, kicking Russia out of Sevastopol is what spiralled this into violence. >A deep rooted sentiment of inferiority, that triggers every time you say something bad about their country, which they hate, and respond by attacking the country they admire but can't admit. Russians do have some sentiment on inferiority, and that's why we actually really glad when some respected and knowledgeable foreigner arrives and intend to cooperate, even teach us. For centuries such people were getting really rich working in Russia, even if they were mediocre back in their countries. But you're totally misguided on the attack part. Attack or self defense phase initiated only in the case of demonstratively refusal to make any reasonable compromise and direct hostile actions. Russian history is full of wars, we do not enjoy violence and know very well the cost in lives. Coming back to Ukraine, it's not so hard to remember, that Putin tried really hard to avoid this war. Crimea was peacefully annexed specifically to block any attempt to bring Ukraine into NATO legally, and secure our interests in the Black Sea, after it was obvious, that newly installed puppets gonna do exactly this (later Ukraine changed their constitution and replaced their intention to be a sovereign and neutral state to be a NATO member). Then Minsk agreements were introduced, for Ukraine government to get in touch with reality, but as we know now, from public admissions, USA, Germany and France intentionally sabotaged these agreements, pushing Ukraine into a military resolution (and at the same time they were introducing more and more sanctions towards Russia, lying that we do not respect our part of the deal). Then, Ukraine finally started to move their heavy equipment to Donbass in the early Autumn of 2021, and Zelensky publicly announced, that he won't respect Minsk agreements (it meant escalation in Donbass). Putin then spent several month in the Winter of 2021-2022 trying to make a deal with USA, to prevent direct war. But USA declared, that they can do whatever they want, build their bases wherever they can etc. So, we got an initial invasion of Feb 2022, when Russian army pushed to Kiev and Putin immediately proposed just another plan of how to stop all this. Ukraine government was ready to sign it, but Boris arrived and told them that they have to fight (also a public knowledge now, with multiple admissions of people involved in the process). It's not so hard to notice, that up to this day, Putin is ready to negotiate and stop this violence, it's Ukraine and the NATO countries behind their back are refusing to. And it's very easy to target USA and Western propaganda in general, that publicly lies up to this day, that \"mad Vlad just woke up and invaded a sovereign country without any reason, because he's evil\". >Without looking at polls, what do you think is the percentage of the Russian population that answered Yes to the question: if given the chance to move to the USA, would you? If you believe what you're saying, you probably think this is a very small number. I don't know if it's a very small number, small number or anything else. What I do know, is that there's still a myth in some countries, that Russia is some country that is behind an Iron Wall, that is hard to escape. Reality is different. Russia is open to the whole world, you can buy a ticket to fly to any country. We have millions of foreign tourists and migrants for decades. Anyone who really wanted to leave Russia did it already, or can do it today, for example. And a lot of people who did, returned already, because they learnt, that what they thought about some countries is not equal to how life there actually is. Reality is, that in the last 20 years Russia made a huge leap in quality of life in every sphere, and for me personally there's no desire to live in any other country, because I like it here. reply ethanwillis 8 hours agorootparentIt's interesting to me how you say \"war\" here on an English speaking and mostly American website.

RT using the term war for English speaking audiences is allowed because it is state sanctioned propaganda so you can come here and point to how they say it. Well, they also come here and pay people like Tim Pool to say things too that they won't say in Russia. reply selivanovp 5 hours agorootparentprev>But what is the official Russian position on it? Can it be called a war there? Of course it can and is called war in Russia. You just missing the point: war is a juridical term. Technically neither Russia nor Ukraine are in war with each other. That's why officially it's called \"Special Military Operation\", and in Ukraine it was for years \"Antiterrorists Operation\", and recently rebranded as \"armed aggression of Russian Federation against Ukraine sovereignty\". >The \"peaceful\" annexation of Crimea also came with Russian funding of separatist groups in eastern Ukraine and the shooting down of civilian aircraft. How peaceful is that? Your should learn some history and geography. Crimea is a peninsula in Black Sea, majority of population are ethnic Russians. Russian special forces entered Crimea after the coup in Kiev, and peacefully blocked Ukrainian military there and let referendum happen, so it was annexed. Most of Ukrainian soldiers stayed in Crimea and were from Crimea, got Russian citizenship just like all the other population. Those who refused were peacefully allowed to return to Ukrainian territory. Donbas is an Eastern region of Ukraine. First of all, how coup in Kiev happened? Ukrainian nationalists, driven by the idea of Ukraine dropping sovereignty and joining EU and NATO, attacked multiple military and police headquarters, got armed, entered Kiev, and after several weeks of riots in the capital that ended with mass shooting there, managed to force elected President of Ukraine and his government to flee. If you're unaware, this president was installed mostly by people in the Eastern Ukraine, opposing to previous one, that was voted in by Western part of Ukraine. So, basically, Western oligarchs (Ukraine during its 30+ years of independence was ruled by several oligarch clans originating from either Western (agricultural) or Eastern (industrial) part of Ukraine), their nationalists backed by USA embassy and Viki Nuland herself seized power in Ukraine. So Donbas with some help from remaining Eastern oligarchs started the uprising in Donetsk and Lughansk, and declared, that they want their rights for their language, religion etc be preserved (Most of Eastern Ukraine population are ethnic Russians and basically was part of Russia until 1922 or so, when Lenin gifted this territory and people to Ukrainian SSR). These people also started to raid police and military bases, got armed. So, coup government in Ukraine, instead of talking to these people, announced \"antiterrorists operation\" and moved army to get Donbass under control, and they started from bombing Lughansk. That's basically how it turned to war. As to civilian plane, it was shot down many weeks after direct confrontation started, and it's up to this day very arguable who actually shot it down, as the court in Netherlands turned this case into the same farce as investigation of Nord Stream sabotage, where they were using only facts that suits their version, and ignored everything, that didn't fit the picture. reply aguaviva 2 hours agorootparentTechnically neither Russia nor Ukraine are in war with each other. Then the \"technical\" distinction is obviously irrelevant. That's why officially it's called \"Special Military Operation\" And the official justification is pure hogwash, of course.

So let me make sure I understand your story perfectly. Russia was so concerned about Ukrainian sovereignty that they sent their military into Crimea. And instead of allowing Crimea to exist as a sovereign state with what Russia viewed as the rightful president/government of Ukraine... it instead annexed it and said this is Russia now? Quite interesting. It's almost as if Russia didn't care about the \"integrity\" of the elections and just wanted more land for itself. reply selivanovp 4 hours agorootparent>So let me make sure I understand your story perfectly. Russia was so concerned about Ukrainian sovereignty that they sent their military into Crimea. Not really. Russian military was already in Crimea. If you're unaware, Sevastopol is a major Russian fleet base since 18th century, and both marines and regular soldiers were stationed there based on signed agreement with Ukraine government. >And instead of allowing Crimea to exist as a sovereign state with what Russia viewed as the rightful president/government of Ukraine... it instead annexed it and said this is Russia now? Those people, who Nuland and K installed as government of Ukraine after the coup were declaring as their political goal to kick Russia out of Crimea, broke the 50 years long deal and turn Sevastopol to a NATO fleet base. So yes, as soon as they were installed and declared by the West as the legitimate government of Ukraine, Putin annexed Crimea, to create a territorial dispute, that will not allow NATO to legally accept Ukraine. >Quite interesting. It's almost as if Russia didn't care about the \"integrity\" of the elections and just wanted more land for itself. Another interesting fact to you: Crimea was an Autonomous Republic, and it actually tried to separate from Ukraine in the 90's to rejoin Russia by referendum, but Kiev government sent troops there and rewrote Crimean constitution to prevent any separation. reply aguaviva 2 hours agorootparentRussian military was already in Crimea.

That said, cave paintings, which are arguably the earliest \"documentation\" we have of human activity and their thoughts, depict pretty tangible things; pictures of animals, hand prints, people hunting animals, plants? that kind of thing. The earliest religious symbols may have been venus statues, but it seems that it cannot be concluded definitively whether they were objects of worship / depictions of deities. That said, there's clear signs of shamanic religion dating from the upper paleolithic, 50.000 years BC and onwards. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_religion is a good read. Anyway, ~52.000 years ago is still fairly recent, given homo sapiens emerged ~300.000 years ago and the earliest stone tools were from ~3.3 million years ago. Personally, I think religion / the concept of gods or a higher power has been a part of humanity for as long as we've had the ability to think smort thoughts and communicate with one another.

By the way she was speaking, I thought she was talking about some events that must have happened during her father's life, maybe his childhood - I assumed she was upset about some communist era Patriarch who probably was too friendly with the regime or something.

    "originBody": "Simon Willison’s Weblog Subscribe Qwen2.5-Coder-32B is an LLM that can code well that runs on my Mac 12th November 2024 There’s a whole lot of buzz around the new Qwen2.5-Coder Series of open source (Apache 2.0 licensed) LLM releases from Alibaba’s Qwen research team. On first impression it looks like the buzz is well deserved. Qwen claim: Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct has become the current SOTA open-source code model, matching the coding capabilities of GPT-4o. That’s a big claim for a 32B model that’s small enough that it can run on my 64GB MacBook Pro M2. The Qwen published scores look impressive, comparing favorably with GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet (October 2024) edition across various code-related benchmarks: How about benchmarks from other researchers? Paul Gauthier’s Aider benchmarks have a great reputation and Paul reports: The new Qwen 2.5 Coder models did very well on aider’s code editing benchmark. The 32B Instruct model scored in between GPT-4o and 3.5 Haiku. 84% 3.5 Sonnet, 75% 3.5 Haiku, 74% Qwen2.5 Coder 32B, 71% GPT-4o, 69% Qwen2.5 Coder 14B, 58% Qwen2.5 Coder 7B That was for the Aider “whole edit” benchmark. The “diff” benchmark scores well too, with Qwen2.5 Coder 32B tying with GPT-4o (but a little behind Claude 3.5 Haiku). Given these scores (and the positive buzz on Reddit) I had to try it for myself. My attempts to run the Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct-GGUF Q8 using llm-gguf were a bit too slow, because I don’t have that compiled to use my Mac’s GPU at the moment. But both the Ollama version and the MLX version worked great! I installed the Ollama version using: ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:32b That fetched a 20GB quantized file. I ran a prompt through that using my LLM tool and Sergey Alexandrov’s llm-ollama plugin like this: llm install llm-ollama llm models # Confirming the new model is present llm -m qwen2.5-coder:32b 'python function that takes URL to a CSV file and path to a SQLite database, fetches the CSV with the standard library, creates a table with the right columns and inserts the data' Here’s the result. The code worked, but I had to work around a frustrating ssl bug first (which wouldn’t have been an issue if I’d allowed the model to use requests or httpx instead of the standard library). I also tried running it using the Apple Silicon fast array framework MLX using the mlx-llm library directly, run via uv like this: uv run --with mlx-lm \\ mlx_lm.generate \\ --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct-8bit \\ --max-tokens 4000 \\ --prompt 'write me a python function that renders a mandelbrot fractal as wide as the current terminal' That gave me a very satisfying result—when I ran the code it generated in a terminal I got this: MLX reported the following performance metrics: Prompt: 49 tokens, 95.691 tokens-per-sec Generation: 723 tokens, 10.016 tokens-per-sec Peak memory: 32.685 GB Let’s see how it does on the Pelican on a bicycle benchmark. llm -m qwen2.5-coder:32b 'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle' Here’s what I got: Questionable Pelican SVG drawings aside, this is a really promising development. 32GB is just small enough that I can run the model on my Mac without having to quit every other application I’m running, and both the speed and the quality of the results feel genuinely competitive with the current best of the hosted models. Given that code assistance is probably around 80% of my LLM usage at the moment this is a meaningfully useful release for how I engage with this class of technology.

Best thing about it is that it's an OSS model that can be hosted by anyone, resulting in an open competitive market bringing hosting costs down, currently sitting at $0.18/$0.18 M tok/s [1] making it 50x cheaper than Sonnet 3.5 and ~17x cheaper than Haiku 3.5. [1] https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen-2.5-coder-32b-instruct reply Vetch 8 hours agoparentClaude Sonnet 3.5s are bars too high to clear. No other model comes close, with the occasional exception of o1-preview. But o1-preview is always a gamble, your rolls are limited and it will either be the best answer possible from an LLM or it returns after a wild goose chase, having talked itself into a tangled mess of confusion. I'd personally rank the Qwen2.5 32B model only a little behind GPT4o at worst, and preferable to gemini 1.5 pro 002 (at code only, Gemini is a model that's surprisingly bad at code considering its top class STEM reasoning). This makes Qwen2.5-coder-32B astounding all considered. It's really quite capable and is finally an accessible model that's useful for real work. I tested it on some linear algebra, discussed pros and cons of a belief propagation based approach to SAT solving, had it implement a fast simple approximate nearest neighbor based on the near orthogonality of random vectors in high dimensions (in OCaml, not perfect with but close enough to useful/easily correctable), simulate execution of a very simple recursive program (also Ocaml) and write a basic post processing shader for Unity. It did really well on each of those tasks. reply dragonsh 7 hours agorootparentNot really tried the Claude 3.5, later tried o1-preview on github models and recently Qwen2.5 32B for a prompt to generate a litestar[0] app to manage a wysiwyg content using grapesjs[1] and use pelican[2] to generate static site. It generated very bad code and invented many libraries in import which didn't exist. Cluade was one of the worst code generator, later tried sieve of atkin to generate primes to N and then use miller-rabin test to test each generated prime both using all the cpu core available. Claude completely failed and could never get a correct code without some or the other errors especially using multiprocess, o1-preview got it right in first attempt, Qwen 2.5 32B got it right in 3'rd error fix. In general for some very simple code Claude is correct but when using something new it completely fails, o1-preview performs much better. Give a try to generate some manim community edition visualization using Claude, it generates something not working correct or with errors, o1-preview does much better job. In most of my test o1-preview performed way better than Claude and Qwen was not that bad either.

If the benchmark dosn't represent real world scenarios, isn't that a problem with the benchmark rather than the model? reply isoprophlex 9 hours agorootparentIf your benchmark covers all possible programming tasks then you dont need an llm, you need search over your benchmark. Hypothetically let's say the benchmark contains \"test divisibility of this integer by n\" for all n of the form 3x+1. An extremely overfit llm won't be able to code divisibility for all n not of the form 3x+1, and your benchmark will never tell. reply YetAnotherNick 2 hours agorootparentNo, because solving a well defined problem with well defined right or wrong is generally not what people use llm for. Most of the times my query to llm is underspecified, and lot of time I figure out the problem when chatting with LLM. And benchmark by definition only measures just right/wrong answer. reply LeoPanthera 8 hours agorootparentprevThis is called Goodhart's law, who said: \"Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.\" But in modern usage it is often rephrased to: \"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law reply ithkuil 4 hours agorootparentprevIt's more subtle than this: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_te... reply exitb 9 hours agorootparentprevOverfitting is a concern. reply anonzzzies 9 hours agoparentprevIt's small...

Super useful for confidential / secret work though reply InsideOutSanta 8 hours agoparentIn my experience, a lot of companies still have rules against using tools like Copilot due to security and copyright concerns, even though many software engineers just to ignore them. This could be a way to satisfy both sides, although it only solves the issue of sending internal data to companies like OpenAI, it doesn't solve the \"we might accidentally end up with somebody else's copyrighted code in our code base\" issue. reply dizhn 8 hours agoparentprevWhat provider/service do you use for this? reply kundi 8 hours agoprevIt seems fine-tuned for benchmarking more than the actual tasks reply tucnak 9 hours agoprevThe issue with some recent models is that they're basically overfitting on public evals, and it's not clear who's the biggest offender—OpenAI, or the Chinese? And regardless, \"Mandelbrot in plaintext\" is a bad choice for evaluation's sake. The public datasets are full of stuff like that. You really want to be testing stuff that isn't overfit to death, beginning with tasks that notoriously don't generalise all too well, all the while being most indicative of capability: like, translating a program that is unlikely to have been included in the training set verbatim, from a lesser-known language—to a well-known language, and back. I'd be shocked if this model held up in the comprehensive private evals. reply simonw 6 hours agoparentThat's why I threw in \"same size as your terminal window\" for the Mandelbrot demo - I thought that was just enough of a tweak to avoid exact regurgitation of some previously trained program. I have not performed comprehensive evals of my own here - clearly - but I did just enough to confirm that the buzz I was seeing around this model appeared to hold up. That's enough for me to want to write about it. reply tucnak 6 hours agorootparentHey, Simon! Have you ever considered to host private evals? I think, with the weight of the community behind you, you could easily accumulate a bunch of really high-quality, \"curated\" data, if you will. That is to say, people would happily send it to you. More people should self-host stuff like https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat without revealing their dataset, I think, and we would probably trust it more than the public stuff, considering they already trust _you_ to some extent! So far the private eval scene is just a handful of guys on twitter reporting their findings in unsystematic manner, but a real grassroots approach backed up by a respectable influencer would go a long way to change that. Food for thought. reply simonw 4 hours agorootparentHonestly I don't think I have the right temperament for being a reliable source for evals. I've played around with a few ideas - like \"Pelicans on a bicycle\" https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/25/pelicans-on-a-bicycle/ - but running evals well on an ongoing basis requires a focus and attention to detail that isn't a great fit for how I work. Here's Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B for \"Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle\" https://gist.github.com/simonw/56217af454695a90be2c8e09c7031... reply tucnak 4 hours agorootparent\"Pelican on a bicycle\" is really fun, honestly. I hope it doesn't go the way of the unicorn! :-D reply JimDabell 7 hours agoparentprev> The issue with some recent models is that they're basically overfitting on public evals… You really want to be testing stuff that isn't overfit to death… I'd be shocked if this model held up in the comprehensive private evals. From the announcement: > we selected the latest 4 months of LiveCodeBench (2024.07 - 2024.11) questions as the evaluation, which are the latest published questions that could not have leaked into the training set, reflecting the model’s OOD capabilities. — https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-coder-family/ reply tucnak 6 hours agorootparentThey say a lot of things, like that their base models weren't instruction-tuned, however people have confirmed that it's impossible to find instruction that it wouldn't follow, and the output would indicate that exactly. The labs absolutely love incorporating public evals in their training; of course, they're not going to admit that. reply isoprophlex 9 hours agoparentprevAll the big guys are hiring domain experts - serious brains, phd level, in some cases - to build bespoke train and test data for their models.

The big labs _are_ hiring serious PhD level researchers, and most of these are physicists, Bayesians of many kind and breed, not \"domain experts.\" However, perception matters a lot these days; some labs, I won't point, but OpenAI is probably the biggest offender, simply cannot control themselves. The fact of the matter is they LOVE including the public evals in their finetuning, as it makes them appear stronger in the \"benchmarks.\" reply kwlranb 8 hours agorootparentprevThe PhD folks will steal from Stackoverflow and leetcode solutions. Just another laundering buffer. Hardly any PhD has the patience or skill for that matter to code robust solutions from scratch. Just look at PhD code in the wild. reply f1shy 9 hours agoparentprev> like, translating a program that is unlikely to have been included in the training set verbatim, from a lesser-known language—to a well-known language, and back. I would exactly want to see that, or \"make a little interpreter for a basic subset of C, or Scheme or \". reply tucnak 6 hours agorootparentSo far, non-English inputs have been most telling: I deal with Ukrainian datasets mostly, and what we see is OpenAI models, the Chinese models, of course, and Llama's, to admittedly, lesser extent—all degrading disproportionately compared to the other models. You know what model degrades the least comparatively? Gemma 27b. The arena numbers would suggest it's not so strong, but they'd actually managed to make something useful for the whole world (I can only judge re: Ukrainian, of course, but I suspect it's probably equally good in the other languages, too.) However, nothing can compete currently with Sonnet 3.5 in reasoning. I predict a surge in the private eval scene when people inevitably grow wary of leaderboard-propaganda.

They really want you to use at least 16kB block sizes with this drive. NAND page sizes have been larger than 4kB for quite a while now, but most SSDs still put significant effort into handling 4kB IO operations well. This market segment of server drives optimized for capacity over performance or endurance is where vendors are most willing to be up front about how your workload really should be appropriate for the drive. reply dylan604 15 hours agoparentOr it could be a boon for video/audio/graphics types. I’m used to setting up my spinning rust arrays with 64k block sizes. Continuous reads from large files vs lots of tiny files is something that tripped up a lot of storage vendors trying to break into the media world. reply bufferoverflow 2 hours agorootparentIt's very expensive. Gen5 SSDs are around $100/TB. Hard drives are $16/TB. It makes sense to have a small fast SSD for editing, but HDDs for mass-storage. And with video you usually want redundancy, storage gets expensive fast. reply dylan604 1 hour agorootparentAnd with any data you usually want redundancy, FTFY But I know what you meant. I used to have systems built with multiple small arrays where the original sources were in RAID-5 (pre-raid6). The software would read from that array and write to a RAID0 array as these files were only ephemeral. The software would then read from that RAID0 and write to a second RAID0 to avoid reading/writing to the same volume. This was all before SSDs. For the lulz, I would love to see how that workflow would perform with NVMe storage. At the time of using these systems, spinning rust was not $16/TB and was probably closer to the $100/TB. I still remember $1k/GB in the early 90s reply starspangled 14 hours agoparentprevPhysical NAND pages aren't really relevant. At least some high end SSDs I know of would gang multiple NAND chips together anyway and effectively the page size would be X*physical (where X might be 8 or 16). It could still do 512 byte writes well if it was configured that way. The limiting factor is the size of the forward map structures. To a lesser degree also things like garbage collection overheads and reverse map structures (particularly if you support deduplication or snapshots). But forward map is the main thing. reply cm2187 12 hours agoparentprevI believe they always do that with the ION line which has crap endurance for random writes (relative to the average datacenter SSD), so I assume it's a way to reassure customers that the non random is not that bad. reply jauntywundrkind 13 hours agoparentprev16kB pages is fine with me, so long as drives have Flexible Data Placement, where they can specify a placement group for their writes. This will let the drive write associated data together & avoid write-amplification problems. Alas I have yet to see many drives advertise FDP clearly. In fact I've seen deception, such as Micron claiming to demo FDP with their 7450 Pro series, but they aren't testing official NVMe FDP, they just namespaced their drive into four equal sizes. One major advantage of FDP is it doesn't need ahead of time subdividing! https://www.micron.com/about/blog/storage/ssd/benefits-of-fl... This was supposed to be a pretty low lift for driver makers, and the hyperscalers were beating down the door for FDP. I'm shocked it's a year latter and it's still not clear how we can get drives that will work with us to combat write amplification. reply piskov 15 hours agoprevPablo Escobar used to announce the price of cocaine on the radio every day, but you will not know even the estimate for an SSD :-) reply wmf 14 hours agoparentThere are a few retailers that carry enterprise SSDs so you don't have to \"call for pricing\", eg. https://www.wiredzone.com/shop/category/components-hard-driv... reply choppaface 11 hours agorootparentFor those who don’t want to click thru: the link shows Gen 4 60 TB drives from Western Digital and Solidigm for ~$7,262.00 ($121/TB). The Micron Gen 5 part is likely much more money. Note on eBay there are currently many listings for 2018-era Intel 8TB P4510 Gen 3 drives, some for as little as $50/TB. These drives have great (enterprise) endurance and performance and became a key part in the sale from Intel to Solidigm. The Micron listing is certainly a milestone, but the NVME market is getting as crowded as CPUs (e.g. 10-year-old Haswell is still plenty useful today). reply brunorsini 15 hours agoparentprevMoore's law: making us disappointed by the storage industry since 1965. reply ClumsyPilot 15 hours agoparentprevSSDs cost more per gram? reply 93po 3 hours agorootparentprinter ink sure does reply xuki 15 hours agoprevLooking forward to have this in my homelab in 10 years. reply userbinator 13 hours agoparentIn 10 years they'll all be worn out. reply shiroiushi 13 hours agorootparentI'm pretty sure he means brand-new versions, with the idea that high-end enterprise tech like this will eventually become inexpensive consumer-level tech, as it usually does. reply edgineer 13 hours agorootparentOld drives on eBay are somehow usually in great condition and barely used in my experience. reply xuki 12 hours agorootparentprevYou would be surprised!

In our storage we had complete servers and storage originally packaged in case server in our Datacentar would die. After x years we decommissioned both of them.

Asrock + cheap epyc seems to be the most plausible replacement when it dies. reply bjoli 10 hours agorootparentprevI tried that AMD thing, and getting things to work properly is hard. Hardly any motherboards advertise ecc support, and getting it to work is finicky and brittle. I stopped using it on my main computer after it silently stopped working and started giving me other memory issue after an OS update. reply karlgkk 10 hours agorootparentSkill issue. You had to do some actual research on the boards. I grabbed a few manuals and ended up with an asrock. reply bjoli 5 hours agorootparentThis was on ASRock X570M Pro4, with a memory from the qvl. I validated that it worked, and then one day it stopped working after a system update. I gave up on ecc on AMD consumer chipsets.

That works out at ~285 years - is that really correct? (I'm not really familiar with what's considered normal for devices of this class) reply zamadatix 15 hours agoparentAs far as I understand it MTTF measured in device hours is meant to give expectation on how often to expect a failure when you buy a pool of devices and run them a reasonable amount of time (I.e. a number to tell you when you buy 2,000 of this how to calculate your expected failure interval) not necessarily \"how long an individual device is expected to keep working\". reply magicalhippo 14 hours agoparentprevThis[1] page explains MTTF as follows: The MTTF is a statistical value that defines after how much time a first failure in a population of devices may occur (measured in hours). If MTTF is given as 1 million hours, and the drives are operated within the specifications, one drive failure per hour can be expected for a population of 1 million drives. For the more realistic quantity of 1000 drives, a Managed Service Provider (MSP) should plan for a failure every 1000 hours (almost 42 days). It also has some formulas to convert MTTF to Annualized Failure Rate (AFR).

Last I've heard they were still handily beating them but it has been a while reply superkuh 15 hours agorootparentI'd heard the Micron 7450 Pro 15 TB u.3 is comparable to an Optane 905p 1.5TB u.2 when it comes to random 4K IO; spec sheet states, \"Latency, READ (TYP): 80μs, WRITE (TYP): 15μs\" and 500k iops. Whereas a typical Optane 905p has 10μs writes up to 500 kiops. (ref: https://www.micron.com/content/dam/micron/global/public/docu... vs https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16636/rr-rate-905p-1500.pn...)

    "originBody": "We Just Gave $750,000 to Open Source Maintainers Chad Whitacre Sentry started out as an Open Source side project in 2008. Today we are a Fair Source company with 100,000+ organizations on our SaaS and $100M+ ARR, but we have not forgotten our roots nor the hundreds of Open Source maintainers whose work we depend on for our success. Every year we share our success with the community, and 2024 is no different. This year, our budget is $750,000, up 50% from last year. We have 129 engineers right now, so that works out to $5,813 per developer on staff. The Open Source Pledge Exists Now Of course, the big news this year is that, together with dozens of other companies, we launched the Open Source Pledge. It’s great that Sentry pays maintainers, but we can’t solve the Open Source sustainability crisis by ourselves. The good news is that we’re not alone. Through the Pledge, many other companies are also stepping up to the plate, paying maintainers at least $2,000 per year per dev on staff and blogging about it annually to drive awareness and accountability. If your company would like to be part of this movement alongside the likes of Laravel, HeroDevs, StackBlitz, GitButler, and, as of today, Sanity, learn how to join. Sentry’s Distributions for 2024 Our main distributions this year are as follows: Recipient Amount ($) Django 30,000 OSI 30,000 Outreachy 25,000 Python 16,500 OpenJS 15,000 Rust 15,000 rrweb 15,000 SPI (PostgreSQL) 15,000 Geomys (Go) 15,000 PHP 12,000 Apache 10,000 Ruby Central 10,000 .NET 10,000 sum 218,500 % of overall budget 29 Armin Nehzat at thanks.dev helped me manage these relationships again. For the other $531,500, we used three platforms to distribute money in an automated fashion to smaller projects and individual maintainers. thanks.dev - $381,500 (totaling $600,000 with the above-managed distributions) - Honestly, the algorithmic allocations on thanks.dev are almost too powerful. I get kind of lost balancing the forest and the trees now that we have well over 500 recipients across seven ecosystems. GitHub Sponsors - $75,000 - GitHub offers very rudimentary tools for bulk sponsorship. They don’t include any algorithmic allocation. For this reason, we keep it simple on Sponsors, distributing small amounts monthly to as many maintainers of our dependencies as we can. This year, it seems that many of you have been upping your minimums—as you probably should!—so we only achieved about 90% coverage across our three orgs (getsentry, codecov, and syntaxfm). That said, the Syntax crew is having some extra fun with part of this budget ... more details on that soon. Open Source Collective - $75,000 - Open Source Collective is working on a pilot program to allocate funds algorithmically using data from Ecosyste.ms. Does your company want to be part of it? Reach out to OSC. I’ll update this post with a link to how specifically these funds were distributed when that program starts up. We Need A Conversation About Allocation With the Open Source Pledge, we are working to unlock the flow of funds from companies to maintainers. Insofar as we are successful, we will need to have a lot more conversations about how to allocate those funds. I see a lot of proposals around allocation that require companies to pay more attention to their dependencies through bounties, goals, perks, and whatnot. The problem is that attention is expensive. There are way too many of you maintainers for me to decide precisely what to pay each one of you individually based on a full review of your contributions and circumstances. We need approaches to allocation that require less attention, especially to win over companies who care a lot less about Open Source maintainers than Sentry does. Write a big check, pick a few high-level ecosystems, … and then what? I see two options: algorithms and people. On the one hand, platforms such as thanks.dev, Open Collective, and GitHub Sponsors can keep developing and refining algorithms for allocation. We are really early days on this. Platforms have an opportunity to differentiate and earn the community’s trust by developing allocation algorithms openly and transparently. On the other hand, I see an opportunity for the leadership of FOSS foundations to take on more responsibility. Their scope has been expanding for decades. Newer entities such as the PHP Foundation intentionally focus on paying maintainers, at least for the core, if not the wider library ecosystem. The Pledge intends to pay maintainers so Open Source stays healthy. Ecosystem foundations seem to me to be a natural venue for each community to hash out for itself the best way to distribute funds toward that end. One way or another, we’re proud at Sentry to run our own Open Source funding program for the fourth year in a row and to continue driving this wider conversation.

I help develop an open source game engine and they have given us a free team license for their product since it is open source. They've been invaluable for fighting crashes and regressions. reply kmelve 23 hours agoprevI had the great pleasure of processing Sanity's donations to open source projects too. Hope other companies follow suit! reply vanschelven 8 hours agoprevThis is a great initiative, but one wonders to which degree this is mostly a marketing stunt, white-washing their own \"fair source\" efforts. Sentry is a multi-billion company, and Open Source pays exactly none of their bills (though it may serve other purposes). This leads to pages such as [1] where they actively steer users away from self-hosting their \"open source\" (in name only) solution. Much has been said about Sentry's switch to \"Fair Source\"[2], but for me personally, the ship of \"open source in name only\" sailed long before that with the ever-increasing complexity of managing your own setup.[3] It’s clear that the priority here has shifted to pushing users toward their hosted, paid plans. Business models beat licenses every time if you want to understand actual intentions.

We used to have places people could be committed to against their will so they could get help. The few places like this that are left can't function effectively due to being overloaded and are more like the county jail. Now these people end up homeless or die. reply bloudermilk 17 hours agoprevI'm very sorry to hear that your friend is experiencing this crisis and the distress it's causing you. I've been through similar episodes before, first with an immediate family member who experienced a months-long manic episode that was later diagnosed as manic bipolar disorder, then a close friend who experienced a drug-induced psychosis which evolved into long-term schizophrenia. I know how hard it is to watch someone you love behave erratically and how powerless it can feel to try and fail to help. Here's what I learned... The most important thing you can do is take care of yourself. Your own physical and mental health are prerequisites to caring for anyone else and being a part of extreme psychological distress of someone you love takes a huge toll. Lean on whatever practices you already have to stay healthy and content. Remember that what you're witnessing is not your fault and not in your control. The best way I've found to be supportive are to be present as much or little as I can without compromising my own being. Intervening, escalating, and trying to reason with people in this state seldom has the intended effect and often has the inverse effect. As much as you're able, accept your friend for who they are in this state, listen without judgement, and validate their experience without cosigning it. Stay in touch with their family and close friends and work together to seek medical intervention if they risk the well-being of themself or others. I'm here if you want to talk about it on a call or over email. Same handle at gmail. Be well and keep reaching out for support. reply qnleigh 16 hours agoparentI would add to this trying to find other people who know your friend and can help. Ideally local, but if he has friends who he trusts that he can talk to over phone/video that works too. Get their connect information. It sounds like this is beyond what any one person can handle on their own, but you are in a unique position to connect him with further resources, in general and during acute crises should they happen. Also know that 988 is now the nationwide suicide hotline number (in the US), and that you can also use this resource for yourself to deal with your friend's situation. Look up nearby crisis centers and save their info. Lastly, for me 'take care of yourself' means talking about the situation with trusted friends and family. There can be a tenancy to treat kinds of things as taboo, but open discussion and outside perspective can be extremely helpful. reply rented_mule 14 hours agorootparentI like the 988 advice. I'd take it a bit further... consider getting professional help (counselor, therapist, etc.) for yourself as well, at least temporarily. I see at least two angles where this can be beneficial... One is getting guidance on how to keep yourself as mentally healthy as possible while going through something so difficult. This is at the heart of the ideas I'm responding to above... you have to stay afloat to have any chance of helping. If you've ever been on a commercial flight, you've heard \"Put on your oxygen mask before helping others with their masks.\" The right professional can be a big help. Another is that a professional will be able to give you guidance about what you might be able to help your friend with, and things you probably shouldn't try to help with. Professionals have seen a much broader spectrum of situations and have a better idea of where they themselves might be able to help (or not) and where a layperson may be able to help (or not). And they can give you ideas for things to try that might help your friend while exposing you to less risk of harm. You're taking a smart step by asking for advice. In my experience, a professional often has the best advice. reply ttjjtt 17 minutes agoprevGetting seriously involved in changing someone else's life will incur major loss to your own. I'm speaking from several rounds of experience. It's not to be taken lightly and it's not an automatic moral duty. I would strongly argue that your duty is to make a full bodied effort to convince their family that their own is in mortal immediate crisis. If they don't respond to that after it's clearly and emphatically communicate then it's on them. Sadly your friend is almost certainly not going to seek out professional help unless someone intimately intervenes. reply mcmcmc 16 hours agoprevAs someone who has been on the opposite side of this scenario (diagnosed bipolar) the best thing your friend can do is get professional help. Since he’s refusing that, there’s not much you can do other than taking care of yourself and trying to minimize the damage from his episode. You won’t be able to talk him into it. He has to come to the decision that he wants to get better himself. There’s a good chance he will get worse before he gets better. He may become a danger to you or himself. If he has never been diagnosed with a mental health issue he may blame you for it as you forced a confrontation with reality when you called the crisis line. If you really wanna play psych nurse (which you will eventually be forced to if you continue living with him while his condition is untreated/unmanaged)start by declaring your home a drug and alcohol free zone. If he has a taste for them he’ll probably go get them on his own anyway, but increasing the barrier to access decreases the risk of other life altering mistakes. Try to make sure he eats enough and stays hydrated. My recommendation would be to give him an ultimatum: he gets into some kind of treatment or you go your separate ways. It doesn’t have to be psych care. I found going to a support group incredibly helpful when I was first coming to grips with my disorder. Before I found a specific group for bipolar I went to a couple AA meetings even though I wouldn’t call myself an alcoholic. Being with other people and watching them confront their demons can often make it easier to start facing your own. You are a good friend and it sucks your friend is going through this. But if you are not a trained mental healthcare professional you are not equipped to handle this. reply aabaker99 16 hours agoparentAddressed to GP. This resonates with my experience. When a friend is having their first manic episode, it’s hard to get them to recognize that and get the help they need. But after the aftermath of a couple manic episodes, my friend wanted to get help. Even when he had a hard time complying with meds, he was able to recognize when he was heading into another manic episode and get help proactively. My friend’s family do a few things to mitigate some of the bad decisions that a manic episode brings on. 1) the family has location tracking, 2) the family can pause credit cards, 3) the family can take away car keys. I don’t expect any of those mitigations will be able to be implemented today in your case. But if your friend is currently going through a bad manic episode then they will probably want to prevent future manic episodes from spiraling. Having a conversation about how to achieve that, and having a mutually defined set of warning signs, will help address the problem. reply nikisweeting 14 hours agorootparentYeah seconding this advice. If you really want to help someone who struggles with this, long-term help / working them on strategies to avoid escalating mania & exacerbating it in the future is the highest impact form of help. Don't agonize over how to handle the situation in the moment too much and don't take anything they say seriously or try to make any decisions, just keep them from hurting themselves and try to steer them towards medical help to the best of your abilities. reply ccleve 18 hours agoprevSudden onset mental health problems can have a physical cause. It's very important he have a thorough medical evaluation. Find the best place that you can to do the eval, and absolutely insist that they do a very detailed workup. A lot of doctors are dismissive of mental health issues. Find a good neurologist, and then push, push, push to get this done. If you make it happen, you'll be the best friend he could ever have. reply m463 16 hours agoprevFor adults a lot of this depends on the state/country you reside in. For example it is generally much harder in california, unless there is a \"danger to himself and others\" (which the suicide note actually HELPS with). It is important to start treatment promptly. You did the right thing. Also, independent of location, many people with mental illness have a corresponding condition called Anosognosia, which is basically a lack of insight into your own condition. It works kind of like denial. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia A book that can help communicate with someone with mental illness is I Am Not Sick, I Don't Need Help! by Xavier Amador (the author's brother had schizophrenia and communicating is challenging, although the book really helps) You can pass this on to his family. It is really tough to navigate through this if the person is not cooperative. reply exmadscientist 17 hours agoprevUnfortunately when it gets really bad, like this, there is just not much you can do. Calling the crisis team sounds like it was appropriate. I wish there was some state-sanctioned response in between \"please go see a doctor/please take your meds\" and \"you are now going to be involuntarily committed for possibly forever, hope you like your life getting ruined if it wasn't already\". But around here, at least, there is not. Those are your choices, and it is very, very painful. reply nikisweeting 14 hours agoparentApparently some regions have crisis intervention teams (e.g. Los Angeles through 988) that can be \"hands on\" / use limited physical coersion without involving police or going full 5150. Even if they do help in the moment though, what happens after they leave? I agree there's not nearly enough options for support on the 3~12 day timecale. reply Willingham 17 hours agoprevThe most you can do for him is to take care of yourself so that you are the best version of yourself if he reaches out for help. In the meantime, staying in contact and having normal “how’s the weather” conversation is important, so that you are not talking about the serious stuff every time you talk, and so that he doesn’t feel like you are cut off from him. Lastly, Al-Anon is very helpful to folks who have loved ones with mental health issues, not just alcoholism, if I were you I would try that out as well. I have an uncountable number of people in my life who have benefited from various 12 step programs. reply satori99 16 hours agoprevThankyou all for your help. It is becoming clear to me that this is way above my pay grade. I understand that my non-professional help may even make things worse. He has agreed to let me visit him in hospital today before he is discharged, but I fear he is not yet in a position to see things clearly for himself. I will likely have to move. reply rKarpinski 54 minutes agoparentIf they've had a previous episode and have lived with you for 5 years without incident it sounds like they are able to successfully manage whatever underlying issues they have, with the exception of this acute episode. > I will likely have to move. Much higher probability then the week before but I wouldn't rush to judgement. You don't want to be a live-in care taker but maybe this crisis was just a manageable bump in the road. Although, don't expect them to be completely back to baseline when they are discharged. reply tdeck 38 minutes agorootparentPersonally I think OP should move. A housemate relationship isn't a marriage, you don't need to stick with your housemate through thick and thin, and you need a safe home to rest and recover in. Sometimes people going through psychosis can do very strange and unpredictable things; not only is it stressful but it can become dangerous. I'm not saying it will, but at least taking the step of not living with the person seems prudent. reply abnercoimbre 1 hour agoparentprevPlease give us an update here if you can! Stand strong. reply PmTKg5d3AoKVnj0 16 hours agoprevDoes he do experimental work? Something that progresses so rapidly almost makes me think that a chemical used in work could be having an effect.

We did just have a US Presidential election. reply satori99 16 hours agoparentprevHe does work in a lab with serious compounds, but I have since been told by a member of his crisis team that they know about previous (relatively minor) mental health incidents in his past. I was completely unaware of this, so I am assuming he has dealt with this on his own for a long time, until he was unable to anymore. I am near certain he is not a drug user either. I have never seen any evidence of this, and in my experience drug addicts are not very good at hiding it when they lose control. Also, I contacted his work abbout his absense (without details) from my own phone. His colleague (boss?) called me back because they were already concerned about him late last week at work. If they suspected something concerning the work they do, they would have told me or the hospital. reply ac29 4 hours agorootparent> in my experience drug addicts are not very good at hiding it when they lose control.

Sometimes you really don't know! reply 6figurelenins 13 hours agorootparentprev> in my experience drug addicts are not very good at hiding it when they lose control Not sure if it's relevant, but psychedelics (mushrooms) broke a college friend after minimal recreational use. Like, maybe twice, with zero past history of any other controlled substance. His delusions were similar to what you described. In hindsight, I wasn't qualified to handle his deeply troubled mind. You did the right thing contacting family and seeking professional help. If he harms himself, it's not your fault. reply malux85 16 hours agoparentprevYeah mercury was my first thought too reply nh2 17 hours agoprevI have no expertise in this, but the first thing I would do is to call an expert on the topic that deals with such situations frequently. Many countries have suicide helplines (both public and private). For example, googling \"suicidal friends helpline [yourcountry]\" returns for the UK: https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/feelings-symptoms-behaviour... While many of these pages and helplines are targeted at the person going through the breakdown, I imagine they will also advise friends and family, and some pages are targeted specifically for them, for example this result (I have not read the full contents yet): https://www.rethink.org/advice-and-information/carers-hub/ge... reply schoen 17 hours agoparent> I imagine they will also advise friends and family They will definitely advise friends and family, although they may not have the proverbial silver bullet. reply samstokes 17 hours agoprevI'm sorry this is happening to you and to your friend. I have some similar experience and want to share some advice I wish I had heard earlier. It sounds to me like you did the right thing - situations like this can get worse if left unchecked and have serious consequences for the person in question and those around them. I'm not diagnosing your friend - I'm no expert, and various disorders can have those symptoms - but there are resources out there about (e.g.) mood disorders [1] that might give you some perspective and advice. Treatment can help, and can make a huge difference. Hospitals are unpleasant but can sometimes be the only way for someone who needs treatment to receive it. I am certainly no legal expert, but I think if he was forcibly committed to a hospital and police were involved, he's unlikely to be released without accepting treatment. You might find it helpful to join a support group for caregivers (e.g. [2]). In my experience it's common for friends as well as family members to attend those. People will offer resources and advice, as well as just sharing their experience, which can provide perspective and help with feeling lost. Also consider (if you're not already) finding a therapist of your own. People in one of these episodes can push boundaries, say things to you they wouldn't normally mean, and generally be hard to be around while maintaining your own health and boundaries - particularly if you're invested in trying to help them. [1] https://www.dbsalliance.org/education/ [2] https://www.dbsalliance.org/support/chapters-and-support-gro... reply satori99 15 hours agoparentThat is the part I do not understand. I have never agreed with any health professionals to be part of his ongoing care. I suspect his family may have done so, but are abandoning their responsibility? He had agreed to let me visit him in hospital very shortly, before he is discharged. I intend to make it very clear to the staff that I have not agreed to have any official role in his ongoing help. reply samstokes 10 hours agorootparentYou're right, you're not his caregiver, or obliged to be. Sorry if it sounded like I was suggesting that. I doubt the staff would expect or pressure you to take responsibility for him. If anything you might have trouble getting them to even discuss his case with you - different states vary but in some cases they won't share case details without explicit permission from the patient. (If that sounds frustrating given your first hand experience of his symptoms and their progression - I sympathise.) The support groups in particular may be useful despite that, just because you mentioned he's a housemate, so he may continue to be in your life. When I attended there were spouses, parents, but also just friends who wanted to help out their friend and understand what they were going through, without adopting responsibility for them. reply cwmoore 5 hours agoprevViolently extracting the man from his home demands sincere apologies. Without that, and if you choose to focus on your own wellbeing as so many suggest, there is no reason for him to trust you, or his own security. Water, food, shelter, clothing, and love are not bargaining chips to get someone to comply with medication, they are necessities and much more fundamental to mental health than pharmaceuticals with indeterminate effects. reply cwmoore 2 hours agoparentTo add, I understand GPs story and appreciate them for sharing. Finding themselves in an unmanageable situation I understand they are not directly at fault for the use of force, but the roommate still deserves an understanding apology from the person close to them who escalated authority. Since he refuses treatments, I recommend he quit everything except sleep, diet and exercise until he can respond normally to normal conversations, and suggest utilizing motels. reply fred_is_fred 57 minutes agoparentprevIt was the mental health crisis team who made that decision to remove him. I don't think it's fair to blame OP - who presumably called out of concern. If that is your take then you are suggesting that nobody call for help in a mental health crisis for any reason, which I don't think is a valid take. reply cwmoore 45 minutes agorootparentThe straw-man invalid take is not really helpful to a shared living situation. Why not apologize for the consequences of the concern? New events can be a call to renew agreements. reply 93po 3 hours agoparentprevAgree with this - calling the cops on him is a harmful action even if the intention was a positive end result. If this is in the US, you just pointed violent people with firearms at your friend, and asked them to use violence against him. I would never trust someone again who did that to me. reply Atotalnoob 1 hour agorootparentHang on, op didn’t call the police, they called a crisis team who are trained professionals. Those professionals, for better or worse, chose to include the police. reply nl 18 hours agoprevIt's hard to give generic advice but it sounds like calling the crisis team was a good decision. One thing that generally helps is to get the person talking (and don't offer them advice - listen and help them talk things though themselves). I've found going for walks with people is good. Can you take him hiking? reply greentxt 3 hours agoprev\"I'm not sick I don't need help\" was a very useful read at one point. A key point I recall is the importance of avoiding taking an adversarial stance and maintaining trust. reply dgeiser13 17 hours agoprevWhat country are you in? Sometimes actual medical issues can cause psychosis, e.g. UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections) or brain tumors. Getting him into a safe environment was the correct thing to do. If he returns and you don't feel safe then getting yourself into a safe environment is the correct thing to do. reply sdwr 18 hours agoprevI've had a few moments like that, it's not a pleasant thing to be around. In that kind of mental breakdown, you get addicted to the story you build in your head, where you are special and important and on the verge of something great (but also worthless and doomed). Healing means giving that up and returning to baseline, and you can't do that for him. Protect yourself first reply lioeters 16 hours agoprevThat must be a difficult situation, and you're a good friend for trying to help. I've only had a few brushes with similar mental health issues in friends and family, but in the worst situations it was necessary to get professional help, such as police, hospital, community services. (Police as the last resort.) This is beyond what any well-wishing friend can be expected to do. I think you need support from other people with experience in the matter. It sounds like your friend needs psychiatric treatment, probably medication. Maybe hospitalization until things are stable. reply yungporko 7 hours agoprevi have experience with psychotic episodes in my family and partner, and unfortunately professional intervention is the only thing that can actually help. there is absolutely nothing you can do to help him or snap him out of it, all you can do is try to limit what he can get his hands on that he could do any damage with. as shitty as it is, the best thing you can do is get out of there so he doesn't drag you down with him. you will burn out fast if you try to run around after him and take care of him. i'm not exaggerating when i say that it will ruin you. the only thing worse than dealing with a crazy person is dealing with a crazy person who is smarter than you. you can't help. if things get worse, it wasn't because you \"didn't do enough\". he needs antipsychotic medication and professional help and you can't provide that. i hope you both end up being ok. reply sadcodemonkey 16 hours agoprevLook up the book titled \"I am not sick I don't need help! How to help someone with mental illness accept treatment\" by Xaviar Amador. In a nutshell, the key is not to insist that your friend recognize that they're paranoid and suffering from delusions. You can't win that battle. Instead, get him to see that he can alleviate some of the immediate problems he's currently encountering (with work, family, doctors, you, etc) by getting an evaluation and medical treatment. In other words, to motivate him to get help, you might have to entertain some of his delusions to a certain degree. You have to play his mental game, until he (hopefully) gets treatment or medication and begins to see things more rationally. If the two of you are not on speaking terms, find someone that he trusts and is willing to talk to, and get them to try this strategy. This helped me when I was trying to convince a loved one with severe mental illness to make certain decisions about getting assistance and medical care that they were very resistant to. Good luck. This is a very difficult and stressful thing to deal with, and as many others have advised, you should consider seeking support for your own mental health as well. reply komposit 9 hours agoprevI'm sorry this is happening to you and I know all too well how distressing it is to be a compassionate onlooker in an event like this. Something similar (although likely less severe) happened to my wife in a not too distant past. More or less from one day to the next she started feeling very very unsafe, thought people were after her and conspiring to take away our child. She started writing protective symbols on the walls and doors of our house and felt she was talking to ghosts. I would find her yelling at passersby from our flat window. No one in her life, including me, felt like a safe person anymore. To me it felt like this foreign power had invaded our life and started ripping everything to shreds. I honestly have never been so stressed in my life. Luckily we did find our way out of it. My wife was on ADHD medication at the time (dexamfetamine) and we had been going through a rough time our marriage. Covid had just happened and we had a 3yo son. I think by the time she started developing delusions she probably hadn't slept well for months. Her mother came to live with us for a couple of weeks, we stopped the dexamfetamine and we focused on just making our life as low stress and loving as possible. I am honestly so grateful that we managed to navigate our way out of this together and that we are fine now. I can't give you much by way of advice. The position you are in is unfair and whatever you do to help your friend is commendable. One thing I realized is that once the human mind is stressed enough it becomes a sort of runaway nuclear reactor, stuck in a cycle of every more stressful thoughts. The kind of behaviors you will see in that situation are hard to witness, and the best thing you can do as a friend is to provide safety, even when the other person sees the opposite. Living together with this person might not be a workable or safe situation for you or for him, and unfair as it might be you might end up in a position where you have to make this call. Your friend might see this as a betrayal. Be compassionate to yourself and your friend in this moment. Know you are trying to make the best out of an impossible situation. Understand you are not in control and that you are afraid to do the wrong thing and that the fact that you feel this way is what makes you a good friend. Best of luck! reply screye 17 hours agoprevI've seen something similar happen before. If it's severe, then it's out of your hand. But anecdotally, here's something that's worked for people who are still, for the lack of a better word, sane. So everything from here assumes there is an external (work/people/existential) cause, and not an internal pathology (BPD, Schizo, Brain Tumor). I'm also assuming that both of you have a requisite level of intimacy as friends & that this isn't a drug use problem. My solution: Take a long walk with him. I mean a loong walk. Ideally on a quiet night, lasting 5+ hours. You can't pull someone out of a spiral, but a person can pull themselves out if given enough space & time. Anecdotally, you stay quiet and let the silence build up for the first hour. Eventually, the person starts talking. They'll spend the first couple of hours rambling with only a couple of hints interspersed. Don't pounce on anything, but prod them in the direction of those hints. Soon, they'll start circling around the real issue more aggressively and if you're lucky (FWIW), that's when the levee breaks. I'd say it's the norm for men to cry at this point. I mean, if it causes a mental breakdown, it's big enough to make them cry. If you reach here, then be very gentle here on out. This person has revealed their softest underbelly. Everything here on out should be unconditional support. Have a seat. It's easier to talk when you're walking, but it is easier to cry seated. Liminal/transitional spaces (train stations, over passes, tiny parks) are the best. At some point, the tears dry out & some degree of catharsis is achieved. Then, they're ready to walk back again. This is where you can starting looking at optimistic change : how does the person get out of this mess ? Keep this uncomplicated. Give them a simple & optimistic conclusion to cling onto for the next time they spiral. Outline the first step to mark the beginning of a way out. And explicitly give them permission to call you anytime/anywhere if this happens again. If you're lucky, the sun will start rising, the city will begin waking up, and optics of a new-day will give them another soft push toward optimism.

Eat plenty and sleep plenty. He should follow the advice of his doctor however the medical profession tends to treat most psychotic episodes as wholly delusional. If he denies any validity or even the existence of this episode in order to recover he runs the risk of treading the same path and risking another episode. There can be insight in these episodes but it requires some recovery to see objectively. I suspect he could know what caused the episode but it may be suppressed into his subconscious. It's a life's work to integrate. Therapy can help. Meditation can help (with the caveat that if you get serious with practice it can trigger another episode). Ultimately if I was you I would consider moving out. Depending on how much support he needs in this time it may not be a role you are prepared for or should be expected to take on.

My first encounter with this was a close friend I'd grown up with and who was also seemingly quite intelligent. He'd had one violent incident in the past involving weed that triggered some kind of psychotic episode that was waiting to happen, and then nothing for many years, until he started down this paranoid pseudo-science veganism and yoga cures all diseases, fasting, breatharianism type direction. Apparently there was more happening that I didn't see, started keeping weapons around, lots of psychedelics. In retrospect, he was almost certainly schizophrenic, ended up attacking someone during a psychotic episode and unfortunately his life ended early and dramatically. After that, some of the signals became harder to ignore, and noticed that another more distant acquaintance started repeating similar things as your friend, except on LinkedIn of all places. Many delusional, spiraling paranoid posts of grandeur (not in the typical weird way everyone does on that platform), describing the government coming to get him after he isolated in the countryside.

I began a regimen last year and had side effects which sound quite similar to this. Sometimes they are like night a day for people in a good sense.

I eventually learned about ‘suicide crisis syndrome’ and evidently new antidepressant prescriptions are at least somewhat correlated with this state.

I explain that mania often feels really good! It can feel like \"everything is really important and meaningful\" all of a sudden, and that \"there is a greater truth that they see clearly now\". I ask if they think they are experiencing something like that? I ask if they care about limiting potential long term damage to their brain. I try to offer a selection of choices of ways to come down from mania safely: e.g. would you be ok doing a group call with a doctor to discuss ways to limit damage? would you be comfortable taking some seroquel/lithium/GABA-ergic drug with medical supervision? what about trying to get some sleep? etc. Steer clear of stimulants/weed/psychedelics, they usually make mania worse. Another common effect of mania is tanked working memory, it's very hard to avoid thought loops or stay on a single train of thought for more than a few minutes. If you find discussions sliding backwards or repeating often, help them externalize their working memory on a whiteboard, paper, voice memos, etc. so they can actually think clearly. The relief they experience from lowering working memory load / not having to re-derive every train of thought Memento-style helps a ton to lower combativeness + re-ground them in reality. If you have any experience with high dose psychedelics you can sort of model mania as a similar mental state and \"tripsit\" them in similar ways. Keep in mind that even though their working memory is tanked, long-term memory is not, they will likely remember everything you say and do with them, and might take deceit personally for a long time. Set boundaries, prioritize your own health and security, but try to avoid forcing them / lying to them too much, it can backfire and damage real long-term trust. You have to balance maintaining their trust with the reality that they may try to trick you / forget their own promises. If they agree to be driven to the hospital, discreetly child lock the doors to stop them getting out on the highway if they change their mind. If they agree to try to sleep in their room, make sure they cant climb out a balcony window, etc. they can't be fully trusted to not endanger their own life in this state. Good luck and thank you for caring enough to help them. Video or write about parts of the experience (privately) and share it with them afterwards, they may appreciate seeing an objective record of what their mania looks like to others, to calibrate against what it feels like internally. If another episode happens in the future, pulling up those notes/videos can help convince them to get help sooner as it can help remind that it's an \"episode\" that can't last forever. Diclaimer: I am not a trained professional in this area / this is not medical advice, it's just based on my own experiences / YMMV Also when in doubt, call 988 (if in the USA).

Like say you have been depressed for X weeks/months and have been mulling over philosophy/turning ideas in your head. At some point ideas click and you realize something \"obvious\" that changes your perspective and you no longer feel as empty as you were before – is that mania indicative of the mind finally \"breaking down\", or a genuine breakthrough? And for that matter how does the feeling \"everything is really important and meaningful\" differ from the supposed state of \"enlightenment\"? What are some tests you can perform on yourself to assess the difference (between mania/healthy appreciation)?

Any duration longer than that using pharmaceuticals to treat mental health is likely to cause brain damage. Non-pharmaceutical ways are, drinking spring water, eating heavy root vegetables and foods, like potatos, cheese, carrots, grains and also spending time walking and sitting in nature. If someone has experience with mediation, then having the meditative intention to surrender to whatever one considers to be the highest power e.g. God, Allah, Buddha, Universe, Nature, Void is also extremely effective. Source: My own experiences. reply theaussiestew 15 hours agoprevA perspective different to others in this thread. As someone who has been in your roommate's position before. Unless he was physically violent to you, you calling the mental health team (and therefore the police) on him escalated this situation. Obviously he would be angry with you, because you essentially had him arrested. His reactivity to this in of itself is not a sign of mental illness. If you put yourself in his shoes, you would be angry or annoyed too. Additionally, you could have been more descriptive about his behavior. That he believes reality is an illusion is not necessarily a sign of mental illness. For all we know he could have had a glimpse of satori (ironic given your username). That statement about reality is described in countless spiritual and religious texts by people far wiser and more intelligent than either of us. However, him talking to himself and not sleeping could be a sign of mental illness. Not sleeping itself could even be the cause, and not the effect of mental illness. As in, maybe he stopped sleeping well on the first day, and then the second, and so on, causing this weeklong incident, and sleeping normally would bring everything back to normal. We don't know if this was the case. If I were you, as a friend, I would apologize for causing him to be arrested and thrown in hospital (even if you don't believe you're at fault or have done anything wrong) and at least let him stay in the house you shared for a couple of months before making any drastic moves like kicking him out. Treat him normally, as you did before this incident. Don't treat him with kid gloves or as a crazy person. This incident could very well be a one off...or it could be the start of long term mental health issues, which can be resolved but would require some more understanding from you. From there on, make a decision about whether you want to continue living with him given what has transpired. You have to be careful about not blowing this one week, or even a couple of days out of proportion and ruining his life and career. Treat it just as an anomaly, don't share what happened with anyone unless you have permission from him. I'm speaking as someone who's gone through what your roommate has gone through and recovered. A lot of armchair mental health professionals in this thread are providing extremely poor advice here; advice that's only likely to exacerbate what's happened. For example: - Kicking him out of the house Refusing to have him back in the house is basically the same as indefinitely extending his stay at the hospital - possibly one of the worst things you can do from my perspective. Unless he's actively physically violent, which it doesn't sound like he is - why on earth would you refuse to have him back for at least several weeks? - Breaking off ties with him Ridiculous, treat him as the friend he has always been to you. There's no need to worry about your safety unless he is actively physically violent to you. If he starts talking about reality, why not humor him out try and understand exactly what he's saying or looking it up? - Telling his workplace about what happened You mentioned you phoned his workplace regarding his absence. I hope you kept the details general and didn't tell them about him being hospitalized. That's a decision for him to make later when he is feeling better. You sound like a good guy. The best thing you can do for him is to keep a level head yourself and be a good friend while maintaining some kind of detachment and distance. The most likely outcome statistically is him recovering - it will just take some time. Just my two cents. reply satori99 15 hours agoparentI am very hesitant to add specific details as it involves other real people he was accusing of manipulating him, which I know to be false. By Sunday night my friend was having what appeared to be actual conversations with voices in his head. And they became totally non-sensical to me. It was scary. I initially told his work only that he wouldn't be in for a week. I did not discuss specific details with them, but they already sort of knew because his behaviour at work was raising eyebrows late last week. reply theaussiestew 14 hours agorootparentFair enough, it does sound like he's having some pretty severe mental health problems from those additional details. I care for your friend, if you can relay some of this advice to him when he's feeling better, it would be beneficial. To echo other people in this thread, you're not responsible for him, but if you have the emotional bandwidth to help out where you can, you can make a difference in his recovery outcomes. It sounds like a lot of pressure, but the more relaxed and detached you are the better it'll be for both of you. I generally think you were completely right to call the mental health team, but he understandably might still be angry. I care for your friend, and here are some concrete steps that worked for me, in order of effectiveness. 1. Taking time off work, or even leaving if that's possible Sounds like workplace tensions caused or exacerbated what he's going through. It's likely his mistrust has spiralled into some kind of paranoia. It's also possible that workplace stress is exhausting and destabilising him. It's best for him to simply take extended leave, or leave the workplace entirely. 2. Avoiding psychiatric labels in favour of therapeutic/psychological labels Understanding that paranoia develops from suspicion, and suspicion grows from fear, and fear grows from mistrust. To elaborate, it sounds like he's having some kind of conflict where he thinks other people are doing x or y to him, but that's likely just mistrust spiralling out of control. One attitude is to label this paranoia, and as a psychiatric symptom of psychosis/schizoaffective disorders, another attitude is to label it as an extreme version of mistrust. Both are true, but one is more conducive to healing. Basically, if I were your friend, I would avoid internalising any labels he would be taking on during this period, because that can actually reinforce negative outcomes. 3. Eating pure, unprocessed, and heavy foods. A lot of mania like symptoms are just the result of emotional or mental exhaustion. That causes us to get light headed and start overthinking, and then have an emotional reaction of fear, which causes more overthinking and so on, which can spiral out of control. A simple solution that doesn't involve pharmaceuticals is drinking lots of fresh, spring water, eating tuber and root vegetables like potatos and carrots, and also fatty and greasy foods like cheeses and butter. Basically, natural and whole foods which weigh you down, not things like McDonalds or potato crisps. Drugs are likely going to be necessary for at least a couple of weeks and maybe several months, but longer than this, in my opinion is likely detrimental to the brain's physiology. Your friend sounds quite intelligent, let's keep it that way. 4. Sleeping more Like I said in my previous response, lack of sleep can cause and exacerbate mental health problems. Sleeping drugs or aids like melatonin may be necessary at this stage, but if not, then natural remedies like camomille tea, a relaxing bath and music would help. 5. Working with a psychologist/therapist, rather than a psychiatrist This perspective may be polarising, but I believe that psychiatrists are not equipped to help heal severe mental health issues. At best, they are a temporary support that prescribes medication (which is necessary initially for weeks and months). To end up on medication for years and decades, and stuck with a psychiatrist who keeps on prescribing them is a one way road to being a zombie. Instead, in my opinion, working regularly with a psychologist and/or licensed therapist is the best way to recover from so called severe mental health illnesses like bipolar/schizoid disorders. If your friend has the financial means, additionally working with a neurologist once he's more stable (maybe 1 or 2 months from now), would be even better. The neurologist can rule out things like actual physical brain conditions like high cranial pressure, brain tumours and other physiological causes of mental health problems. 6. Spending time in nature during the day, either alone or with a trusted friend Just sitting or walking around in a park can have extremely outsized benefits for mental health. That means going to as secluded and natural of a place as is practical. If there are no people in the place, that's even better. I experienced it myself, when I walked in a park every day and recovered extremely quickly. 7. Having the intention to surrender to a higher, benevolent power Your friend is communicating with voices in his head, which is a a big warning sign, from a spiritual, psychiatric and psychology perspective. It could be anything from different parts of his psyche communicating to try and come to a resolution, or it could even be what are called \"jinns\" or negative spirits in religions like Islam. While many may roll their eyes at the mention of spirits, especially in a more secularly oriented community like Hacker News, this is a possibility. The solution, regardless of what is happening, and regardless of what you (or I) believe is happening, is surrendering to a higher power. It could be surrendering to God, Allah, Buddha, Earth, Universe or the Void. It doesn't matter whether he's atheist, agnostic, religious or spiritual, simply having the internal intention to surrender to a higher power will deliver very rapid healing and peace. If the intention to surrender is genuine (not laced with doubt or skepticism) and comes from a deep place, it will cause an instant effect of peace and relaxation. You can even try this yourself right now to verify it. It definitely did for me. In fact, this last point was the most effective, over everything else I mentioned. If your friend wants to talk to someone when he's feeling better I'm always available. reply throw8qoh 19 minutes agorootparentTo give my perspective from having experienced this side as well (did not use the more powerful medications and recovered from the worst part in a bit over two weeks from the time it got distinctly worse with a small residual effect for maybe a couple weeks after that): I agree with this list but would phrase some of them a bit different. I'll start mentioning that my understanding is that there seem to be a few different types of outwardly similar issues with major differences along with variation within a type and different severity. I was never at danger of suicide and never started a note, though I did vividly imagine suicide at one point. The worst part for me was panic attacks that lasted hours on a few days (suicidal inclination at that time could be deadly as it felt like the end was near in any case, although for me that was not when I imagined suicide). I never use recreational drugs including alcohol (unless you count sugar, which likely you should). I did not hear voices or see people who weren't there but did have a visual oddity during most of the worst times (which clued me in that something was seriously wrong; I wasn't able to make as much use of that insight as I would have hoped but the worst parts happened later when it was much less visible). I call it brain overheating but it was not just the brain; the rest of my body was overheating as well. I suspect blood brain barrier issues and blood sugar issues during this worse time (but not other times). Adding some oil to my diet seemed like it might have been quite helpful (although jumping to conclusions was a big part of the issue). My memory was both better and worse than usual in some ways; I could pull a bunch of memories to support a theory (at times definitely invented some but mostly real memories I think) while contradictory memories were much harder to recall and dismissed way too easily or worked around in elaborate ways. I started with a theory that felt true (related in some ways to things I worry about but also random) and my brain worked to figure out why it must be true and to fill in details rather than questioning it. I would eventually figure out that the theory was false but then jump to the next one, particularly during the worst couple of days. I don't think someone else engaging much with details of such thoughts is likely to be helpful but gently honest feedback about your overall impression if you do listen can help point the way to reality (I do think there are aspects of reality in the overheated thinking as well but they are covered by the false connections). Writing down what I was thinking was helpful and made it easier to spot the issues later (just don't let anyone else read it). I had strong \"universal love\" feelings, religious feelings, and paranoia at different times (and maybe combined in some ways). I would not phrase #7 on this list that way and wasn't similarly magic to me but I do think it helped that when I thought cops were coming for me I was basically OK with that and tried to be ready in a way that would limit the chance of being shot (then eventually the fact that they didn't show up brought me back to reality some). I don't think joining a religion in that state is a good idea and it is a helpful show of love when those who are religious don't try to take advantage of the religious feelings to try to push their religion (clearly not the intent here, I agree with accepting whatever happens being helpful). Getting outside when I was improving is what finally resolved the worst times for me but earlier made it worse (because it worked its way into a theory). To get to that point focusing on a simplified daily routine (and finding some things to do that helped some or at least didn't make things worse) was most helpful for me. In terms of sleep low dose delayed release melatonin seemed quite helpful to me as well. I would add that it is not just lack of sleep that causes trouble but circadian rhythm as well. Symptoms were distinctly worse for me at night and brighter mornings seemed to help more than cloudy mornings. Isolation was helpful for me as nearly every interaction I had with others was embarrassing and made things worse. I also accused one person I care about of doing something malicious and feel bad about that. At the same time feeling love from a few people (including the person I accused, who I apologized to fairly quickly) was also helpful. I misinterpreted coincidences as being malicious so I would say isolation is good but avoid permanent decisions until fully recovered if possible since decision making is impaired. reply tcj_phx 16 hours agoprevWhen people's brains run low on energy (ATP) they start to exhibit 'mental health' symptoms - depression, psychosis, etc. Sometimes a person just needs a better diet and they'll snap out of their spiral.

For the benefit of those of us who haven’t learned as much about that school of thought, how would Islamic teaching suggest the OP deal with their friend’s possible-psychosis situation that they described? reply soulofmischief 16 hours agoparentprev [–] No. Absolutely, positively, no. Are you serious? We're discussing a man having a psychotic break, possibly developing schizophrenia or at least intense mania, and you want to introduce him to a religion? All Judeo-Christian religions are death cults, and prey upon the weak and confused. It is incredibly disgusting that you would suggest this. reply sincerecook 14 hours agorootparent [–] Materialism is the real death cult. A living, waking, walking death. reply soulofmischief 11 hours agorootparent [–] I agree that materialism is bad news. But there's not one \"real death cult\", there are many, and so this comment seems out of place. It seems extra out of place when paired with some of your other comments. For example, if you abhor materialism, then you should also abhor the extremely materialistic death cult behind Trump. Both parties are run by neoliberals who engage in foreign and domestic anti-Democratic violence in order to increase corporate profits. Neither party truly cares about your free speech, even though they both pretend to. I would recommend reevaluating your support of conservatism, Trump politics especially. It doesn't mean you have to support the Democrats instead. Vote third-party. Let your hatred of materialism be your guiding light and don't fall for the extreme rhetoric falling out of this charlatan's mouth. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
