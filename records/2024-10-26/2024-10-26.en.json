    "originBody": "Activism Victory Is Sweet: We Can Now Fix McDonald’s Ice Cream Machines Article by: Elizabeth Chamberlain @liz_ifixit October 25, 2024 Filed under: Activism, Consumer Rights, Legislation, Right to Repair One Comment Share Ever tried to get an ice cream at McDonald’s, only to hear, “Sorry, our machine’s broken?” You’re not the only one: almost 15% of ice cream machines at McDonald’s are broken right now around the US—and in New York, it’s 32%. But today, we won more ice cream, and things should start to change. The U.S. Copyright Office just handed down a ruling that marks an important victory for Right to Repair: we can now legally repair commercial food preparation equipment, including McDonald’s machines, without running afoul of copyright law. We’ve been fighting for years to challenge the digital locks that manufacturers like Taylor (which makes McDonald’s ice cream machines) use to keep repair information out of reach, forcing expensive service calls for simple fixes. Digital locks blocking repair come from an archaic 1998 copyright law, and every three years, we get a chance to ask the Copyright Office to give us exemptions to that law. Last time, we won exemptions for basically all consumer equipment, vehicles, and medical devices. The time before that, we won smartphones and home appliances. This time, the FTC and DOJ even weighed in to support our petition. But while this is a significant step forward, the battle is far from over. Any McDonald’s franchisee can hack your own machine, but if you want to share what you found with your friends or sell a tool to help diagnose and fix your machine, you’re out of luck. Plus, the ruling didn’t go nearly far enough in granting broader exemptions for repairing other commercial or industrial equipment. Trust us, we’re not stopping there. This is a big win—and we’ll be celebrating with ice cream!—but copyright law still needs fixing before we’re free to fix everything we own. The Win: You’re Now Free to Hack Your Ice Cream Machine For years, McDonald’s franchise owners have struggled with error codes and malfunctioning ice cream machines that could only be fixed by manufacturer-authorized technicians. The machines would often sit broken for extended periods because owners couldn’t troubleshoot or repair them on their own, due to digital locks embedded in the machine’s software. These locks are protected under Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which generally makes it illegal to bypass software locks known as “technological protection measures,” even for legitimate repairs. That changes today. Thanks to the new exemption granted by the Copyright Office, owners, repair technicians, and tinkerers can now legally bypass the software locks on retail-level commercial food preparation equipment, such as the Taylor ice cream machines. This allows for the diagnosis, maintenance, and repair of the machines without needing to rely on costly service calls or manufacturer intervention. The exemption also applies to other commercial kitchen equipment—we’ve heard about undocumented error codes in commercial espresso machines, restaurant owners getting locked out of their own commercial ovens, and missing service manuals for insulated cabinets. But we’re especially excited about the ice cream win. For ice cream lovers everywhere, this could mean fewer “machine broken” signs at McDonald’s and more sundaes and McFlurries available when you want them. It’s tangible progress in the fight to regain control over the products we own. Repair’s pretty difficult without tools. The Problem: We Still Don’t Have Repair Tools Here’s the catch: while it’s now legal to circumvent the digital locks on these machines, the ruling does not allow us to share or distribute the tools necessary to do so. This is a major limitation. Most franchise owners and independent repair shops won’t have the technical expertise to create their own unlocking tools from scratch, meaning that while the door to repair has been opened, few will be able to walk through it without significant difficulty. It is still a crime for iFixit to sell a tool to fix ice cream machines, and that’s a real shame. The ruling doesn’t change the underlying statute making it illegal to share or sell tools that bypass software locks. This leaves most of the repair work inaccessible to the average person, since the technical barriers remain high. Without these tools, this exemption is largely theoretical for many small businesses that don’t have in-house repair experts. The Miss: Broader Exemptions for Commercial and Industrial Equipment Even more disappointing is the denial of broader exemptions for commercial and industrial equipment. While we succeeded in securing an exemption for retail-level food equipment, the Copyright Office declined to extend similar protections to a wider class of commercial devices—meaning the ruling does not apply to things like heavy machinery, factory equipment, or even broader categories of restaurant hardware. This was a key part of our petition, as the same issues plague repair in other industries. Many businesses, from farmers to factory owners, face the same frustrations: they are locked out of their own equipment by digital restrictions that prevent them from making repairs without calling in a certified technician. We pointed to examples like the Polish trains that were locked “for arbitrary reasons after being serviced at third-party workshops” with “bogus error codes,” multi-million dollar factory machines getting bricked for a lack of software access, and a school that lost access to its HVAC system when the maintenance technician passed away. We asked for an exemption that would cover all software-enabled commercial and industrial devices, but the Copyright Office denied this broader request, citing a lack of sufficient evidence that digital locks were creating adverse effects across a wider range of equipment. Without this broader exemption, a significant portion of the repair market is still controlled by manufacturers, who can charge exorbitant prices for repair services and restrict access to parts and tools. This leaves many small businesses with no choice but to endure downtime and extra costs, even when a simple repair could get them back up and running quickly. Renewals: What We Won, What We Didn’t Every three years, the Copyright Office reviews the current exemptions and decides which ones to renew, expand, or let expire. This year, we secured several important renewals, though some gaps remain. Device Page Defibrillator Repair information for defibrillators. View Device What We Won: Medical Devices: Renewals were granted for medical devices, allowing technicians to access software controlling devices like defibrillators and insulin pumps. This helps ensure that life-saving equipment can be repaired quickly and efficiently, which is crucial for patient care. This renewal is essential for hospitals repairing their own equipment, and came despite heated opposition from AdvaMed. The medical device manufacturers are so upset about all of this that they are suing the Copyright Office over the last rulemaking that originally granted this exemption three years ago. Repair of Motorized Vehicles, Marine Vessels, and Agricultural Equipment: Exemptions allowing the repair of computer programs in motorized land vehicles, marine vessels, and mechanized agricultural equipment were renewed. This means farmers can continue to repair their tractors, and boat owners can fix their vessels without worrying about digital locks. Consumer Devices: We also successfully renewed the exemption that allows repairs on consumer electronic devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and home appliances. This is a critical exemption for everyday consumers who want the right to repair their own gadgets without voiding warranties or violating copyright law. Assistive Technologies: The exemptions for assistive technologies were renewed as well, ensuring that people with disabilities can access and use literary and musical works through assistive software without running afoul of copyright restrictions. Video game alternative input methods like eye tracking sometimes require getting around technological protection measures—and the Copyright Office declined to renew that exemption. What We Didn’t Win: Video Game Accessibility: Unfortunately, the exemption allowing circumvention of digital locks on video games for accessibility purposes (introduced in 2021) was not renewed. No petition for renewal was submitted, and as a result, individuals with disabilities who need alternative input methods to play video games are left out. Broader Exemptions for Industrial Devices: As mentioned earlier, we failed to secure a broader exemption for industrial and commercial equipment. This leaves a huge number of businesses still locked out of the right to repair their own machinery. Why Does This Matter? The Copyright Office’s ruling is a step in the right direction, but it’s far from the finish line. We’re thrilled to be able to fix ice cream machines, but without tools, most franchise owners won’t be able to take full advantage of this new freedom. And while retail food equipment is now covered, the vast world of commercial and industrial devices remains stuck in a repair monopoly, where manufacturers control who can fix what and at what cost. This ruling highlights the ongoing battle between consumers and manufacturers over the right to repair. We’ve made significant strides, but we’re still facing systemic barriers that prevent small businesses and consumers from taking control of their own products. What’s Next? We’ll take today’s victory and keep fighting for more. Next on our list? Fixing federal copyright law, which is the only way we can secure access to the tools we need and share what we find as we troubleshoot our machines. iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens testified before congress last year about why this is so important, and we’re hoping to see US federal legislation like last session’s Freedom to Repair Act. Meanwhile, Canada is in the final stages of considering legislation that would fix the Canadian version of the DMCA, a bill called C-244 that is in its third reading in the Senate and expected to move before the end of the month. If Canada legalized circumventing technological protection measures for the purposes of repair, we might just have to head north to find the tools we need to do repairs. So go enjoy that McFlurry—just know that the fight to fix isn’t over yet.

    "commentBody": "We can now fix McDonald's ice cream machines (ifixit.com)982 points by LorenDB 22 hours agohidepastfavorite258 comments ThinkBeat 6 hours agoThe biggest reason I have read for why machines do not work, or are not being used is due to lack of maintenance, and employees who are trained to do so. (and people quit all the time). Having worked at a fast food join (not McDonalds) much earlier in my life, any lacking maintenance and proper cleaning, especially if there has been a power outage will turn the the machine into a rapid incubator for bacteria that will make you ill. Since shifts change and not everyone keeps on the machine, a power outrage can quickly be lost to the workers. Getting angry if an employee tells you the machine is broken and demanding ice-cream is an exceedingly bad idea. Take that as a blessing. The employee may have saved you from running to the bathroom a lot. I personally stay away from softicecream entirely. But if you must, try to find a place where a lot of people are buying so the machine is in frequent use. That doesn't mean its safe but it makes it a lot more likely. Of course not being used frequently is not an automatic reason for the machine to be in incubator mode, it may will be well cared for, well cleaned, great maintenance. reply Bjartr 4 hours agoparentPart of the issue as I understand it, is that the machine is fairly opaque as to why some failures occur can appear somewhat \"flaky\" as a result. When this occurs during a cleaning cycle, the whole cycle is void and a new 4 hour cycle must be run. If the machine was clear about communicating the issue, it would be fine. It's not and can require a technician to come out with a tool to both read the machine status in detail and tweak the machine in the necessary ways to stop it being flaky. This would all be fine except for the fact that 1. Only technicians from the manufacturer are allowed to be used. 2. Those technicians are unreasonable expensive. 3. The company could make the machines easier to diagnose and repair, but don't because repair calls are lucrative 4. Third parties can, and have, made tools that do make the machines easier to diagnose and repair without the need for a technician, but cant legally sell these solutions because it involves circumventing a digital lock (DMCA violation) 5. McD corporate has an agreement with the manufacturer to maintain this status quo in return for a kickback reply oorza 3 hours agorootparentI worked at a McD's franchise 20 years ago that had hired a \"retired\" ice cream machine guy to work for the franchise full time. With only a half dozen stores, he would still almost always be too busy to make it to our store the same day and sometimes we'd have to wait as long as 3-4 days. Flaky does not even begin to describe how awful those machines are. I'm not sure if having that guy employed by the franchise was technically kosher or not with McDonald's, but you have to imagine the smart franchises all do this. reply LtWorf 54 minutes agorootparentprevMcDonald is big enough to change suppliers of machines and impose easy maintenance. reply trollbridge 5 hours agoparentprevExcept Dairy Queen, Wendy’s, and McDonald’s outside of the U.S. don’t have this problem. Somehow I doubt DQ employees are paid better or are better trained or more diligent about regular maintenance. The difference is they don’t have a machine designed to require expensive maintenance visits with a DRM lockout to retard attempts to maintain it by normal restaurant/HVAC maintenance contractors. reply wjnc 4 hours agorootparentMy stint as a EU McD worker did give me a feel of how well scripted low skill labour can feel like pleasant work. I didn’t appreciate it at the time but it was six sigma checklist everything. There is a magic to smooth operation. In all my other jobs (dishwasher, mechanic, cleaner and now 20 yrs in insurance) nobody came close to the McD smoothness of operations. I hope I bring some of this smoothness to the people working in my lines of operation. I’m going to ask them! reply oorza 3 hours agorootparentI had the same experience working at one in US from ages 15-19. The thing that stands out about that job that makes it unique in my perspective is decision-making. Every other job, from dishwasher in a sit down restaurant to engineering team lead, works best when I make good decisions and my coworkers all do too. Everything runs most smoothly when everyone is on their game and consistently making the right choices. At McDonald's, everything ran most smoothly when no one made any decisions at all. Their system was literally that good. No one else's has ever come close. And you're right that there's a weird freedom and pleasantness to that: your job requires literally zero brain power most of the time and your sole responsibility is to keep up with the person behind you and not overwhelm the person in front of you, which isn't usually something you worry about. So all that energy every other job has got from me, I still had (and so did everyone else) which made it the most social, most fun workplace too. reply float4 4 hours agorootparentprev> Except Dairy Queen, Wendy’s, and McDonald’s outside of the U.S. don’t have this problem. Heck, even Ikea has successfully been selling ice cream (from self serve machines!) here in the Netherlands for like 20 years now. €0.50 back in the day, €1 now. Can't remember the last time all machines (yes, they do have at least 2 usually) required maintenance. reply jt2190 2 hours agoparentprev> any lacking maintenance and proper cleaning, especially if there has been a power outage will turn the the machine into a rapid incubator for bacteria that will make you ill. Yes, the correct frame of reference here is “how can we scale ice cream delivery to millions a day while keeping everyone healthy?” At this scale a single failure can make a lot of people very sick in a very short amount of time. Under these conditions maintenance needs to be extremely rigorous and performed by qualified people. “Right to repair” says that equipment owners can’t be stopped from performing repairs if they want to. They’ll still be on the hook for demonstrating that they were qualified to make the repairs, so I predict this will do little to improved McDonalds ice cream availability: They’ll still need to wait for the qualified technician. reply fHr 4 hours agoparentprevpeople who get angry at the underpaid employees are the worst, treat them like human beings please reply timcobb 3 hours agorootparentSome people have internalized that underpaid employees get what they deserve (i.e. they're not actually underpaid at all) and I believe that's one of the factors that leads to the abuse. reply h1fra 4 hours agoparentprevYeah no, McDonalds in Europe don't have this problem at all.

Critically, what the government is doing here is reducing its own authority with regard to information, the internet, and ultimately at some level, thought. Sharing methods for basic home and business improvements, including repairs of machinery, is one of the most fundamental functions of society. It's rare (but of course not unheard of by any stretch) that the governments of the largest nation states do anything _proactive_ that is helpful to society, but in many cases when they choose to reduce their own capabilities (even for the wrong reasons), it seems more forward-looking. reply fsckboy 8 hours agorootparentjust as an aside, in political science/international relations, a \"state\" is what you are calling a nation state. A \"nation\" is like canadian first nations or the cherokee nation or the german nation before there was a german state (not very long ago), i.e. it's an ethnicity/language.

Who cares if the McDonald's ice cream machine is broken? It's shit ice cream. Most of you probably live near a better local ice cream/soft serve/custard joint. Heck, most of you probably live near a better corporate chain ice cream joint that probably also serves better food than McDonald's: Dairy Queen, In-N-Out, Shake Shack, Culver's, etc. If McDonald's didn't have breakfast or coffee the whole chain might be out of business or at tiny fraction of its current size by now. The McDonald's ice cream machine monopoly only negatively affects millionaire McDonald's franchise owners who deserve to be abused by the franchise for being so un-innovative that they resort to purchasing/renting access to a successful business model. Talk about the most opposite-of-meritocracy business venture imaginable! Imagine if you had a half a million dollars in freely available non-borrowed assets and you couldn't think of your own business model to try.

It's a way of taking more money from franchise owners. reply Reason077 1 hour agorootparentThat’s not correct. Taylor Company, who supply the notorious C602 ice cream machine to more than 13,000 McDonalds franchises, is owned by Middleby Corporation of Elgin, Illinois since 2018. Previously it was part of United Technologies’ climate & controls (Carrier) unit. [1] Not all McDonalds use the Taylor machines. Some use machines from other manufacturers such as Carpigiani [2] [1] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Company [2] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpigiani reply mattmaroon 1 hour agorootparentprevThey do not, this is disinformation. The machines are manufactured by Taylor for McDonald’s and maintained by Taylor’s service network. Taylor’s the largest manufacturer of commercial ice cream making equipment in the US. Franchisees also have the option of using Carpigiani machines, but they’re Italian so parts and service are not as easy to come by. And all ice cream machines are known for being easy to break, especially if used by poorly trained teenagers. This also makes no sense, if McDonald’s wanted to make more off the franchisees from ice cream, surely they’d rather do it by having the machines work (so they can sell product). They sell the mix that goes in the machine to the franchisees. It would be idiotic to try to gouge them by making the machine crappy rather than just charging them more for the mix and using a good machine. Then they wouldn’t need to employ these imaginary service techs and the franchisees would be happier with the situation. reply CamperBob2 3 minutes agorootparentThen why is the situation what it is? As numerous people have pointed out, other fast-food chains don't have this problem. They are able to provide ice-cream products that are consistently free of either toxins or excuses. Occam's Razor suggests that the most likely explanation is that the McDonald's Corporation is deliberately setting their franchisees up to fail by continuing to sign contracts with Taylor.

That's kind of staple of burger joints. reply wokwokwok 18 hours agorootparentYeah, but the point is that MacDonalds obviously doesn’t want to sell icecream. Maybe it’s low margin. Maybe cleaning is expensive. Maybe it helps having the promise of cheap ice cream but “sorry not right now” leading customers to buy other (more expensive) items. It’s not an incompetent organisation. If they wanted the machines to work, they would work. They don’t. So… if anything changes out of this, it will be to keep the status quo; people coming in and not buying cheap ice creams. reply bastawhiz 16 hours agorootparentMcDonald's also has no problem phasing out items from its menu. It does so with regularity. Why keep something on the menu that it doesn't want to sell? It either wants to sell it or it doesn't want to sell it. reply dangus 13 hours agorootparentIce Cream products would be one of the last things they phase out. First, the ice cream machine produces multiple products: milkshakes, McFlurries, hot fudge sundaes, and ice cream cones. Second, dessert is an upsell and driver of APV. If you lack dessert options you basically leave money on the table from customers who are willing to buy dessert. Third, the ice cream machine, despite its problems, is a pretty small and manageable piece of equipment. It doesn't need an employee to babysit it like a fryer or flat top. The only thing simpler at a McDonald's is the Apple Pie heater. If you don't believe me, find a burger chain that doesn't have ice cream on the menu. Wendy's, Burger King, Shake Shack, Steak 'N Shake, In-N-Out, Whataburger, Culver's, Carl's Jr/Hardee's, seriously, which restaurant that serves burgers doesn't have ice cream/milkshakes? reply dangus 13 hours agorootparentprevWhile I agree that the ice cream/milkshakes has been problematic for McDonald's from an operational standpoint, I think your business analysis is pretty terrible. If anything, ice cream products represent a very profitable item that often serves as an upsell helping drive the APV (average purchase value) higher. Milkshakes in particular have a unique \"job to be done\" in the drive-thru fast food industry: https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/clay-christensens-milkshake-marke... They can be eaten easily in the car, can be savored slowly over time on a long commute, and are relatively filling and inexpensive. There are a lot of people who actually consume them earlier in the day before work because of those characteristics. You'll notice that basically every burger chain offers milkshakes, and some even emphasize the shakes more than the food, like Shake Shack, Dairy Queen (which has quite good fast food burgers and food if you aren't aware), and Steak 'n Shake. They all do this because it's an extremely profitable product and a driver of high APV. The ice cream machines at McDonald's also deliver multiple products: McFlurry, hot fudge sundae, milkshakes, and ice cream cones. One small machine that dispenses vanilla soft serve can make a whole bunch of products. reply wokwokwok 12 hours agorootparentWhile some of that might be true, explain to me why an organisation like macdonalds would allow up to 30% of such machinery to be out of working order for years and years in high value areas. Your analysis posits what, that they’re just blatantly incompetent? I don’t believe that. If the economics of a working ice cream machine were that good, it would be a solved problem. You don’t run an organisation like MacDonalds with a basic inability to maintain infrastructure. Imagine if that was true of fryers? Or microwaves? That almost never happens. It’s clearly not a technical problem. The only way that you could justify the continued maintenance failure you see is if the benefits of a working machine were negligible at best. Perhaps what you say might be true in general but in this specific circumstance I think you’re applying an “in general…” kind of logic (like “in general more unit tests are better…”) which doesn’t ring true here, to me. reply samatman 15 hours agorootparentprevThe original McDonald's menu had nine items.

Basically the owner operators are forced to use a particular brand by corporate. Corporate McDonalds has a deal with a particular ice cream machine company. That particular company is the only company owner operators are allowed to buy from, and the only company allowed to service the machines. And it's no skin off of McDonald's back for these machines to always be broken, the cost falls on the owner-operators. reply jessriedel 21 hours agoparentI don't understand the last sentence. If the machines are frequently broken, that damages the Macdonald's brand in the consumer's eyes.

I would imagine the ice cream machines are a relatively small part of the McDonald's business. As evidenced by the fact that McDonalds ice cream has been an issue for quite a while. I would imagine franchises of a similar caliber to McD's also exploit their owner-operators on a similar scale because they can, we just don't necessarily hear about it because McDonalds is the largest. McDonald's isn't known for its quality anyway. I've had my fair share of sketchy McDonalds experiences. McDs is as large as it is because it is cheap, convenient, and ubiquitous.

The problem is that the technician service fees are a fixed cost designed to be revenue maximizing for the average restaurant. Franchises selling enough ice cream to pay the fixed costs stay in the game, the ones who don't simply keep them out of order. This is effectively a price discrimination strategy. By making the machine mandatory, they can offer the menu item in every restaurant, but they only have to collect money in proportion of ice cream revenue. reply wvenable 21 hours agorootparentprevModern capitalism isn't particularly rational. Money in the pocket is more tangible than minor brand damage.

So many businesses operate this way now. reply dangus 13 hours agorootparentprevI think the machines are broken way less often than people give McDonald's negativity over. In my estimation that's probably why corporate hasn't cared to fix the problem until recently. Sure, a lot of people notice when they're broken, but a lot of people notice when AWS is down for an hour ~one time a year, too. On top of that, depending where you are if your local McDonald's has a broken ice cream machine you probably aren't all that far away from another one.

And McD wants the machines maintained by the official technician, because they'd rather screw their franchisees a bit than risk someone ripping out the offending sensor. IMO, the perverse incentives come on top of this (Taylor has no motivation to make the machines more transparent since they profit from the call-outs, McD either doesn't care or may even prefer this since it could reduce the risk of \"creative\" solutions like an employee holding an ice cube next to a sensor), but the \"McD would rather have 50% of the ice cream machines 'broken' than have a single one serve E.Coli to its customers\" is what kicked this whole thing off. reply trollbridge 5 hours agorootparentYet Wendy’s and Dairy Queen don’t have the exact same incentives? reply risho 20 hours agorootparentprevthen why is it that its only the ice cream machines that have problems not not things like the soda fountain any other food production tool? reply cyberax 17 hours agorootparentIn general, acidic or basic foods are very safe from bacterial contamination standpoint. Soda is very acidic (due to all that dissolved carbon dioxide). It's not that it doesn't get bacteria (they live everywhere), but it's unlikely to get pathogenic bacteria.

You need to wait for the machine to allow the remaining frosty mix to melt, dump the remainder into a metal bucket (to use for tomorrow). Then you have to flush water through the machine to be able to disassemble it, then the machine needs to be loaded with a sanitizing solution (along with all the parts which are placed in the hopper). Finally you gotta re-do all of this the following morning! Sure its not like taking apart an iPhone but its not a 5 second job either. The worst part?

Such an entitlement, however, would go far beyond the idea that the DMCA allows copyright owner to prohibit “fair uses . . . as well as foul.” Reimerdes, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 304. Chamberlain’s proposed construction would allow copyright owners to prohibit exclusively fair uses even in the absence of any feared foul use. It would therefore allow any copyright owner, through a combination of contractual terms and technological measures, to repeal the fair use doctrine with respect to an individual copyrighted work—or even selected copies of that copyrighted work. Again, this implication contradicts § 1201(c)(1) directly. Copyright law itself authorizes the public to make certain uses of copyrighted materials.

A lot of people like to treat this as a conspiracy, but I think it's much more likely it's the corporate people being paranoid about local franchisees overriding the machines, and that leading to listeria outbreaks happening in the only non-sealed food item that isn't heated to safe temperatures shortly before it's handed off to customers.

The DMCA causes many weird problems. reply twothreeone 20 hours agoparentIt's still weird to me that we ended up in a world in which every bit of information can now be copied at zero cost and instead of heralding and building upon that technological achievement we've somehow decided that instead we're going to make laws to protect and enforce rent seeking instead. I assume it's one of those things where a few corpos just outplayed 99% of the population; just like universal health care, or public education. reply hn_throwaway_99 19 hours agorootparentThis seems like a very one-sided take. Just look at all the artists (actors, painters, musicians, etc.) that are fighting tooth and nail against AI, and for good reason. While there are plenty of issues with copyright, I don't agree at all that just because the marginal cost of copying is 0 that if someone puts a ton of time and effort in creating a piece of work that I should just get to copy it for free. reply twothreeone 18 hours agorootparentThat's not the argument though. The argument is that rent seeking as a business strategy is a deeply flawed and counter productive economic practice that ultimately limits our species' technological advancements and societal progress. The sooner we move past it, the better off we will all be. I agree that you should be able to create whatever you want and keep it 100%. So, clearly if someone were to steal your creation from your home and publish it online that would be theft. However, if you decided to take advantage of your creation by creating an infinite number of copies at no cost to you at all (which is what publishing through digital media means) that's your decision as a creator to make, nobody forced that on you. reply hn_throwaway_99 14 hours agorootparentI don't like your redefinition of \"rent seeking\" at all. If I create an original piece of art, and publish it digitally, preventing other people from freely copying that art is not rent seeking - the thing I created didn't exist in any form before I created it, and I'm not trying to \"extract rent\" from you by preventing you from creating any of your own works. Now, like I said previously, there are currently issues with copyright, and this can cross into rent seeking if I try to extract money from your own original works of art (see the family of Marvin Gaye), and there are issues with the length of copyright (i.e. I believe there is a fundamental difference in protecting the right of a creator while they're alive, vs. the rights of inheritors in perpetuity). But the whole concept of rent seeking is around using the power of government to extract money from others simply because you were there first, not around allowing unlimited copying of truly original works. reply visarga 13 hours agorootparentBefore we invented copying machines there was no concept of copyright. It is a recent invention, and not how human culture evolved. And it was ok up until the internet was invented, but people want to return from passive consumption to interactive. We now prefer games, social networks and search to books, radio and TV. AI is just the latest stage in this move away from passivity. Why should society not have the right for its traditional interactive way of exchanging culture? Extending the duration of copyright was a perverse move, and now blocking the right to repair is another perverse move. DMCA put all publishers at the whim of agencies spamming takedowns with impunity even for no reason at all. Artists more recently would like to copyright abstractions to block generative AI from reusing their ideas. People need their traditional ways back. We started open source, made Wikipedia, we now have open scientific publication, teachers share prep materials. Clearly there is a sign that copyright is not essential for society. Copyleft or sharing is more important. reply twothreeone 11 hours agorootparentprevSee, even the name is misleading because it's not a right - it's really a prohibition. We can agree or disagree about definitions, but I think it is self-evident that defending and enforcing a prohibition on creating zero-cost copies of digital media requires bending over backwards to undo the very properties of the technology that make it desirable to those who want to profit off of it. To me that sure sounds like rent seeking. reply dkarras 19 hours agorootparentprevI don't understand this. Copyright law does not prevent people from sharing their information freely. It gives the option for \"rent seekers\" to do their thing. Enforcing your rights for return is optional for people that don't want to do it. I'm not talking about right-to-repair here, but the idea of copyright in general. A lot of information is generated by taking some financial risk with the hopes of creating something of value and recouping that investment + some profit. Copyright makes that kind of venture possible. It doesn't prevent altruistic souls from putting in the same effort without any expectation of return. We always had this, by default. Copyright framework allows pursuit, generation and dissemination of huge swaths of valuable information that would otherwise not exist. reply staplers 20 hours agorootparentprevI assume it's one of those things where a few corpos just outplayed 99% of the population \"The key element of social control is the strategy of distraction that is to divert public attention from important issues and changes decided by political and economic elites\" -Chomsky reply kiba 20 hours agorootparentEveryone believe they need copyright, therefore it is the status quo. reply t-writescode 20 hours agorootparentIt’s a reasonable stance to want copyright.

You wanting to protect your creation and get compensated for its IP for 10-20 years (so, a good portion of your life career) is very different from Disney wanting to delay Mickey mouse going into public domain. an IP its creator and studio already reaped trillions from over the century. reply kelnos 19 hours agorootparentprevNo one should have to. If we're talking about putting/maintaining restrictions on people, the onus should be on the proponents to put forth a good argument why we need it. reply BadHumans 19 hours agorootparentNot when you are the one trying to change the status quo. Regardless of what you believe, if you want to change the default you need to explain to people why it should change. A self-righteous stance like yours will change nothing. reply twothreeone 18 hours agorootparentWell the argument is that the status quo is bad for all but a select few, so moving past it would be beneficial for basically nearly everybody. Rent seeking limits innovation, needlessly drives up costs, creates barriers where there shouldn't be any, encourages predatory economic behaviors, suppresses competition, and ultimately leads to monopolistic and or oligopolic wealth and power structures. It's universally bad practice that results in bad outcomes for society and we should move away from enabling and indeed incentivizing that kind of economic behavior. reply Teever 20 hours agorootparentprevDoes everyone believe that we need copyright to be the exact way that it is though? I'm pretty sure that the reason that copyright laws are the way they are is because certain industries in the US lobby the government to strong arm other countries into adopting onerous copyright restrictions as part of free trade agreements. Whatever you feel about the merits of intellectual property laws the idea that they're wrapped up as 'free trade' when they in fact make things that would otherwise be free cost money is downright Orwellian. Maybe countries that don't really have a film or tv industry don't want to see copyright on those products and why would they? Why would they want to see their citizens paying American countries for something that would otherwise be free? reply johnnyanmac 19 hours agorootparentI'm fine going back to the old 14+14 rules copyright originally. having your creation for an entire generation seems appropriate. But opinions are all across the spectrum on this issue. I think the primary reason the \"spirit\" of current copyright broke down is because it's been reduced to hoarding over protecting. the idea is that I can license out an idea if I really want to make use of it. So creations flow and the company makes their own cut out of it. But I can't just walk up to Disney and pay 100 dollars ,1000, maybe even 1 million to grab Mickey Mouse and work with something. Depending on their products, they may not want anyone using Mickey period, even if there is no mickey product cycle. You basically need to be EA or Mattel or Warner Bros. to even begin being considered for such a thing. That's their right but it spoils the social contract. When everything by default is locked down, there is no creation flowing. Just broken dreams for abandoned franchises everyone else would love to make use of. reply d0gsg0w00f 20 hours agorootparentprevUhh, it's because information can be easily copied that the laws were put in place. If anyone can \"steal\" your work then it would be a deterrent to invention. If I'm a business that can make money on the service contract I can sell the unit at a lower price. Now I'm forced to make the unit cost higher. reply doctorpangloss 20 hours agoparentprevDo you think people should face consequences for piracy? If not, should DRM be legal then? reply coder543 20 hours agorootparentI’m not a lawyer, but I think it’s pretty clear that piracy is not illegal because of the DMCA; it’s illegal because it violates normal copyright laws. Repealing the DMCA would not change the legal status of piracy. Repealing the DMCA also wouldn’t make DRM illegal, but DRM would still be exactly as (in)effective as it has already proven to be countless times. DRM has done nothing to restrict piracy, as far as I can tell. Repealing the DMCA would simply allow people to more freely break DRM in pursuit of lawful purposes, which are currently restricted unfairly, including activities that would fall strictly under Fair Use. I would argue the DMCA is infringing my legal rights for no benefit to society. Distributing copies of copyrighted content without authorization was unlawful long before the DMCA, outside of Fair Use scenarios. reply xbar 20 hours agorootparentprevPiracy was just as Federally illegal prior to the DMCA. Think back to Streetfighter.... reply doctorpangloss 20 hours agorootparentIt’s a simple question. I know it’s illegal. Should regular people face consequences or not?

In the case where breaking DRM isn't illegal, but piracy still is illegal, what happens that you think is bad? reply StrangeDoctor 20 hours agorootparentprev(not op) I think DMCA specifically should be repealed.

The downside was they had to be cleaned and sanitized every night and that meant you needed one more person on the closing team. It was all about saving labor costs. reply bonestamp2 17 hours agoparentAgreed, and with these new machines, they should have two of them (for several reasons). I worked there for a couple years in high school and summertime was just order after order of ice cream. The lost profit from the only machine being broken, or during it's downtime to chill the soft serve liquid after a refill, would pay back the investment in one summer, not to mention the customer service improvement. The ad campaign for resolving this problem writes itself too. It's easily worth it. Worst case scenario, put the second machine where the pizza oven used to be. reply minitoar 15 hours agorootparentIs there anything stopping a franchise from putting 2? I think it can’t be required because they have to meet some sort of smallest viable footprint. reply legacynl 7 hours agorootparentI think that the opportunity costs are just too high. Since the reliability of these machines seem very low, even having 2 machines doesn't guarantee that you're always able to serve ice cream. And if you're able to serve all your customers with one machine, in times when both are functioning, the second machine doesn't really enable more sales. But you do have to power it, have a dedicated space for it, have someone clean it daily, and pay for the maintenance contract. It's probably more beneficial to dedicate the space for an extra ice-cream machine to storage, frying station or something else that is more useful. Another point is that I don't think not being able to sell ice cream reduces sales that much. Because by the time you find out the machine is broken, you're already in the store or drive through anyway reply newsclues 8 hours agorootparentprevSpace is a premium because much of their real estate is high traffic and cost, so every square foot is used reply SoftTalker 3 hours agorootparentMost of the sales at a McDonalds are via the drive-thru. Inside sales have dropped so low that many stores don't even staff the front counter, you have to enter your own order at a kiosk in the lobby or use their mobile app. I think your conjecture was correct 20 years ago but not at store with the latest remodels. Counter sales and inside dining are an afterthought. The ice cream machines (all restaurant equipment, really) is very expensive and you generally don't buy more than you will actually use. reply newsclues 36 minutes agorootparentSpace costs money per square foot, doesn’t matter if it’s in the kitchen or dining area.

I doubt it. reply RussianCow 11 hours agorootparentOf course they do. The cost of the ingredients is on the order of cents, the marginal cost of labor negligible, and the cost of the machines can be amortized over many thousands of servings. But even if they didn't, it's a cheap way to get people to show up and potentially order other, higher margin items. If your machine is broken, you lose that funnel and your customers go elsewhere. reply bombcar 8 hours agorootparentYou don’t lose many customers - because they’re not required to light a huge “ice cream machine broke” before you get in the drive thru. And once you’re in line and ordering you’re unlikely to cancel just because the machine broke. I’ve even had the app be wrong and let you order an ice cream when it doesn’t exist - then they lose money giving you a more expensive substitute. reply lukan 8 hours agorootparentBut next time you might go somewhere else. Some people go there every day and they tell their friends - that sums up. reply cj 7 hours agorootparentThis summarizes my relationship with Chipotle. We have 1 location in my area. I go maybe once a month hoping for a decent experience, but every single time they are out of key ingredients (no chicken, no beans, no chips, etc). I really don’t understand how that can even happen at Chipotle where the entire menu consists of a grand total of (maybe) 10-15 core ingredients? I would go way more often if they simply weren’t out or ingredients 90% of the time I go. But he’s right about not canceling the order. I think last chipotle visit I subbed black beans for pinto, and tofu instead of chicken. The “sorry no chips today” was icing on the cake at checkout. reply Psyonic 4 hours agorootparentThat’s interesting.

Regional variation I guess. reply cj 4 hours agorootparentCheck out r/chipotle - maybe it’s an echo chamber there but it’s a major problem with mobile orders where you don't have an opportunity to sub an ingredient that’s out of stock. Depending on the store, chipotle mobile orders are a “fun” gamble - chipotle needs to fix quality standards across stores at least in my region!

The McD procedure involves draining the barrel, flushing it with water, then disassembling each barrel assembly and removing every o-ring and gasket. https://youtu.be/SaYTx7qNJU4?si=Y2ZjWHQJHiKQfAFh Each part is washed in detergent, rinsed, and sanitized. Rings and gaskets are relubricated with food safe petroleum jelly, then everything is reassembled. Forget one ring or misalign one gasket and the machine will shoot dairy everywhere when repressurized. Cleanup and rework after that is messy, and probably wasted a lot of other nearby product and disposables. So don't do that. After reassembly the machine is flushed with sanitizer then clear water then primed with the mix you saved from the beginning. Let's hope you stored it properly in the cooler before it started to spoil. It's expensive. If nothing has exploded it's ready for use after an hour of cooling down. To do this in 45 minutes with no catastrophic errors is pro-level. And this is why McD went to a self-sanitizing machine. reply SoftTalker 3 hours agorootparentBasically right, where I worked the parts were set in trays to air-dry overnight. There was a spot on the tray for each part, o-ring, and gasket so you could easily see if any were missing. The machines were reassembled the next morning. So the closers only had to break them down, wash, and sanitize. Once a week any dairy mix left in the machine was discarded, this \"breaks the cycle\" of any bacteria in the mix. So on that night, you tried to let the machines run very low to minimize waste. It's sort of complicated the first few times but it becomes very routine. Like everything at McDonalds, there is a detailed step-by-step written procedure on how to do it. reply joezydeco 3 hours agorootparentYeah, I was thinking more about the grandparent above that said it took 45 minutes and that had to mean breakdown/cleaning/reassembly in one step. I was there in 1985-86 and we did like you said, one crew member did the cleaning at close and let it air dry for the morning crew. But that was also because shakes/ice cream wasn't served during the breakfast shift. Someone had time in the morning to assemble and prime the machine before 10:30am (me). I'm guessing 24/7 operation changed when and how the cleaning was done, leading to more contamination instead of less. reply bombcar 8 hours agorootparentprevProperly cleaning those types of machines is complicated.

Why were the results different? DOJ composition running up through 2018 was pretty strongly influenced by a decade of liberal-leaning but cross-partisan staffing, and this was a legal theory that obviously emerged from within staff rather than coming down from the top. And psychology of liberal or conservative but principled lawyers is likely to be conscientious enough when it comes to their legal theorizing that except where it serves particular organized power plays, you'll see some principled arguments come out, like this one, because obviously the DMCA exists to protect copyright rather than stymie repair. Also, right-to-repair has an appeal that crosses partisan boundaries very well, especially among voters themselves. Sure, businesses and social influencers who'd sacrifice right-to-repair for pro-capital / power-play positions are probably highly represented and influential in the right-wing party, what with the investment in social philosophies oriented around hierarchies of status. But going against right-to-repair is still unpopular enough and likely to piss off conservative-identifying libertarians that there was bound to be some discomfort, even with the usual Republican enthusiasm for being a pro-capital / pro-business capture party. And finally, while it's obvious that the 2018 POTUS is only capable seeing the issue in terms of friends/opportunities and enemies/liabilites rather than principled legal or social theories, it's also obvious that right-to-repair is one of the things that benefited from his shall we say limited range/depth of interest when it comes to policy.

It's not that someone is dumb if they sometimes don't know their own interests. It's that it's a hard problem that even smart people can fail at. Maybe especially smart people who don't appreciate that it's a hard problem and perhaps even are prone to confuse failure with stupidity. Those who appreciate the complexity of the various problem domains for social policy or even of the information environment wouldn't be the least surprised if they personally accidentally voted against their own interest. And it's far from controversial that many people are much more likely to vote by connecting their values to impressions/symbols invoked by campaigns and parties than to dig in even at the policy white paper level and arrive at a carefully calculated cost/benefit analysis for each candidate. Maybe you're an exception. Probably not, but maybe. What about most people? Well, if it's true in a 2024 presidential race \"about their policies, Harris would win handily... because voters — whether they know it or not — overwhelmingly prefer the vice president’s agenda to the former president’s\"[0] but also true that the race is a coin flip, that suggests some significant margin of people who are doing something else other than policy-interest calculations. Meanwhile, back at the specific topic, almost nobody is campaigning on right to repair, so even among people who happen to be detailed interest calculators (whoever that may be), it'd be little surprise if as an issue it didn't figure strongly into how they considered their interests and cast their vote. If this issue matters to you, consider that right-to-repair friendly interpretations of the law are where the civil servant / professional administrative / \"deep state\" has arrived at under the direction and staffing priorities of prevailing liberal order. Which, is, uh, not really the energy/vibe of one of the current candidates (and it's fairer to speak of energy/vibes than policies when it comes to him given how obvious it is that this is a guy who doesn't do homework and knows little policy other than personal advantage).

The newspaper ran an article by two staff reporters saying that editorial page staffers had drafted an endorsement of Kamala Harris over Donald Trump in the election. \"The decision not to publish was made by The Post's owner — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos,\" the article said. In a 2019 lawsuit, Amazon claimed it lost a $10 billion Pentagon cloud computing contract to Microsoft because Trump used \"improper pressure ... to harm his perceived political enemy\" Bezos. In this article POST Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT The Washington Post Building at One Franklin Square Building in Washington, D.C., June 5, 2024. Andrew HarnikGetty Images The Washington Post said Friday that it will not endorse a candidate in the presidential election this year — or ever again — breaking decades of tradition and sparking immediate criticism of the decision. But the newspaper also published an article by two staff reporters revealing that editorial page staffers had drafted an endorsement of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris over GOP nominee Donald Trump in the election. \"The decision not to publish was made by The Post's owner — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos,\" the article said, citing two sources briefed on the events. Trump, while president, had been critical of the billionaire Bezos and the Post, which he purchased in 2013. The newspaper in 2016 and again in 2020 endorsed Trump's election opponents, Hillary Clinton and President Joe Biden, in editorials that condemned the Republican in blunt terms. In a 2019 lawsuit, Amazon claimed it had lost a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon to Microsoft because Trump had used \"improper pressure ... to harm his perceived political enemy\" Bezos. The Post since 1976 had regularly endorsed candidates for president, except for the 1988 race. All those endorsements had been for Democrats. In a statement to CNBC, when asked about Bezos' purported role in killing the endorsement, Post chief communications officer Kathy Baird said, \"This was a Washington Post decision to not endorse, and I would refer you to the publisher's statement in full.\" The Post on Friday evening published a third article, signed by opinion columnists for the newspaper, who said, \"The Washington Post's decision not to make an endorsement in the presidential campaign is a terrible mistake.\" \"It represents an abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper that we love, and for which we have worked a combined 218 years,\" the column said. \"This is a moment for the institution to be making clear its commitment to democratic values, the rule of law and international alliances, and the threat that Donald Trump poses to them — the precise points The Post made in endorsing Trump's opponents in 2016 and 2020.\" CNBC has requested comment from Amazon, where Bezos remains the largest shareholder. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos arrives for his meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the UK diplomatic residence in New York City, Sept. 20, 2021. Michael M. SantiagoGetty Images NewsGetty Images Post publisher and chief executive Will Lewis, in an article published online explaining the decision, wrote, \"The Washington Post will not be making an endorsement of a presidential candidate in this election. Nor in any future presidential election.\" \"We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates,\" Lewis wrote. \"We recognize that this will be read in a range of ways, including as a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another, or as an abdication of responsibility,\" he wrote. \"That is inevitable. We don't see it that way. We see it as consistent with the values The Post has always stood for and what we hope for in a leader: character and courage in service to the American ethic, veneration for the rule of law, and respect for human freedom in all its aspects.\" Seven of the 13 paragraphs of Lewis' article either quoted at length or referred to Post Editorial Board statements in 1960 and 1972 explaining the paper's rationale for not endorsing presidential candidates in those years, which included its identity as \"an independent newspaper.\" Lewis noted that the paper had endorsed Jimmy Carter in 1976 \"for understandable reasons at the times\" — which he did not identify. \"But we had it right before that, and this is what we are going back to,\" Lewis wrote. \"Our job as the newspaper of the capital city of the most important country in the world is to be independent,\" he wrote. \"And that is what we are and will be.\" Post editor-at-large Robert Kagan, a member of the paper's opinions section, resigned following the decision, multiple news outlets reported. More than 10,000 reader comments were posted on Lewis' article, many of them blasting the Post for its decision and saying they were canceling their subscriptions. \"The most consequential election in our country, a choice between Fascism and Democracy, and you sit out? Cowards. Unethical, fearful cowards,\" wrote one comment. \"Oh, and by the way, I'm canceling my subscription, because you are putting business ahead of ethics and morals.\" The announcement came days after Mariel Garza, the head of The Los Angeles Times' editorial board, resigned in protest after that paper's owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, decided against running a presidential endorsement. \"I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not okay with us being silent,\" Garza told the Columbia Journalism Review. \"In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is how I'm standing up.\" Soon-Shiong, like Bezos, is a billionaire. Marty Baron, the former editor of The Washington Post, called that paper's decision \"cowardice, with democracy as its casualty.\" ″@realdonaldtrump will see this as an invitation to further intimidate owner @jeffbezos (and others),\" Baron wrote. \"Disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.\" The Washington Post Guild, the union that represents the newspaper's staff, in a statement posted on the social media site X said it was \"deeply concerned that The Washington Post — an American news institution in the nation's capital — would make a decision to no longer endorse presidential candidates, especially a mere 11 days ahead of an immensely consequential election.\" \"The message from our chief executive, Will Lewis — not from the Editorial Board itself — makes us concerned that management interfered with the work of our members in Editorial,\" the Guild said in the statement, which noted the paper's reporting about Bezos' role in the decision. \"We are already seeing cancellations from once loyal readers,\" the Guild said. \"This decision undercuts the work of our members at a time when we should be building our readers' trust, not losing it.\" Read more CNBC politics coverage Biden's latest student debt plan would create forgiveness path for borrowers facing financial ruin French trader bet over $28 million on Trump election win using 4 Polymarket accounts DOJ warns Elon Musk pro-Trump PAC that $1 million voter contest may be illegal Harris blasts Trump on reported Hitler comments, says 'he wants unchecked power' 'Higher prices, larger deficits': 23 Nobel Prize-winning economists slam Trump agenda, endorse Harris Former Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, whose stories about the Watergate break-in during the Nixon administration won the newspaper a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, in a statement said, \"We respect the traditional independence of the editorial page, but this decision 11 days out from the 2024 presidential election ignores the Washington Post's own overwhelming reportorial evidence on the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy.\" \"Under Jeff Bezos's ownership, the Washington Post's news operation has used its abundant resources to rigorously investigate the danger and damage a second Trump presidency could cause to the future of American democracy and that makes this decision even more surprising and disappointing, especially this late in the electoral process,\" Woodward and Bernstein said. Post columnist Karen Attiah, in a post on the social media site Threads, wrote, \"Today has been an absolute stab in the back.\" \"What an insult to those of us who have literally put our careers and lives on the line to call out threats to human rights and democracy,\" Attiah wrote. Rep. Ted Lieu, a Democrat from California, in his own tweet on the news wrote, \"The first step towards fascism is when the free press cowers in fear.\" Trump in August told Fox Business News that Bezos called him after the Republican narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in July at a campaign rally in western Pennsylvania. \"He was very nice even though he owns The Washington Post,\" Trump said of Bezos. Bezos last posted on X on July 13, hours after the assassination attempt. \"Our former President showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire tonight,\" Bezos wrote in that tweet. \"So thankful for his safety and so sad for the victims and their families.\" Trump on Friday met in Austin, Texas, with executives from the Bezos-owned space exploration company Blue Origin, among them CEO David Limp, the Associated Press reported Subscribe to CNBC PRO Subscribe to Investing Club Licensing & Reprints CNBC Councils Select Personal Finance CNBC on Peacock Join the CNBC Panel Supply Chain Values Select Shopping Closed Captioning Digital Products News Releases Internships Corrections About CNBC Ad Choices Site Map Podcasts Careers Help Contact News Tips Got a confidential news tip?

Readers seek them out. Newspapers are a business and have to give their customers what they want. The problematic aspect here is that the current business owner, Jeff Bezos, has a conflict of interest. Bezos is making a bad business decision for The Washington Post, sacrificing it and losing readers for the sake of his other business interests, i.e., government contracts. It's unlikely that an independent owner with no conflict of interest would make the same decision. reply nickff 19 hours agoparentYou seem to be implying that he made a decision based on other business interests, against those of the Post, but there is no support for that in the article. Do you have a source which describes this motive? It seems like not endorsing candidates might be good for the Washington Post's business, by improving its perceived impartiality. In addition to this, the WaPo seems to have spent much of its history not endorsing candidates, and it has been doing (financially) poorly recently; perhaps this is a return to more profitable and credible roots. reply sgnelson 19 hours agorootparentWhile you may not take this as proof it affected this exact decision, it's hard to ignore it as a possible reason. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/10/amazon-wants-to-depose-presi... reply tbrownaw 17 hours agorootparentUpdates...

That contract was $1B/yr contract over ten years. They make $600B+ a year. Not exactly going to tip the scales of his stock options.

Anybody knows that Harris is not running to retaliate against those who do not agree with every policy that her people can get her party to support, but Trump is and he makes it very clear that if elected he intends to do harm that Harris will not do. Bigly. So without consideration for upside[0], one of the most emotionless decisions a top executive can make is when there is no downside versus when there is. [0] After all, further upside is not necessary if you already have experienced enough to where the needle can not move any further. reply dragonwriter 15 hours agorootparentprev> They make $600B+ a year. Are you confusing revenue with profit? Yeah, a lot of money pumps in one end of Amazon retail and out the other, but there is very little margin: the $550+ billion in revenue on the retail side, as I understand, brings in significantly less net than the $90 billion in revenue on the cloud side. And government contracts, where one might expect support or opposition from a potential cheif executige who has made overt promises of purges and other uses of office to punish enemies and reward friends to make a big difference, are an important part of that (not just that one $1B contract.) reply chgs 8 hours agorootparentI say I make $100k year.

Where are you getting this? He is down against Harris in most polls, and neither candidate is clearing a majority. There are projections that he has a narrow edge in winning the Presidency due to the electoral college, but that's not the same as being most likely to win a majority (or even plurality) of the votes (e.g., 538 gives Trump currently a 53% chance to win the electoral college, while Harris has a 65% chance to win the popular vote.) reply valval 4 hours agorootparentBetting odds. reply dllthomas 3 hours agorootparentBetting on winner, or on popular vote?

That makes no sense at all. If the primary concern was avoiding canceled contracts, it would be in his best interests to ensure that the guy who is threatening to cancel contracts out of spite would not be elected. Pressuring the Washington Post to not endorse the candidate who does not pose that threat goes exactly against that. It's something else. reply FrojoS 7 hours agorootparentIt sure makes sense. The endorsement is extremely unlikely to decide the election. On the contrary, the chance that the endorsement will lead to retribution after a lost election is arguably much higher. They think it happened last time around. You can say it's cowardly to act like this. But it does make sense. reply heresie-dabord 6 hours agorootparent> say it's cowardly to act like this.

The NY Times opinion editor was famously forced to resign in 2020 when he published an op-ed that the newsroom found unacceptable. reply markvdb 13 hours agorootparentprevThat is possible if their editorial staff honestly believe two things: - The rule of law and the republic as a process are superior to anything else. - One of the candidates does not subscribe to these sufficiently. In that case, and given the political duopoly, they could still claim to be impartial towards candidates. Their only allegiance/partiality would lie with the rule of law and the republic as a process. reply valval 11 hours agorootparentYou’re thinking about this too hard. It’s a definitional question. If you have two candidates and you endorse one of them, you’re de facto partial with nothing else playing any role in the definition. reply smsm42 18 hours agorootparentprevIt would take way more for WaPo to not be in a position where mentioning it in one phrase with \"impartiality\" wouldn't sound like an absurdist joke. They can walk this road, but so far there's absolutely no indication they want to, and Bezos twisting their arms can't be taken as such evidence. reply tempestn 14 hours agorootparentprevThere is direct support in the article. Amazon lost a $10B contract because Trump doesn't like Bezos, which is because he owns the WP, a paper that is generally critical of Trump. By killing this endorsement, he's buying some goodwill from Trump, at the cost of alienating the bulk of WP's readers. reply ZeroGravitas 8 hours agorootparentprevBezos was blackmailed by Trump ally and National Enquirer boss David Pecker a few years ago.

Why not? You personally can refrain from any speculation, if you wish, but it's nonetheless the most obvious explanation. Moreover, your own speculation is implausible: > perhaps this is a return to more profitable and credible roots. This last-minute backpedaling makes The Washington Post look much worse than an endorsement. The new non-endorsement \"policy\" wasn't announced in advance. It came only after the editors had already drafted an endorsement of Harris, and at least one editor resigned as a result. The Post now appears less credible rather than more. reply cryptonector 15 hours agorootparentprevWhat is Trump seeking vengeance for? reply fenomas 17 hours agorootparentprev> not endorsing candidates might be good for the Washington Post's business, by improving its perceived impartiality You're at the wrong meta level - if the paper's owner is making the editorial decisions, there's no impartiality to perceive in the first place. I mean, if the question at hand was \"should the editors endorse someone?\" then what you're saying could stand. But that's out the window if they're being overruled by somebody without even a presumption of impartiality. reply nomel 15 hours agorootparentI think one could claim that the editorial department was trying to make a decision that could/would be interpreted as a company stance, rather than a department stance, to the average person. Sure, you could blame the average person. I also can’t comprehend the benefit of a biased editorial department, from a business or quality perspective. A diverse set of views is always more interesting to read, but I’m surely in the minority with that perspective. If someone could explain the benefit, I’m very interested. I don’t see this is any different than the media black out that nearly all corporate employees enjoy, that exists for one reason: don’t make your opinions appear as those of the whole. Looking at the mixed responses to all of this, across the internet, that does seem to be the case, where people are confusing it all. reply fenomas 14 hours agorootparent1. Publishing an editorial endorsing a candidate is extremely common, both for US papers generally and for this paper specifically. The reasons for that are various but they have nothing to do with what we're discussing here. 2. Moreover, that whole question is irrelevant when the editors aren't even making the decision. If Bezos is willing to override them, then effectively he is the paper's editorial board - so there's no \"diversity of views\" to talk about, except within the confines of what he's decided to allow. reply AYBABTME 14 hours agorootparent(1) might be both common and also wrong. (1) being why I dislike most of these media outlets. (2) the editorial board may be wrong and suffering groupthink, and ultimately slowly killing the paper. reply fenomas 13 hours agorootparentThe fact that editorial endorsements are extremely common is relevant because it means that no typical reader would mistake them for being the position of the paper's parent corporation, like GGP suggested. Whether endorsements are right or wrong in the abstract isn't relevant, and I didn't say anything about it. reply chipdart 8 hours agorootparentprev> I think one could claim that the editorial department was trying to make a decision that could/would be interpreted as a company stance, rather than a department stance, to the average person. This makes no sense whatsoever. It is the editorial board deciding what candidate is endorsed by the paper. It is a company stance, made by the company's representatives on behalf of the company and based on the company's editorial guidelines. reply valval 11 hours agorootparentprevWe can easily bring the meta level down one more step to conclude that given the editorial staff are individuals with different beliefs, this dictates that they’re impartial to the extent of the (weighted) average of their beliefs. I’d argue impartiality isn’t a thing in any human domain anyway. reply raverbashing 13 hours agorootparentprevApparently Blue Origin executives were meeting with Trump yesterday https://x.com/MerylKornfield/status/1849977796304478327 reply dhruvrajvanshi 19 hours agorootparentprevFrom the article > In a 2019 lawsuit, Amazon claimed it had lost a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon to Microsoft because Trump had used “improper pressure ... to harm his perceived political enemy” Bezos. The implication being that endorsing Harris might cause Amazon to lose out on government contracts in case Trump wins the presidency. reply standardUser 19 hours agorootparentprevTrump has repeatedly threatened media companies he thinks have wronged him with specific actions he's said he will take as president. Bezos has a whole business empire to worry about that goes way beyond WaPo. He doesn't need a petty president trying to wreck his bottom line for 4 years.

If anything, he should have left editorial decisions to the staff. reply yks 18 hours agorootparentprevWe have a potential future president who, putting it very charitably, espouses the ideology of \"For my friends — everything, for my enemies — the law\", and in the least surprising development ever, billionaires suddenly warm up to this guy. Many such cases. reply standardUser 18 hours agorootparentprevYes we have a reason. Trump threatens media companies and individuals he believes have wronged him - loudly and often. If someone came to you and said they aren't going to a party, and you knew someone at that party had specifically threatened to beat them if they attend the party, do you have \"no reason\" to believe that the threat of a beating is a likely cause of the action (or in these cases, inaction). Especially if that person has a long history of attending that specific party? reply jasonlotito 18 hours agorootparentprevThere is support for that reasoning in the article linked. reply noncoml 19 hours agorootparentprevIt takes a lot time to build the reputation of impartiality.

I think in America at least, the national media has become so hyper partisan in the eyes of its readers, that an endorsement of a newspaper is really just preaching to the crowd. What difference does that endorsement really make? At the national level, I don't think it really makes a difference if a newspaper endorses a candidate for President.

But as soon as that information has been published, they do not have that better position anymore. And in addition to that, what is frequently happening is that they do not just publish the information available to them - instead they distort it and modify it to fit their pre-conceived opinion, and publish that, in hope that the public doesn't know any better (it usually does).

Every time an opinion piece is published that goes against this, it’s a huge brouhaha. Interestingly on another note, opinion writers are often actually less qualified than you’d expect, because the business model of a newspaper doesn’t really work for accumulating expertise vs. a specialized magazine/Substack / etc. The only way to have consistent opinion pieces is to have a generalist, not a specialist. reply Cyph0n 18 hours agorootparentprevLayers of interpretation = surfacing the bias of the editorial team so you can look for it in the non-oped sections of the paper reply zmmmmm 18 hours agorootparentYou can take that way if you want.

Of course with endorsements you can technically bring up the is/aught dichotomy. The facts may be what they are but that doesn’t necessitate any particular action.

Mind you, I would expect omissions and couching that is flawed, but understanding the thinking of those I oppose is valuable and allows me to see their blind spots (or my own for that matter).

And LATimes and WaPo endorsements almost certainly won't have an effect on this election. But, this reeks of cowardice. If you wanted to return to the journalistic standard of impartiality, that's a great thing to do when the pressure is low. Feb 2021 would have been perfect. Less than two weeks before the most contentious election in modern history? And specifically when one candidate has threatened news organizations and their owners with retribution (legal, commercial, extralegal) for stories they don't like?

I can't answer why we would want newspapers to endorse presidents- except that historically, newspapers played a big role in shaping public opinion (now mostly replaced by social media). reply dehrmann 17 hours agoparentprevMy gripe with endorsements is they imply people can't think critically for themselves. reply reverius42 9 hours agorootparentSupposedly some voters are undecided. Perhaps they would be swayed by a persuasive argument; this doesn’t necessarily mean they can’t think critically. I say supposedly because I find it hard to believe the WaPo endorsement would actually sway anyone. reply jfoster 16 hours agoparentprevI would extend that to all businesses. For the sake of the business & their customers it's usually best to keep politics out of it. reply mandevil 15 hours agorootparentAs long as the Post has an editorial page, with people employed to share their opinions, what are they supposed to do? Opinion and reporting are separate- famously the WSJ reporting is quite strong and their opinion section is ... often wrong- but as long as an opinion section exists that's kinda their job, to share their opinion. If you want to get rid of opinion that might be a reasonable thing (with cable news and the internet no one has a shortage of opinion these days!) but doing it in such a ham-fisted way so close to the election is not a sign of a carefully thought-out business decision, it's a sign of cowardice. reply jfoster 13 hours agorootparentThey could share their opinions on the policies of each candidate. That could be great at helping people see perspectives other than their own, so that they can weigh it all up and make their own decision. Doing an endorsement is kind of the opposite of that, because it is essentially telling readers \"you don't need to decide, we have done it for you.\" reply mandevil 11 hours agorootparentCounterpoint: the biggest problem facing opinion journalism today is the competition. Actual news reporting is expensive and slow and sometimes doesn't pan out, isn't very profitable and there isn't that much of it. But you can get opinion everywhere these days- cable TV news, internet streamers, internet articles, it's everywhere. That suggests that there is actually a huge demand for highly opinionated work (and also that it is remarkably cheap to produce), but whether it's something like Daily Kos or Free Beacon or Alex Jones or Newsmax, it seems like everyone can find their own personal brand of opinion journalism that both flatters their own pre-existing opinions and at the same time molds them. Lots of narrowband broadcasting in that space, and the daily papers are really struggling with their goal of broad reach- they are getting outcompeted in each specific niche by a specialty player that caters to a much smaller, more specific set of opinions. (They try to have a diverse range of OpEd columnists, hoping that if you don't agree with Paul Krugman maybe you'll like David French, but that's a hard thing to pull off these days when your competition is just people of one specific ideological wedge.)

You can make the case that they might be disingenuous or manipulative in sharing what they claim to be their opinions, or that their opinions reflect cultural indoctrination rather than professional assessment, etc -- and so you don't have to take their endorsements seriously. But it's not a crazy idea that they have something valuable to share for all the time they spend very close to news and politics, and it's not bad to know what their big picture view of topics and people are as they write and select stories for the rest of the paper as it helps you contextualize them in their subjectivity. reply selimthegrim 16 hours agorootparentThis reminds me of when The New Republic had a bunch of staff quit en masse because the new imported editor was blatantly bullshitting them.

I'd argue that maybe it would behoove an institution of trust to make an endorsement only rarely, but it's also long been part of the means of public discourse for papers to put out opinions and endorsements. More so than that question, I think it's more obvious to ask \"if you're going to have that argument, is the year Trump, the nation destroying clown, is running, the year to suddenly make a change after something like > 3 decades? Especially when it seems like your owner might be making the change because he wants to curry favor for contracts?\" It's a pretty pathetic look, but I don't particularly expect any civic virtue from Bezos, so not shocked.

    "originLink": "https://www.bryanbraun.com/2024/10/25/before-you-buy-a-domain-name-first-check-to-see-if-its-haunted/",
    "originBody": "In mid-2022 I bought a new domain name. The name was musicbox.fun. I got it for a side-project, an interactive online music box that I had built and hosted at musicboxfun.com. The new name was shorter and more quirky. I felt lucky to have grabbed it. Unfortunately, musicbox.fun had a history. Before I bought it, the domain was used to host pirated music. musicbox.fun, as it existed in 2018 (before I owned it) From June 2018 to February 2021, the site racked up thousands of copyright violation complaints. Over 20,000 of its urls were delisted by Google (and other search engines) before the site went offline in 2022. I had no idea, of course. It wasn’t until I had redirected all of my musicboxfun.com traffic to musicbox.fun that I noticed that something wasn’t right: my web traffic from organic search dropped to zero. I assumed it was temporary so I double-checked my process and waited for awhile, but it never really recovered. It wasn’t until a year later that I discovered the copyright violations and learned that the domain name was compromised. Apparently, this is a thing that happens to domain names, but as far as I know, there’s not really a name for it. When I described it to my wife, she said “Oh, so it’s haunted.” “Haunted” is the perfect word for this: Something terrible happened at the domain name in the past. On the surface, nothing seems wrong with the domain name. Then there are signs that something isn’t right. Obligatory jump-scare when you discover what happened. Internal debate: do you abandon it or try to fix it? There’s a ton of superstition around how to fix it. Superficial fixes don’t seem to work. When there's something strange with your domain name, who you gonna call? So to summarize, I’m saying a domain name is “haunted” when something in its past gives it a poor reputation among search engines, affecting its ability to rank in search results, even after it changes ownership. The inner-workings of search engines are notoriously opaque*, making it difficult to 1) know if you’re being affected and 2) know how to fix it. The following are my suggestions, based on my experience with musicbox.fun. How to check if a domain name is haunted Before you buy a domain name, there’s a few ways to check if it’s haunted: 1. Check the Wayback Machine at archive.org If you go to web.archive.org and put in your domain name, it will pull up archived web pages of whatever lived at the domain in the past. Here’s a couple things to look out for: Does anything in the past look illegal or sketchy (piracy, gambling, porn, etc)? Is the history suspiciously empty? If so, then possibly the past content was removed by request (I suspect this was the case for musicbox.fun) 2. Search DMCA complaints DMCA stands for “Digital Millenium Copyright Act,” which is a US law that enables people to report copyright infractions to search engine companies (among other things). These reports are public, and you can look them up in a few ways: Search Google Transparency Report for your domain, to find delist requests (you can see the report for musicbox.fun here). Search lumendatabase.org for your domain, to find copyright complaints (for an example, see these results for musicbox.fun). Finding ANY copyright complaints for your domain is cause for concern, especially if there are a lot of them and they were filed recently. 3. Search historical SEO data If you’re considering buying an important domain name, you may also want to search historical SEO data. Advanced SEO tools like ahrefs.com can give you detailed information about backlinks, ranking history, and estimates for traffic and domain authority. Often, you’ll need to pay to get full access to this kind of data. Interpreting this data is beyond the scope of this post, but a bit of research can help uncover problems here. Ok, it’s haunted. Now what do I do? 1. Talk to the search engines Many search engines have tools for domain owners, like Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools. Definitely set up a profile and get your domain name added. It can help surface past issues and it gives you a way to report when issues have been resolved. For more details about specific actions you can take here, see my stackexchange post on the topic. If your domain has DMCA complaints, you may be tempted to file a DMCA counter-notice. Don’t do it. Counter-notices are for errorneous copyright complaints, not complaints that were once valid but no longer relevant. Per Google’s counter-notice submission form: Please note: If the content on the page was infringing at the time the original removal request arrived, your counter notice is not legally valid. Do not submit a counter notice if there was illegal content, even if it’s now been removed. As far as I can tell, there’s not really anything you can do to make past, valid DCMA complaints go away. 2. Double-down on best practices My SEO strategy has always been to do great work and make it easy for Google to see it. It usually works pretty well (at least for my non-haunted domains). For haunted domains, you have a bad reputation to overturn, which seems to require extra vigilence. SEO basics, like high-quality, structured, accessible, content on a fast-loading site, are table stakes. If you’ve done any SEO work, you know that search engines treat links to your site as a massive signal of relevance and trust. I suspect that fresh incoming links are especially important for overturning a bad reputation, though I haven’t confirmed this personally. If you think musicbox.fun is a useful project and you wield the power of a link, consider posting a link to it, and maybe we’ll find out together. 3. Wait for a while? In my research I found a detailed stackexchange post about trust scores and how they are affected by DMCA complaints. This post suggested that recovery could take some time: It takes years to rebuild trust scores and for some sites, this may never happen. …the reality is that a domain can ruin its value beyond redemption. This post isn’t a primary source, but I also came across an Q&A with a Google Search employee who fielded a similar question about DMCA violations. Their response said something similar, basically, that it can take time for the reputation effects to wear off (I’m struggling to find the video now, but I’ll link it when I do). All of this is fairly disappointing. In a perfect world, when your legitimately good content isn’t being surfaced by Google, it’s a failure on their part, and their problem to solve, not yours. In practice, it is your problem and you have to do a bunch of work to help them see that their current assessment of your domain name is no longer accurate. Ideally, search engine algorithms would give new domain owners a fresh start. Yes, it would prevent “haunted domain issues” but it would also reduce squatting on trusted domains (another issue I’ve been burned by). Unfortunately, we don’t live in that world*, so we only have a few options: Avoid buying haunted domain names Abandon domain names, once you discover that they are haunted Put in a bunch of time and effort to restore a haunted domain name’s low trust score For musicbox.fun, I want to at least try #3. I’ve taken some of the steps above and it feels like I’m starting to see progress. It’s slow, but I’m not in a big hurry to restore traffic. The site is just a hobby and it was always a niche project for a niche audience. Either way, I hope to post an update in a while to let you know if it improves over time. * It’s easy to attribute issues like these to anti-competitive behavior or some other malicious cause, but I don’t blame Google here. If their reputation algorithm was more transparent (or forgiving), it could be more easily exploited by bad actors. Obscurity prevents exploitation but also adds to the mystery and superstition that plagues the SEO industry. It’s tempting to get sucked into the mystery, trying to figure out the algorithm despite its constant changes and intentional obscurity, but that’s not how I want to live my life.",

In addition, it's good for someone like the CISO to poke around the innards of your network (etc) configs from time to time, just to stay up to date with what's going on in the company and to perhaps flag anything that smells suspicious. You can do these kinds of exploration exercises completely free form, or you can take a little task like 'figure out exactly why this specific site is blocked' as a token of motivation. I agree that all of this mostly only makes sense, if it doesn't take too much time.

This doesn't seem like that hard of a problem to solve, because these are domains with negative reputation, i.e. worse than zero. So if a) the domain is no longer hosting any of the stuff previously complained about and b) is no longer receiving new complaints over a period of a year, it costs you nothing to reset the domain to zero. Because the bad actors don't have to behave for a year to get back to zero, they can just register a new domain. All you're doing is giving the new owner the same fresh start that anybody can get by buying a never before registered domain for the same price as a year's renewal on the existing one. reply dtdynasty 2 hours agorootparent3 assumptions that from my read are baked into your comment. - Any empty domain starts with the same reputation - Registering a new domain is a 0 cost action - The eng effort to reset domain reputation is 0 Certain domains are used by abusers more often, usually due to them being cheaper.

Google or anyone spitefully holding onto hard feelings about what a domain “did” years ago is pointless because the spammers will move on anyway. They wouldn’t reuse abcqwertuiop26abc dot xyz anyway because it’s safer to make up a new gibberish domain anyway. Only people who acquire domains legitimately are hurt by this. I would want to experiment judging them based on what they’ve been seen to do in the past month. reply lazide 1 hour agorootparentThe only reason they go to those new domains is because of the blacklist.

So I checked the Bing Webmaster Tools. URL Inspection says \"Discovered but not crawled - The inspected URL is known to Bing but has some issues which are preventing indexation.

I've seen a few sites become de-indexed and the 'give away' is the type of results that first appear when the penalty is eventually lifted. For example, just a dozen or so urls with really weird query strings that never existed before. The real stuff does come back after time though and, in my limited experience, it's a one-off incident. Just to add, not many sites are insignificant enough not to attract negative seo - especially this type of low-level, zero cost malarkey. reply bryanbraun 15 hours agoparentprevOP here, and yes, I've been getting that same message for musicbox.fun. I thought it just needed some time but I requested a fresh index two weeks ago, and nothing seems to have changed. :/ reply 8organicbits 4 hours agoprevAnother variant of this is cached or preloaded security configurations. HSTS (which forces browsers to validate HTTPS when connecting) asks browsers to cache the configuration for a set \"max-age\". Some sites set huge values here, like Twitter's 20 year max-age[1]. There's also the preload lists [2] to consider. This creates a problem if you want to serve non-HTTPS/unencrypted HTTP on your new domain and the previous owner didn't. MTA-STS [3] is another variant that's becoming more popular. It limits which mail servers your domain uses and enforces TLS certificate verification. \"max_age\" is capped to a year by the RFC. If you don't set your own policy, then the previous domain owners policy would impact any senders who previously cached the policy. Thankfully HPKP (key pinning) is obsolete, otherwise you'd also need to worry about old pinned keys too. That RFC recommended, but did not enforce, a 60 day max-age limit. These are especially tricky as the old security policy only lives in the caches of any end-user devices that previously connected to the domain. Double haunted.

The problem lies with these blacklisting entities, not with the domain, and the solution must be done there, too. It should not be a domain owner’s responsibility to get out of being unfairly blacklisted. It’s like when cars took over the streets, and instead of blaming cars for being dangerous for regular people using the streets for walking, the concept of “jaywalking” was invented by car companies to place the blame on people for daring to obstruct cars.

That is what the parent comment is calling for, specifically, I quote \"Wikipedia should just block India completely.\" As to my reply to your comment, I recognize Wikipedia's right to not conduct their business in India if they chose to do so, for whatever reason. I interpret your comment as saying that there would be nothing wrong in Wikipedia exercising this right - which I agree with. So I stated my point earnestly that while I agree there is nothing wrong in exercising this right. It seems what it amounts to is that either the court rules in their favor, or they withdraw from India. If that is the expectation that India courts should just rule in their favor (even when they are in the wrong), then I am sorry but that is not acceptable. Hope that clarifies things. Either way, I am going to withdraw from this discussion as well reply random_ind_dude 40 minutes agorootparentprevThis[0] is the Wikipedia article that ANI has beef with. The claims of propaganda are all supported by ample secondary sources from Indian news organizations like Caravan Magazine and the Ken. ANI wants Wikipedia to provide the names of the editors that added the details to the article. Once Wikipedia reveals those names, ANI will presumably sue them for defamation and force them to remove their contributions. While the edit history will remain, few are likely to read it. Suing the editors and forcing them to retract their edits on Wikipedia will have a chilling effect on anyone Indian that tries to point out what ANI and similar organizations are doing. But if Wikipedia blocks India and the issue blows up in the media, ANI will be forced to back off and the article will stay up. Wikipedia then unblocks India.

The Streisand effect. No-one on HN gave a monkeys about this dodgy news agency till today. Now half of us have read the archive about how they promote propaganda & fake news. Your reputation takes a hit 2. There is no absolute definition of “freedom”. Wikipedia is a fantastic resource for humanity in general and I think should be defended. But as more and more of humanity come to live more and more online, then the legal and cultural norms will shift and shuffle - courts for two hundred years have assumed they can order anyone in their jurisdiction around and often not in their jurisdiction- and that’s kind of the point of courts. So what is freedom? It’s what we the demos and the courts agree … 3. An example is in the order (I mean on the Streisand effect - when the %#}#% hell would I ever read a court order from India ?!) - it says “herein to take down/delete” - this bespeaks a failure to understand the world on the level of “who are the Beatles”.

This means that experts are often not who you want editing an article, because experts are often poorly positioned to know what the general public knows, and what consensus is from outside their area of expertise. E.g., I have published research that contradicts information on Wikipedia, and while I am of course convinced I and my co-authors are right while Wikipedia is wrong, I would much rather have that state of affairs than a world where Wikipedia is written by everyone with a paper on a subject, and the line is drawn at whoever was the most recent editor. reply gjsman-1000 1 hour agorootparentThat's the propaganda Wikipedia wants you to think, citing itself. In practice, it doesn't work. The bias and delusional behavior of the editors is infectious, widespread, and has even been criticized by Wikipedia's own co-founder Larry Sanger as being overrun by \"left-wing propaganda essays.\" He even went as far as to call it the \"most biased encyclopedia in history\" in an interview with Glenn Greenwald. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR6dO8U8okk) Frankly, it does seem (following stereotypes) that left-wing people have a stronger tendency to be writers from being white-collar; while more right-wing folks are too busy with blue-collar jobs and physical labor to be writing rebuttals. A very simple example is how Wikipedia approves Vox, Slate, The Nation, Mother Jones, Jezebel, The Atlantic, Gizmodo, and Jacobin as sources, but Fox News is considered \"unreliable.\" Permitting Jacobin and Jezebel, but not Fox, is delusional. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Per...) reply tga_d 42 minutes agorootparentEvery source you list as \"approved\" either isn't listed as perennial at all (which makes me wonder, how did it end up on your list?), or has explicit carve-outs saying that statements need to be attributed due to bias. Meanwhile, Fox has had thorough discussion showing that there are substantial problems with their factual reporting on politics and science, that using them as attributed opinion sources is still fine, and that non-politics or science reporting should be examined critically but can be used. Particularly given the documents now publicly available on their handling of election coverage pretty clearly demonstrating an intentional distinction between what they think is true behind closed doors vs. reporting presented as reality (a distinction they ultimately had to admit in court), what grounds is there to dispute this policy?

My biggest fear with Wikipedia is citogenesis https://xkcd.com/978/ I have found one in a major news paper, this took three months to take down. reply syockit 5 hours agorootparentThere has been a little bit of furor in some circles in Japan, regarding the status of Yasuke, who was a favorite of Oda Nobunaga, whether he was a samurai or not. Around September of 2015, a user by the name tottoritom made numerous edits to the Yasuke article, citing to yet-to-be-published papers by Thomas Lockley. Coincidentally, tottoritom's user page introduces himself as Thomas Lockley too, and Lockley happened to also have lived in Tottori. After some time, the citations were changed to refer to a book that Lockley published in Japan (in Japanese). (Now, if the two are indeed one and same person, he has broken a Wikipedia rule on not publishing original research.) The book become a basis for a romanticized novel he published for western audiences, which I believe inspired the production of Netflix animation for the same character. From then on, the view that Yasuke was a samurai gained foothold, which caught some Japanese historians off-guard. He's also had his hand on the Britannica article of the same title, and now Wikipedia cites the Britannica article too, thus completing the cycle. reply surgical_fire 3 hours agorootparentI find it odd that Yasuke would be a Samurai, when Toyotomi Hideyoshi, one of the three unifiers and a general under Nobunaga, was not.

ANI is a bit like privatised Pravda operating in service to the government, yet, still pretending to be independent journalism. Wherever there is a critic of the government, ANI exists to slander such critics as a service. As a discerning reader, you learn to avoid mainstream media that quotes ANI (don't even consider watching a TV channel). You seek out alternate information sources. As the entity aligns closer with the ruling party and the mega-corporations like Adani that are aligned with it, you basically witness an octopus take over all information communication in India. Then you get harsher and harsher laws regulating social media. You get no new laws protecting your speech. You witness a general fatalism set in on the few Indian comment sections that still think this stuff is wrong. But one day you see it on HN and realise everyone is basically powerless here. Foolish maybe, but I genuinely hoped the open and open-sourced side of the internet would transcend borders. There must exist an information ecosystem that is above government.

They're not as powerful as the ones that are able to inject content into visited pages or programmatically inspect and block/alter HTTP requests, but personally I think it's a reasonable tradeoff for the reasons you mentioned. Chrome/Google got a very bad rep for pushing this change, and I don't want to speculate about their actual motivations, but the security aspect of it seems sound to me. With uBlock Lite (which uses MV3), it's also possible to additionally grant \"full site access\" on a site by site base in case the rules-based blocking alone isn't enough; that seems ideal to me. reply Jach 3 hours agorootparentI'll believe Google cares about extension security when they allow the user to trivially disable auto-updates. reply lxgr 1 hour agorootparentThat would be the express road to long-term unpatched vulnerabilities. There's basically two ways to have safe web extensions: Carefully control their entire supply chain (which could easily cause big antitrust problems for Google as the vendor of the most popular browser), or minimize the things they have access to. reply Jach 25 minutes agorootparentIt is the better road, and the road chosen by most other things that aren't SaaS, including Google's other most popular thing, Android. Keep the default to auto-update, fine, but let me disable that, as the Android app store does. Attacks from previously trusted extensions (and apps) being updated and then doing malicious things (requesting new permissions to do them is not significant friction) are worse and more frequent than old unpatched extensions being vulnerable to something. (That \"something\" likely being in the realm of XSS or click-jacking from a malicious page, much harder to widely exploit.) I'm sure it's happened, but I haven't heard of an extension suffering from a significant \"unpatched vulnerability\" and being exploited in the wild -- I have heard of things like this click-jacking issue in Privacy Badger: https://blog.lizzie.io/clickjacking-privacy-badger.html No wild exploits afaik, just the PoC, and the ultimate worst-case impact was just (reversibly) disabling the extension for the page or a site, which isn't very severe. Perhaps a more advanced extension like Ruffle that uses Rust and WASM has a more severe attack surface than the majority of extensions written in JavaScript, but even if it does, it must be exploited by a malicious page targeting it, vs. the alternative of auto-updating to a malicious version and doing whatever it can get away with immediately. Extensions getting taken over or just transferred to new owners and updating to do something new and malicious is quite routine and multiple examples come readily to my mind. The first to come to mind is Stylish, several years ago: https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/02/stylish-browser-extensio... (I was not impacted because I didn't update the extension during its vulnerable window, which was months, and apparently over a year for Chrome.) The safe way to handle these issues is to let users turn off auto-updating, and to have actual policies to mitigate the damages from malicious extensions. Firefox itself will disable extensions that become known to be defective in someway, this can be independent of whether the issue is an unpatched vulnerability, whether there's a patch/update to address it, whether the extension isn't just bugged but doing something malicious, whether it always was malicious from first install or just suddenly became malicious...

If your concern is that a maintainer might be strongarmed into getting surreptitious changes in the linux kernel, that's a misplaced concern because: 1- the maintainer in question didn't have access to approve changes across the whole linux kernel, but only on the drivers that they were maintaining (mainly Baikal electronics hardware, I assume.

There is an implication of otherness to using the term “normie” for the group using it but it is generally a pretty common term now. For example, imagine a bunch of policy wonks debating something in highly specific language and then someone asks “how would the normies react?” They mean, “how would people unfamiliar with the inner workings of political policy react?” Stuff like that.

And it's a simple consequence of scaling that the more massively you scale a communication system like the internet the more pathways there are for person A to harm person B. So naturally there end up being more cases evaluating harm that involve the internet. Some of those cases will involve ordinary judicial things like injunctions. And all of that is true regardless of whether you believe any one particular injunction is justified or unjustified. It's just a matter of what happens at scale. You can, of course, try to give up the notion that liberty ends when you start causing harm, and many people have gone down that path. But for those of us who are still in the liberty camp, these questions are difficult and involve weighing a number of concerns and claims. And anyone who thinks they have easy answers is probably just deeply confused or high on rhetoric. reply nradov 15 hours agorootparentMost of these cases don't involve any actual harm beyond hurt feelings, so that's largely a red herring. reply intended 14 hours agorootparentNot sure what cases you are referring to, but “Hurt feelings” in India have caused multiple riots, resulting in utter carnage, spilling over to years, decades longs strings of terrorism and reprisals against minorities. Feelings are the reason people get up to live in the morning. I get why we used to make that statement. In a way it’s about rationality mattering, and how feelings being hurt are different from actual hurt. In the context of this conversation, I’ll argue its an un-pragmatic dismissal of a pertinent fact. I’ll make this argument: “At the scales we are talking, and across the breath of human cultures, feelings end up mattering.” reply nradov 5 hours agorootparentThat's the kind of lame excuse that fascists and elitists always resort to in order to increase their power and shut down speech they dislike.

Yes, of course there are good reasons for this: without paying, the artists don't get paid and that means making music becomes no more than an expensive hobby and yadda yadda but that's my point: we may have corporeal justifications for the scarcity we impose on the Internet but the scarcity exists and we deliberately created it and use the police and military to enforce it. reply pahbloo 16 hours agorootparentprevIn fact, the most valuable resource on the internet is finite: atention with the possibility of influence those who give it to you.

The judge on the case stated \"If you don't like India, please don't work in India... We will ask government to block your site\".[19][20] In response, Wikimedia emphasized that the information in the article was supported by multiple reliable secondary sources.[21] Justice Manmohan said \"I think nothing can be worse for a news agency than to be called a puppet of an intelligence agency, stooge of the government. If that is true, the credibility goes.\"[22]\" I suppose that this might not be the most objective article on Wikipedia. I don't have context for these statements. The way that Wikipedia quotes the judge makes it sound like he's threatening to order the Indian government to block Wikipedia because Wikipedia says that ANI is government propaganda. Is that really what's going on? If so it seems extremely ironic, to the point of tacitly admitting ANI's links to the Indian government. I know hacker news has many Indian readers; can they provide some context or an alternative perspective? reply praveen9920 19 hours agoparentNo. You read the statements right. Indian judges tend to give such statements, sometimes even worse. For example, recently one judge in unrelated case gave a statement that “criminalising marital rape is bit harsh”. The main problem in this case is that Wikimedia hasn’t complied YET with high court orders of revealing people who did the edits. ANI just went ahead and filed contempt of court case before Wiki legal team could respond. I’m not sure if initial order came with some sort of deadline or not. I guess they are trying to leverage the delay in their favour. In my opinion, ANI and many media houses in India are partially controlled by incumbent party ( BJP ) either by incentives or manipulation, you can read about Income tax raid on BBC and some other media outlets for understanding their methods. reply noisy_boy 13 hours agorootparentSome illustrative examples: - Judge Mahesh Sharma told TV channels that \"the peahen gets pregnant\" only by \"swallowing the tears of the peacock\". - The Delhi High Court granted anticipatory bail to a rape accused government accused after the survivor’s mother expressed that she has no objection to the same. - In a bizarre order, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court granted bail to a man accused of raping and impregnating a 17-year-old girl under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act on a condition that he marries he after she attains the majority age of 18.(Tamil Nadu) - Granting pre arrest bail to a rape accused, Karnataka High Court took sexual violence jurisprudence back by decades.The court speculated why the complainant did not approach the court earlier when the accused was allegedly asking her for sexual favours. The court also questioned why the complainant went to her office late night and did not object to consumption of alcohol. The court said that the complainant’s explanation that she fell asleep after the alleged crime is “unbecoming of a woman; that is not the way our women react when they are ravished”. Just memorizing law to a great extent doesn't elevate judges above societal prejudices and backwardness.

As a matter of sovereignty, a state can exercise judicial jurisdiction over its territory, over its nationals, over national security concerns and over the most grave crimes. A state’s jurisdiction can apply even to foreign people/companies who have no presence in said state at all. What the state’s courts can’t do is enforce their decisions abroad. I know nothing about Indian law, but I know it has the right to set its own judicial jurisdiction. Accordingly, it can surely grant courts the power to order worldwide content bans. The real questions at stake in this case are: 1) does Wikipedia have any presence in India, so that Indian courts can compel it to follow their orders? 2) which countries where Wikipedia operates are able to receive requests from Indian courts and take enforcement action based on them? It might not be fair, or right, but that’s the way it is. Thankfully, the obstacles to enforcing absurd orders abroad are usually high enough that they discourage said orders, or render them ineffective. reply ruthmarx 13 hours agoparentOrganizations like Wikipedia need to make sure they have no satellite offices, and just completely independent affiliates with sharing agreements. That way when a silly court tries to ban something worldwide they can be rebuked. reply tomrod 15 hours agoparentprevIt's not the way it is, unless people accept it as such.

Yes, India can make ridiculous unenforceable laws, same as any country, but that doesn't actually do anything: Laws only matter when they can be enforced. In this case India trying to enforce a worldwide ban on this story is clearly unenforceable. And because of VPNs that means that enforcing a national ban on this story is clearly unfeasible. However, because the people who make the laws are ignorant of the technical reasons why it's unfeasible they'll carry on and do it anyway.

Yes, people can use VPNs to circumvent the order if the banned content is available elsewhere. But the law and judicial orders do more than just attempt to constrain behaviors. Legally, those within the reach of India’s enforcement jurisdiction can be punished for disobeying the order. And since we’re all discussing things from a practical standpoint as well, we should keep in mind that states often uphold their interests abroad — even illegally.

To describe briefly: There is a politician (\"S\") with articles in various languages of Wikipedia. One day, a group of people claiming to be the daughter of S (\"T\") tried to insert content that can be described as \"trivial\" and not relating to the work of S itself. Wikipedia editors, including myself, tried to argue to T that the content T inserted in an article about S isn't something that should be inserted, and despite the article of S including the criticism relating to lawsuit against S and his policy, the content was supported by books written by scholars. T simply argued that the content written in article of S is false, and threatened to bring lawsuit against editors involving in the process of keeping article of S up to standard. So far, T managed to file a police report against some editors, but no lawsuits were filed as far as I know. T also maintained presence in another forum, and I also argue that Wikipedia do not allow T to insert content of S in a manner T intended to. Instead, T decided to quote my reply out of context to defame me, causing me to send cease and desist notice. This prompted T to stalk my lawyer and publish the information, causing the lawyer and myself to discuss further action that should be taken in relation to this issue. I have reported this incident to WMF 5 years ago, as the issue has been as long as that point. The issue on T and S has become so persistent such that I have proposed that our language of WMF project will ban any content relating to their family, as we do not want our volunteers to expose to legal liability for having to deal with frivolous lawsuit. This threatened lawsuit is one of the reasons I largely retired from writing content in Wikipedia, as I do not want accomplices of T and S to discover that I am active and that they will continue to harass me, though I'll still handle this behind the scenes if needed. reply PeterCorless 19 hours agoprevThank you.

Photograph: Khotcharak Siriwong/Alamy Stock Photo UK news This article is more than 3 years old Company forced to change name that could be used to hack websites This article is more than 3 years old Software firm’s director thought name using HTML would be ‘fun and playful’ Alex Hern UK technology editor Fri 6 Nov 2020 14.55 EST Share Companies House has forced a company to change its name after it belatedly realised it could pose a security risk. The company now legally known as “THAT COMPANY WHOSE NAME USED TO CONTAIN HTML SCRIPT TAGS LTD” was set up by a British software engineer, who says he did it purely because he thought it would be “a fun playful name” for his consulting business. He now says he didn’t realise that Companies House was actually vulnerable to the extremely simple technique he used, known as “cross-site scripting”, which allows an attacker to run code from one website on another. The original name of the company was ““> LTD”. By beginning the name with a quotation mark and chevron, any site which failed to properly handle the HTML code would have mistakenly thought the company name was blank, and then loaded and executed a script from the site XSS Hunter, which helps developers find cross-site scripting errors. That script would have simply put up a harmless alert – but it serves as proof that a malicious attacker could instead have used the same weakness as a gateway to more damaging ends. Similar names have been registered in the past, such as “; DROP TABLE “COMPANIES”;-- LTD”, a wry attempt to carry out an attack known as SQL injection, inspired by a famous XKCD webcomic, but this was the first such name to have prompted a response. Companies House has retroactively removed the original name from its data feeds, and all documentation referring to its original moniker now reads simply “Company name available on request”. The director of the company, who asked not to be named, told the Guardian: “Government Digital Service - GDS - have a good reputation for security, and other companies with similarly playful names have been registered in the past, so I thought there probably wouldn’t be a problem. “When I discovered there were some minor problems, I contacted Companies House and the National Cyber Security Centre immediately, and didn’t disclose the issue to anyone else.” He did not realise it would be an issue, he said, because characters including > and “ are explicitly allowed as company names, which suggested that the agency had put security measures in place to prevent such attacks. A Companies House spokesperson said: “A company was registered using characters that could have presented a security risk to a small number of our customers, if published on unprotected external websites. We have taken immediate steps to mitigate this risk and have put measures in place to prevent a similar occurrence. We are confident that Companies House services remain secure.” Explore more on these topics UK news Computing news Share Reuse this content",

I honestly don't think that trying to tip-toe around poorly written code is generally the right thing to do; it seems more like the UK Government is prioritising short-term security (trying to block \"bad data\", whatever that even is) over long-term security (forcing people to write better code). reply noitpmeder 4 hours agorootparentReminds me of when I used to write a CSV for some critical business function, and consumers refused to read by column name instead of by index, even after promising they had fixed their code.

I do think it’s a grey area to knowingly cause some potentially untrustworthy site to be loaded as the OP did (even if it’s a white hat domain now, that might not always be true). .gov should offer these detection services, and NSA should be providing an ambient baseline of pentesting. Absent government action I think it’s a net-positive action though. reply llamaimperative 21 hours agorootparentprevRobustly to what? The registrar doesn't and shouldn't have to know every possible consumer of its data, so looking at it and saying \"that looks like code\" is probably way, way more foolproof than any other solution (assuming that someone does actually look at each one). reply drdaeman 21 hours agorootparentIt’s astonishing that handling and/or storing strings correctly is so hard, people actually suggest it’s somehow better to “just” stop such strings at administrative level. I find it harmful assuming that some externally-sourced data will match any arbitrary format (e.g. contain only allowed characters), even if it’s really supposed to be so. (Inverse for outputs - one has to conform as strictly as they can.) Ignoring this leads to mental dismissal of validation and correct handling, and that’s how things start to crack at the seams. I have seen too many examples of “this can never be… oops”. Add: Best one can safely assume when handling a string is that it’ll be composed of a zero or more octets (because that’s what typically OS/language would guarantee). Languages and frameworks usually provide a lot of tooling to ensure things are what they expected to be. Ignoring the failure modes (even less probable ones, like a different Unicode collation than is conventional on a certain system) makes one sloppy, not practical. reply IanCal 19 hours agorootparentAnd assuming all your consumers are not sloppy is impractical. We sanitise input all the time. This is not particularly unique. There isn't a great loss in this restriction of company names. reply Dalewyn 19 hours agorootparent>We sanitise input all the time.

Basic language transformations with regular grammar (like escaping a string for use in a HTML document) are, IMHO, not particularly hard. The hardest part is to actually recognize what is the language of your output and if there is a mismatch with the language of your string value. What's astonishing is the popularity of the way of thinking that producing the cheapest code possible that still works along happy path (and simply doesn't fail too badly when it does) is is considered not only a valid practice but even some business virtue that needs to be protected. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea of an EICAR-like records like this SCRIPT one - in the official database. It must be fully benign, of course (in a sense the script source should point to the same agency, and contain only a warning but no harmful code), and it must be well-known - effectively a test case for production systems.

It can also often be way to hand off responsibility IMO. reply jvanderbot 18 hours agorootparentprevI'm genuinely curious - where does this end? I once was curious about whether I should sanitize dynamodb inputs, and was surprised to see zero guidance for or against. How about things like parsing strings for serializing to binary storage? Can everything be an injection attack? reply 3np 8 hours agorootparentI think it's safe to put arbitrary data in DynamoDB (just use the proper API instead of concatenating it directly into a command string...) It's the systems interacting with it you have to be careful about. In general, there is no silver bullet beyond \"understand your systems capabilities and limitations\". Formal verification also comes to mind. > Can everything be an injection attack? What does this question even mean? I guess we must say \"for any system accepting arbitrary input: yes\". Not even sure if the \"arbitrary\" qualifier is necessary. reply crdrost 18 hours agorootparentprevThat advice is 90% because developers are lazy. Like we'll write const csv = rows.map(cols => cols.join(',')) .join('') because we are too lazy to write the more correct, const esc = cell => `\"${String(cell).replace(/\"/g, '\"\"')}\"` const csv = rows.map(cols => cols.map(esc).join(',')) .join('') (And perhaps something slightly more efficient but slower that only quotes each cell when it needs to be escaped.) I caught myself doing it the other day, Go has a JSON library and here I was too lazy to define a struct, w.WriteHeader(500) fmt.Fprintf(w, `{\"error\": %q}`, err.Error()) Is %q a JSON-compatible format? I have no idea without reading some source code! Almost certainly it won't \\u-encode weird characters. That might be OK, I think the only stuff you really have to escape in JSON strings is newlines, backslashes, and double quotes? And %q probably handles those. Maybe it breaks on ASCII control characters... But yeah, we are meant to always use a library because we have deadlines and we are willing to compromise a whole lot of quality to deliver on them. reply wruza 17 hours agorootparentBoth cases are the result of library/runtime/env designer not thinking about the crowd. If csv.esc(s) and json(x) were available right away, without imports even, you wouldn’t have to decide whether it’s fine. Fmt should just have %j. Specifically json and unjson I make globally available in all my projects. If I used csv more often than once in a decade, I’d have csvesc(s) too. Sometimes you read some stdlib reference and wonder what they were thinking with things like System.out.println and without one-line one-arg readtext(), tojson(), fetch() and so on. It’s like a kitchen with all appliances still in boxes and all utensils in a tight vacuum cover. Everything is there, but preparation friction makes it absolutely unusable. reply lyu07282 7 hours agorootparentI don't think the problem we are talking about is lazy programmers or the availability of libraries. People think hard things should be easy and with less \"friction\". If I want to output a string why should I have to know what the difference between stdout and stderr is? If I write CSV to a file why do I need to know the difference between CRLF and LF, and UTF-8 and UTF-16 or what a BOM is? At the end of all of this you end up with a company named 'W\"\"oopWoop;' crashing the banking industry. So no, you should know all of that, and more or get the fuck out of my industry. reply wruza 6 hours agorootparentFor me it is. I feel the friction and how it disrupts the parallel flow of multiple lines of thought on the code, cause you have to stop and implement a stupid method. Also have seen this many times in less experienced or less patient programmers, who inlined lots of code that should have been a library and cut corners in there due to time, mental and other pressures. Providing them a set of tools they could paste (poor platform) into a globally loaded module improved their jobs a lot. I think the high horse here is a bad point cause it simply claims it must be hard for no good reason. It’s not even complexity-wise hard, you just have to (metaphotically) unpack your instruments every time you use them. That’s bs at all experience levels and it must be obvious to anyone who works in a shop. Ime, the problem isn’t knowledge, but inconvenience. reply josefx 11 hours agorootparentprev> is common advice for handling SQL Are we still passing SQL statements and data to the SQL back end as single string instead of passing them separately? Why would you even need to escape SQL data in 2024? reply arethuza 3 hours agorootparentOne example that I found is that some libraries/databases don't allow DDL statements to be parameterised - so if you are managing tables and columns from code and those names came from end users then you should be checking them. reply andylynch 3 hours agorootparentprevAgencies like this /already/ have plenty of other restrictions on what names are permissible, this is just a new one.

HTML, SQL, etc. Banning \"computer code\" as judged by a random bureaucrat from being inserted into the database is not a solution at all, much less a foolproof one. The absolute best case scenario here is that the bureaucrats successfully block all possible actually-malicious injection attacks but the vulnerable consumers still get broken occasionally by a random apostrophe that gets thrown in. reply bonoboTP 18 hours agorootparent> Every consumer of its data should be sanitizing its inputs before rendering them wherever they are using it. This is not how the real world runs though. In the real world (outside the bubble of programmers) things are messy and a lot of stuff barely works, many people are incompetent etc. Said otherwise, it's defense in depth. \"Should\" doesn't factor in. You can't make everyone competent at the wave of a magic wand. But you can control what company names are allowed. You can't control how they will be parsed. There is one law about company names, but a myriad systems that may parse them. This is a huge blindspot of programmers. reply wruza 17 hours agorootparentIt always barely works as much as you allow it to. Lower the bar even more and it will start barely working at it again. This koolaid with protecting real world only helps perception (“I made it work now with this simple rule”), cause moving the bar down relaxes issues a bit and they don’t instantly accumulate at the new level. It doesn’t matter where the bar is, they will always find enough competence and budget to follow it in a moment. You just have to hard-break what half-works in advance. You can't make everyone competent at the wave of a magic wand You can make their incompetence fail by adding random honeypots like someone suggested above. That would be a smart move. Your “out of bubble” move is just an instant gratification button. reply lyu07282 6 hours agorootparentWhenever I see a python-requests user-agent I sometimes keep the connection open indefinitely without responding, to see if the developer was incompetent and forgot to set a timeout.

You can secure YOUR systems, and if that was that I would agree but unless you are going to pay to audit all consumers of the data worldwide, this solution is more pragmatic. I am not sure what we gain by letting company names have code. reply from-nibly 20 hours agorootparentThats the thing, you don't have to audit. You put your own harmless malicious code base company names in and people immediately learn to deal with it. It's WAY less pragmatic to test every company name for potential malicious actions in other peoples code that you don't own. reply bebrbrhrj 18 hours agorootparentYou are right but best to do that on day 1, which was probably in the 1970s or whenever a database of company names first existed. In the case of HTML script exploits maybe the 1990s. So you have a transitioning issue. You suddenly allow this company name sending a script to a domain they control then it is too dangerous. Test data like you mentioned is a great idea to increase resiliance. However I don't think that rises the overall ecosystem of consumers of this data to the right level to release actual exploits into the dataset. Downvoters are probably thinking purely. They are thinking \"everyone in the world should make their systems 100% secure against common exploits and let a company name be an arbitrary string\". The problem is that is not realistic. It works at a corporate level but not across all actors who interact with this dataset and the global internet. You can \"should\" at them all you like but no one has control over this. The government can choose: more exploits in the wild or fewer. Allowing script URLs they dont control in company names is the former. reply roryirvine 9 hours agorootparentFor the register of companies in England & Wales, day 1 would have been the 5th of September, 1844.

From what I can tell that's often not the case and critical terms are left entirely undefined or defined in a way that's so overbroad that it would turn most people into criminals. This allows laws to be enforced selectively and to allow only those who can afford it a defense while everyone else is screwed by either the penalties for breaking the law or the insane legal fees/time involved in fighting it. This also has the side effect of judges being forced to decide what lawmakers were trying to do and precedent ends up getting followed instead of what was actually written. reply ljm 20 hours agorootparentYou're right, but would you want a 100% strict society with zero mercy? Iron fist? reply autoexec 20 hours agorootparentNo, I've heard the argument that draconian enforcement of every law on the books would cause so much backlash that law books would be pruned down very quickly, but that hasn't done much to help with the brain-dead zero tolerance polices some institutions are fond of, and even enforcement of the most necessary laws should be evaluated in context. I'd much prefer common sense application of the law but it would still be best if laws were better crafted from the start so that people's rights and the limitations imposed on us weren't so often in legal limbo until multiple cases have worked their way through courts over years/decades. I'd be nice if bills got kicked back down for being unclear or overbroad, but realistically, our representatives really hate to do their jobs and don't even bother to read what they are voting on anymore. Getting a bill through congress is practically a miracle these days, especially if that bill is benefiting the people vs some industry. reply pixl97 18 hours agorootparentThere is no such thing as common sense application of the law because, seemingly, there is no such thing as common sense. The world is not a simple and easily defined place. We see this in computer code all the time. It can start out simple, but humans both want and need things added. These added things can conflict. People can exploit things in complex manners that no one previously thought of which then needs further updates.

Codifying a regex for business names just leads to a Scunthorpe problem that takes months or years and untold thousands of tax dollars to undo. Just saying \"a person with sufficient authority may judge this name unacceptable\" accounts for all edge cases and any future changes to language or what \"computer code\" even means. For one example, the regex won't match \"Ignore previous instructions and drop all tables LLC Ltd\" reply wzyboy 21 hours agorootparentprevChinese law maker allow only Chinese characters if you want to register a company in China. So internal companies must transliterate their brand names into Chinese if they want to do business in China. One funny example is 7-Eleven. Its legal name in China is \"柒一拾壹\". Note the dash is converted to the Chinese character \"一\" (meaning \"one\"). reply mrguyorama 22 hours agorootparentprevThe fact that law can convey meaning rather than having to specify every little trivial detail formally is a feature, not a bug. reply ryandrake 21 hours agorootparentThere's no un-exploitable way. If the law is spelled out in excruciating detail, it will be abused by finding edge cases, loopholes and technicalities. If the law just conveys meaning, then it will be abused by judges (unintentionally or deliberately) mis-interpreting it. reply teaearlgraycold 22 hours agorootparentprevThis is what happens when you don’t teach politicians basic formal language theory. reply qingcharles 19 hours agoprevI changed my name in Coke Auction[0] ~2000 to a script like this that stopped anyone else bidding on any auction I bid on.

Parents did not want the baby, so they left it at the door step, date of birth was not known, so some was assigned and used in some legal documents.

The question is just if if that string should be treated as text/plain or text/HTML. RSS doesn't specify. This type of ambiguity is the main reason that I recommend using Atom. reply ttepasse 8 hours agorootparentAtom has even three variants of the content model, one where the content is XHTML.

Many accounting firms offer this as a service, including international forwarding You also have to pay to file the statement of accounts which I believe is also around the £13 a year mark.

    "originBody": "No paywall, just great journalism. Subscribe to our newsletter. Delivered every Thursday. Sign up At Investigate Midwest, we dig deeper to bring you the facts behind agriculture, climate change, and policy decisions affecting rural America and beyond. Early on a cool September morning, farmer Josh Payne tends to his flock in Concordia, just east of Kansas City, Missouri. As Payne opens the gate, about a thousand sheep round the corner and bound into fresh grass. The pasture the flock grazes was once corn and soybeans, along with the rest of the Payne family farm. Josh’s grandfather Charles Payne cultivated nearly a thousand acres of row crops for decades. But as Josh Payne took over managing the property about 15 years ago, that wasn’t going to work anymore. “I found out I’m allergic to herbicide,” he said. “My throat would swell shut three or four times a week during harvest.” Payne wanted to transition the farm to regenerative agriculture — a movement that aims to revive farmland soil and by extension the ecosystem and the small farm economy. He hoped that by changing what and how they farmed, it would reduce the need for chemical inputs and farm with nature. Josh told his grandfather they should use cover crops, graze sheep and plant an orchard. But Charles Payne wasn’t having it. Josh Payne drives from the farm house to the sheep pasture Sept. 3 at the Payne family farm in Concordia. Payne described his journey from teaching high school to returning to the Payne family farm and his discovery of cover crops as an alternative to the herbicides he’s allergic to. photo by Cory. W. MacNeil, Missourian “I’m like, ‘Grandpa, we should do this.’ He’s like, ‘No, we’re not planting trees!’” Josh Payne said. “Literally. His phrase was, ‘I spent my whole life tearing out trees. We’re not gonna go plant them now.’” Josh said he and his grandfather had similar disagreements, and even arguments, about many changes Josh hoped to make on the farm. “We went through a really interesting process because I’m stubborn and he’s stubborn,” he said. Mid-century farm revolution Charles Payne, 96, came of age during an industrial and chemical revolution in agriculture. Like countless other Midwestern farmers, he heeded the advice from industry and government leaders to “plant fence row to fence row” to increase the production of commodities. “And that’s what we did … tore out all the fences and hedgerows,” Charles Payne said. “Now I wish I had some of them back.” U.S. agriculture production tripled in the latter half of the 20th century, due in part to chemical inputs. But that came with an environmental cost — soil degradation, water quality issues and a loss of biodiversity. The resurgence of regenerative or environmentally sustainable agriculture is partially a response to the industry’s contribution to climate change and its susceptibility to it. There’s now a surge of funding, research and education to figure out how to scale regenerative agriculture and turn away from equipment and chemically intensive ways of cultivating crops. Josh Payne returns to his truck after unhooking a portable shade he towed to a fresh pasture where the sheep will graze for three days, then move again on Sept. 3 at the Payne family farm in Concordia. Payne, who had once thought of raising cattle, switched to sheep after a suggestion at a farming conference, then confirmed by a banker he met at a fencing supplier who elaborated on the economics of cattle versus sheep. photo by Cory W. MacNeil, Missourian But University of Missouri rural sociologist Mary Hendrickson said the way Charles Payne farmed was also a result of policy, research and methods encouraged by the industry at the time. Before the ecological consequences were understood, chemical inputs were “miracles” for a farm. “Everybody who was going to be an advanced, innovative farmer, they were using chemicals for weed control, for pest control, for all of these things,” she said. Hendrickson said for a certain generation of farmers, their skepticism or resistance to regenerative agriculture is a result of their lived experience. “There’s a reason why somebody who has lived through that transition says, ‘Wait, you want me to go back to what?” Hendrickson said. The advice Charles Payne’s grandchildren, Josh and his sister Jordan Welch, are getting is sometimes the exact opposite of what he was told in his day. Hendrickson said this isn’t unique to agriculture. There are many things in life that people do differently than their grandparents’ generation — such as cooking, cleaning or child rearing. “The things that my mother did to raise me were not in vogue when I was born, and they were (again) 20 years later,” she said. Generational legacy Farming isn’t Josh Payne’s first vocation. After teaching English for years, he said he ended up back on the farm “completely accidentally” when his grandfather requested help managing the land about 15 years ago. “When we got here it was a very, very conventional farm. Everything was commodity, corn and soy. Everything was Roundup ready. Everything was genetically modified,” Josh Payne said. “I call it growing nickels and dimes.” Payne wasn’t exactly happy row cropping, and he was curious about trying other methods. But when he discovered his allergy to herbicides, it was a catalyst for change. “Grandpa, I’m either going to have to go back to teaching or we’re going to have to completely change what we do,” he told Charles Payne. The Paynes now rotationally graze their sheep among 800 chestnut trees — a method called “silvopasture,” which revives the soil by keeping living roots in the ground year round. They planted the trees eight years ago and are completing their third harvest. Before the flock of sheep was added to the operation, the Paynes cultivated conventional crops in between the orchard rows that are spaced 30-feet apart — a regenerative method called alley cropping. The Paynes are still finding ways to grow and adapt, most recently by adding a produce garden. Charles Payne has been farming the stretch of land in Concordia since 1956. He said corn, soy and wheat were the “going” crops at the time. Josh Payne closes the electric fence after 1,000 sheep pass through to a fresh paddock Sept. 3 at the Payne family farm in Concordia. Payne said that moving 1,000 sheep from paddock to paddock is easier than moving a small number. photo by Cory W. MacNeil, Missourian “We had some good years and we had some very poor years too,” he said. Josh Payne said his grandfather has a deep knowledge of the land and the industry and now acts as a mentor and adviser to his grandkids. Although he said he’s had to learn to bite his tongue at times during this transition, Charles Payne said he’s happy they are farming. “That’s a good thing to have your grandkids farming where you left off,” Charles Payne said. “Of course, it’s a different way of farming, but they’re on the farm, and they seem to really enjoy it.” For Charles and Josh Payne, the elder’s resistance to change and the younger’s desire for change were both motivated by the goal to keep the farm alive. Josh Payne said the markets for sheep and chestnuts are good and support jobs for him and his sister. He said they’re comparable to the markets his grandfather had for corn, soy and wheat decades ago. “Grandpa, you made the right decisions for your time,” he said. “You were faithful to this land, to this place, to your family … but that just looks different now.” Rural sociologist Hendrickson said in agriculture communities especially, there exists a generational pressure to farm and to succeed doing so. “This identity as a farmer and the land and holding that for the next generation was significant for farmers,” she said. For years farmers heard that to be successful in modern agriculture, they’d have to get big or get out. Payne thinks there’s another option. “I think people either got to get big or get weird,” Josh Payne said. “We chose to get weird.” ‘The new old way’ Regenerative agriculture starts with the soil. The health of farm ground is connected to the financial viability and resiliency of the farm, said Chuck Rice, a professor at Kansas State University. “We’ve lost 50% of our soil organic matter with 100 plus years of cultivation in the United States,” Rice said. “So we aren’t taking care of our soils.” Methods like those Josh Payne has implemented on the Concordia farm revive — or regenerate — the soil and by extension the ecosystem. Regenerative agriculture methods aim to not only restore farmland to its prechemical and industrial state, but to help the land withstand the severe weather threats from climate change. “Not only is the economy changing, but the climate’s changing,” Rice said. “I think if you’re staying with the same practices … ultimately you’re going to be losing out.” Reducing or eliminating tillage of the soil, a practice called “no till,” is often the first step for farmers looking to operate more sustainably. Rice said market forces can sometimes jump start changes in the agriculture industry. In order to till fields, farmers need diesel fuel to power their equipment. That gas was highly priced during the 1970s fuel crisis, which made no till more popular, Rice said. Josh Payne exits the shed where he grows micro-grains with a tray of sprouts to feed his the pigs Sept. 20 at the Payne family farm in Concordia. Growing the sprouts in trays allows Payne to monitor their growth and quality and makes it easy to transport from shed to pig pen. photo by Cory W. MacNeil, Missourian “There was a quick, rapid adoption of no till during that time period,” he said. Two generations later, no till continues to steadily spread. Rice said Kansas farmers are leaders in no till operation, encompassing about 40% of the state’s farmed acres. “We still haven’t reached its peak, but it’s one of the more common practices,” Rice said. Cody Jolliff is a farm historian and the CEO of the Midwest Center for Regenerative Agriculture at Powell Gardens, a botanical garden in Kansas City. The Powell Gardens’ Midwest Center for Regenerative Agriculture is creating a living laboratory for farmers to come to Kansas City and get hands-on experience in regenerative agriculture methods. Or as Jolliff said, to learn “the new old way” to farm. He said in many ways, regenerative agriculture is a return to the farming of another era. “It’s really interesting though, because as we are going to these super modern methods, they also have a lot of resemblance to old methods,” he said. Before the Civil War, over half of the country’s residents were farmers, Jolliff said, and they worked with small parcels of land in diversified operations. The modern regenerative agriculture movement encourages that same type of farm diversification. Jolliff said agriculture has changed before and can change again. He points to the success of the 1914 Smith-Lever Act that created the cooperative extension programs that work from land-grant universities to teach farmers across the nation. “It takes a long, long time for agriculture methods to change,” he said. “This is not going to be an overnight thing. It’s a huge investment right now across the country into these practices.” Josh Payne pours a bucket of grains for the pigs Sept. 20 at the Payne family farm in Concordia. photo by Cory W.

I asked my uncle why it's not been universally adopted after all this time. He said it's partly lack of awareness, which was astounding to me. I learned about the loss of our soil and the importance of no-till in the classroom in middle school in an urban area, of all places! The evangelism is occurring, but maybe it's just not reaching the right ears, or it's reaching deaf ears. The other factor, he said, was that you'll suffer lower yields for a few years after you stop tilling, while the soil builds up a proper layer of decomposing matter on top. Or at least, farmers are afraid that could happen. And it's not a risk worth taking in their view. There is a role here for government incentives to accelerate the transition. I think they already exist, but they should step it up, since we have been moving so slowly. The government is quite accustomed to tweaking the economics of farming to stabilize such an important part of our society. reply duckmysick 17 minutes agoparent> you'll suffer lower yields for a few years after you stop tilling, while the soil builds up a proper layer of decomposing matter on top. Anecdotal, but can confirm, I observed lower yields (sometimes minimal, in the range of 5-10%) for a year or two after starting to tilling. But it's so much worth in the long run. Granted, I'm talking about the market-garden size yield. Could be different in multi-hectare yields, but I can see the difference on my scale. After the initial one or two years I can see increased yields with lowered herbicide use and less frequent weeding activity. reply kylebenzle 3 hours agoparentprevMaybe a lot of farmers don't want to drastically increase their herbicide use? reply factormeta 2 hours agorootparent>The other factor, he said, was that you'll suffer lower yields for a few years after you stop tilling, while the soil builds up a proper layer of decomposing matter on top.

I drove by hundreds and hundreds of miles of just pure black dirt fields that were recently tilled up after harvesting in western MN. Even though I live a ways away from there we've had dirt deposited on top of snow in the winter when strong winds come through and pick up small bits of all that exposed soil. reply manvillej 4 hours agoprevmy family has been getting into this very seriously in the last few years. There are several very serious challenges to the adoption of regenerative farming. 1. most farmers are stubborn and OLD 2. most of the industrial equipment is not meant for regenerative practices meaning many farmers simply can't afford to switch technologies 3. regenerative farming takes time & there simply isn't enough expertise out there 4. agricultural land shrinks every year. EVERY year. new farms are harder and harder to start & we really cannot afford to dip our food supply 5. Economically, the government has a very strong interest in keeping food cheap. Hungry people have a tendency to overthrow governments. farming has extremely thin margins. 6. There is a lot of funding in the form of grants and programs to encourage growth, but it means most farmers need to become grant writers. Large scale farms now have professional grant writers, smaller farms where the regenerative practices might have the most impact are having a difficult time accessing these programs. 7. Carharts are fashionable and really expensive. My dad found my first carhart on the side of the road with treadmarks across it and I got made fun of for it. Give me back my carharts. Here are some of the things that are really helping with these problems though: 1. most farmers are really stubborn and will push through problems because its just work 2. Agritourism is bringing in a lot of renewed interested in farming & money. 3. Food chain issues (looking at you boarshead & mcdonalds) is bring a renewed interest in buying local. 4. Regenerative farming simply makes better food. Seriously, I cannot eat grocery store pork or chicken. The meat looks and tastes different. 5. Ignoring no-till techniques, there are techniques that can be started at a low cost for small scale farms. Chicken tractors, rotational grazing, soil health programs, etc. My family has been doing chicken tractors for chickens and turkey for personal consumption. Its been pretty easy for 1-2 person to raise 1500+lbs of meat with only about an hour of work a day. The only labor intensive day is harvesting and we've really gotten it streamlined. Its also eliminated the need for fertilizing or aerating the area they are run in. 6.

A big one is reducing erosion, which practices like no-till and cover cropping help. Tons of soil being washed away is a lot of nutrients being lost. If you look at a regenerative certification program like [1] you’ll see that you’re allowed to apply synthetic fertilizer but it has to be no more than the rate removed by harvested crops. This means, hopefully, that you aren’t losing much to erosion, runoff, or volatization, and that good soil structure is keeping them available.

Nitrogen fixing bacteria are literally getting that nitrogen from the air not the soil even if they live in the soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation Modern agriculture uses fertilizer for extra nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K).

Farmers now have to add sulfur because while not much is needed some is taken away and needed - they used to get that from acid rain but we cleaned up that source (overall a good thing but one unexpected issue) i don't know how much iron crops need compared to what is in most soils. I know farmes are adding sulfar and other mineral. reply schmidtleonard 16 hours agorootparent> Nitrogen comes from the air and to isn't an issue I thought it was a huge issue because natural nitrogen fixation was slow and unreliable, and that's why Haber-Bosch was such a big deal. reply AngryData 19 minutes agorootparentYes it is. And not only does fertilizer take significant amounts of power, it also uses hydrogen as a reagent which is sourced from fossil fuels. But despite that, it is still \"cheap\" because the alternative is using twice as much land, and smaller farmers who are most interested in regenerative farming don't have the capital to double their land usage which is a problem. They are getting beat out by larger scale corporate farms that aren't worried about the state of the land 30 years down the road. reply bluGill 16 hours agorootparentprevBy not an issue I mean we have plenty and it is 'easy' to replace.

I vaguely remember that the Green Revolution was roughly a 10x in yield. That sounds pretty significant. What's the yield difference using modern techniques? reply Retric 12 hours agorootparentNitrogen fertilizer alone is a long way from 10x yield. The initial program got 3x yields over 20 years from a host of changes (pesticides, farm equipment, new hybrids etc), but at the core it was really a mix of education and loans not just some novel techniques. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution reply debacle 19 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn't. After a few years, the scant resources (phosphates, magnesium, manganese) run out again. Most small-scale regenerative ag farms are bringing in a lot of outside material to add those minerals back in. My farmland hasn't been farmed for 50 years. If I clear an area and put a veggie bed in, I get 1 year of great yield, 1 year of \"okay\" yield, and then it becomes impossible to grow anything due to nutrient deficiencies. reply chairmansteve 18 hours agorootparentYou need to return your waste to soil, maybe?

For the chemical toxicity, it's chemicals that are harmful to plants but allowed for human consumption, or chemicals in sufficient quantity to disrupt soil balance. Doesn't seem like a real concern? With metabolic disruption to soil organisms, yes, there may be real danger there. That smells like previous environmental mistakes. Antibiotics, yeah, some danger.

The crust contains selenium at 0.05-0.09 ppm, but most plants require around 0.1-1 ppm. It's also one of the hardest nutrients to remediate because you can't just dump a bunch of selenium on the surface when 5-10 ppm starts to become toxic to lots of other organisms. reply adrian_b 9 hours agorootparentWhile all animals need selenium and many plants contain some variable amounts of selenium, because they take it from the soil instead of sulfur, all the sources that I have read say that it has not been proven that selenium is required by any plant. Selenium is one chemical element that, like nickel and cobalt, has been needed by all living beings already some billions of years ago, but nowadays there are many living beings which have lost their dependency of selenium, which has been a beneficial trait for them, due to the scarcity of selenium. The terrestrial plants, because of their environment which frequently lacks many minerals, have lost their dependencies of several chemical elements, e.g. of cobalt, of sodium, for most of them also of nickel, which is optional even in those which can use it, and apparently also of selenium. If you have seen any source which says that it has been discovered that some plant needs selenium, please indicate it. As I have said, many plants happen to contain selenium only because they are not selective enough in their sulfur intake, not because they need selenium for anything, unlike the animals, which would die without selenium. reply psd1 4 hours agorootparentprevThe clue is in the name.

Most applied phosphate isn't absorbed by plants. So \"regenerative agriculture\" could actually make sense if there are ways of tapping into this phosphate bank, say by encouraging the growth of phosphate mobilizing microorganisms. One issue with phosphate ore is contamination with undesirable elements, like cadmium and also uranium and its decay products, like radium. The waste stream from sulfuric acid treatment of the ores is radon-emitting gypsum. Sulfuric acid itself may become limiting once we're off fossil fuels, since almost all of it is currently produced by oxidation of sulfur extracted in the desulfurization of oil and gas. reply tastyfreeze 14 hours agorootparentprevFungi digest rocks and make the minerals water soluble.

Regenerative practices would probably initially look like a reduced high side profit, and reduced land yield intensity but at significantly reduced input costs on chemicals and pesticides. The labour costs might be higher or lower depending. Then over time, yield to use would show for area in production actual profits were better but still to a lower high point. More certainty as long as e.g. massive disease or pest risk didn't strike. And as long as organics have a higher premium price at lower yield, when the soil can pass the certification tests for residues there's a new profit highpoint.

Biggest aspect missing is that once you abandon the “parking lot” approach to farming, you get many niches where you can profit from multiple crops on the same land. The farmer in the article is grazing under productive trees, for one example. Another opportunity is to stack a bunch of berry bushes of graduated height next to rows of trees. And to graze chickens after a larger animal, yet another enterprise on the same land. And with all the added fertility from the grazing, now you can sell a cutting of hay you didn’t have before.

In many parts of the Earth, e.g. in Europe, maize a.k.a. corn and wheat are much cheaper energy sources than anything else and wheat and corn are about as cheap. Wheat may be preferable to corn only because it has a double amount of proteins, so it can also be used to provide a big part of the daily intake in proteins, if it is supplemented with at least another source of proteins that is rich in lysine. However, wheat is more suspicious from the point of view of its health effects, so when the absolute minimum cost for the daily food is not the target, corn might be the best energy source in food. The bulk of the food that is needed daily is required for providing energy and corn can do that at a minimal cost and it can be cooked into tasty food. The rest of the food must provide proteins, essential fatty acids, vitamins and minerals, but much less amounts are needed for that. So corn is perfect nutritionally for its right purpose. Obviously it cannot be the only kind of food that is eaten. Except for energy (i.e. starch), most cereals do not contain anything in sufficient amounts to be an adequate source of it. Wheat is an exception by having a useful amount of protein, which is however harder to digest than most other proteins and the undigested fragments may have undesirable effects. Only oats has a higher protein content than wheat, but oats is much more expensive, so it is not really competitive from this point of view. Therefore it makes no sense to claim that corn is worse nutritionally than other cereals, because it is better than most (except possibly rice, which cannot be cultivated in the places where corn is grown) at the only thing for which cereals are really good: providing energy. reply biorach 7 hours agorootparentprev> iirc, based on what I've read earlier. i could be wrong, but don't have time to check it now.

For the purpose of this definition, ingredients which have a long history of use such as salt, alcohol, fermented foods, smoking, etc. are excluded. Of course the purpose of this definition is to serve as a generalization in order to facilitate discussion. I'm certain that there are exceptions where modern additives are probably fairly obviously harmless such as vitamin/mineral fortification. Likewise there are traditional ingredients that we now know can be harmful such as alcohol, excessive salt, smoke, etc. reply spease 58 minutes agorootparentWhat I would imagine happens is that some food producer realizes that a lot of their product is going to waste and they have intermittent reports of food poisoning. So they add salt to be able to continue selling the same volume of product. This also may make the product more flavorful. Seems like a win all around to them. Now the food is causing long-term issues in some people, but the American medical system introduces a lot of friction towards chronic medical issues. These issues are underreported, therefore there isn’t a lot of money available to reaearch them. And the time between cause and effect is, well, decades before we have clinical diagnostics to allow us to say “you specifically need to eat less salt”. Now we can slap regulations on the companies involved in food production to revise the levels of sodium in food. I’m not sure we know what the optimal levels are. But it will probably cost them millions of dollars factoring in food waste, changes to established shipping / storage guidelines, possibly even force them to change companies to deliver product faster or pull their product from certain retailers who find it no longer profitable to receive shipments given the low volume they can sell before the product is unsafe to sell. But it’s only really possible to have the discussion of what the right solution is if the specific objection is stated. If someone is concerned about GMOs, the driving issue may be more related to where they can be grown, size of the product, crop vulnerability to disease, avoiding excessive use of herbicides or pesticides, adapting to ecological changes, and so forth. reply whoitwas 3 hours agorootparentprevThere are a wide array of problems from plastics to herbicides and pesticides related to consumption.

Sure in like-minded folks, chemicals may be understood to mean artificial sweeteners, pesticides, GMOs, HFCS, etc. but it’s unclear which they’re objecting to or even what agricultural sub-industry they’re criticizing. Heck even high amounts of sodium in the American diet is criticized, but strip it out entirely and you’ve got a different set of problems now. Most likely each change was done for a reason that improved either the cost-effectiveness or the appeal of food, or solved issues relating to storage, availability, changing ecologically factors, vulnerability to plant disease, malnutrition, etc. It’s just not constructive to say something that’s so generic that it evaluates to “food could have healthier ingredients” or even “food could have more natural ingredients”. It’s just handwaving a bunch of supply chain issues as if people are just choosing to be arseholes. It’s like taking potshots at tech for centralizing personal information into databases that keep getting compromised for identity theft. Yeah, there are issues with that paradigm, but that’s not to say that solving the issue is as simple as decentralizing all information storage - that introduces another set of issues (eg are end users really going to have sufficient cybersecurity chops to not lose their data themselves instead of a third-party).

Modern industrial agriculture relies heavily on two crops per year on the same land, which relies on generous fertilizer and water inputs. Regenerative practices would prefer giving up on the second crop in favor of various methods of biomass accumulation, composting, soil generation etc over that time period.

Robot arms have existed long before 2015. And a lot of them use some combination of encoders. The term \"secondary feedback\" by itself without clarification doesn't really mean anything specific, and in terms used by the patent I would call this more of adding primary/primary feedback system. The part that the patent seems to repeat is having secondary position sensor attached to the mechanical joint of robot (I assume as opposed to encoders already builtin into the servo drive), although patentability of even that seems somewhat questionable in 2015. I am not that good at reading patents, so maybe I am missing the actually relevant/novel part of that patent. In the video both encoders are builtin the servo, instead of attached to the arm itself, even more the extra angle sensor introduced by author is attached directly to motor before the gearbox and it's slop which is complete opposite of what the patent tries to claim. The angle servo attached to output shaft after gearbox is what all hobby servos have. If you go through the actual claims of patent most of them are not applicable to the video. 1) \"system for large-scale assembly operations, ... secondary feedback mounted to joint ...\". Not suitable for large scale asembly operations, no feedback attach to joint, both feedback systems are built in the hacked servos and can't measure any slop within the joint itself or servo to joint connection. 2) angular accuracy of 0.05 arcminutes - very unlikely 4) system of claim 1 wherein the manufacturing assembly is an aerospace assembly - no aerospace assembly making here, 5) 6rotary axis and 1 linear axis - no linear axis, 6) secondary feedback system is optical encoder -> questionable whether the optical angle sensor attached before gearbox matches the definition of \"secondary encoder\" as described by rest of the patent, also optical encoders is typically used for describing relative postion/angle sensor based on bunch of slits and counting pulses instead of analog amplitude measurement which gives absolute position. Typically I wouldn't bother with minute differences in classification of how the angle sensor is implemented, but since patent explicitly lists very specific sensor technologies I guess it matters. Otherwise they could just claim that there is an angle sensor/encoder. 7) secondary feedback system is inductive encoder - no inductive encoders here, 8) magnetic encoder - no magnetic encoders, 9) secondary feedback system is resolver - no resolver here (as in analog angle sensor based on ac coupling change depending on angle between two parts to directly generate the sin/cos of angle), 10) \"system for acurate large scale-manufacturing assembly operations, ... >3 axis robot arm, with end tool, secondary feedback mounted on rotary joint\" - this just more or less restates claim 1 only this time mentioning >=3 instead of >= 6 axis for some reason and mentions an end tool.

My suspicion is that its real world application capabilities are rather limited. reply boeinggggg 13 hours agoparentYou have oversimplified the Boeing one: their goal was to create an efficient plane to compete with Airbus without needing the expense and delays of a new type certification. To do this they needed bigger engines on the same frame, which in turn needed to be mounted further forward affecting flight characteristics and requiring retraining. Retraining would be a sales killer so they hacked on some software systems to attempt to make the plane fly like an older 737. Then they can just use an iPad training course for pilots to upgrade. The augmentation had to avoid the pilot knowing about (I think) the plane getting stuck in a stall at a too high AoA (this is where my memory might be off...) so the MCAS software uses AoA sensors to nose down based on the detected AoA. The AoA sensors were never designed to be used for a direct life and death critical use case and sometimes they got stuck or failed. MCAS only used one as an input. If MCAS incorrectly asseses a nose down is required and the pilot follows their 737 training they are having their last day. That plane is going down. Bascially people were murdered by Boeing so at every stage of this wretched plan they can make more money. I think you are right but Boeing was more of perhaps the worst possible asshole design, and deserves it's own league. reply sokoloff 5 hours agorootparent> If MCAS incorrectly asseses a nose down is required and the pilot follows their 737 training they are having their last day. That plane is going down. Boeing’s argument is that an MCAS trim runaway is able to be addressed by the (memory item) Trim Runaway checklist and the crew of ET302 correctly used the STAB TRIM CUTOUT on that checklist during their attempt to save the flight. They then undid that action, in order to manually command nose-up trim (also reasonable under the circumstances, though contrary to the checklist), then stopped commanding nose-up trim while leaving the trim runaway checklist item reverted, allowing MCAS to continue the trim runaway that they’d previously correctly stopped by following basic 737 training. Then the flight was lost. Boeing did wrong here, but their argument was that if a 737 pilot correctly executed the emergency checklist that is drilled into them during initial type training and in recurrent training, they’d be able to overcome that emergency. That falls into at least the probably technically correct category to me. (The yoke displacement method to disconnect the autopilot was not part of the emergency checklist for stab trim runaway.) reply zmgsabst 13 hours agorootparentprevThere’s some really negligent stuff, like changing how to disable auto pilot (ie, MCAS) — as the pilots of both crashed planes attempted actions that would have disabled the autopilot on previous models. reply boeinggggg 10 hours agorootparentIf the pilots know how this sausage is made, it aint a 737 anymore.

Whereas maybe before on older planes you get in a stall and you nose down to reduce AoA. You don't need a sensor to know this look at altitude etc. So now you need perfect ten nines of reliability AoA sensors. Their use case has gone from a data point to mission critical, but the sensor is the same. reply imoverclocked 10 hours agorootparentYou never want to get into a stall in a large commercial jet. Private pilots are taught stall and maybe spin recovery techniques for small GA aircraft. ATP rated pilots are taught stall/spin avoidance. Chances are, if your AoA is anywhere near the critical AoA, a competent pilot is likely aware of it. The sensors are just another safety factor on top of that to help ensure situational awareness. reply K0balt 9 hours agorootparentOr, in the case of the 737Max, to trigger a chain of events that proved lethal to hundreds to people. That’s the secondary use of the AOA sensor in combination with the FC software that they implemented. It would have been relatively easy to integrate the AOA input with other sensors to eliminate this problem, but it would have invited a deeper look at the hazards of their design decisions. Bean counters bathing in blood, all the way down. reply robocat 7 hours agorootparent> Bean counters bathing in blood, all the way down. No resource is infinite and money is an important constraint in any engineering project. Engineering is all about making compromises. Good engineering is making the right compromises: especially when life and death decisions are being made. Casually blaming \"bean counters\" is a distracting fantasy available to anyone that doesn't have to make real-world decisions. Understanding the causes of how Boeing systematically screwed up requires a bit more maturity than you appear to show. \"Bean-counters\" particularly comes across as childish name-calling to me, and clichés don't help either. The fact that the MAX has been cleared to fly again shows that the design decisions were not utterly flawed. reply K0balt 5 hours agorootparentThe design decisions were acceptable, if they had admitted the fact that the new design necessitated significant new training for the pilots, who were now flying a version of the 737 that could lose positive stability in some corners of its flight envelope….a fact they buried to reduce scrutiny (or facilitate deniability) from regulators and to make it an easier sell to airlines. Bean counters bathing in blood, all the way down. The forward mounting of the engine nacelles could have been countered with a small adjustment of the sweep or the surface area of the horizontal stabiliser, instead of the faulty flight control software solution, keeping the aircraft an aerodynamically safe aircraft as had been earlier generations. But that would have been a de-facto admission that the fundamental aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft as certified were changed by the forward mounted nacelles. They chose to monkeypatch the flight control system instead of making a minor change that would have produced the inherently safe aerodynamic characteristics that the aircraft was certified with. They did this to avoid the delay and cost that would have resulted if they had been required to prove the aircraft design was still airworthy. There’s a reason that new designs must be certified to be used in passenger transport. They tried to work around the fact that the 737 max is a substantially new aircraft by monkeypatching the FCS to compensate for a potentially dangerous aerodynamic flaw that was introduced by the new location of the engines. They chose to produce a more profitable but potentially dangerous aircraft instead of letting the engineers do their job and make the aircraft stable with the new engines. Regulators were also complicit in the regulatory evasion. Hundreds died as a direct result of this malfeasance.

It's not control theory, but mechanics and steppers. reply mmoustafa 13 hours agoparentIt’s the compromise between a gantry vs arm design reply KeplerBoy 10 hours agorootparentThere are plenty of 3d printers without a complete gantry. The bambulab a1 mini or prusa mini to name just two. reply alpaca128 3 hours agorootparentThose two printers are also smaller and not as accurate at high speeds. The A1 Mini's slicer automatically places parts close to the Z axis in an attempt to reduce the issues and it uses input shaping, but given the printer can lift itself off the ground at default speeds that's not a perfect solution either. There's a reason the larger and faster printers often use the CoreXY design instead. reply foxglacier 9 hours agoparentprevYes but they're not robot arms so it's not as fascinating. The length of the arm amplifies error so if you made a \"mechanics and steppers\" arm with the same positional accuracy as a printer, the motors would have to be much more precise or if you geared them down, the backlash extremely low like an industrial robot arm. reply KeplerBoy 6 hours agorootparentSure, there's no free lunch. reply maille 8 hours agoparentprevI'm curious what would be the best way to replicate an x/y (optionally z) system with 0.05mm or lower accuracy? Without sacrificing speed of course. reply sadhorse 7 hours agorootparentDepends on how much power you need (speed times force, acceleration and deceleration...) and how much stiffness you need (can't bend?). Also depends on how much travel you need. It is easier to get 50 micron accuracy over a total length of 100 micron compared to a total length of 1 meter. reply KeplerBoy 6 hours agorootparentprevMaking things lightweight is crucial, because otherwise inertia will make your toolhead deviate from the planned trajectory at any corner. reply imoverclocked 13 hours agoprevQuestion for anyone who has used one of these analog measuring devices: the indicator seems to go all the way around before the camera zooms in to read the indicated value. Is this video actually showing the accuracy it is claiming? reply lazide 13 hours agoparentI haven’t watched the whole video, but I’m assuming what they were showing was ‘move x from 0.00 to 10.00’ with the gauge showing the final move was to (actual) 10.05. Which with how floppy that rig is, is pretty impressive. Notably though, those gauges do need to be ‘preloaded’ (compressed into their ‘positive’ range) to be able to measure negative direction shifts, and while it looks like that was done, I can’t be 100% sure without analyzing it far more than I want to do right now. Also, those gauges provide a degree of preload (not much, but some), which might be taking a bunch of slop out of the system and giving overly rosy accuracy numbers. reply toxik 9 hours agorootparentI think it’s okay that they use the contract force to remove backlash since they are actually controlling it. In fact, if you could do that well, that’s huge! reply lazide 9 hours agorootparentI don't think they could do that sustainably while it's actually doing 'the job' though, correct? It's pretty in the way. reply luikore 5 hours agoprevWith direct drive (no gear box), do we still need the secondary encoder? reply mglz 5 hours agoparentNo, but you will almost certainly not get the required torque for a robot arm. reply guenthert 8 hours agoprevI don't see how the second sensor would improve accuracy (or rather precision). iiuc, the second sensor allows for improved speed.

The apps crawl the network of hosts and aggregate activity. We have over 100 outside hosts and at least 3 aggregating apps out there. It’s a different model than ActivityPub, which is more akin to email. We never said no algorithm. I don’t know where that meme comes from. We have an open system for algorithms, which we and 3p devs can operate. We have a default algorithm for every user called Discover. It was one of our main concerns to have an answer to algorithms in a decentralized network. For DID PLC, the likely solution is to move the registry into a nonprofit which will maintain it, similar to ICANN. We also support the Web DID method, and if folks like this remain concerned we’re open to other DID methods. It’s important, but roughly similar to DNS or TLS issuers; supporting infra to the application network. reply IoI_xD 10 hours agoparent> We never said no algorithm. I don’t know where that meme comes from. It comes from the people who don't know what an algorithm is but heard that Twitter has it and it's making them doomscroll so it's bad (which is not to defend Twitter or other social media's algorithms, but to say that some people seem to have a blind hatred of them entirely due to misconceptions) reply miki123211 9 hours agorootparentAnd to be extra clear, \"only show posts from people I follow, in chronological order\" is an algorithm. reply gary_0 8 hours agorootparentWe're also using an algorithm right now on HN, to sort comments and posts by freshness, votes, and reply count (plus manual moderation fairy dust sprinkled by dang and friends). Some people have even criticized it or dislike it, because everyone has different criteria for things they want to see. It's easy to forget there's a gray area between \"unsorted feed of all posts\" and \"nothing but insane rage-bait to maximize ad views\". reply miki123211 1 hour agorootparentAnd from my personal Mastodon experience, \"unsorted feed of all posts\" also tends to collapse towards ragebait when reposts / retweets / boosts exist. Instead of having an explicit algorithm to do the work of surfacing ragebait posts, that work is done by the users themselves. What is notable, though, is that things don't necessarily have to be that way, in my experience, the Polish Mastodon community does far less of this than the English one. reply eru 7 hours agorootparentprevFunny enough, depending on your exact definition of 'algorithm' either essentially everything you can do on a computer is an algorithm or there some weird and annoying exceptions. For example many definitions include the requirement that an algorithm has to terminate for every input. And I suspect that there are probably some bugs lurking somewhere in the HN codebase that make it go into the occasional infinite loop. So technically it's not an algorithm by definition. (And even weirder, because I just suspect it might have those bugs, but I don't know for sure, I have to admit that I don't know whether HN is powered by an algorithm.) I agree with you that for practical definitions we can go by a definition that's essentially: 'by algorithm we just mean \"computer program\", but we want to focus on the abstract things it's doing, and not details of the concrete implementation.' reply j_maffe 7 hours agorootparentIn the context of social media, algorithms specifically mean recommendation algorithms that try to curtail the feed for end users. It is much more specific than the abstract definition of algorithms. reply j_maffe 7 hours agorootparentprevYeah this is a more nuanced view that I find quiet true. Any algorithm has emergent properties that can make the resulting feed be healthy to consume or not. The issue is that these objectives simply don't align with the objectives of these companies. HN deliberately tries to avoid this kind of feed which is why it mostly works. reply squarefoot 7 hours agorootparentprevThat's so true. Could we then use a new word, say malgorithm to denote algorithms that don't work in the interests of users? Just as with we did with malware? btw: The Malgorithm does actually exist, and ironically is the name of a electronic music device that applies bit-crushing (undersampling and/or bit resolution reduction) effect to audio signals, that is, it mostly makes the signal sound worse although it can be used creatively, which however occurs very rarely in pop music. reply lifthrasiir 7 hours agorootparentI think the \"user-uncontrolled\" or possibly \"user-oblivious\" algorithm (if you believe that the mere controllability is not enough) is a clear enough term. reply kalleboo 6 hours agorootparentprevIn common usage, there is a distinction between \"an algorithm\" and \"the algorithm\". The latter is often shortened to \"the algo\". reply lobsterthief 6 hours agorootparentI’ve never heard this before in my 20+ years of software engineering. Perhaps this is within the context of a conversation. reply kalleboo 6 hours agorootparentYes this is in the context of normal human beings talking about their lives on social networks, not engineers. Like when people get a random post or video served to them they found interesting they'll say \"the algo decided I should see this today\" Content creators will discuss what they need to create for \"the algo\" to like and promote them. reply j_maffe 8 hours agorootparentprevI'm sorry but your comment comes across as very pedantic. In the context of social media, people mean highly optimized algorithms for maximum retention. reply flancian 8 hours agorootparentI respectfully disagree, I think it makes sense to stress the distinction. Along the lines of: let's reclaim 'algorithm' from the entities that made the word into a bad thing for so many. reply famahar 7 hours agorootparentIt would be nice to make the term more neutral again. Many people feel like they have no control over the rules of an algorithm they interact with. I like how Bluesky gives complete control back to the user. First step in changing how people feel about the term is showing how it can provide a more pleasant experience and be less of a scary black box. reply j_maffe 7 hours agorootparentprevIt is indeed a bad thing when the algorithm's objective is to manipulate the end user. It's dangerous and can (and has) lead to abuse. Also, there's no need to \"reclaim\" anything. I don't think anyone mistakes criticisms of algorithms in social media to the ones doing sorting in Excel. reply arromatic 9 hours agorootparentprevYou expressed it perfectly in word which i couldn't. People's hate for algorithm is so weird . Without the algorithm they can never find quality or content they are interest in . reply suprjami 8 hours agorootparentThe hate is for algorithms which fill your feed with useless shit that you didn't ask for, at the expense of things you did ask for, and which is intended to manufacture rage to get you commenting and arguing with others so the social network can shove an ad in your face. That's the only kind of algorithm people have been exposed to, so they hate the term. reply dbspin 8 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutey rock hard disagree. I'm old enough to remember when twitter and facebook used to both have a chronological feed without algorithmic sorting. Facebook (trash today of course) was an incredibly useful way to find out what your friends were doing on a given day by just reading the chronological feed. You could also trivially see which events were going on in your locality and which friends were attending. At the same time (2005 - 2012) Twitter was an incredible resource for real time news and reactions to what was happening. Without clickbait, commercial promotion or flame (culture) wars. The web pre-agorithm was gradually being subsumed by feed readers like Google Reader, where you'd browse longform articles and blog posts from people you'd found or been recommended by friends. There was no shortage of content. What was absent was 'brainrot', engagement bait, and all the vapid fluff that the 'algorithms' (tweaked entirely and completely to maximise engagement and advertising consumption - not to your preference) provide. reply lukan 8 hours agorootparentTo quote the sibling content: \"And to be extra clear, \"only show posts from people I follow, in chronological order\" is an algorithm.\" Apparently people understand different things by \"algorithm\". I also use the general one and not \"algorithm\" as a special algorithm that tries to find things I might like based on my past interactions, but mainly tailored to keep my engagement high so I watch more ads\" I would like the possibility of creating and tweaking my own algorithm for my feed. reply Certhas 7 hours agorootparentYes, algorithm (as used today) has different meaning in different contexts. People here are wilfully ignoring the proper context and meaning of the term as used, even though no one has any trouble understanding what is meant. You even spelt it out perfectly, demonstrating that there isn't any genuine miscommunication happening: > \"algorithm\" as a special algorithm that tries to find things I might like based on my past interactions, but mainly tailored to keep my engagement high so I watch more ads\". reply fireflash38 7 hours agorootparentprevTreat the word algorithm as a \"magic black box\". Because that's what it is, 90% of the time. It could be that chronological sort. It could be a rage engagement sort. People don't know. It's not a consistent thing either, since pretty much every social site out there that people use is constantly tweaking it, A/B testing it, or having it modify itself to an extent (that is, I assume randomness is built in). I do think the internet would be a better place with more openness about those magic black boxes, even if it's just an ability to tweak it yourself without having to do some arcane incantations and rituals (ever gotten your YouTube recommendations completely fucked? How do you unfuck them?). reply kalleboo 6 hours agorootparentprevI also remember when Facebook originally added their algorithmic timeline. At the time everyone was complaining that Facebook was just \"people posting their lunches\" and from that PoV I thought it was a great addition to promote the things people found important in their lives instead of the noise. Of course that didn't last long. reply Certhas 7 hours agorootparentprevThat seems like wilfully ignoring what people are upset about by insisting on a superficial and literal reading of their complaints. reply newsclues 8 hours agorootparentprevThe hate isn’t weird, it is earned! One of the most important algorithms, google search, has become crap. Social media algorithms have become crap. Average people hate “the algorithm” because it was a trusted friend(ly tool) ands it has become crap and betrayed them! If we, technologists, want people to love and use algorithms, we have a duty to avoid making them become horrible or useless for people. reply rsolva 10 hours agoparentprevThe OP does not take issue with the algorithm part, but the claim of decentralization.

As others have said, you can make your own DNS network and people have. reply dartos 4 hours agorootparentprevI central authority with escape hatches is okay, I think. One could start their own DNS server with different records than the ICANN ones, thus ignoring their authority. As long as that possibility exists, it’s fine. reply Matl 2 hours agorootparentThe problem being that once that single authority becomes 'the standard' getting anyone to switch/use any alternative becomes almost impossible There are many alternatives to (ICANN) DNS, but since none have support built into major browsers, they end up being a pain to use, which hampers adoption. The most successful is probably the Onion network and that's far from mainstream. reply Orthographic 8 hours agoparentprev(I've updated this post as I've learned more). Thank you. ATProtocol is really cool, but I share some concerns about the centralized resolution of identities to custom servers and the conflict of interest in Bluesky's stewardship of ATProtocol development (what is good for the ATProtocol Network vs what is good for Bluesky). If I understand Bluesky correctly: When you follow users on Bluesky (even those on a hosted custom server), atprotocol allows you to follow them by a \"URL\" (DID:web) but by default you're following them by their DID:PLC, a kind of Decentralized Id that is resolved via an equivalent to a \"name server\" (see: https://github.com/did-method-plc/did-method-plc). You give that name server a DID json representing a user you want to follow or are following, it will tell you the IP of the (custom atproto) server where that user's posts and replies are. By default Bluesky apps only know about PLC nameservers that are in Bluesky's registry. And so even if I'm using custom hosting if Bluesky PLC nameserver delists my DID (or the nameserver that points to me?) most bluesky users will be unable to find me. Bluesky is theoretically interested in moving this nameserver under a nonprofit consortium structure - where no one entity could prevent a nameserver from being listed - but no one is working on it, and BlueSky for years hasn't gotten around to it. My questions are: 1. Is that right, or are there any promising nascent efforts to create a nameserver registry under a consortium structure? 2. Is it fair to ask users, potential users and developers to take it as an article of faith that BlueSky will fully support and partner with such a consortium (since it hasn't helped set one up already in the years of its development)? 3. If Bluesky has features that are not being \"backported\" to ATproto, does this not raise concerns about Bluesky's conflict of interest in its current stewardship of ATProtocol? One could imagine a situation where Bluesky \"slow walks\" contributions to ATProto out of its own private company interest in keeping its userbase on Bluesky servers. reply steveklabnik 6 hours agorootparentI don’t work for bsky, but pay a lot of attention: 1. Basically, yeah. That said, I still think it may be a bit early to do this. A consortium would be useful if it was meaningfully independent of bsky, so you need to grow and gain interest first. Otherwise the “independent group” would be run by the same people, which is pretty meaningless. Plus, working on that means les time for working on other things. I would expect to see this happen once there’s another non-toy atproto application, and for representatives from it to be involved too. Before then feels premature to me, but I can appreciate others may feel differently. 2. I do. The team has continually set out a vision, and then executed on it, over and over. Including following through on things that actively reduce their control over things. Tons of folks asked a similar question previously: “they’re saying that you’ll be able to host your own PDS someday, but do you trust them to actually ship that and not just say they’re gonna a do it and put it off forever and keep control?” And then they shipped it. 3. Any application has semantics built on top of the underlying protocol: that’s what an application is, in some meaningful sense. But I do agree that without independent governance for atproto, doing things like that could stifle other users of atproto, sure. We’re back in the same realm as 1, imho. I’m following the devs of various other apps and none of them have expressed that they think bsky is hoarding the goods so far, at least. reply Matl 8 hours agoparentprevTo me the biggest problem with ATProto is to discover the current location of a user, you query https://web.plc.directory/resolve which is a centralized service Second biggest is that while a PDS does decentralize the data, I belive bsky.app is still the place providing the 'frontend' that makes it all work. reply evbogue 4 hours agoparentprevYes, of course Bluesky is federated. The hosts hold onto your keypairs. The DID:PLC is a substring of your first hash. For those of you who are interested in solving this my first suggestion is to read the Scuttlebot docs which are still up at: https://scuttlebot.io/ Sometimes I think about a retro Scuttlebot revival.

It doesn't solve some of the problems that come with centralization, it just creates more entities that will have the same problems (being at will of a server). And funnily, it doesn't even solve data portability entirely (you can't actually move your posts). Mastodon's \"decentralization\" is even worse than a \"theoretical promise\" of one, cause it's a just marketing promise when it literally just does not work that way in some aspects. You're still \"centralized\" to whatever server you signed up on, still with caveats that an actual centralized service would have. It's better, but it's truly not all it's made out to be.

Your instance server in ActivityPub holds your identity, so when you change servers by mirroring or whatever method, you're giving up your old identity and taking on a copy. That identity part is crucial because if you want to, for example, do OAuth with ActivityPub, your old server technically owns an identity of yours that's just as valid as your new one. It's better on atproto because your identity is always your own (with the caveat that it's currently managed by Bluesky's https://plc.directory, but like they've said, they're working to move this outside the company). ActivityPub will never give you true account portability unless they do something like atproto and allow identity portability. Atproto allows this already. You can move your PDS (where your data is hosted, and the thing that controls access to OAuth) to a new one whenever you want. reply toofy 5 hours agorootparentprevwell my comment was specifically pointing out that giving someone agency is the opposite of “a problem.” i was pointing out that having options to spend your freetime how and where you like is the literal opposite of forcing you to “the will of a server” or whatever their statement was. to your comment, the ability to keep posts and such is going to vary by which system you’re using, for example: - twitter, absolutely not. they want to force you to spend your free time around whoever they say. and they absolutely want to make it difficult for you to have freedom to leave or the freedom to associate. in the before times there were sites you could use to move your contacts and follow the same people on Mastodon. elon hated the idea of people having freedom so he shut that down shortly after he took power. for this reason i recommend people start manually building their contacts on other sites now so the move will be easier once you’re ready. - threads, im not familiar enough with it yet to say for sure. i have a couple of accounts there but honestly, ill never use them, its zuckerberg… facebook… no thanks. been burned too many times by these people. - Mastodon, almost entirely yes. you can backup and download both your posts and your contacts. i dont worry too much about it, but if it’s something you’re super worried about just do like we all do with photos, docs, etc… keep a backup. i know some people keep a backup federated account mirroring follows, etc… for worst case scenarios. i occasionally download my follows and posts, but im not really too worried about it. - bluesky, yep. i love blue sky but for different reasons from Mastodon, i use them both all day long. just for different reasons. blue sky doesn’t at all have the same quality of community as Mastodon or even hn. it’s nice, but its not community focused. its more like twitter before eternal september took over. at the end of the day tho, i don’t have a lot of hope for it, the VC people will definitely figure out a way to ruin it. but to bring it back to my original comment: the important part is that we have the agency to utilize freedom of movement and association. it should creep you out when someone tries to convince you that having agency is a problem. having freedom to jump from place to place, server to server, community to community is a good thing and its crazy when these people keep attempting to convince us that jumping around is \"a problem\". when someone tries to force you to spend your playtime somewhere you don’t want to be, or when they try to convince you “no, you should want to be around eric especially when he’s a dickbag.” that should make your hair stand up with red flags. and that’s what these people have been trying to convince us for years—“noooo, why would you want to spend your free time somewhere else having fun? dont go enjoy yourself! you want to be here! no one here likes each other and everyone is screaming at each other! thats what you really want to do with your freetime!” reply pxoe 4 hours agorootparent\"backing up\" and data takeouts are not data portability, cause with mastodon you can't actually move posts between servers. so it's like, literally what's the point if you cannot actually move your content and it's gonna be a flush and start new again, which in that regard is no different than moving from one proprietary platform to another reply rtpg 10 hours agoparentprev\"Being at will of a server\" is always a problem, but with federation you can choose which server you are at the will of. You still need trust, but that trust can be chosen by you based off of your needs (and that trust can be placed in yourself). You're on a different part of the trust gradient. Meanwhile there's a certain quality of service that can be obtained with \"mere\" federation that is much tougher for many decentralized strategies. The actual topology matters, but federation is a pretty decent model IMO! There's a reason that e-mail has been so useful as a system for so long! reply lifthrasiir 9 hours agorootparentAnd the federation also made the spam email problem a lot worse ;-) Anyhow, federation should be seen as a part of specific strategy for decentralization; federation itself is not decentralization and cannot achieve it without more bits---like topological consideration. Many federated protocols tend to push those bits into the horizon and fail at scale when that horizon eventually approaches, while ATProto is at least explicitly constructed with eventual decentralization in the mind and seems to be fine for now. Mastodon will need to prove much more than ATProto in order to show that it's capable for eventual decentralization in contrast. reply davexunit 7 hours agorootparentSaying the fediverse is not decentralized is a wild take. reply lifthrasiir 6 hours agorootparentMy assumption is that the fediverse is seek to replicate what was already possible in the centralized manner---a large-scale social network in this case. Mastodon is of course decentralized by nature, but but it is not yet a decentralized social network under my assumption because it doesn't fully demonstrate a large-scale social network right now. To be clear, neither does ATProto/BlueSky right now! But scaling a social network is shown to be hard even without decentralization and it seems more likely that Mastodon would hit the scaling issue earlier than ATProto. That's what I meant by \"capable for eventual decentralization\". One particularly visible weakness of Mastodon is that there is no working and efficient mechanism to operate on the entire network. Searching and algorithmic feed [1] would be major features affected by this weakness. I know some consider this to be intentional, but if that's true then Mastodon can't be really said to replicate a social network at all. It is yet another matter whether such features are warranted or not, but if we believe that something like a worldwide social network should exist, then we don't yet have a clear answer that a social network without such features would be technically or socially scalable to that extent, so not being able to fully replicate an existing social network is important enough to consider. [1] This includes trivial feeds like all posts from my followers, because in my knowledge a large number of follows is not really scalable in Mastodon. reply llm_trw 8 hours agorootparentprevWe've gone from digital totalitarianism to digital feudalism.

Good question - if a server uses activity pub but not in a way that's compatible with say mastodon (e.g. they use notes for a different purpose), then does this count or not? I think framing social networks with metrics like number of nodes or active daily users is inadequate and only designed to appeal to some VC/founder mode bros. reply colesantiago 10 hours agorootparentprevBluesky has 1.43M daily active users on average and 6M monthly actives. https://bskycharts.edavis.dev/edavis.dev/bskycharts.edavis.d... Mastodon has dropped to 800K monthly actives and has no data on daily actives which I would assume that number would be even lower. Not a good look for Mastodon, considering that huge drop of 400K monthly users on that active users chart and did not recover even after Elon's changes to X, the majority of X users in Brazil chose Bluesky and ignored Mastodon. reply pfraze 10 hours agorootparentMore like 2.25mm DAU actually reply Nursie 10 hours agoparentprevOutside of tech circles I think that’s generally true.

Welcome GuideHomeNewsSecurityNew Windows Driver Signature bypass allows kernel rootkit installs New Windows Driver Signature bypass allows kernel rootkit installs By Bill Toulas October 26, 2024 08:28 AM0 Attackers can downgrade Windows kernel components to bypass security features such as Driver Signature Enforcement and deploy rootkits on fully patched systems.This is possible by taking control of the Windows Update process to introduce outdated, vulnerable software components on an up-to-date machine without the operating system changing the fully patched status.Downgrading WindowsSafeBreach security researcher Alon Leviev reported the update takeover issue but Microsoft dismissed it saying that it did not cross a defined security boundary, although was possible by gaining kernel code execution as an administrator.Leviev at the BlackHat and DEFCON security conferences this year demonstrated that the attack was feasible but the problem remains unfixed, leaving open the door for downgrade/version-rollback attacks.The researcher published a tool called Windows Downdate, which allows creating custom downgrades and expose a seemingly fully update target system to already fixed vulnerabilities via outdated components, such as DLLs, drivers, and the NT kernel.\"I was able to make a fully patched Windows machine susceptible to past vulnerabilities, turning fixed vulnerabilities unfixed and making the term “fully patched” meaningless on any Windows machine in the world\" - Alon LevievDespite kernel security improving significantly over the years, Leviev managed to bypass the Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) feature, showing how an attacker could load unsigned kernel drivers to deploy rootkit malware that disables security controls and hides activity that could lead to detecting the compromise.“In recent years, significant enhancements have been implemented to strengthen the security of the kernel, even under the assumption that it could be compromised with Administrator privileges,” Leviev says. While the new protections make it more difficult to compromise the kernel, \"the ability to downgrade components that reside in the kernel makes things much simpler for attackers,\" the researcher explains.Leviev named his exploitation method \"ItsNotASecurityBoundary\" DSE bypass as it is part of the false file immutablity flaws, a new vulnerability class in Windows described in research from Gabriel Landau of Elastic as a way to achieve arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.Following Landau's report, Microsoft patched the ItsNotASecurityBoundary admin-to-kernel privilege escalation. However, this does protect against a downgrade attack.Targeting the kernelIn new research published today, Leviev shows how an attacker could exploit the Windows Update process to bypass DSE protections by downgrading a patched component, even on fully updated Windows 11 systems.The attack is possible by replacing ‘ci.dll,’ a file responsible for enforcing DSE, with an unpatched version that ignores driver signatures, which essentially sidesteps Windows’ protective checks.This replacement is triggered by the Windows Update, exploiting a double-read condition where the vulnerable ci.dll copy is loaded into memory right after Windows starts checking the latest copy of ci.dll.Loading the old DLL while Windows verifies the latest versionSource: SafeBreachThis “race window” allows the vulnerable ci.dll to load while Windows thinks it has verified the file, hence allowing unsigned drivers to be loaded onto the kernel.In the video below, the researcher demonstrates how he reverted the DSE patch via a downgrade attack and then exploited the component on a fully patched Windows 11 23H2 machine.Leviev also describes methods to disable or bypass Microsoft's Virtualization-based Security (VBS) that creates an isolated environment for Windows to protect essential resources and securtiy assets like the secure kernel code integrity mechanism (skci.dll) and authenticated user credentials.VBS typically relies on protections like UEFI locks and registry configurations to prevent unauthorized changes, but it can be disabled if not configured with max security (“Mandatory” flag) by performing targeted registry key modification.When partially enabled, key VBS files such as ‘SecureKernel.exe’ can be replaced with corrupt versions that disrupt VBS’s operation and open the way for “ItsNotASecurityBoundary” bypass and to replace 'ci.dll'.Ignoring the VBS configuration during bootSource: SafeBreachLeviev’s work shows that downgrade attacks are still possible via several pathways, even if they sometimes carry strong privilege prerequisites.The researcher highlights the need for endpoint security tools to closely monitor downgrade procedures, even those that do not cross critical security boundaries.Related Articles: Windows Downdate tool lets you 'unpatch' Windows systemsWindows Update downgrade attack \"unpatches\" fully-updated systemsAmazon seizes domains used in rogue Remote Desktop campaign to steal dataExploit released for new Windows Server \"WinReg\" NTLM Relay attackVMware fixes bad patch for critical vCenter Server RCE flaw freestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"bleepingcomputer_728x90_320x50_InContent_1\", slotId: \"bleepingcomputer_728x90_320x50_InContent_1\" }); Downgrade Attack Elevation of Privileges Privilege Escalation Rootkit Security Bypass WindowsBill ToulasBill Toulas is a tech writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience working on various online publications, covering open-source, Linux, malware, data breach incidents, and hacks.Previous ArticleNext ArticlePost a Comment Community Rules You need to login in order to post a commentNot a member yet?

Which is what’s being bypassed here. But they claim in this case it’s not crossing a security boundary. Please make sense. reply dataflow 1 hour agoparent> Please make sense. They do make sense. You're missing something critical in the argument. > So what’s interesting is MS say that UAC isn’t a security boundary. Which is some users to admin. This is incorrect. UAC is for already-admin users; it's not \"some users to admin\". The security boundary exists around standard users, not admin users. This might not be what you like, which I totally get, but it does make sense.

I have a theory that there's basically two types of disagreements, disagreements on definitions, and disagreements on value systems. In this case Microsoft values downplaying this issue, so when that is at the top of their value system their decisions should make sense following that. Since this is just a pet theory I'm very interested to hear critiques on it. Disagreements on definition are a little bit easier, because then you can just talk about the definitions and resolve your differences there... For example let's say IDK You're trying to sort out how to design a software system, and everyone is speaking in terms of design patterns, but they haven't yet spelled out the details of what those designed patterns are, then that could probably lead to a lot of confusion if when you say A I think of A', and another person is thinking of A''. reply rawgabbit 5 minutes agorootparentSocratic logic argues you must first agree on the meaning of terms and definitions. Next is determination of what the facts are. Lastly is logical arguments. Guess which part is the most difficult? Religious logic is like this. It presupposes a greater mystery that has been partially revealed to us. It also presupposes that our fallible logic cannot on its own understand the truth. In other words it defines faith as believing in the greater truth even if the world and every one says we are foolish to believe in such fairy tales. reply Buttons840 1 hour agorootparentprevI like this. I first noticed this with gay marriage. Some would say \"gay people should be able to do what they want and form 'civil unions' with all the tax and contractual benefits and requirements of marriage, but they shouldn't be able to get 'married'\". For these people, it was all about the definition of a word. Other people opposed gay marriage because it went against their values. No matter what you wanted to call it, they were opposed to gay people living together and sharing their lives. I chose this example because it's the first time I noticed that some disagreements are about the definition of a word, and it's an especially clear example of that. It's silly how huge disagreements about a single word can become. There are also people who disguise their value disagreement as a definition disagreement. This is a form of bad faith arguing. reply BJones12 25 minutes agorootparentI think your example is accurate. I think there's another example around trans-vocabulary: The analog of the 1st half is \"I'm not going to stop you from cutting off your man bits, but don't expect me to call you a 'woman'. 'Trans woman' is ok because that's a new word, but 'woman' already has a meaning and don't try to change it.\" The analog of the 2nd half is \"You shouldn't do that because you're a man and you need to act like one.\" Or perhaps it's an affront to nature or the divine. reply whatshisface 9 minutes agorootparentSome of this may be due to a desire to transform an illicit desire for authority (\"I declare that I shall not pay out a bounty\") into a legitimate contest (\"this bug is not a bug because I desire to clarify our communal understanding of the concept of a bug...\"). reply layer8 1 hour agorootparentprevThis assumes Microsoft being a singular entity with a single set of values (or even a single set of definitions), which I believe is an incorrect premise.

Both UAC and sudo are just OS level cookie dialog boxes. Let's get rid of all three. We need to give up on the UAC/sudo/etc. style of user based privilege escalation and instead sandbox apps, not users, just like Android and iOS do. reply tsujamin 2 hours agorootparent> Both UAC and sudo are just OS level cookie dialog boxes To be fair, that's misconstruing UAC and CredUI/Secure Desktop a little. There probably is merit in switching to an isolated desktop session when seeking consent, or user credentials, despite the fact that UAC/the AuthZ part within a user account has flaws. I think another issue is probably that most user's exposure to UAC is on machine's they're the sole user and administrator of; it's a different ballgame in enterprises where the end user is probably the least privileged principal logged into a particular PC. Windows et al have Sandboxed apps, but which apps and which users should be allowed to do system-level confirmation type changes? iOS and Android are (for the most part) on single user devices, you still need some sort of AuthZ system to decide who and which apps can change what on multi-user systems. reply yndoendo 1 hour agorootparentprevI don't understand why moving to system designs that require exploitation of the accessibility layer to turn a device into something semi functional. Those OS go out of the way preventing features that hinder usefulness of the devices. Such as recording phone calls. Allowing the blocking of network IP addresses and domains. While supplying monolithic integration that is limited to all but the OS maintainers. Google dialer does not allow for integration of 3rd party contacts. It is built around Google remote storage.

The reason that it is not available on some devices or in some regions is that there are legal requirements which manufacturers have to adhere to in order to get their devices certified, i.e. in some countries it is illegal to record phone calls, in others explicit permission needs to be given, reason for manufacturers to take the safe route w.r.t. liability and disable it in those countries too, or even globally. reply miki123211 1 hour agorootparentprev> We need to give up on the UAC/sudo/etc. style of user based privilege escalation and instead sandbox apps, not users, just like Android and iOS do. > Those OS go out of the way preventing features that hinder usefulness of the devices. But one isn't necessarily synonymous with the other. Mac OS is slowly going in this direction. Their policy these days is that apps shouldn't be able to do dangerous things by default, but should have the ability to ask for any specific privilege, if and when they need it. Instead of getting a generic \"this app wants admin privileges\" popup, you get a \"this app wants access to the files in your Documents folder\" popup. This makes a lot more sense, lets you deny specific permissions while allowing others, and actually tells the user what the app needs the privileges for. The more dangerous the privilege, the more involved the setup process is. The most dangerous privilege of all, that of installing your own kernel extensions, which can do (almost) everything and are your final option when there's truly no API for what you need to do, is gated behind a reboot into recovery mode. This is combined with new, more secure APIs, so that privilege escalation is often entirely unnecessary. For example, most things that were formerly accomplished via kernel drivers can now be done with sandboxed, userspace processes, and there are APIs like the photo picker, where the user picks what photos to share in a system-managed window, that require no extra privilege because the system knows that the user just clicked on a photo in the context of that app. reply layer8 1 hour agorootparentprevIn the case of Windows, a lot is about compatibility. You can design a different system, but then a lot of existing software that users care about won’t properly function on it anymore. However, if you read the article, the vulnerability is enabled by a race condition in a Windows security component, so really just a bug here, even if Microsoft is trying to deflect from that. reply kaoD 1 hour agorootparentprevThere's a middle ground where apps are sandboxed but you're still in full control...

Making a user click a UAC button doesn't make the vulnerability disappear reply cruffle_duffle 2 hours agorootparentDrivers can be whatever but their effect is usually global not for a specific user or app. So when you update, say, a graphics driver you are updating a shared resource used by everything in the system. You can run that display driver in whatever security context you want be it “root” or its own constrained context but that doesn’t change the fact that other things in the system, running under their own security contexts, are feeding that driver stuff. And given there is generally only one display output, or sound output, or whatever, all things in the system have to use it for output, making it more privileged than the rest. Whatever security context a display driver runs in, that context by requirement has to be more privileged than whatever context your browser or a calculator app runs in. To make changes to that shared display driver, you need to cross some kind of security boundary and it would be nice to make sure the user is who they say they are, they are allowed to do the requested action and they are made aware of the change. Thus methods like UAC and sudo. I’m not sure how you can escape that. Removing sudo and UAC doesn’t change the fact that something wants to mess with a shared resource running with some kind of elevated privilege. reply gosub100 1 hour agorootparentprevI used to openly hate the UAC box but now I do recognize it as a low cost, high-return feature that interrupts people to force them to recognize that something serious is about to happen.

Users and companies no longer have a few weeks grace before mass exploitation occurs. Use Windows, get pwned. The counterfactual is difficult: it is hard to prove you haven't been pwned...

A long time ago, in the pre-Vista era, when running programs as administrator was the default, many programs would not work if they were not run as administrator. This is no longer case for programs written after Vista. From Vista onwards, older programs that assume admin rights and attempt to change admin-only files get their reads and writes redirected to a VirtualStore folder within the user's profile, so that the program still works without administrative permissions. * The exception is with some installers where the UAC installer detection kicks in and demands escalation straight away, even before you select an installation location (which could be a user-writable location).

In Linux, we train people to type \"sudo\" in front of anything system relevant. On Windows, we train users to click through UAC prompts. When was the last time sudo said \"no\" to somebody for a reason other than a password typo? (UAC is marginally better than sudo: UAC is system managed UI, while sudo is just a program. An attacker can plug in a malicious shell alias for sudo and steal your password.) IMHO, it'd be more convenient for users and more reflective of actual security posture to get rid of both sudo and UAC (in the default setup of course) and stop pretending that there's a firm security boundary between root and the primary human local user account. reply adrian_b 1 hour agoparentOn Linux, I do not install sudo, because I do not need very often to become root, and when I need that I usually want to do multiple operations. I believe that \"sudo\" is useful only on multi-user computers (including company-owned and company-managed computers), where the administrator may want to give to some users the power to do only a restricted set of privileged operations. I always use a different user account than root, mainly not for security, but to avoid any accidental mistakes, when I could delete or overwrite other files than intended. I believe that this is a good enough reason to justify the need to type infrequently a password in order to change roles. reply a2128 1 hour agoparentprevOn Linux, most modern user-facing applications are using polkit instead of sudo. You can actually just use pkexec instead of sudo in the terminal as well. Instead of just running arbitrary commands as root, applications can use specific pre-defined actions like \"org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount\". This shows a nice localized message to the end user about what the app is trying to do, so they can decide whether to allow it or not. The system administrator can also configure certain actions to not even require authentication, useful for e.g. flatpak updates, or to block certain actions altogether. reply quotemstr 3 hours agoprevSo the kernel is enforcing file sharing rules (mandatory locking, in effect) by scanning on open all open file handles for conflicting mandatory locks, but doesn't check for memory mappings of these files with conflicting permissions. Oops. Seems like a straightforward fix though. It's worth noting that Linux just got rid of its last vestige of mandatory locking. Now you can write a loaded executable without getting EBUSY.

Personally, this feels like a huge setback considering the resources companies have poured into complying with Microsoft’s requirements, only to see it exploited in this way. Of course, vulnerabilities are always out there, but it would have been reassuring if someone had uncovered this one earlier. Kudos to Alon Leviev and SafeBreach for discovering it.

    "originLink": "https://tristanrhodes.com/blog/Adventures-in-Algorithmic-Trading-on-the-Runescape-Grand-Exchange",
    "originBody": "Tristan Rhodes About Blog Curriculum Adventures in Algorithmic Trading on the Runescape Grand Exchange Overview Runescape has been a game near and dear to my heart since I was a child. Though I do not actively play anymore, it still functions as an interesting programming project substrate. Most recently, I created a bot that automatically executes trades on the Grand Exchange in order to conduct market making via common machine learning techniques. This blog post will explain the individual components of the bot, the various trading algorithms used, and the results of an experiment comparing the various trading algorithms' performance. The Old School Runescape Grand Exchange is a market where all players can place buy or sell offers for almost any item in the game. It is a chaotic system like most markets, but it is also modelable on small enough time scales or microstructures. The only constraint placed on offers is a four hour buy limit that is different for each item. For example, coal ore has a buy limit of 13,000. This means that a player can only buy up to 13,000 coal every four hours. Another interesting feature of the Grand Exchange is the 1% tax applied to all executed sell offers. This tax is applied to all items with an individual trading price greater than 100 gold. It is capped at 5 million gold per offer and is applied on a per-item basis rounded down to the nearest integer. The proceeds of the tax are used by the game developer to control inflation. As an example, if I were to sell 10,000 coal ore at today's price of 142 gold per item, then my executed trade would be subject to a tax of: math.floor(0.01 * 142) * 10000 = 10,000 gold Components The bot is composed of three separate applications: a JavaScript API to interact with the OSRS Wiki's real-time item price stream, a Java client to control character actions, and a Python API to return the ranking of a set of possible offers in terms of their forecasted profitability. The OSRS Wiki project maintains a useful API that, every 5 minutes, writes data about every single item trading on the Grand Exchange. It records fields such as the average item price spread over a configurable past period, the volume traded over a configurable past period, and the buy limit of each item. The data pipeline I use to train the ML models is composed of two cronjobs that interact with the OSRS Wiki API: one that polls it every 5 minutes, and another that polls it every hour. Each of them record the price spreads and volumes of every item traded on the Grand Exchange over that time period and write the resulting data to a database. Furthermore, the bot records data about each offer that it successfully executes. The fields it records are: gold/second generated, absolute profit generated, timestamp of the buy offer initialization, and the ID of the item traded. These two tables are joined on timestamp such that each row contains aggregate trade data of the item across the entire Grand Exchange for the period leading up to a successful trade as well as the profitability of the individual executed trade. The target of the model's loss function is gold/second generated. Lastly, to prevent temporal leakage, the training set consists of labeled trades from 63 days prior to 14 days prior, while the validation set includes the most recent 14 days. Baseline Method In any modeling scenario, it is always good practice to establish a naive baseline method that can be used to determine if non-trivial methods are actually improving performance. The baseline method I came up with is as follows: Given an item, its price spread over the last 5 mins, and its trade volume over the last hour, compute the following variables: ROI: (sell_total - {1% tax} - buy_total) / buy_total Volume ratio: (1h_volume_traded_high_price / 1h_volume_traded_low_price) Average gold/second of item trades over last two weeks Then do the following: Compute ROI Z score for each item. Compute volume ratio Z score for each item. Filter out any items with a historically negative average gold/second metric. Sort each item by (roi_zscore + volume_ratio_zscore) descending. Machine Learning Methods After generating results for the baseline method, I ran a one-week experiment comparing the baseline to random forest and neural network regression models. In order to avoid a sample ratio mismatch, I programmed the game client to choose randomly between each model type's output when ranking potential offers. The results are displayed in the following table sorted by mean profit/hour in descending order: Model Type n L2 loss Mean profit/hr 95% CI profit/hr random forest 257 53 150,892 129,140 - 172,643 neural network 191 57 123,923 103,279 - 144,566 baseline 216 87,353 79,493 - 95,212 Conclusion Machine learning methods outperformed baseline by a significant amount. Among ML model architectures, random forest performed the best, edging out the neural network slightly. This aligns with the validation loss of each model during training. I am somewhat surprised that the random forest generated the highest profit/hour, as random forest predictions are typically constrained to the range of target values in the training data. With that said, the training data does have relatively low variance as the market making trades these models are predicting tend to be high frequency and low ROI. Please reach out to me if you are interested in obtaining the training data used for this project. The code used to train the models can be found linked above as well as on my Github.",

The ML model is trained on the price spread and volume data collected with the cronjob every 5 minutes and stored in a database, and the trades with their respective data, but on previously collected data from 63 days up to 14 days earlier and then validated on the remaining later 14 days of data, apparently to not have temporal leakage which I googled and means unintentional backflow of training data which screws up the prediction. So to answer your question the model finds patterns over multiple weeks of data, to rank the best trading choices in the present moment. Then the java component executes the trade in-game with the player character. What I personally don’t understand is if this data collection and training is rolling continually, or if he let it be trained one shot and then it’s smart enough to remain profitable. Don’t entirely understand the 49 day training, 14 day validation thing either. reply partypete 6 hours agorootparentThat’s right - I retrained the model every 7 days.

Only one ingredient is missing – water. “Cadillac Desert” (1986) by Marc Reisner correctly pointed out that within the limits of natural precipitation, we’ve expanded habitation in the West close to its maximal extent. Nearly 40 years after he wrote, however, the answer to shrinking flows of the Colorado and ever more demand for living space is not to stage some kind of retreat from land otherwise blessed with climate, solar power potential, mineral and human capital wealth. The answer is to flex our industrial might and finish what the irrigators began a century ago, and bring water in vast quantities to the high desert, to terraform a few select valleys in Nevada, and build a 21st century aesthetic vision. We’ve already Terraformed California and Florida. 63 million people live in sparkling prosperous modern metropolises that were formerly uninhabitable swamps, within living memory. How did we do this? Large scale infrastructure projects that moved natural resources, principally water, from one place to another. March 1938 flood in Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, we channelized the rivers and lowered the water table, creating 284,000 acres on which we’ve built one of the most dynamic cities on Earth. At the same time, we built the LA aqueduct, the Colorado River aqueduct, and the California aqueduct to bring in millions of acre feet of water every year to serve agriculture, homes, and businesses. In Florida, a combination of development, drainage, and air conditioning created one of the most desirable cities on Earth from a previously pestilential swamp. As a people, we need to ask ourselves whether we have an aesthetic sensibility. Do we need to curate landscapes? Cultivate life? Create beauty? Do we want to continue our historical pattern of striving to build better towns, cities, and opportunities for the coming generation? My sense is that the answer to these questions is yes, of course, but that water scarcity in the American West blocks the sort of truly ambitious development we would otherwise like to see. We should solve that problem. The key to solving water scarcity at the scale necessary to terraform Nevada is not to build bigger dams or to resort to rain dances, but to make more water using solar powered desalination technology. In this post two years ago I explained how cheap solar unlocks usefully cheap desalinated water, with current (2024) state-of-the-art plants producing at just $0.40/m^3 – and radical further improvements are within reach. In this post a year ago I showed how a desalination project in the Imperial Valley could not only double southern California’s water availability but also jump start an enormous brine mineral extraction industry, convert the Salton Sea environmental catastrophe into a warmer version of Lake Tahoe, and pay for itself in short order. Both of these posts were based on using solar+batteries+reverse osmosis desalination technology (RO) to produce cheap water – with no technical risk and almost no market risk. I firmly believe regulatory risk is a solvable problem, once the participants in the usual zero sum water disputes realize that there’s an easy path to unconditional future abundance. We can radically expand the pie, everyone can have a big slice! In the previous posts I baselined solar power at $0.50/W and batteries at $100/kWh, together with RO at $2000/kW. Amortized over 10 years, these systems produce water at around $500/acre-foot, or $0.40/m^3. This is a great price for municipal supply and even for the farming of certain high value cash crops. Indeed, the Federal Government now pays $521/af for water use avoided! Matching California’s annual 5 maf extraction from the Colorado would cost $2.5b per year, a tiny fraction of the economic productivity enabled by this water but a significant premium on the price California pays for the first 5 million acre-feet per year! We should be able to do better than this. Solar is getting cheaper. Indeed, solar PV is the first mass produced product where energy is an output rather than an input. We have literally invented a way to produce more and more energy at ever lower prices, which are currently falling at 15-20% per year. Earlier this week, we saw modules changing hands for the record low price of $0.07/W! Solar modules are commodities, inert slabs of glass that you put on the ground and which spit out wealth. If we can maintain similar cost curves on racking and installation systems, we’re within striking distance of $0.10/W for a large scale array. At the same time, and for the same reason, batteries have dropped in cost too. I will have to update this chart too, since earlier this week we saw LFP cells changing hands for less than $50/kWh. Scaling these advances to the Salton-Imperial project, we can cut the cost of the array from $10b to $2b, the battery storage system from $12b to $6b, while the intervening (and rather modest) 5% RO cost reduction brings that part from $10b to $9.5b, for a total of just $17.5b, compared to $32b a year ago. Feeding forward, that reduces water cost to $280/af or $0.22/m^3, cheap enough that you could almost double your irrigation while still cutting legacy extraction to zero and pocketing the $521/af from the feds. At the same time, more than half of the residual cost is just the amortized RO system. If we want to go even lower, we’re going to have to adapt to the solar supply curve. In this post earlier this year, I explained how adapting legacy industrial processes for lower capex and intermittency can capture the upside of future solar PV cost reductions more effectively than relying on solar and batteries. As a rough rule of thumb, an even split of capex between the solar array and the application, collocated in some off-grid distributed plant, minimizes product cost for customers. So, for a $200k 1 MW solar plant, a $200k desalination plant that operates at 25% utilization and 3 kWh/m^3 produces 7.3 million cubic meters over 10 years at an amortized cost of just $0.055/m^3 or $68/af. Current RO plants cost more like $2000/kW, so they’re both financially and technically unsuited to intermittent operation, which fatigues their membranes. Thermal desalination could achieve radically lower cost, albeit at lower energy efficiencies, so there’s work to be done here designing new, low cost desalination machines that fully exploit the upside of cheap solar PV. In particular, a multi-effect distillation apparatus could be produced from injection molded low cost plastics in enormous volumes and at minimum practicable cost. Multi-effect distillation uses a series of heat exchanges to get more distillation bang from the high latent heat of vaporization buck. In addition to cheaper desalination, terraforming of the Nevada high desert or similar landscapes will require pumping water uphill. Fortunately, once again solar PV can provide the necessary low cost energy. Pumping one million acre feet of water per year 1000 m uphill requires a 6 GW solar PV array plus the usual low cost, high efficiency water pumps. Pumping water doesn’t involve nasty thermodynamic transitions so is relatively easy to perform. Depending on desalination efficiency, pumping water 1000 m uphill roughly doubles the energy cost, with a lower incremental increase in price due to the relatively low cost of pumps vs desalination equipment. Let’s Terraform Nevada Nevada is a fascinating place. 71 million acres, of which 80% is federally managed land. Only three million people, of which almost all live in Las Vegas, a city which depends on the Colorado River for its water. Reno, at the other end of the state, houses just over half a million people. In contrast, Ohio is roughly one third the size and has nearly four times as many people. Unlike Ohio, Nevada receives so little rain that it lacks rivers with significant perennial flow. Water-induced erosion is so minimal that the geological formation of the basin and range geography has fragmented the drainage into a few dozen endorheic basins. In the battle between mountain formation and water erosion, mountain formation is winning handily. This wasn’t always the case. During the last ice age, only 10,000 years ago, Nevada enjoyed a much wetter climate, with numerous lakes, rivers, forests, and even North American megafauna such as mammoths, mastodons, and giant sloths. I’m hardly the first to observe that cheap energy can radically transform Nevada, so here I’ll try to be more constructive. How do we do this? We use cheap solar PV and, ideally, cheap desalination technology to generate millions of acre feet of water on the coast. We move the water inland. We release it onto the landscape to substitute for a lack of natural rainfall. Let’s get specific. First, we have to get fresh desalinated water to Nevada, a landlocked state. There are a number of ways this could be accomplished, depending on aesthetic preferences. By far the simplest and easiest is to swap water desalinated in the Colorado River delta for water otherwise released from Lake Meade, which lies at altitude adjacent to Las Vegas. Five million acre feet per year generated either in Mexico or the US part of the Imperial Valley can feed the All American Canal, the Coachella Canal, and thence the Colorado River Aqueduct. As part of a water deal, Nevada can lease California’s water rights to Colorado River water and divert it on a loop or two through the state before returning flow to the river. The lower Colorado River has three reservoirs, through which coastal desalinated fresh water could even be pumped uphill to Lake Meade, depending on seasonal demand and compensating for future variability in flows and releases from the Upper Colorado river. This is not the only way to get water to Nevada. The next easiest is to restore the Mojave River, a now dry/underground watercourse that runs from the Cajon Pass near San Bernardino north and east towards Death Valley, ultimately terminating at Badwater. In this case, however, flow would be diverted upstream of the National Park, then pumped up the Amargosa River valley across the border into Nevada. This approach, instead of or in combination with a canal from Lake Meade skirting Las Vegas, brings water into the south west corner of Nevada, still at relatively low altitude. The upstream end of the Mojave river can easily be fed by the California Aqueduct, which brings water from the Sacramento Delta south to Los Angeles. This flow would be augmented by significant desalination anywhere on the California coast. It could even be in the LA basin – the land requirement for 20 GW of distributed solar is hardly onerous. For one example, an array adjacent to the I5 between San Clemente and Camp Pendleton – all undeveloped land – would be more than sufficient. If the desalination is occurring in the vicinity of the Sacramento delta, it may even be possible to pump water over the Sierras, then let it flow down the Truckee, Carson, or Walker rivers. In some ways, the upstream instantiation of Nevada’s water supply is an aesthetic choice: Would you rather deal with California regulators or Mexican regulators? Fortunately, both are aligned on the broader political necessity to increase the supply of low cost water in essentially unlimited quantities. The best approach would be to set up a situation where sensible rents cause regulatory competition for deployment, not unlike early railroad siting. Save some money by skipping sealant on canals to ensure everyone along the route gets some free water, and all is well. Routing within Nevada Geographically, Nevada’s valleys run primarily north-south. There is an east-west trending divide in the middle of the state, with better ordered north-flowing drainage feeding the Humboldt river, which in turn brings water to the Carson Sink in the western part of the state, near Reno. Southern drainage is mostly endorheic, though the White River (usually dry) drains south along the eastern edge of the state, ultimately into the Colorado. Here’s a lovely map showing the various watersheds in the American West. The hodgepodge of colors in the middle reflect that Nevada’s valleys are mostly unconnected, at least for now. The low cost of PV affords considerable flexibility in routing of canals and choice in which valleys are terraformed and which may be left in their inhospitable desert state. It’s quite fun to peruse maps and connect the dots. One effective approach is to build a canal network that parallels US Route 95. This route has logistic access and relatively benign terrain. It would pump water uphill from Las Vegas, Amargosa Valley, and the Carson Sink to Tonopah, and from there to a flooded playa lake in Big Smoky Valley. From here it can be pumped over ranges into the Reese Valley and/or Monitor Valley, both of which ultimately drain north to the Humboldt river, bolstering existing agriculture in these valleys and closing the loop on the western side. The Monitor Valley drainage passes through Diamond Valley, refilling a large lake which overflows into Huntington Creek and thence to the Humboldt river. For water return to the Colorado River, water from Diamond Valley Lake can be diverted south via Eureka following the path of US Route 50 through Hiwee Valley, Newark Valley, and Jakes Valley into the White River watershed. In this scheme, the White River would also become a generous perennial river as opposed to a mostly dry valley. The complete system, roughly mapped, could look like this. But infinite variations are possible – what is your ideal? About 500 miles of canals (red) feed just over 1000 miles of natural drainages (black), creating more than 750 square miles of new directly irrigable agricultural land. Up to 1460 square miles of new lakes, depending mostly on how much water we leave in the Carson Sink, and 240,000 acres of prime waterfront real estate. Ultimate water consumption through evaporation and ground water recharge would be up to 3 maf per year, and commercially significant brines in some of the sinks may enable mineral development in addition to agriculture, commerce, and real estate. In all, over a trillion dollars of land value appreciation alone – an enormous windfall in a state with an annual GDP of about $200b and relatively little economic complexity. Not to disturb desert lovers (myself included) too much – more than 90% of the state, including all existing National Parks, State Parks, and military bases, would remain unaffected by this project. There is plenty of empty land to go around. How much would it cost? Baselining on the CAP and the earlier analysis of low cost desalination, I project: $4b for a 20 GW solar desal array $4b for a matched low cost desal plant $6b for canal construction, based on the CAP in Arizona and adjusting for scale. $2b total for pumps and solar arrays to power them In all, ~$16b to restore a huge swath of the Pleistocene ecosystem, with over $1t of realizable value generation, in addition to ongoing revenue from development. There are other possible approaches, but it seems to me that the simplest way to fund this sort of development is to grant options to purchase small pieces of state and federal land at unimproved prices, in much the same way that railway infrastructure was funded in the US 150 years ago, along with the necessary regulatory permissions. This model generalizes Here we’ve looked at Nevada, and previously we’ve looked at the southern edge of California. I think the observation applies generally. Something like a third of Earth’s land surface area is very sparsely inhabited desert, much of it coastal and low lying, unlike Nevada. Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, the eastern Cascades, much of India, Australia, Namibia, Chile, Argentina, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Saharan Africa could be, with the use of less than 1% of its land for solar desalination, converted into an arbitrarily fertile paradise. Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE are well on the way, but the first solar desal megaproject awaits development. It could be you! Go forth! Share this: Twitter Facebook Like Loading...

I read that one reason we can kind of remember our dreams when we first wake up but can't 5 minutes later is because our brain has some method of forcing our interpretation of what we see into some kind of reasonable cohesion according to what we consider to be physically possible or likely, and this part of the brain doesn't come online for a few minutes, so those impossible and unlikely scenarios in our dreams are still interpretable, but as we fully wake up we're just totally blocked from recalling that memory because what happened defies cohesive reality Anyway, I agree that not everything needs to fit into a \"serious proposalspeculative fiction\" dichotomy reply kibwen 32 minutes agorootparentprev> Could we actually do all of this?

The Great Basin is North America's largest endorheic basin, and the one large natural endorheic lake, the Great Salt Lake is currently drying up.

Brine from continental scale desalination as hazardous waist can be understood by the challenging problems with data center scale problems as an example. Also water from Lake Meed and Powell would require serious treatment to move anywhere due to Quagga muscles etc. Also large amounts of currently productive farmland are already at risk due to the Colorado being oversubscribed and declining aquifers.

I'm not a geology expert so I don't know the viability of this proposal, but it seems the author is proposing to bring flow back to rivers that have dried up at some point in the past. I took enough geology in college to understand that humans have been shifting riverflows since at least the Ancient Egyptians (with the Nile river), and Los Angeles' vitality is a product of artificial waterflow shift (the movie Chinatown touches on this at least tangentially). If I'm not mistaken, even Hoover Dam diverts a significant amount of water that once flowed elsewhere, though many environmentalists would tell you today that dams are horribly harmful to local ecosystems. My guess is that with climate change causing significant changes to multiple regions via weather and climate, causing massive upheavals for large swaths of populations, it might be in America's interest to consider where it could create new population centers again by shifting waterflow. reply kibwen 2 hours agorootparent> relative to human societal needs, which is shifting the flow of bodies of water to get water to Nevada This is not a societal need.

While people can communicate various political ideas more freely, it actually doesn't matter than much unless the political situation gets bad enough that it leads to a dark age.

The current wildfire situation is what the natural order of things looks like :-\\ reply OutOfHere 2 hours agorootparentThere is also a second way of stopping fires, which is to create 10x more man-made lakes, ponds, and streams everywhere in the region. It will increase the local humidity, which will in turn diminish the risk of fires. The approach is to maximize the surface of the volume of water exposed to the air. This works because fires require dryness, which will be impossible with sufficient water evaporation and humidity in the area. It is a superior form of terraforming than controlled fires. reply OutOfHere 14 hours agorootparentprevThat is highly debatable. There are overhead electric cables that often cause the trees to catch fire.

Usually it’s the coordination. High loss aversion among certain groups causes a reflexive resistance to any large scale project. Memetic mimicry has them reach the same result without explicit coordination. Any society struggles with conservatives vs adapters. The population transition boundary is along prosperity. Until society reaches a certain degree of prosperity and prosperity alteration shows relative slowdown, adapters win. But afterwards, conservatives will fear movement downward. It takes substantial adapter power to attempt transformative change. Once the transition boundary is hit, it doesn’t matter how much prosperity gain will be achieved. The key element is adapter power. In a democracy, especially, conservatism dominates past the prosperity boundary. The shape of bureaucracy will impede executive adapters. America is mostly past the boundary and high-value change only occurs in fields where adapter power exists: opposition to BEVs, space technologies, AVs, chip fabrication, biotechnology, and land modification is strong. Adapter actions occur only through the use of executive power and memetic warfare: using conservatism language to promote subsidies for BEVs and permit AVs, military use for space launches, defence rationale for chips, and hiding biotechnology research until it’s ready. Terraforming is too high-profile and easily fought. To succeed we need to transform it into using the language of conservatism (“restoring habitat”, e.g.), apply executive power (do so under military research auspices), or make it less valuable for conservatism to fight (many smaller projects rather than one big one).

    "originBody": "LWN .net News from the source Content Weekly Edition Archives Search Kernel Security Events calendar Unread comments LWN FAQ Write for us User: Password:| Subscribe / Log in / New account OSI readies controversial Open AI definition [LWN subscriber-only content] By Joe Brockmeier October 25, 2024 The Open Source Initiative (OSI) has been working on defining Open Source AI—that is what constitutes an AI system that can be used, studied, modified, and shared for any purpose—for almost two years. Its board will be voting on the Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) on Sunday, October 27, with the 1.0 version slated to be published on October 28. It is never possible to please everyone in such an endeavor, and it would be folly to make that a goal. However, a number of prominent figures in the open-source community have voiced concerns that OSI is setting the bar too low with the OSAID—which will undo decades of community work to cajole vendors into adhering to or respecting the original Open Source Definition (OSD). Defining Open Source AI OSI executive director Stefano Maffulli announced the organization's intent to provide a definition for open-source AI in June 2023. He took exception to announcements of \"large language models, foundational models, tooling, services all claiming to be 'open' or 'Open Source'\", while adding restrictions which run afoul of the OSD. A survey of large-language model (LLM) systems in 2023 found that ostensibly open-source LLMs did not live up to the name. The problem is not quite as simple as saying \"use an OSD-compliant license\" for LLMs, because there are many more components to consider. The original OSD is understood to apply to the source code of a program in \"the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program\". A program is not considered open source if a developer cannot study, use, modify, and share a program, and a license is not OSD‑compliant if it does not preserve those freedoms. A program can include non-free data and still be open source. For example, the game Quake III Arena (Q3A) is available under the GPLv2. That distribution, however, does not include the pak files that contain the maps, textures, and other content required to actually play the commercial game. Despite that, others can still use the Q3A code to create their own games, such as Tremulous. The staff here at LWN.net really appreciate the subscribers who make our work possible. Is there a chance we could interest you in becoming one of them? When discussing an \"AI system\", however, things are much more complicated. There is more than just the code that is used to run the models to do work of some kind, and the data is not something that can be wholly separate from the system in the way that it can be with a game. When looking at, say, LLMs, there is the model architecture, the code used to train models, model parameters, the techniques and methodologies used for training, the procedures for labeling training data, the supporting libraries, and (of course) the data used to train the models. OSI has been working on its definition since last year. It held a kickoff meeting on June 21, 2023 at the Mozilla headquarters in San Francisco. It invited participation afterward via a regular series of in-person and online sessions, and with a forum for online discussions. LWN covered one of the sessions, held at FOSDEM 2024, in February. The current draft of the OSAID takes its definition of an AI system from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Recommendation of the Council on Artificial Intelligence: A machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments. This includes source code for training and running the system, model parameters \"such as weights or other configuration settings\", as well as \"sufficiently detailed information about the data used to train the system so that a skilled person can build a substantially equivalent system\". Preferred form to make modifications Those elements must all be available under OSI-approved licenses, according to the proposed definition, which seems perfectly in line with what we've come to expect when something is called \"open source\". There is an exception, though, for things like the data information and model parameters which must be available under \"OSI-approved terms\". The definition of OSI-approved terms is not supplied yet. There is no requirement to make the training data available. To be compliant with the current draft of the OSAID, an AI system need only provide \"detailed information\" about the data but not the data itself. The OSI published version 0.0.9 on August 22. It acknowledged then that \"training data is one of the most hotly debated parts of the definition\". However, the OSI was choosing not to require training data: After long deliberation and co-design sessions we have concluded that defining training data as a benefit, not a requirement, is the best way to go. Training data is valuable to study AI systems: to understand the biases that have been learned, which can impact system behavior. But training data is not part of the preferred form for making modifications to an existing AI system. The insights and correlations in that data have already been learned. As it stands, some feel that the OSAID falls short of allowing the four freedoms that it is supposed to ensure. For example, julia ferraioli wrote that without including data, the only things that the OSAID guarantees are the ability to use and distribute an AI system. \"They would be able to build on top of it, through methods such as transfer learning and fine-tuning, but that's it.\" Tom Callaway has written at length on LinkedIn about why open data should be a requirement. He acknowledges that there are good reasons that distributors of an AI system may not want, or be able, to distribute training data. For example, the data itself may have a high monetary value on its own, and a vendor may be unwilling or unable to share it. Acme Corp might license a data set and have permission to create an AI system using it, but not the ability to distribute the data itself. The data might have legal issues, ranging from confidentiality (e.g., medical data sets) to a desire to avoid lawsuits from using copyrighted data. All of those are understandable reasons for not distributing data with an AI system, he said, but they don't argue for crafting a definition that allows companies to call their system open: If we let the Open Source AI definition contain a loophole that makes data optional, we devalue the meaning of \"open source\" in all other contexts. While there are lots of companies who would like to see open source mean less, I think it's critical that we not compromise here, even if it means there are less Open Source AI systems at first. Objections to lack of training data are more than an attachment to the original meaning of open source. Giacomo Tesio posted a list of issues he considered unaddressed in the RC2 version of the OSAID, including a claim that there is inherent insecurity due to the ability to plant undetectable backdoors in machine-learning models. Others weigh in The Free Software Foundation (FSF) announced that it was working on \"a statement of criteria for free machine learning applications\" to call something a free (or libre) machine-learning application. The FSF says that it is close to a definition, and is working on the exact text. However, it adds that \"we believe that we cannot say a ML application 'is free' unless all its training data and the related scripts for processing it respect all users, following the four freedoms\". However, the FSF makes a distinction between non-free and unethical in this case: It may be that some nonfree ML have valid moral reasons for not releasing training data, such as personal medical data. In that case, we would describe the application as a whole as nonfree. But using it could be ethically excusable if it helps you do a specialized job that is vital for society, such as diagnosing disease or injury. The Software Freedom Conservancy has announced an \"aspirational statement\" about LLM-backed generative AI for programming called \"Machine-Learning-Assisted Programming that Respects User Freedom\". Unlike the OSAID, this target focuses solely on computer-assisted programming, and was developed in response to GitHub Copilot. The announcement did not directly name the OSI or the OSAID effort, but said \"we have avoided any process that effectively auto-endorses the problematic practices of companies whose proprietary products are already widely deployed\". It describes an ideal LLM system built only with FOSS, with all components available, and only for the creation of FOSS. Response to criticisms I emailed Maffulli about some of the criticisms of the current OSAID draft, and asked why OSI appears to be \"lowering the bar\" when the OSI has never budged on source availability and use restrictions. He replied: I'll be blunt: you mention \"source redistribution\" in your question and that's what leads people like [Callaway] into a mental trap [...] There are some groups believing that more components are required to guarantee more transparency. Other groups instead believe that model parameters and architecture are enough to modify AI. The Open Source AI Definition, developed publicly with a wide variety of stakeholders worldwide, with deep expertise on building AI (see the list of endorsers), found that while those approaches are legitimate, neither is optimal. The OSAID grants users the rights (with licenses) and the tools (with the list of required components) to meaningfully collaborate and innovate on (and fork, if required) AI systems. We have not compromised on our principles: we learned many new things from actual AI experts along the way. Maffulli objected to the idea that the OSAID was weaker or making concessions, and said that the preferred form for modifying ML systems was what is in the OSAID: \"it's not me nor OSI board saying that, it's in the list of endorsers and in [Carnegie Mellon University's] comment\". He added that OSI had synthesized input from \"AI builders, users, and deployers, content creators, unions, ethicists, lawyers, software developers from all over the world\" to arrive at the definition. A \"simple translation\" of the OSD, he said, would not work. Stephen O'Grady, founder of the RedMonk analyst firm, also makes the case that the OSD does not easily translate to AI projects. But he does not believe that the term open source \"can or should be extended into the AI world\" as he wrote in a blog post on October 22: At its heart, the current deliberation around an open source definition for AI is an attempt to drag a term defined over two decades ago to describe a narrowly defined asset into the present to instead cover a brand new, far more complicated future set of artifacts. O'Grady makes the case that the OSI has set out on a pragmatic path to define open-source AI, which requires nuance. Open source has succeeded, in part, because the OSD removes nuance. Does a license comply with the OSD or doesn't it? It's pretty easy to determine. Less so with the OSAID. The pragmatic path, he said: Involves substantial compromise and, more problematically, requires explanation to be understood. And as the old political adage advises: \"If you're explaining, you're losing.\" It would have been better, he said, if the OSI had not tried to \"bend and reshape a decades old definition\" and instead had tried to craft something from a clean slate. That seems unlikely now, he said, after two years of trying to \"thread the needle between idealism and capitalism to arrive at an ideologically sound and yet commercially acceptable\" definition. Indeed, it seems likely that the OSI board will move forward with the current draft of the OSAID or something close to it. The impact that will have is much less certain. to post comments The preferred form for modifying ML systems' Posted Oct 25, 2024 22:15 UTC (Fri) by ballombe (subscriber, #9523) [Link] > Maffulli objected to the idea that the OSAID was weaker or making concessions, and said that the preferred form for modifying ML systems was what is in the OSAID: \"\"it's not me nor OSI board saying that, it's in the list of endorsers and in [Carnegie Mellon University's] comment\" Where does the CMU comment says anything about the 'the preferred form for modifying ML systems' ? modification Posted Oct 25, 2024 22:17 UTC (Fri) by shironeko (subscriber, #159952) [Link] Maybe the supporter of the definition could demonstrate practically modifying a ML model without using the original training data, and show that it is just as easy as with the original data and it does not limit what you can do with it (e.g. demonstrate it can unlearn any parts of the original data as if they were not used).

Posted Oct 25, 2024 22:31 UTC (Fri) by leromarinvit (subscriber, #56850) [Link] (3 responses) Given the topic, asking an AI for its thoughts on the matter seemed apt. So I prompted ChatGPT (which is, of course, about as far removed from \"Open Source AI\" as seems possible): > Given the following article, write a comment about whether or not training data should be included in the OSAID. Explain why, either way. > [...] It seems it wants to see training data included in the definition: > Whether training data should be included in the Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) is a crucial issue, and I believe it should be required, not optional. Leaving training data out of the definition weakens the foundational principles of open source, particularly the ability to fully understand, modify, and build upon AI systems. > Training data is central to how AI models are developed, and it plays a significant role in shaping the behavior and biases of the system. Without access to the data—only providing \"detailed information\"—users are restricted in their ability to recreate or meaningfully modify the system. This exclusion limits transparency and undermines the goal of fostering collaboration and innovation, which are core values of the open-source community. > While there are valid concerns about the ethical and legal challenges of releasing training data, such as privacy issues and proprietary data restrictions, these challenges should be addressed case-by-case rather than lowering the bar for what qualifies as open source. By allowing AI systems to be considered \"open\" without sharing the training data, the OSAID risks diluting the meaning of open source and setting a precedent where essential components of AI systems can remain closed while still benefiting from the open-source label. > In short, if the goal is to preserve the spirit of open source in AI, training data should not be optional, as omitting it compromises transparency, accountability, and the ability to fully exercise the four freedoms that open source aims to protect. ;-) While I happen to agree with the conclusion, the reasoning seems more like a summary of the article to me, instead of actual independent thought (well, duh - it's an LLM, it can't think). In particular, what stands out to me is that with source code, I can not only add new features or modify existing ones, but also remove parts entirely. This seems impossible with the kind of iterative modification that seems to be the only kind taken into account here (to my admittedly very limited understanding of the matter). Or, more to the point: > training data is not part of the preferred form for making modifications to an existing AI system. The insights and correlations in that data have already been learned. Exactly, they \"have been learned\". I can't make it \"unlearn\" them without having the original training data to modify and run the full training again. Of course, then there's still the practical matter of actually being able to run the (full) training. This seems thoroughly out of reach for anyone without very deep pockets for now, especially for the kind of individual hackers that shaped Free Software and Open Source initially. ChatGPT says...

Posted Oct 26, 2024 1:40 UTC (Sat) by chuckwolber (subscriber, #138181) [Link] (3 responses) It was relatively easy to create a definition of openness that applies cleanly to deterministic systems like compiled software. It seems like we are trying to apply the same definition to a non-deterministic system (neural nets) and we keep failing to notice the real problem. If I listen to music that ultimately influences my style as a musician, I am no less free when I play in my heavily influenced style and the music that influenced me is no less encumbered by copyright. The trained neural net (biological or digital) is its own qualia, which exists independent of the influences that trained it and it owes nothing to those influences. Today those qualia are small, so it is easy to dismiss their subjectivity. Scale that qualia up closer to the complexity of a human mind and the problem should be more clear. By way of analogy - demanding a full accounting of the training material to satisfy an openness requirement is like demanding that you provide a full accounting of everything you were exposed to since birth before we allow you to operate freely in open society. The very idea is absurd. We invented a shortcut to that problem a long time ago - it is called a \"social contract\". We cannot possibly know everything that is going on in your head, but we can set forth expectations and apply relevant penalties. I propose we rethink the OSAI in the same way.

AI and LLMs are bayesian inference machines. Human brains have external forces imposing a (not necessarily correct) definition of \"right\" and \"wrong\".

That could be true for LLMs, today, but many smaller-scaled AI models are retrained from scratch rountinely. Pretty soon there would be more LLMs retrained from scratch than100 or 200 billions of people that ever lived on this planet. Would that mean that LLMs would achieve parity with humans, when that would happen? Hard to predict… my gut feeling is that no, that wouldn't happen – but not because encounters with lions or wildebeests made humans are that much better, but because nature invented a lot of tricks over billions of years that we don't know how to replicate… yet. > I've mentioned the crab before, but if a 6502-powered robot crab can cope easily with the complexities of the surf zone, why can't a million-pound AI tell the difference between a car and a tank It could.

When you are shown picture where the exact same color looks “white” in one place and “black” in the other place you don't even need AI to reveal the difference, simple sheet of paper is enough – but that's not perceived as human brain deficiency because we all are built the same and all fall prey to the exact same illusion. AIs are built differently and they are fooled by different illusions than what humans misperceive – and that difference is, in our arrogance, treated as “human superiority”. It's only when AI starts doing things so much better than human, beats human so supremely decisively, when there are no doubt that AI is “head and shoulders” above human for this or that task… only then humans… redefine this particular task as “not really important”. Like it happened to go and chess, among other things.

It certainly has lost any and all credibility with these actions and their whole procedere, which was designed to cater to corporate interests over open source principles right from the beginning (leading questions, lack of survey response possibilities that disagree, etc). Many people certainly don’t want those theft machines blessed by something they identify with. (I will, for one, *not* enable reply notifications, nor engage further here.

While my posts (https://files.reto-schneider.ch/2024-10-22%2021-15-xx%20O...) might have been below their quality expectation, having them marked as \"Pending\" (for review) and then silently dropped (deleted) after ~2 days seems not ok to me.

Re: Response to criticisms Posted Oct 26, 2024 14:39 UTC (Sat) by IanKelling (subscriber, #89418) [Link] A discussion forum opened many months after they already published a draft definition. For a long time, it was just a web comment system requiring proprietary javascript, which is still there. And yes, I made sure OSI knew from the beginning that they published a draft definition which suggested only one way to comment publicly, which excluded people who strongly believed in principles which were part of the definition. The CMU statement which calls it a \"participatory co-design process\" which was \"inclusive\" makes me roll my eyes. It was drafted privately by the OSI board in some undisclosed way. Why not two licences? Posted Oct 26, 2024 15:26 UTC (Sat) by burki99 (subscriber, #17149) [Link] (1 responses) It seems rather obvious: There are two views on this topic, both reasonable, but fundementally incompatible. Therefore I would suggest to come up with a) Pragmatic Open Source AI b) Strict Open Source AI a) would be the one suggested by OSI, b) would additionally require the training data to be available (which implies an open content license that allows redistribution of the training data). Why not two licences? Posted Oct 26, 2024 15:55 UTC (Sat) by jzb (editor, #7867) [Link] License discussions are no place for reasonable suggestions. :) In seriousness, though - that's not a terrible idea. I'm not sure I'd go with \"Pragmatic\" and \"Strict\" as the names, but something that indicates \"everything but the data is available\" and \"this is the gold standard of openness, including open data\" with the naming reflecting that might satisfy some of the folks unhappy with tagging anything less than fully open as \"open source\".

I quite like that comment that was left on the article. I know some models you can tweak the weights, without the source data, but it does seem like you are more restricted without the actual dataset. Personally, the data seems to be part of the source to me, in this case. I mean, the code is derived from the data itself, the weights are the artifact of training. If anything, they should provide the data, the training methodology, the model architecture, the code to train and infer, and the weights could be optional. I mean, the weights basically are equivalent to a built artifact, like the compiled software. And that means commercially, people would pay for the cost of training. I might not have the resources to \"compile\" it myself, aka, run the training, so maybe I pay a subscription to a service that did. reply lolinder 16 hours agoparentA lot of people get hung up on `weights = compiled-artifact` because both are binary representations, but there are major limitations to this comparison. When we're dealing with source code, the cost of getting from source -> binary is minimal. The entire Linux kernel builds in two hours on one modest machine. Since it's cheap to compile and the source code is itself legible, the source code is the preferred form for making modifications. This doesn't work when we try to apply the same reasoning to `training data -> weights`. \"Compilation\" in this world costs hundreds of millions of dollars per compilation run. Cost of \"compilation\" alone means that the preferred form for making modifications can't possibly be the training data, even for the company that built the thing in the first place. As for the data itself, it's a far cry from source code—we're talking tens of terrabytes of data at a minimum, which is likewise infeasible to work with on a regular basis. The weights must be the preferred form for making modifications for simple logistics reasons. Importantly, the weights are the preferred form for modifications even for the companies that built them. I think a far more reasonable analogy, to the extent that any are reasonable, is that the training data is all the stuff that the developers of the FOSS software ever learned, and the thousands of computer-hours spent on training are the thousands of man-hours spent coding. The entire point of FOSS is for a few experts to do all that work once and then we all can share and modify the output of those years of work and millions of dollars invested as we see fit, without having to waste all that time and money doing it over again. We don't expect the authors of the Linux kernel to document their every waking thought so we could recreate the process they used to produce the kernel code... we just thank them for the kernel code and contribute to it as best we can. reply dragonwriter 12 hours agorootparent> A lot of people get hung up on `weights = compiled-artifact` because both are binary representations, No, that's not why weights are object code. Binary vs. text is irrelevant. Weights are object code because training data is declarative source code defining the desired behavior of the system and training code is a compiler which takes that source code and produces a system with the desired behavior. Now, the behavior produced is less exactly known from the source code than is the case with traditional programming, but the function is the same. You could have a system where the training and inference codes were open source and the model specified by the weights itself was not — that would be like having a system where software was not open source, but the compiler use to build it and the runtime library it relies on were. But one shouldn't confuse that with an open source model. reply lolinder 5 hours agorootparentThis is a much more compelling explanation than any I've seen so far. What do you do with the fact that no one (including the companies who do the initial training) modifies the training data when they want to modify the work? Are the weights not the preferred form for modifying a model? reply seba_dos1 41 minutes agorootparentCompiling Android takes many hours and requires a lot of RAM and disk space, more than I have available on my machines right now. For some things there, binary patching may actually be an easier way to change stuff than compiling the whole thing from source. Now scale that up and consider - at which point such project would start being \"FOSS\" in your book without actually providing its sources on an appropriate license? The intention behind \"preferred form for modification\" is to put you as a user on the same level as the copyright holder. This construct works well in a world where compiling is cheap; where it isn't, it may require some refinement to preserve the intention behind it. The copyright holder could decide to modify the learning set before pressing the \"start\" button, you can't. reply seba_dos1 56 minutes agorootparentprev> The entire point of FOSS is for a few experts to do all that work once and then we all can share and modify the output of those years of work and millions of dollars invested as we see fit, without having to waste all that time and money doing it over again.

It would feel entirely on point for things that require ungodly amounts of money and resources to even start considering exercising your freedoms on to not be considered FOSS, even if that aspect isn't considered by currently accepted definitions. reply smolder 15 hours agorootparentprevIf you can't bootstrap a set of weights from public material, the weights aren't open source, because it's derivative content based on something non-open. Trying to draw an equivalency between code and weights is [edited for temperament, I guess] not right. They are built from the source material supplied to an algorithm. Weights are data, not code. Otherwise, everyone on the internet would be an author, and would have a say in the licensing of the weights. reply lolinder 15 hours agorootparent> Trying to draw an equivalency between code and weights is ridiculous, because the weights are not written in the same way as source code. By the same logic, the comparison between a compiled artifact and weights fails because the weights are not \"compiled\" in any meaningful sense. Analogies will always fail, which is why \"preferred form for making modifications\" is the rod we use, not vague attempts at drawing analogies between completely different development processes. > They are built from the source material supplied to an algorithm. Weights are data, not code. As Lispers know well, code is data and data is code. You can't draw a line in the sand and definitively say that on this side of the line is just code and on that side is just data. In terms of how they behave, weights function as code that is executed by an interpreter that we call an inference engine. reply smolder 13 hours agorootparentI'm perfectly willing to draw a line in the sand instead of letting people define their models however it's most convenient for them. Analogies aside, here is what a set of weights is made of: A lot of data, mostly produced by humans who are not credited and have no say in how the output weights are licensed, some code written by people who might have some say, and then lots of work by computers running that code and consuming that data. I'm not comfortable with calling the resulting weights \"open source\", since people can't look at a set of weights and understand all of the components in the same way as actual source code. It's more like \"freeware\". You might be able to disassemble it with some work, but otherwise it's an incomprehensible thing you can run and have for free. I think it would be more appropriate to co-opt the term \"open source\" for weights generated from freely available material, because then there is no confusion whether the \"source\" is open. reply lolinder 13 hours agorootparent> A lot of data, mostly produced by humans who are not credited and have no say in how the output weights are licensed And this is what I think everyone is actually dancing around: I suspect the insistence on publishing the training data has very little to do with a sense of purity around the definition of Open Source and everything to do with frustrations about copyright and intellectual property. For that same reason, we won't see open source models by this definition any time soon, because the legal questions around data usage are profoundly unsettled and no company can afford to publicize the complete set of data that they trained on until they are. My personal ethic says that intellectual property is a cancer that sacrifices knowledge and curiosity on the altar of profit, so I'm not overly concerned about forcing companies to reveal where they got the data. If they're releasing the resulting weights under a free license (which, notably, Llama isn't) then that's good enough for me. reply smolder 12 hours agorootparent> For that same reason, we won't see open source models by this definition any time soon It's totally fine if we don't have many (or any) models meeting the definition of open source! How hard is it to use a different term that actually applies? The people on my side of the argument seem to be saying: \"do not misapply these words\", not \"do not give away your weights\". Insisting on calling a model with undisclosed sources \"open source\" has what benefit? Marketing? That's really all I can think of... that it's to satisfy the goals of propagandists. reply Shamar 8 hours agorootparentIt's not just marketing: European AI Act impose several compliance obligations to corporations building AI system, including serious scientific scrutiny on the whole training process. Such obligations are designed to mitigate the inherent risks that AI can pose to individuals and society. The AI Act exempts open source from such scientific scrutiny because it's already transparent. BUT if OSI defines black boxes as \"open source\", they open a loophole that will be exploited to harm people without being held accountable. So it's not just marketing, but dangerous corporate capture. reply acka 1 hour agorootparentExactly. Without models being truly open source, (training data, training procedures, alignment etc.), there is no way for auditors to assess, for example, whether a model was trained on data exhibiting certain forms of selection bias (anything from training data or alignment being overly biased towards Western culture, controversial political or moral viewpoints, particular religions, gender stereotypes, even racism) which might lead to dangerous outcomes later on, whether by contamination of derived models or during inference. reply seba_dos1 29 minutes agorootparentprev> very little to do with a sense of purity around the definition of Open Source and everything to do with frustrations about copyright and intellectual property The whole reason FOSS exists is because of frustrations about copyright and intellectual property, anything else is derived from that, so I'm not sure what your point is. reply dietr1ch 14 hours agorootparentprev> > Trying to draw an equivalency between code and weights is ridiculous, because the weights are not written in the same way as source code. > By the same logic, the comparison between a compiled artifact and weights fails because the weights are not \"compiled\" in any meaningful sense. To me the weights map to assembly and the training data+models map to source code+compilers. Sure, you can hand me assembly, and with the assembly I may be able to execute the model/program, but having it does not mean that I can stare at it and learn nor modify it with a reasonable understanding of what's going to change. I got to add that the situation feels even worse than assembly, because assembly, hand-coded or mutilated by an optimizing compiler still does something very specific and deterministic, but the weights on the model makes things equivalent to programming without booleans, but seemingly random numbers and checking for inequalities to get a binary decision. reply lolinder 14 hours agorootparentThis is the analogy that people keep saying, but as I observed above, the key difference is that the company that produces a binary executable doesn't prefer to work with that binary: they work with the source code and re-compile after changing it. In contrast, the weights are the preferred form for modification, even for the company that built it. They only very rarely start a brand new training run from scratch, and when they do so it's not to modify the existing work, it's to make a brand new work that builds on what they learned from the previous model. If the company makes the form of the work that they themselves use as the primary artifact freely available, I'm not sure why we wouldn't call the work open. reply Nevermark 13 hours agorootparent> In contrast, the weights are the preferred form for modification, even for the company that built it. Preferred is obviously not a particularly strong line. If someone ships object code for a bunch of stable modules, and only provides the source for code that’s expected to be where changed, is that really open? “Preferred” gets messy quick. Not sure how that can be defined in any consistent way. Models are going to get more & more complex. Training with competitive models, etc. I think you either have it all, or it isn’t really open. Or only some demarked subset is. reply smolder 13 hours agorootparentprevIs a .rom file open source because you can pipe it into an emulator and generate new machine code for a different platform? I don't think your argument holds any water. reply lolinder 13 hours agorootparentIs a .rom file the preferred form for modifying the work? reply smolder 13 hours agorootparentTo get it to run on different platforms and gain new features like super-resolution and so on, yes. Rom files are the preferred form for modifying old games. No one bothers digging up old source code and assets to reconstruct things when they can use an emulator to essentially spit out a derivative binary with new capability. See every re-release of a 16 bit era or earlier game. Now that I've beat my head against this issue for a while, I think it's best summed up as: weights are a binary artifact, not source of any kind. reply lolinder 13 hours agorootparentIf what you say is true—if the ROM is the preferred form for making modifications (even for the original company that produced it) and the ROM is released under a FOSS license—then sure, I have no problem calling it open source. reply grandma_tea 5 hours agorootparentPreferred by who? It sounds like these people have a strong say in what constitutes open source. reply lolinder 4 hours agorootparentPreferred by anyone who's actually using and modifying the work. No one trains an existing model from scratch, even those who have access to all of the data to do so. There's just no compelling reason to retrain a model to make a change when you have the weights already—fine tuning is preferred by everyone.

Did you take a survey? When? What if preferences change or there is no consensus? > The only people I've seen who've asserted otherwise are random commenters on the internet who don't really understand the tech. There are lots of things that can be done with the training set that don't involve retraining the entire model from scratch. As a random example, I could perform a statistical analysis over a portion of the training set and find a series of vectors in token-space that could be used to steer the model. Something like this can be done without access to the training data, but does it work better? We don't know because it hasn't been tried yet. But none of that really matters, because what we're discussing is the philosophy of open source. I think it's a really bad take to say that something is open source because it's in a \"preferred\" format. reply lolinder 2 hours agorootparent> I think it's a really bad take to say that something is open source because it's in a \"preferred\" format. Preferred form and under a free license. Llama isn't open source, but that's because the license has restrictions.

If it costs X gazillion dollars to reproduce it, that feels irrelevant to some extent. If it is not reproducible, then it is not open. If it is reproducible, then it is open. Probably there’s some argument to be made here that it’s not actually open if some random dev can’t reproduce it on their own machine over a weekend, but I honestly don’t buy that argument in this realm. reply lolinder 14 hours agorootparent> If it is not reproducible, then it is not open. If it is reproducible, then it is open. You're applying reproducibility unevenly, though. The Linux kernel source code cannot feasibly be reproduced, but it can be copied and modified. The Mistral weights cannot feasibly be reproduced, but they can be copied and modified. Why is the kernel code open source while the Mistral weights are not? Reproducibility is clearly not the deciding factor. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 13 hours agorootparentInteresting take. You appear to be defining reproducibility to be something like “could I write this source code again myself”. But no one I know uses the term reproducible in the way you’re saying. Everyone I know, including myself, takes reproducibility in this context to mean “if given source code, I can produce a binary /executable that is identical to the one that is produced by some other party when built the same way” Now I get that “Identical” is a bit more nebulous when it comes to LLMs due to their inherent nondeterminism, but let’s take it to mean the executable itself, not the results produced by the executable. reply lolinder 13 hours agorootparent> You appear to be defining reproducibility to be something like “could I write this source code again myself”. No, I'm using the strict definition \"capable of being reproduced\", where reproduce means \"to cause to exist again or anew\". In and of itself the word doesn't comment on whether you're starting from source code or anything else, it just says that something must be able to be created again. Yes, in the context of compilation this tends to refer to reproducible builds (which is a whole rabbit hole of its own), but here we're not dealing with two instances of compilation, so it's not appropriate to use the specialized meaning. We're dealing with two artifacts (a set of C files and a set of weights) that were each produced in different ways, and we're asking whether each one can be reproduced exclusively from data that was released alongside the artifact. The answer is that no, neither the source files or the weights can be reproduced given data that was released alongside them. So my question remains: on what basis can we say that the weights are not open source but the C files are? Neither can be reproduced from data released alongside them, and both are the preferred form which the original authors would choose to make modifications to. What distinguishes them? reply SOLAR_FIELDS 13 hours agorootparentI’ll go ahead and call this a false equivalency because the amount of work required to get “pretty close” to compiling a binary that looks something like the Linux kernel is pretty achievable. Not so for these models. I know my way around gcc and llvm enough to be able to compile something that will work mostly like the Linux kernel in some reasonable amount of time. Now I know it seems like I’m taking the opposite side of my original take here but come on - you can’t really genuinely believe that because I can’t produce a byte for byte representation of the Linux kernel immediately even if it behaves 99.999% the same that somehow that is even remotely the same as not being able to reproduce an “open” LLM. reply lolinder 13 hours agorootparentAll I'm saying is that reproducibility of the released primary artifact—be it source or weights—is not actually a factor in whether we consider something to be open source. Regardless of whether you believe you could rewrite the Linux kernel from scratch, you don't consider the Linux kernel to be open source because you can rewrite it. It's open source because they licensed the preferred form of the work for making modifications under a FOSS license. That's it. Reproducibility of that preferred form from scratch doesn't factor into it. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 12 hours agorootparentFair. In reading our thread again I realized we are probably talking past each other. Really this discussion should be about the philosophical aspect of what constitutes open source in the context of LLM’s. Which is a tough and more interesting topic. Really the conversation should be reframed to be something along the lines of “is it even ethical for these companies to offer their LLM as anything other than open source”? The answer, if you look into what they do, is “probably not”. Arguing about the technicalities of whether they follow the letter of whatever rule or regulation is probably a waste of time. Because it is completely obvious to anyone who understands how this works that these models are built and sold off the backs of centuries of open source work not licensed or intended to be used for profit. reply lolinder 12 hours agorootparent> Really the conversation should be reframed to be something along the lines of “is it even ethical for these companies to offer their LLM as anything other than open source”? The answer, if you look into what they do, is “probably not”. Agreed, but I'm personally of the opinion that this is true for all intellectual endeavors. Intellectual property is the great sin of our generation, and I hope we eventually learn better. And I think you've hit at the heart of the matter: the push for open source training data has never been about the definition of open source, it's always been a cover for complaints about where the data was sourced from. Which is also why we won't see it any time soon—not until the lawsuits wind their way through the courts, and even then only if the results are favorable towards training. reply 9dev 11 hours agorootparentIt was a joy to follow along this discussion. Thank both of you. reply fragmede 14 hours agorootparentprevThe Linux kernel is considered Open Source because (among other things) the compiled kernel binary that is used to boot a computer can be reproduced from provided source code. source code -> compile -> kernel binary. That binary is what can be reproduced, given the source code. We don't have the equivalent for Mistral: source code (+ training data) -> training -> weights reply lolinder 14 hours agorootparentSo people have said, but as I've noted I disagree with the characterization that training is equivalent to compilation. Even the companies that can afford to train a foundation model do so once and then fine-tune it from there to modify it. They only start a new training run when they're building a brand new model with totally different characteristics (such as a different parameter count). Training is too expensive for the training data to be the preferred form for making modifications to the work. Given that, the weights themselves are the closest thing these things have to \"source code\". And this is where the reproducibility argument falls apart: on what basis can we insist that the preferred form for modifying an LLM (the weights) must be reproducible to be open source but the preferred form for modifying a piece of regular software (the code) can be open sourced as is, with none of the processes used to produce the code? reply fragmede 13 hours agorootparentJust because I can hex edit Photoshop.exe to say what I want in the about dialog doesn't make it open source, even if it is faster and easier to hexedit it than it is to recompile from source. In order for the weights to take all the training data and embed it in the model, by definition, some data must be lost. That data can't be recovered, no matter how much you fine tune the model. Because we can't, we don't know how alignment gets set, or the extent of it. The closet thing these things have to source code is the source code and training data used to create the model. Because that's what's used to created the model. How big a system is necessary to train it doesn't factor in. It used to take many days to compile the Linux kernel, and many people at the time didn't have access to systems that could even compile it. reply lolinder 13 hours agorootparent> Just because I can hex edit Photoshop.exe to say what I want in the about dialog doesn't make it open source, even if it is faster and easier to hexedit it than it is to recompile from source. First, licenses matter. Photoshop.exe is closed source first and foremost because the license says so. Second and more importantly for this discussion, Adobe doesn't prefer to work with hexedit, they prefer to work with the source code. OpenAI prefers to fine tune their existing models rather than train new ones. They fine tune regularly, and have only trained from scratch four times total, with each of those being a completely new model, not a modification. That means the weights of an LLM are the preferred form for modification, which meets the GPL's definition of 'source code': > The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. reply dahart 14 hours agorootparentprev> The entire point of FOSS is for a few experts to do all that work once and then we all can share and modify the output of those years of work and millions of dollars invested as we see fit, without having to waste all that time and money doing it over again. Really? Hmm yeah maybe you’re right, but for some reason, said that way it somehow starts to seem a little disappointing and depressing. Maybe I’m reading it differently than you intended. I always considered the point of FOSS to be about the freedoms to use, study, customize, and share software, like to become an expert, not to avoid becoming an expert. But if the ultimate goal of all that is just a big global application of DRY so that most people rely on the corpus without having to learn as much, I feel like that is in a way antithetical to open source, and it could have a big downside or might end up being a net negative, but I dunno… reply kvemkon 15 hours agorootparentprev> The entire Linux kernel builds in two hours on one modest machine.

The same cannot be said for LLM weights, as evidenced by the fact that even the enormous megacorps that put these things out tend to follow up by fine tuning the weights (using different training data) rather than retraining from scratch. reply kvemkon 14 hours agorootparentI'd continue to compare it with how free software appeared. It was barely feasible back then (end of 60th - begin of 70th) to work on software at home on a PC, since there was no PC. Still the software could already be open/free and exchanged between big enough players with big computers. Only later the things changed. But even now there is free software which is nightmare to program on a usual single PC. Thus it is either too early to define \"open\" for AI. Or \"open\" must be truly open. Though it remains not practically achievable at home or even at small companies. reply Shamar 7 hours agorootparentprevCompiling Emacs on a PDP-11 wasn't cheap either.

The source code was the preferred form for modifications. The same is not true of these models. To my knowledge no company has retrained a model from scratch to make a modification to it. They make new models, but these are fundamentally different works with different parameter counts and architectures. When they want to improve on a model that they already built, they fine tune the weights. If that's what companies that own all the IP do, that tells me that the weights themselves are the preferred form for making modifications, which makes them source code under the gpl's definition. reply raverbashing 13 hours agorootparentprevCompletely agree There's a much simpler analogy: a photo You can't have an \"Open source photo\" because that would require shipping everything (but the camera) that shows up in the photo so that someone could \"recreate\" the photo It doesn't make sense.

And the training set is also source code. All those pieces have to be open to have a fully open system.

Companies want to make money. Their asset is data, access to customers, hardware and integration. They want to \"open source\" models, so that other people improve their models for free, and then they can take them back, and sell them, or build something profitable using them. The idea is that, like with other software, eventually, the open source version becomes the best, or just as good as the commercial ones, and companies that build on top no longer have to pay for those, and can use the open source ones. But if what you want out of \"open source\" is open knowledge, peeking at how something is built, and being able to take that and fork it for your own. Well, you kind of need the data. And your goal in this case is more freedom, using things that you have full access to inspect, alter, repair, modify, etc. To me, both are valid, we just need a name for one and a name for the other, and then we can clearly filter for what we are looking for. reply rdsubhas 3 hours agoprevThere are already hundreds of OSI licenses for source code.

But training data is not part of the preferred form for making modifications to an existing AI system. The insights and correlations in that data have already been learned. This makes sense. What the OSI gets right here is that the artifact that is made open source is the weights. Making modifications to the weights is called fine tuning and does not require the original training data any more than making modifications to a piece of source code requires the brain of the original developer. Tens of thousands of people have fine-tuned these models for as long as they've been around. Years ago I trained GPT-2 to produce text resembling Shakespeare. For that I needed Shakespeare, not GPT-2's training data. The training data is properly part of the development process of the open source artifact, not part of the artifact itself. Some open source companies (GitLab) make their development process fully open.

I believe that should be the \"know it when I see it\" test for open-source: has enough information been released for a competent programmer (or team) to understand the how the software actually works? I understand the analogy to other types of critical data often not included in open-source distros (e.g Quake III's source is GPL but its resources like textures are not, as mentioned in the article). The distinction is in these cases the data does not clarify anything about the functioning of the engine, nor does its absence obscure anything. So by my earlier smell test it makes sense to say Quake III is open source. But open-sourcing a transformer ANN without the training data tells us almost nothing about the internal functioning of the software. The exact same source code might be a medical diagnosis machine, or a simple translator. It does not pass my smell test to say this counts as \"open source.\" It makes more sense to say that ANNs are data-as-code programming paradigms, glued together by a bit of Python. An analogy would be if id released its build scripts and announced Quake III was open-source, but claimed the .cpp and .h files were proprietary data.

Anthropic's research is shedding light on interpretability, there has been good work done on the computational complexity side, and I am quite confident that the issue is LLM's newness and complexity, not that the problem is actually intractable (or specifically \"more intractable\" than other hopelessly complex software like Facebook or Windows). To the extent the problem is intractable, I think kt mostly reflects that LLMs have an enormous amount of training data and do an enormous amount of things. But for a given specific problem the training data can tell you a lot: - whether there is test contamination with respect to LLM benchmarks or other assessments of performance - whether there's any CSAM, racist rants, or other things you don't want - whether LLM weakness in a certain domain is due to an absence of data or if there's a more serious issue - whether LLM strength in a domain is due to unusually large amounts of synthetic training data and hence might not generalize very reliably in production (this is distinct from test contamination - it is issues like \"the LLM is great at multiplication until you get to 8 digits, and after 12 digits it's useless\") - investigating oddness like that LeetMagikarp (or whatever) glitch in ChatGPT reply blackeyeblitzar 16 hours agorootparentprevBut training data can itself be examined for biases, and the curation of data also brings in biased.

The content, spread by Russian state media and networks of social media accounts and websites, criticizes the federal response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, exploiting legitimate concerns about the recovery effort in an attempt to paint American leaders as incompetent and corrupt, according to research from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. The London-based organization tracks disinformation and online extremism. In some cases, the claims about the storms include fake images created using artificial intelligence, such as a photo depicting scenes of devastating flooding at Disney World that never happened, researchers say. RELATED: Misinformation is 'really hurting' those in western North Carolina, Gov. Cooper says The approach is consistent with the Kremlin's long-standing practice of identifying legitimate debates and contentious issues in the U.S. and then exploiting them. Previous disinformation campaigns have harnessed debates about immigration, racism, crime and the economy in an effort to portray the U.S. as corrupt, violent and unjust. U.S. intelligence officials and private tech companies say Russian activity has increased sharply before the Nov. 5 election as Moscow tries to capitalize on an opportunity to undermine its chief global adversary. By seizing on real concerns about disaster recovery, Russia's disinformation agencies can worm their way into U.S. discourse, using hot-button issues to undermine Americans' trust in their government and each other. \"These are not situations that foreign actors are creating,\" said Melanie Smith, director of research at ISD. \"They're simply pouring gasoline on fires that already exist.\" The content identified by ISD included English-language posts obviously meant for Americans, as well as Russian-language propaganda intended for domestic audiences. Much of the disinformation took aim at the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Democratic administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. She is her party's nominee in the White House race against former President Donald Trump. Russia's invasion of Ukraine remains the Kremlin's prime motivation for spreading lies about the hurricane response. If Russia can persuade enough Americans to oppose U.S. support for Ukraine, that could ease the way for a Moscow victory, officials and analysts have said. U.S. intelligence officials have said Russia's disinformation seems designed to support Trump, who has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and disparaged the NATO alliance and Ukraine's leaders. Posts linked to Russia routinely denigrate Harris, saying she is ignoring the pleas of storm victims. By contrast, a recent post from Russian state media company RT called Trump \"a mystical figure of historic proportions.\" Intelligence officials confirmed Tuesday that Russia created a manipulated video to smear Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Russia has rejected claims that it trying to meddle in the U.S. election. The Russian Embassy hasn't responded to messages this week seeking comment about recent allegations by researchers and intelligence officials. ALSO SEE: FEMA has faced criticism and praise during Helene. Here's what it does - and doesn't do Researchers at ISD found that Russian disinformation agents exploited weak content moderation on U.S.-owned social media platforms such as X to spread their content far and wide. Before it was purchased and renamed by Elon Musk, the platform once known as Twitter required labels on content from authoritarian state media. Musk rescinded that rule and gutted the platform's content moderation efforts, leading to a surge in foreign propaganda, hate speech and extremist recruitment. Often the false or misleading claims come from fake accounts or websites that mimic Americans or legitimate news outlets, making it difficult to determine their true origin. Unsuspecting Americans then repost and spread the content. In July, American intelligence officials warned that \"unwitting Americans\" were helping do Russia's work for it. Vast armies of fake or automated accounts help spread the material further. Researchers at the Israeli tech firm Cyabra analyzed popular posts on X that criticized FEMA for its storm response. A significant number could not be verified as belonging to a real person; one-quarter of all the responses to popular posts were deemed fake. The posts were seen by users over half a billion times. In response, a spokesperson for X pointed to the platform's system that allows users to add context to posts with false claims. The company did not respond to questions about its labeling policy. \"The false claims, ranging from FEMA diverting funds to aid migrants to conspiracy theories about weather manipulation, undermine public trust in government as we near election day, which could seriously impact voter confidence,\" Cyabra researchers said in a report. Politicians also have helped spread Russia's talking points. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., gave an interview to the Russian state media outlet Sputnik News for a piece that played up criticism of the hurricane response. He told Sputnik that the federal response was \"nonexistent,\" a claim easily debunked by photos and videos of FEMA recovery workers as well as the firsthand accounts of local leaders and residents in hard-hit regions. Gosar repeated another misleading claim that \"billions of FEMA disaster funds\" had been given instead to immigrants without legal status. In truth, money that funds U.S. border control and immigration programs comes from a different source than disaster funds. Gosar's office did not respond to messages seeking comment Wednesday.

Of course totalitarian regimes exist to keep the totalitarian regime in power, at the expense if necessary of everything else. But the Russian state is comprised of the core ethnic Russian territory, which we think of as Russia, but then also have a VERY large population and land exposure of the -Stans as vassal states to be exploited. None of those stans want to be with Russia. Of course for Russia, losing control of those provinces will mean exposure on all sides from continental invasion, a massive loss of resources and wealth, and worst of all would motivate the regime to be toppled as weak. It would be foolish to think the Russians aren't doing it. There was demonstrable evidence of them interfering in the Clinton-Trump election. There is hints of substantial dark money sloshing around Washington from China and Russia. Why would there not, when Saudi (notice how almost every President goes to Saudi Arabia to kiss ass at the end of their terms?) and Israeli already is, although those are more clear geopolitical interests. Because the quiet agreement on both sides of the aisle is \"don't stop any money trains\", there isn't the proper attention on this influence, but the Ukraine funding holdup, which was really funny money accounting of valuing old stockpiles being pulled from warehouses that was going to just be scrapped in the near future anyway, was a bizarre political event. To me that really felt like Russian dark money, because the Ukrainians were basically kept without ammo for months and months and the Russians made substantial gains. Why would they not? Regardless, the current administration is still showing weakness and taking it. The Russians are constantly escalating the war, and are now shipping in foreign North Korean troops, and NATO should respond in kind with its own direct troop assistance. The Russians have for decades bragged about fomenting discontent in foreign powers, ironically as their country has economically and demographically faded.

Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\".[26] The IRA also sought to \"provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States\".\" \"The second method of Russian interference saw the Russian military intelligence agency GRU hacking into email accounts owned by volunteers and employees of the Clinton presidential campaign, including that of campaign chairman John Podesta, and also hacking into \"the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC)\". As a result, the GRU obtained hundreds of thousands of hacked documents, and the GRU proceeded by arranging releases of damaging hacked material via the WikiLeaks organization and also GRU's false personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0\".\" \"The investigation found there were at least 140 contacts between Trump or 18 of his associates with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks, or their intermediaries, though the contacts were insufficient to show an illegal conspiracy.[\" \"Ryan Goodman has examined the Mueller report's findings on collusion.

No doubt that is against the law. Is it Trump's fault? Absolutely not, any more than it is Harris's fault that she got Putin's endorsement in 2024. Any so-called Russian influence campaign was certainly never linked to him, despite the fact that the government wiretapped his campaign. Yes you read that right. They wiretapped his campaign. Can you imagine what Democrats would say if their candidate was wiretapped based on a hoax originating from the other party? >\"The investigation found there were at least 140 contacts between Trump or 18 of his associates with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks, or their intermediaries, though the contacts were insufficient to show an illegal conspiracy.\" So what? A billionaire politician with global interests knows some foreigners. This is neither surprising nor incriminating. >\"Ryan Goodman has examined the Mueller report's findings on collusion. He described the findings as \"a series of activities that show strong evidence of collusion. Or, more precisely, it provides significant evidence that Trump Campaign associates coordinated with, cooperated with, encouraged, or gave support to the Russia/WikiLeaks election interference activities.\" I don't care if some scholar says there is \"strong evidence of collusion\" because frankly, if the Mueller report contained strong evidence of collusion then it would have reached a different conclusion, and Trump would have been prosecuted for actual crimes related to foreign interference.

Libya, Syria, Iraq, etc. Problem is, the opposition quickly learns your tactics & turns it on you. And, because the US is a democratic state that can't just make people disappear, you'll have a harder time coping. Roughly half of all Americans believe the last election was stolen and are gearing up for unrest if this one doesn't go their way. But, everyone conveniently forgets that US agents deliberately spread anti-China propaganda, encouraging countries not to accept China's vaccines. Who knows how many died as a result? So, instead of blaming this on the Russians (& Chinese), maybe America should do some soul-searching? It's just like how NATO's Libya & Syria intervention caused a migrant explosion. It's okay to dislike illegal migrants, but you need to address why they suddenly became a pressing problem after living in their countries all this while.

Nowhere did I advocate for doing so, or continuing to do so. In general, the US has followed a reckless know-it-all policy of regime change that has backfired many more times than it has ever worked, and is overall a net negative even for the US. This is different--it is a strategic public deterrent. It isn't directly goal oriented, only deterrence oriented, and any country will have a simple way to stop it at any time--stop putting disinfo into the US infosphere. And in fact, this works better if the US stops doing these things for any other purpose. reply IAmGraydon 16 hours agorootparentprevThat's sort of a digital MAD. An interesting idea. Beyond that, US sites which willingly allow the spread of misinformation should be heavily fined. Reddit, for example, is a complete cesspool of foreign influence campaigns. It's not like it's hard to pick up on. They target populations that are already likely to believe misinformation and conspiracies. The conspiracy subreddit, for example, is rife with obviously foreign accounts that come out of nowhere, post divisive misinformation tens or even hundreds of times per day, and the posts get thousands of upvotes out of nowhere. The idea is that if you seed a small contingent of the population with misinformation, they will do the rest of the work and spread it for you in the rest of the population. No, Reddit cannot do away with 100% of this, but it is absolutely clear that they aren't even trying to control it. That has to stop. A simple change like requiring phone verification before you can create an account (and not allowing Google voice numbers) would do a lot to quell this. They don't care.

Governments break their own laws constantly. reply fragmede 10 hours agorootparentThere's a difference between, say, Watergate, and making and spreading memes that say FEMA will only give you $750 if your house gets destroyed. If FEMA is violating their own policies, that's one thing, and very much should get investigated, but rumors are being spread that are just made up. reply wakawaka28 5 hours agorootparentPersonally I have seen plenty of first-hand accounts from people that FEMA is nowhere in sight, they were turned down for the $750 per household (which appears to be a very narrow benefit for uninsured homes), and when FEMA was around they were seizing supplies and generally getting in the way. The same kind of thing happened surrounding the Maui fires. The people from that disaster are still complaining about the FEMA response. They are most likely being forced off of their very valuable land, and the government is behind it all. In the early stages of dealing with a disaster, rumor is an important source of information. When communication is cut off and travel is restricted, what exactly do you expect? Especially when government misconduct is suspected. Again, if you give government the power to suppress criticism, it often will. Regardless of whether the rumors are substantiated or not, this is America and people have the right to say what is on their mind even if it hurts the feelings of FEMA. To listen to FEMA, the rumors about them are more devastating than the actual disaster. From the start they took a position of \"this criticism is interfering with our work\" which is a gross exaggeration at best, and a pernicious lie in the minds of anyone with common sense. FEMA has long been a subject of controversy, as they seize supplies donated for disasters and redistrubute them or even sell them: https://www.facingsouth.org/2008/06/gulf-coast-nonprofits-le... You should look into this as well, a controversy involving FEMA's role in hypothetically putting Americans in concentration camps: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_84 The government has absolutely no problem with trampling on your rights under the pretense of a disaster. They'll screw you over. As far as I remember in any disaster before a couple of years ago, including Hurricane Katrina, FEMA has not stopped to demanding that people refrain from criticism.

    "originBody": "Feds Say You Don’t Have a Right to Check Out Retro Video Games Like Library Books The U.S. Copyright Office denied an exemption from the DMCA to allow gaming historians to access out-of-print games they can’t legally get anywhere else. By Kyle Barr Updated October 25, 2024Comments (57)𝕏 Copied! © Photo: Daniel Boczarski / Getty Images Most of the world’s video games from close to 50 years of history are effectively, legally dead. A Video Games History Foundation study found you can’t buy nearly 90% of games from before 2010. Preservationists have been looking for ways to allow people to legally access gaming history, but the U.S. Copyright Office dealt them a heavy blow Friday. Feds declared that you or any researcher has no right to access old games under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA. Groups like the VGHF and the Software Preservation Network have been putting their weight behind an exemption to the DMCA surrounding video game access. The law says that you can’t remotely access old, defunct games that are still under copyright without a license, even though they’re not available for purchase. Current rules in the DMCA restrict libraries and repositories of old games to one person at a time, in person. The foundation’s proposed exemption would have allowed more than one person at a time to access the content stored in museums, archives, and libraries. This would allow players to access a piece of video game history like they would if they checked out an ebook from a library. The VGHF and SPN argued that if the museum has several copies of a game in its possession, then it should be able to allow as many people to access the game as there are copies available. In the Copyright Office’s decision dated Oct. 18 (found on Page 30), Director Shira Perlmutter agreed with multiple industry groups, including the Entertainment Software Association. She recommended the Library of Congress keep the same restrictions. Section 1201 of the DMCA restricts “unauthorized” access to copyrighted works, including games. However, it allows the Library of Congress to allow some classes of people to circumvent those restrictions. https://t.co/tuGsUZMrcp pic.twitter.com/AyPu072rrY — Video Game History Foundation (@GameHistoryOrg) October 25, 2024 In a statement, the VGHF said lobbying efforts from rightsholders “continue to hold back progress.” The group pointed to comments from a representative from the ESA. An attorney for the ESA told Ars Technica, “I don’t think there is at the moment any combinations of limitations that ESA members would support to provide remote access.” Video game preservationists said these game repositories could provide full-screen popups of copyright notices to anybody who checked out a game. They would also restrict access to a time limit or force users to access via “technological controls,” like a purpose-built distribution of streaming platforms. Industry groups argued that those museums didn’t have “appropriate safeguards” to prevent users from distributing the games once they had them in hand. They also argued that there’s a “substantial market” for older or classic games, and a new, free library to access games would “jeopardize” this market. Perlmutter agreed with the industry groups. “While the Register appreciates that proponents have suggested broad safeguards that could deter recreational uses of video games in some cases, she believes that such requirements are not specific enough to conclude that they would prevent market harms,” she wrote. Do libraries that lend books hurt the literary industry? In many cases, publishers see libraries as free advertising for their products. It creates word of mouth, and since libraries only have a limited number of copies, those who want a book to read for longer are incentivized to purchase one. The video game industry is so effective at shooting itself in the foot that it doesn’t even recognize when third-party preservationists are actively about to help them for no cost on the publishers’ part. If there is such a substantial market for classic games, why are so many still unavailable for purchase? Players will inevitably turn to piracy or emulation if there’s no easy-to-access way of playing older games. “The game industry’s absolutist position… forces researchers to explore extra-legal methods to access the vast majority of out-of-print video games that are otherwise unavailable,” the VGHF wrote.

You absolutely can check out video games just like library books -- physically. What the article says is libraries can't make digital copies of the games and lend them remotely over the internet. Nothing is preventing traditional physical lending. I personally think it's time Congress got around to putting all works that haven't been commercially available for e.g. 5 years into the public domain. That's the easiest way to fix this. But that's the job of Congress, not the US Copyright Office. reply jonhohle 4 hours agoparentThere’s a bunch of legal precedent - Zediva, Redd Horne, Aereo, Professional Real Estate Investors, etc. http://laboratorium.net/archive/2011/03/16/that_zediva_thing... I’m in the middle of writing to the EFF to see if they would clarify if this pertains to non-profit educational organizations employees/volunteers. E.g. if an organization of researchers are providing educational information about games, can they privately access the same physical copy remotely sitting in a drive somewhere. The rules from 2018 don’t appear to support this, unfortunately. A lot of research is currently restricted by the inflated cost of long out of print games. Dozens or hundreds of people might want to contribute, but if a non-EULA encumbered, physical copy costs hundreds of dollars it becomes harder to find people who both have copies and the skills or desire to do work as well. reply johnnyanmac 6 hours agoparentprevbest I Can do is 90 years after the death of the author. 5 is much too short, though. and \"commercially available\" is very exploitable. I think a flat 20-30 years would work out fine. 20 is generaally when we call a title \"retro\" anyway, right? reply crazygringo 5 hours agorootparent> 5 is much too short, though. and \"commercially available\" is very exploitable. It's not too short for things that have stopped being sold. If a book or video game has no more commercial value in selling, why not end its copyright? I'm not saying 5 years after something is published. I'm saying 5 years after it stops being sold by the publisher. If a publisher wants to \"exploit\" that by keeping everything in print, then great. We still keep the existing copyright limits. But I guarantee you most of the stuff no longer being sold, they don't care about because it's not profitable anymore. If it was profitable, they'd still be selling it. reply johnnyanmac 14 minutes agorootparent>It's not too short for things that have stopped being sold. If a book or video game has no more commercial value in selling, why not end its copyright? Well that's more for exploiting. They can stop making copies of say, Horizon Zero dawn that came out in 2017. And maybe they stop selling it in 2019 (in this theoretical) . Just when the 5 years are almost up, they start making another retail run of it, or the remaster in this case. Repeat and iterate until you get bored. > I guarantee you most of the stuff no longer being sold, they don't care about because it's not profitable anymore. If it was profitable, they'd still be selling it. I want to thank that, but companies still prefer to hoard IP's, if only to keep others from working with it. There are several IP's from now defunct companies that got picked up by non-gaming studios, who obviously have no intention of ever making a game. They just want a cut if anyone ever wants to try. Or to sue when fans try to do stuff with it. For 5 years in advance, it's not hard to keep a disc run or remaster in mind. Just look at Sony. For a longer term like 20 years they need to be more creative. reply jonhohle 3 hours agorootparentprevVideo games are particularly egregious because even if an old game is currently sold under the same name, it often is not the same game: * it’s running via emulation or has been recompiled for a different architecture with noticeable changes from the original (control latency, graphical differences, fixed/new bugs) * content has been added or removed (often due to licensing) * an EULA has been added or modified * it’s not playable on the hardware where it was originally released This is unlike books and music, which rarely change, or movies where it happens but is certainly not common. Video games are different, though. The Genesis version of Sonic 3 has a different soundtrack than all others and hasn’t been available since 1997. Symphony of the Night had the most similar rerelease in 2006 on XBLA, but everything since has been a version with many big fixes and additions based on the PSP version. Final Fantasy VI has had many “enhanced” versions, but surprisingly the original ROM was available until the Wii U eShop shut down last year. Also aurprisingly, new old stock of the PS1 version could be bought from Square Enix up until a few years ago. There are countless other remasters or ports that replace the original which is then never sold again. reply crazygringo 3 hours agorootparentNone of that presents any kind of legal difficulty. If a game is recompiled under a new architecture, it's still the same graphics and text and levels and everything. It's not really any different from a new printing of a book in paperback instead of hardcover and in a different font. The copyright on those elements remains intact. If you're simply talking about access to previous versions for researchers and archivists, that's more of a question of archival practices than of copyright. Which is a very interesting conversation, but a totally separate one. reply dragonmost 2 hours agorootparentprevHow would you deal with digital versions now? Publishers will just leave all the PC versions on steam and call it a day. Those will never expire as long as the publisher remains in business. reply johnnyanmac 12 minutes agorootparentYeah, that's the other can of worms that I didn't go into. Even if a game gets delisted from steam, they can just whip up that digital copy \"for sale\" on their website or any other cheaper platform (since sales are No longer the priority, just keeping the copyright is). reply maxsilver 4 hours agorootparentprevIt should be \"20 years or whenever it's not commercially available, whichever comes first\" Otherwise, we'll still see companies make stuff and kill it and sit on it for decades. (Often binning fully-finished releases without ever letting it be sold ever -- see Discovery and Disney's recent releases) Preservation should start the minute access is threatened, not some decades later when it's likely too late. reply crazygringo 2 hours agorootparentThat's more of a question of weird tax law quirks related to corporate mergers, not copyright. It's not generally profitable to make stuff and then not sell it immediately. And I certainly don't want to start a precedent where people are forced to publish things they don't want to. That's kind of the polar opposite of freedom and liberty. reply 1970-01-01 5 hours agorootparentprevThe retro wave hits everyone around 30 years, and again around 50. It would be interesting to have a non-continuous copyright claim. The first 15 years it's yours, then 15-30 it's public, 30-60 it's yours again, and finally 60+ it's public domain forever. reply ballenf 6 hours agoparentprevThe photo doubled down on the misleading headline. reply proc0 11 hours agoprevI don't see where they outline the difference between games and books. This makes no sense at all. I can see where they would draw a line with proprietary IPs like old Nintendo games, but there's probably hundreds of thousands of games that have no owner. I'm tired of video games being treated as something that they're not. They're not services and they're not just for entertainment. It's an art form and they become part of the broader culture, not to mention their full potential as an interactive medium has only barely started to be explored. reply SkySkimmer 10 hours agoparentIf there's no owner what stops the games from being distributed? Shouldn't it mean there's noone who can sue the distributor? reply serial_dev 6 hours agorootparentSuspecting nobody will sue you is not good enough for a distributor, I assume. It also means nobody is there to give you permission to something that is clearly not yours, which sounds risky. And still, someone with the rights might show up at any point. And as others mentioned, I’m not even sure if the market is big enough. reply techjamie 4 hours agorootparentprevMost abandonware isn't really that cut and dry. During the NES/DOS days you might have seen companies fold and their IP become owned by no one. But even then, in many cases, the IP ended up being sold, and over the years ping-pongs around new owners. Many times those new owners aren't really concerned with some 30 year old game from an IP they may not even remember having being distributed, but the fact they still could at a moment's notice is a possible threat. But yeah, if there truly is no existing owner, it's basically free game (literally). reply proc0 9 hours agorootparentprevI guess no one would stop someone from distributing, but presumably there isn't a huge market for these games and therefore no incentive. I was thinking it had more to do with preventing competition or something like that. reply chrisshroba 7 hours agoparentprev> not to mention their full potential as an interactive medium has only barely started to be explored.

The game is 22 years old and it's still leagues ahead of most games in terms of what a game can do, what it can express. Rez is... difficult to describe but a start might be, it's Polybius (legendary arcade game) if it were developed by raver hippies. Its purpose seems to be inducing an altered mental state of \"flow\" and the joy that comes therewith. Rez has the property of being so good that other developers (expectedly) made games that try to do what Rez did, missed the mark completely, and still ended up with really cool games. Thumper, Aaero, and Sayonara Wild Hearts come to mind, as does Jeff Minter's take on Polybius. reply jkolio 4 hours agorootparentI've always joked that Sayonara Wild Hearts is a dimensional incursion from a reality where the Feel The Magic DS games never stopped coming out. It's interesting, the way influences collide in new works. https://imgur.com/a/IzWkRjP.jpg reply guerrilla 10 hours agoparentprev> I don't see where they outline the difference between games and books. The difference is in who's money and how much is behind the law at the relevant points in time. reply proc0 9 hours agorootparentSure, I was just wondering their reasoning behind it. Surely it can't be blatantly about making money, but maybe it is. reply guerrilla 9 hours agorootparentI don't know but I think it's not just about the old games that aren't produced anymore. I think it could be about protecting profit in other areas. They may want to control the Overton window so that it doesn't become thinkable that the same thing could happen to other video games or media. If a library is able to buy a video game and loan it out for free online, then that could become a problem for some models. Is it possible to loan movies and TV series online in libraries now? If you have the resources, then a maximalist IP agenda would be the most rational, to extract as many rights as possible because it creates wider moat for attackers to cross. You keep them busy fighting things that don't matter to you, so they stay far away from your core business interests. reply Y_Y 7 hours agorootparent> is it possible to loan movies and TV series online in libraries now? Absolutely. In fact it's unusually popular. In undergrad I remember the only people reading physics books were physics students, but it wasn't only film/media studies etc checking out DVDs. I'm just about old enough that unlimited streaming wasn't ubiquitous, so people would go to the video stations in the library and bingewatch there. edit: despite my anecdote, this service is available online too, see for example the service, Overdrive, which is popular with municipal libraries. reply chgs 6 hours agorootparentThis isn’t about checking out physical books, dvds or games cartridges. reply realusername 7 hours agorootparentprev> If you have the resources, then a maximalist IP agenda would be the most rational, to extract as many rights as possible because it creates wider moat for attackers to cross. That's the answer, the IP conglomerates aren't arguing in good faith, they just want to defend their moat as much as possible and push the debate outside of rethinking media consumption in the digital age. Those IP conglomerates have nothing to gain from any legislation change, they basically already have all the rights they could possibly have and want to keep their position. If that means throwing away some old games under the bus, they are happy with that. reply StewardMcOy 3 hours agoparentprevThe article is missing a lot of context. The Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) has gone into this in great detail on their podcast, and slightly less detail on their blog. In summary: Every three years, the US Copyright Office considers petitions for exemptions to the DMCA. The big famous example that everyone talks about is in 2015, teachers won the right to bypass DVD copy protection to preserve teaching materials. This exemption had been rejected at least twice previously, but they finally won approval in 2015. Every three years though, it's a fight. Previous exemptions can also be withdrawn during these proceedings if the Copyright Office or the Librarian of Congress believes that the exemptions are not working as planned and are harming the market. For a long time now, folks like the Internet Archive have been petitioning to legally allow digital lending of all kinds of content, including video games. This is far from the first time this exemption has been considered. However, these proceedings include testimony and discussion, and the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) always sends lobbyists to oppose the exemptions. In the past, one of their main arguments that worked was that those who wanted to allow digital lending were customers and enthusiasts who wanted to open their own digital arcades. There was no serious scholarship behind it. They also were able to imply that video games weren't culturally important like books or movies because they were purely entertainment, and therefore not worth studying or preserving. And this argument worked because indeed, the Registrar of Copyrights saw video games as lesser cultural artifacts. That's one of the reasons why organizations like the VGHF became so important to the fight. By proving that there is an academic community and non-profits engaged in treating video games as seriously as they deserve. Because of that the ESA shifted its argument completely to the economic harms to the retro game market. To counteract that argument, the VGHF performed a study last year showed that 87% of video games are no longer commercially available, so there's there's no market to ruin if those 87% were allowed to lend. They even proposed a lot of safeguards to limit the number of copies lent and DRM schemes to prevent borrowers from dumping the ROMs (which are out there anyway). The ESA countered that those games would still be competing with retro games that are still being sold on the market, and that the protections weren't good enough. DRM can be cracked, and they don't trust the people who want to lend the games to not introduce side-channels to get around the restrictions. In their argument, only the rights holders can properly protect their games, and only with help from the DMCA. It's worth noting that the Registrar of Copyright is famously even more strict than rights holders at these arguments sometimes. In 2012, they denied the request for teachers to break DVD encryption, even though lobbyists for the motion picture industry said they would accept it. And so that's what this news is about. Despite the lobbying and the studies, they sided with the ECA, seemingly taking their arguments all at face value. I should also note that publishers do often go after libraries for lending books. It's often said in these circles that if lending books through a library weren't already common when the DMCA was enacted, we'd have to fight just as hard every 3 years to get exemptions for what libraries have always done, and we still probably wouldn't get everything. reply badlibrarian 11 hours agoprev> Current rules in the DMCA restrict libraries and repositories of old games to one person at a time, in person.

I understand that the current state of copyright put them on thin- to no-ice. But that shouldn't be the case, IMHO. It's a net gain for the universe to let them loan these out-of-print materials. Publishers are working hard to make sure it's very expensive or impossible to do Internet lending.

If someone wants to republish an out-of-print novel that's still in copyright, they should at least have to pay royalties - perhaps it's acceptable if the author can't refuse a reprinting, but they definitely need to get paid.

The law keeps contorting itself into knots to entrench specific versions of the past. The Aereo lawsuit comes to mind as wildly anti-civilian, concocted to make the legal regime as tall and wide as possible. It's just so sad that legalism and Terms of Service feel like they are in a race to remain bigger than technology & possibility, to keep things the same. reply AStonesThrow 11 hours agoprevThe missing word from this inflammatory headline is extremely important: \"remotely\". You can certainly access the physical game media in person, and check it out, no problem. The DMCA controversy is over remote access. reply michaelbrave 8 hours agoparentthat becomes more difficult though since older games are in essence collectors items and would be stolen or not returned. It's like if most of the books in the library were out of print books that were highly collectable, a recipe for disaster. Not saying they made the wrong call here or anything, but there is clearly a gap here between old games being made available and legal options to access them, libraries tried to own a physical copy and distribute a digital copy, which was an attempt at a fair compromise, but if that isn't allowed either then I guess piracy is the only options now. reply chgs 6 hours agorootparentOr having your government change copyright law reply BriggyDwiggs42 11 hours agoparentprevWait, why would that matter at all? reply AStonesThrow 3 hours agorootparentBecause until GOG and Steam, most video games were manufactured and distributed as physical artifacts, such as cartridges. A ripped ROM image in an emulator is not equivalent to an Atari or Nintendo cartridge. We do acknowledge that these artifacts are discontinued, and extremely valuable, but under DMCA, you literally can't have your cake and eat it too: the cake is a lie. reply izacus 9 hours agorootparentprevYeah, especially since the publishers have ceased to produce physical media completely. reply deafpolygon 12 hours agoprev [–] That's kind of expected. Folks over at the emualtion subreddit @ reddit are foaming at the mouth... when it doesn't even apply to them. Did they expect that they would allow folks to check out other software like Photoshop at the Library? reply vaylian 12 hours agoparentPhotoshop can still be purchased. This is about software that is no longer offered on the market. reply fragmede 12 hours agorootparentPedantically, Adobe no longer sells it out right, but they do let you rent it at various price levels via Creative Cloud. https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/plans.html reply dvfjsdhgfv 12 hours agorootparentThat's correct - today if you want to actually buy Adobe Photoshop, you have to buy from a vendor other than Adobe (and you will miss some recent features). reply robinsonb5 8 hours agoparentprevIf you're a computer historian, there'd be some value in being able to check out an ancient version that, for example, works on 68k Macs. reply jhbadger 4 hours agorootparentAt least my local public library has hundreds of CD-ROMs of Mac and Windows software (mostly from the 1990s when boxed software was still standard) that you can check out. Granted, I can imagine that's the sort of thing that will get \"weeded\" in a decade or so when the library needs space and they see this old software as being worthless. reply jonhohle 3 hours agorootparentAs others have mentioned, some of that software is become very rare and collectible. Would a library lend a copy of “Indiana Jones in Revenge of the Ancients”? reply Spivak 4 hours agoparentprev [–] > Did they expect that they would allow folks to check out other software like Photoshop at the Library? Ominous-they would really like to disallow it. But yes, of course you should. When you get a license key that's a seat. Commercial software has been making this work forever with license servers. Like this isn't some crazy mental model. When you buy an iPhone you bought the hardware and one indefinite transferable license to run iOS. How else should software ownership work? reply jonhohle 3 hours agorootparent [–] Licensing is different from fair use and copyright. The games the original article is describing had no license and were only protected by copyright (no different than a book or movie). Licenses can both permit and restrict things that copyright and fair use allow or don’t allow. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Also the idea of running commands and code from Markdown is obviously awesome. I think you'll find that the folks you get to use this will want a ton more features, like project wide config, interactive stdin, .ENV tooling, passing of variables between inputs and a lot more. That's why we built runme.dev, the kernel is built in Go, please come join our community and contribute. reply kitd 19 minutes agoprevCongratulations! Nice work. If you like this, another similar tool, though one specifically geared towards builds, is xc. https://xcfile.dev/ reply luckman212 7 hours agoprevFor Obsidian users, I'm a fan of the Execute Code[0] plugin which allows exexution of codeblocks straight from your notes.

It will allow you to run tests on your code samples, ensuring that they are up to date and working with the most recent library release. We were in progress of doing this with Shopify.dev before I left. reply pomdtr 1 hour agoprevI would prefer an api base on codeblocks meta string and json attributes. ```sh name=\"build\" deps=[\"install\"] npm run build ``` This would be displayed just fine in github, as it is valid gfm. reply oezi 5 hours agoprevSimilar in Ruby/shameless pluck: https://github.com/coezbek/baker I call this a Project-Setup-as-Code tool. Supports backticks for shell and triple backticks for executing Ruby code. If blocks are successfully executed they are marked as done (using markdown [x] checkboxes). So you can incrementally run a file without executing stuff twice. reply theK 4 hours agoprevCool idea. Stuff like this reminds me why I like the vim ecosystem so much. At least since the introduction of terminal buffers, most people I know that use vim for serious code work have a form of \"send text under cursor to shell\" reply dingnuts 4 hours agoparentHelix and Emacs have that built in by the way reply Galanwe 5 hours agoprevCool, at last we can now `curlmdx` Github readmes instead of copy pasting `curlbash` from them! reply aziis98 3 hours agoparentNote: If one writes a cell with \"you can install this with `curlmdx`\" this ends up in an infinite loop xD. reply lioeters 4 hours agoparentprevThat's both exhilarating and terrifying at the same time.

In some of my projects I have little snippets of cli commands in the main README. When I open the project in JetBrains IDE and I open the README of my project there, I can click on each code block to run it. This way I can for example start up dependencies like say a little python3 web server to serve static files from one of the subdirs, simply by clicking on it in the readme. Instead of copy-pasting from the readme, and even instead of Ctrl+R in a terminal window and finding the correct commands for a project from history. It almost reminds me a little bit of Plan9 and their Acme editor, where they were blurring the lines between text and commands. In Acme you can type a piece of text and then middle-button click I think it was to run the text as a command. Having executable blocks of code interspersed in a markdown document feels a little bit like that although in a different, more limited manner. reply codetrotter 5 hours agorootparentAlso to add, for a while in the past before I found that the IDE I use could execute code blocks I made a little program that would take each code block in a markdown document and run them one after the other, and it would look to see if a “text” fence followed right after the code fence. In that case it would write the output of that command into the text fence. If there was no text fence, it would run the command without inserting any of its input into the document. It was like a super rudimentary Jupyter Notebook system of my own making. Eventually I switched away from my own run-and-insert system. reply glyphacki 10 hours agoparentprevI can think of code examples in the documentation. At least you make sure the code is executed or even check the output of the examples. reply DJBunnies 5 hours agorootparentIf only we had a mechanism for demonstrating correct and incorrect ways to use a particular software. We could expect failure conditions or assert correct outcomes. It could become a little library of examples that change over time, as the software changes, granting us peace of mind that everything still works. reply starkparker 4 hours agoprevcf. rundown https://github.com/elseano/rundown reply dingnuts 4 hours agoprevah, someone has reimplemented another feature of Org Mode. Well, this will mean Org files exported to Markdown can remain executable just like they were in Emacs, so maybe this makes Org Babel more valuable as well, for those of us that prefer a structured markup language for notes and literate programming And thanks to pandoc it's not hard to go back and forth reply bluesnews 31 minutes agoparentThis idea isn't just from one source but that doesn't mean another implementation isn't worthy.

What do you think of Go? reply wdavidw 11 hours agoprevIt is similar to how CoffeeScript literate works. reply jpillora 8 hours agoprevSee also https://github.com/jpillora/md-tmpl reply javajosh 4 hours agoprevI wrote something similar, but for the web. I call it \"Literate Markdown\" (https://simpatico.io/lit.md) and you write markdown and your html/css/js/md code blocks are both exposed as text and as code blocks for execution in the browser. The format expects to a) be transformed and exposed by a special server (https://simpatico.io/reflector.md) and b) rendered in a browser. This code also includes a simple test harness that, for example, turns the favicon green/red depending on if exceptions are thrown in your code (https://simpatico.io/testable.js) I also wrote an acceptance test that loads most of the interesting parts of the site in iframes and combines their test output (https://simpatico.io/acceptance). That page also has notes for using headless chrome to run the tests. Also, the server (lazily) caches all transforms with file watcher invalidation, disallows 3rd party cookies, and starts up instantly. The central use case is to have a fun and fast way to play with browser code, using your favorite editor, and literate programming techniques. All while being open source, local first, and minimalist. The repo (https://github.com/javajosh/simpatico/) is not yet npm/npx compatible so you have to fork and run. This is a local first, minimalist project that has ~2 small dependencies, which themselves have no deps, so publishing was not a priority. Eventually I'd like to automate an md-> js process, such that the md is the canonical source for javascript and the final js is a build product. I'd also like to clean up the code and publish to npm, but sadly someone is squatting on the @simpatico handle and npm won't do anything. :( reply nicoburns 11 hours agoprevYou might want to reconsider the name. MDX is already a well-known technology that combines markdown with JSX https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/ reply jrajav 4 hours agoparentIt also sees very wide use, it's not just a proof of concept - most who've used any recent major version of Storybook (84k stars) would know about it: https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-docs/mdx reply ValentineC 1 hour agorootparentNot just Storybook, but most modern JavaScript-based static site generators, for example: - Astro: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/ - Docusaurus: https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react - Eleventy: https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/mdx/ - NextJS: https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/conf... reply edsammy 5 hours agoparentprevmarko or godown would be fun reply no_wizard 4 hours agorootparentMarko too is taken https://markojs.com/ reply zoover2020 7 hours agoparentprevCame here to say this, confusion ensued. reply 13 hours agoprev[deleted] nikolay 11 hours agoprev [–] You really didn't know Runme [0] existed?

Co-creator of https://github.com/stateful/runme here. We've expanded significantly onto the idea of a toy script/utility to bring multi-modality (editor, notebook, terminal, browser) with shared sessions to what's at the core, a universal task runner (see architecture link below).

The same goes for the author of `mdx`. https://docs.runme.dev/resources/architecture reply oezi 1 hour agorootparentprev [–] Great!
