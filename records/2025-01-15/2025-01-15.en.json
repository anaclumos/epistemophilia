    "originBody": "Don't use cosine similarity carelessly 14 Jan 2025by Piotr Migdał see Hacker News for the discussion Midas turned everything he touched into gold. Data scientists turn everything into vectors. We do it for a reason — as gold is the language of merchants, vectors are the language of AI. Just as Midas discovered that turning everything to gold wasn't always helpful, we'll see that blindly applying cosine similarity to vectors can lead us astray. While embeddings do capture similarities, they often reflect the wrong kind - matching questions to questions rather than questions to answers, or getting distracted by superficial patterns like writing style and typos rather than meaning. This post shows you how to be more intentional about similarity and get better results. Embeddings Embeddings are so captivating that my most popular blog post remains king - man + woman = queen; but why?. We have word2vec, node2vec, food2vec, game2vec, and if you can name it, someone has probably turned it into a vec. If not yet, it's your turn! When we work with raw IDs, we're blind to relationships. Take the words \"brother\" and \"sister\" — to a computer, they might as well be \"xkcd42\" and \"banana\". But with vectors, we can chart entities and relationships between them — both to provide as a structured input to a machine learning models, and on its own, to find similar items. Let's focus on sentence embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs), as they are one of the most popular use cases for embeddings. Modern LLMs are so powerful at this that they can capture the essence of text without any fine-tuning. In fact, recent research shows these embeddings are almost as revealing as the original text - see Morris et al., Text Embeddings Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text, (2023). Yet, with great power comes great responsibility - both in terms of how we use these powerful models and how we protect the privacy of the data we store and process. Example Let's look at three sentences: A: \"Python can make you rich.\" B: \"Python can make you itch.\" C: \"Mastering Python can fill your pockets.\" If you treated them as raw IDs, there are different strings, with no notion of similarity. Using string similarity (Levenshtein distance), A and B differ by 2 characters, while A and C are 21 characters apart. Yet semantically (unless you're allergic to money), A is closer to C than B. We can use OpenAI text-embedding-3-large, to get the following vectors: A: [-0.003738, -0.033263, -0.017596, 0.029024, -0.015251, ...] B: [-0.066795, -0.052274, -0.015973, 0.077706, 0.044226, ...] C: [-0.011167, 0.017812, -0.018655, 0.006625, 0.018506, ...] These vectors are quite long - text-embedding-3-large has up 3072 dimensions - to the point that we can truncate them at a minimal loss of quality. When we calculate cosine similarity, we get 0.750 between A and C (the semantically similar sentences), and 0.576 between A and B (the lexically similar ones). These numbers align with what we'd expect - the meaning matters more than spelling! What is cosine similarity? When comparing vectors, there's a temptingly simple solution that every data scientist reaches for — cosine similarity: Geometrically speaking, it is the cosine of the angle between two vectors. However, I avoid thinking about it this way - we're dealing with spaces of dozens, hundreds, or thousands of dimensions. Our geometric intuition fails us in such high-dimensional spaces, and we shouldn't pretend otherwise. From a numerical perspective, it is a dot product with normalized vectors. It has some appealing properties: Identical vectors score a perfect 1. Random vectors hover around 0 (there are many dimensions, so it averages out). The result is between -1 and 1. Yet, this simplicity is misleading. Just because the values usually fall between 0 and 1 doesn't mean they represent probabilities or any other meaningful metric. The value 0.6 tells little if we have something really similar, or not so much. And while negative values are possible, they rarely indicate semantic opposites — more often, the opposite of something is gibberish. When using cosine similarity on Glove vectors (glove.6B.300d), the closest words to \"dog\" are predictable, the farthest - not You can play with it in Colab from my Thinking in tensors, writing in PyTorch series. In other words, cosine similarity is the duct tape of vector comparisons. Sure, it sticks everything together — images, text, audio, code — but like real duct tape, it's a quick fix that often masks deeper problems rather than solving them. And just as you wouldn't use duct tape to permanently repair a water pipe, you shouldn't blindly trust cosine similarity for all your vector comparison needs. Like a Greek tragedy, this blessing comes with a curse: when it works, it feels like effortless magic. But when it fails, we are clueless, and we often run into impromptu fixes, each one bringing issues on its own. Relation to correlation Pearson correlation can be seen as a sequence of three operations: Subtracting means to center the data. Normalizing vectors to unit length. Computing dot products between them. When we work with vectors that are both centered () and normalized (), Pearson correlation, cosine similarity and dot product are the same. In practical cases, we don't want to center or normalize vectors during each pairwise comparison - we do it once, and just use dot product. In any case, when you are fine with using cosine similarity, you should be as fine with using Pearson correlation (and vice versa). Problems with cosine similarity as a measure of similarity Using cosine similarity as a training objective for machine learning models is perfectly valid and mathematically sound. As we just seen, it's a combination of two fundamental operations in deep learning: dot product and normalization. The trouble begins when we venture beyond its comfort zone, specifically when: The cost function used in model training isn't cosine similarity (usually it is the case!). The training objective differs from what we actually care about. Has the model ever seen cosine similarity? A common scenario involves training with unnormalized vectors, when we are dealing with a function of dot product - for example, predicting probabilities with a sigmoid function and applying log loss cost function. Other networks operate differently, e.g. they use Euclidean distance, minimized for members of the same class and maximized for members of different classes. The normalization gives us some nice mathematical properties (keeping results between -1 and +1, regardless of dimensions), but it's ultimately a hack. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't — see the aptly titled paper Is Cosine-Similarity of Embeddings Really About Similarity?. Sure, back in the days of an image detection model VGG16 I was using logit vectors from the classification layer and Pearson correlation to find similar images. It kind of worked - being fully aware it is a hack and just a hack. We are safe only if the model itself uses cosine similarity or a direct function of it - usually implemented as a dot product of vectors that are kept normalized. Otherwise, we use a quantity we have no control over. It may work in one instance, but not in another. If some things are extremely similar, sure, it is likely that many different measures of similarity will give similar results. But if they are not, we are in trouble. In general, it is a part of a broader subject of unsupervised machine vs self-supervised learning. In the first one, we take an arbitrary function and we get some notions or similarity. Yet, there is no way to evaluate it. The second one, self-supervised learning, is a predictive model, in which we can directly evaluate the quality of prediction. Is it the right kind of similarity? And here is the second issue - even if a model is explicitly trained on cosine similarity, we run into a deeper question: whose definition of similarity are we using? Consider books. For a literary critic, similarity might mean sharing thematic elements. For a librarian, it's about genre classification. For a reader, it's about emotions it evokes. For a typesetter, it's page count and format. Each perspective is valid, yet cosine similarity smashes all these nuanced views into a single number — with confidence and an illusion of objectivity. Cartoon by Dmitry Malkov In the US, word2vec might tell you espresso and cappuccino are practically identical. It is not a claim you would make in Italy. When it falls apart Let's have a task that looks simple, a simple quest from our everyday life: \"What did I do with my keys?\" Now, using cosine similarity, we can compare it to other notes: \"I left them in my pocket\" \"They are on the table\" \"What did I put my wallet?\" \"What I did to my life?\" The closest match is not a plausible answer to our question — instead, it is another question. With sentence embedding cosine similarity, we are more likely to question our own life than to solve our mundane task. Fortunately, sentences about Python are close to zero - as they are not related. And remember, this is just a toy example with five sentences. In real-world applications, we're often dealing with thousands of documents — far more than could fit in a single context window. As your dataset grows, so does the noise sensitivity, turning your similarity scores into a game of high-dimensional roulette. So, what can we use instead? The most powerful approach The best approach is to directly use LLM query to compare two entries. So, first, start with a powerful model of your choice. Then, we can write something in the line of: \"Is {sentence_a} a plausible answer to {sentence_b}?\" This way we harness the full power of an LLM to extract meaningful comparisons - powerful enough to find our keys in pockets, and wise enough to understand the difference between questions and answers. We typically want our answers in structured output - what the field calls \"tools\" or \"function calls\" (which is really just a fancy way of saying \"JSON\"). Since many models love Markdown (as they were trained on it), my default template looks like this: {question} ## A {sentence_a} ## B {sentence_b} However, in most cases this approach is impractical - we don't want to run such a costly operation for each query. Unless our dataset is very small, it would be prohibitively expensive. Even with a small dataset, the delays would be noticeable compared to a simple numerical operation. Extracting the right features So, we can go back to using embeddings. But instead of blindly trusting a black box, we can directly optimize for what we actually care about by creating task-specific embeddings. There are two main approaches: Fine-tuning (teaching an old model new tricks by adjusting its weights). Transfer learning (using the model's knowledge to create new, more focused embeddings). Which one we use is ultimately a technical question - depending on the access to the model, costs, etc. Let's start with a symmetric case. Say we want to ask, \"Is A similar to B?\" We can write this as: where , and is a matrix that reduces the embedding space to dimensions we actually care about. Think of it as decluttering — we're keeping only the features relevant to our specific similarity definition. But often, similarity isn't what we're really after. Consider the question \"Is document B a correct answer to question A?\" (note the word \"correct\") and the relevant probability: where and . The matrices and transform our embeddings into specialized spaces for queries and keys . It's like having two different languages and learning to translate between them, rather than assuming they're the same thing. This approach works beautifully for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) too, as we usually care not only about similar documents but about the relevant ones. But where do we get the training data? We can use the same AI models we're working with to generate training data. Then feed it into PyTorch, TensorFlow, or your framework of choice. If you need a primer, there is a matrix decomposition exercise in my Thinking in tensors, writing in PyTorch series. Pre-prompt engineering Sure, we can train a model. Maybe even train on artificially generated data - but what if we want to avoid this step entirely? We got used to zero-shot learning, and it is not easy to go back. One of the quickest fixes is to add prompt to the text, so to set the apparent context. A simple example — let's have the list of Time's 100 Most Significant Figures in History. Let's say we want to see who is the most similar to Isaac Newton. No surprise, it's other physicists and natural philosophers. Yet, let's say we want to focus on his nationality - so we add a prompt \"Nationality of {person}\". Sadly, the results are underwhelming - sure, Galileo went a few places down, but Albert Einstein is listed as the most similar. So, let's try another approach, by making nationality the subject of the sentence - \"This is a country that has produced many influential historical figures, including {person}\". Now we get much better answer! To be clear - while I have found this approach useful, it is not a silver bullet. Depending on how to formulate the prompt, we can get a slight bias towards our goal, or something actually solving our problem. Rewriting and context extraction Another approach is to preprocess the text before embedding it. Here's a generic trick I often use — I ask the model: \"Rewrite the following text in standard English using Markdown. Focus on content, ignore style. Limit to 200 words.\" This simple prompt works wonders. It helps avoid false matches based on superficial similarities like formatting quirks, typos, or unnecessary verbosity. Often we want more - e.g. to extract information from a text while ignoring the rest. For example, let's say we have a chat with a client and want to suggest relevant pages, be it FAQ or product recommendations. A naive way would be to compare their discussion's embedding with the embeddings of our pages. A better approach is to first transform the conversation into a structured format focused on needs: \"You have a conversation with a client. Summarize their needs and pain points in up to 10 Markdown bullet points, up to 20 words each. Consider both explicit needs and those implied by context, tone, and other signals.\" Similarly, rewrite each of your pages in the same format before embedding them. This strips away everything that isn't relevant to matching needs with solutions. This approach has worked wonders in many of my projects. Perhaps it will work for you too. Recap Let's recap the key points: Cosine similarity gives us a number between -1 and 1, but don't mistake it for a probability. Most models aren't trained using cosine similarity - then the results are just \"some sort of correlations\" without any guarantees. Even when a model is trained with cosine similarity, we need to understand what kind of similarity it learned and if that matches our needs. To use vector similarity effectively, there are a few approaches: Train custom embeddings on your specific data Engineer prompts to focus on relevant aspects Clean and standardize text before embedding Have you found other ways to make vector similarity work better for your use case?

There's an example in the pgvector-python that uses a cross-encoder model for re-ranking: https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/exam... You can even use a language model for re-ranking, though it may not be as good as a model trained specifically for re-ranking purposes. In our Azure RAG approaches, we use the AI Search semantic ranker, which uses the same model that Bing uses for re-ranking search results. reply pamelafox 19 hours agoparentAnother tip: do NOT store vector embeddings of nothingness, mostly whitespace, a solid image, etc. We've had a few situations with RAG data stores which accidentally ingested mostly-empty content (either text or image), and those dang vectors matched EVERYTHING. WAs I like to think of it, there's a bit of nothing in everything.. so make sure that if you are storing a vector embedding, there is some amount of signal in that embedding. reply variaga 18 hours agorootparentInteresting. A project I worked on (audio recognition for a voice-command system) we ended up going the other way and explicitly adding an encoding of \"nothingness\" (actually 2, one for \"silence\" and another for \"white noise\") and special casing them (\"if either 'silence' or 'noise' is in the top 3 matches, ignore the input entirely\"). This was to avoid the problem where, when we only had vectors for \"valid\" sounds and there was an input that didn't match anything in the training set (a foreign language, garbage truck backing up, a dog barking, ...) the model would still return some word as the closest match (there's always a vector that has the highest similarity) and frequently do so with high confidence i.e. even though the actual input didn't actually match anything in the training set, it would be \"enough\" more like one known vector than any of the others that it would pass most threshold tests, leading to a lot of false positives. reply pbhjpbhj 19 hours agorootparentprevThat sounds like a problem for the embedding, would you need to renormalise so that low signal inputs could be well represented. A white square and a red square shouldn't be different levels of details. Depending on the purpose of the vector embedding, there should be a difference between images of mostly white pixels and partial images.

Please tell me from the title and best matching fragments what document IDs you want to see to better reply: [Document ID 0]: \"Some title / synopsis.

Vision LLM retriever such as DSE do this correctly. No need for reranker once done. reply bjourne 16 hours agoprevSo word vectors solve the problem that two words may never appear in the same context, yet can be strongly correlated. \"Python\" may never be found close to \"Ruby\", yet \"scripting\" is likely to be found in both their contexts so the embedding algorithm will ensure that they are close in some vector space. Except it rarely works well because of the curse of dimensionality. Perhaps one could represent word embeddings as vertices, rather than vectors? Suppose you find \"Python\" and \"scripting\" in the same context. You draw a weighted edge between them. If you find the same words again you reduce the weight of the edge. Then to compute the similarity between two words, just compute the weighted shortest path between their vertices. You could extend it to pair-wise sentence similarity using Steiner trees. Of course it would be much slower than cosine similarity, but probably also much more useful. reply jsenn 16 hours agoparentYou might be interested in HippoRAG [1] which takes a graph-based approach similar to what you’re suggesting here.

What you propose is rather different than word embeddings, since it can't compare word features (think: connotations) nor ambiguity, and the way to discover similarities symbolically is not a well-understood problem. reply yobbo 10 hours agoparentprevEmbeddings represent more than P(\"found in the same context\"). It is true that cosine similarity is unhelpful if you expect it to be a distance measure. [0,0,1] and [0,1,0] are orthogonal (cosine 0) but have euclidean distance √2, and 1/3 of vector elements are identical. It is better if embeddings encode also angles, absolute and relative distances in some meaningful way. Testing only cosine ignores all distances. reply montebicyclelo 1 hour agoprevThe author asks: > Has the model ever seen cosine similarity? Yes - most of the time, at least for deep learning based semantic search. E.g. for semantic search of text, the majority are using, SentenceTransformers [1], models which have been trained to use cosine similarity. Or e.g. for vector representations of images, people are using models like CLIP [2], which has again been trained to use cosine similarity. (Cosine similarity being used in the training loss, so the whole model is fundamentally \"tuned\" for cosine similarity.) Articles like these cause confusion, e.g. I've come across people saying: \"You shouldn't use cosine similarity\", when they've seen SentenceTransformers being used, and linking articles like these, when in fact you very much should be using cosine similarity with those models.

I'm actually not sure what the author was trying to get at here? You could ask an LLM 'is that sentence a plausible answer to the question' and then it would work; but if you ask for pure 'likeness', it seems that in many cases, LLMs' responses will be close to cosine similarity. reply stared 9 hours agoparentWell, \"Is {sentence_a} similar to {sentence_b}?\" is the correct query when we care about some vague similarity of statements. In this case, we should go with something in the line \"Is {answer} a plausible answer to the question {question}\". In any way, I see how the example \"Is {sentence_a} similar to {sentence_b}?\" breaks the flow.

STS stands for Semantic Textual Similarity. reply stared 8 hours agoparentprevTechnically speaking, cross encoders are LLMs - they use the last layer to predict similarity (a single number) rather than the probability of the next token. They are faster than generative models only if they are simpler - otherwise, there is no performance gain (the last layer is negligible). In any case, even the simplest cross-encoders are more computationally intensive than those using a dot product from pre-computed vectors. That said, for many applications, we may be perfectly fine with some version of a fine-tuned BERT-like model rather than using the newest AGI-like SoTA just to compare if two products are vaguely similar, and it is worth putting the other one in suggestions. reply staticautomatic 16 hours agoparentprevLink please? reply deepsquirrelnet 16 hours agorootparentHere you go! https://huggingface.co/dleemiller/ModernCE-base-sts There’s also the large model, which performs a bit better. reply janalsncm 16 hours agoparentprevCross encoders still don’t solve the fundamental problem of defining similarity that the author is referring to. Frankly, the LLM approach the author talks about in the end doesn’t either. What does “similar” mean here?

The article is right to point out that cosine similarity is more of an accidental property of data than anything in most cases (but IIUC there are newer embedding models that are deliberately trained for cosine similarity as a similarity measure). The author's bootstrapping approach is interesting especially because of it's ability to map relations other than the identity, but it seems like more of a computational optimization or shortcut (you could just run inference on the input) than a way to correlate unstructured data. After trying out some RAG approaches and becoming disillusioned pretty quickly I think we need to solve the problem much deeper by structuring models so that they can perform RAG during training. Prompting typical LLMs with RAG gives them input that is dissimilar from their training data and relies on heuristics (like the data format) and thresholds (like topK) that live outside the model itself. We could probably greatly improve this by having models define the embeddings, formats, and retrieval processes (ie learn its own multi-step or \"agentic\" RAG while it learns everything else) that best help them model their training data. I'm not an AI researcher though and I assume the real problem is that getting the right structure to train properly/efficiently is rather difficult. reply perfmode 6 hours agoprev> These vectors are quite long - text-embedding-3-large has up 3072 dimensions - to the point that we can truncate them at a minimal loss of quality.

Then I embed the concatenation of all of them instead of just the original chunk. This helps a lot. One fundamental problem of cosine similarity is that it works on surface level. For example, \"5+5\" won't embed close to \"10\". Or \"The 5th word of this phrase\" won't be similar to \"this\". If there is any implicit knowledge it won't be captured by simple cosine similarity, that is why we need to draw out those inplicit deductions before embedding. Hence my approach of pre-embedding expansion of chunk semantic information. I basically treat text like code, and have to \"run the code\" to get its meaning unpacked. reply stared 8 hours agoparentIf you ask, \"Is '5+5' similar to '10'?\" it depends on which notion of similarity you have - there are multiple differences: different symbols, one is an expression, the other is just a number. But if you ask, \"Does '5+5' evaluate to the same number as '10'?\" you will likely get what you are looking for. reply gavmor 13 hours agoparentprevHow do you contextualize the chunk at re-write time? reply ewild 13 hours agorootparentthe original chunk is most likely stored with it in referential format such as an id in the metadata to pull from a DB or something along those lines.

I think it's because the description of the quote uses 'like' words, but not the exact words in the quote, so the LLM gets confused and can't find it. Interestingly, the opposite conclusion is drawn in the TFA (the article says LLMs are quite good at identifying 'like' words, or, at least, better than the cosine method, which admittedly isn't a high bar). [0] Admittedly, some are a little obscure, but they're in famous publications by famous authors, so I'd have expected an LLM to have 'seen' them before. reply seanhunter 10 hours agoparentThat's not how llm training and recall works at all so I'm not surprised you are not getting good results in this way. You would be much better using a conventional search engine or if you want to use an llm, use one with a search tool so it will use the search engine for you. The problem you're encountering is not the model being unable to determine whether a quote it knows is responsive to your prompt but instead is a problem to do with recall in the model (which is not generally a task it's trained for). So it's not a similarity problem it's a recall problem. When LLMs are trained on a particular document, they don't save a perfect copy somehow that they can fish out later. They use it to update their weights via backpropogation and are evaluated on their \"sentence completion\" task during the main phase of training or on a prompt response eval set during instruction fine tuning. Unless your quote is in that set or is part of the eval for the sentence completion task during the main training, there's no reason to suppose the LLM will particularly be able to recall it as it's not being trained to do that. So what happens instead is the results of training on your quote update the weights in the model and that maybe somehow in some way that is quite mysterious results in some ability to recall it later but it's not a task it's evaluated on or trained for, so it's not surprising it's not great at it and in fact it's a wonder it can do it at all. p.s. If you want to evaluate whether it is struggling with similarity, look up a quote and ask a model whether or not it's responsive to a given question. I.e. give it a prompt like this I want a quote about someone living the highlife during the 1960s. Do you think this quote by George Best does the job? “I spent a lot of money on booze, birds, and fast cars. The rest I just squandered.” reply jillesvangurp 9 hours agoparentprevFunny, I've done this a few times with good results. I guess it depends on the quote and the amount of context you give it. This is also a case where something like perplexity might yield better results because it would try to find authoritative sources and then use the LLM to evaluate what it finds instead of relying on the LLM to have perfect recall for the quote. Which of course can fail in the exact same way my own brain is failing me (mangling words, mixing up people, etc.). It's something that works surprisingly well. I pay for Chat GPT and I don't pay for perplexity. But I find myself using that more and more. reply anArbitraryOne 15 hours agoprevJust want to say how great I am for calling this out a few months ago https://news.ycombinator.com/context?id=41470605 reply stared 8 hours agoparentIt's nice to hear that! And from this thread, it is not us only two—otherwise, the title wouldn't have resonated with the Hacker News community. This blog post stemmed from my frustration that people use cosine distance without a second thought. In virtually all tutorials on vector databases, cosine distance is treated as if it were some obvious ground truth.

Instead of embedding the user question directly – and risk retrieving chunks that look like the question – you ask a LLM to hallucinate an answer and use that to retrieve relevant chunks. Obviously, the hallucinated bits are never used afterwards. reply miven 8 hours agoparentAFAIK retrieving documents that look like the query is more commonly avoided by using a bi-encoder explicitly trained for retrieval, those generally are conditioned to align embeddings of queries to those of relevant documents, with each having a dedicated token marker, something like [QUERY] and [DOC], to make the distinction clear. The strong suit of HyDE seems to be more in working better in settings where the documents and queries you're working with are too niche to be properly understood by a generic retrieval model and you don't have enough concrete retrieval data to fine-tune a specialized model. reply romanhn 10 hours agoprevSay I generate embeddings for a bunch of articles.

The article strongly suggests using dot product similarity and it's a great metric in some situations, but dot product similarity has some issues too: - not normalized (unlike cosine simularity) - heavily favors large vectors - unbounded output - ... Basically, do not carelessly use any similarity metric. reply danieldk 12 hours agoparentTraditional word embeddings (like word2vec) were trained using logistic regression. So probably the closest would be σ(u.v), which is of course nicely bounded. (The catch is that during training logistic regression is done on the word and context vectors, but they have a high degree of similarity. People would even sum the context vectors and word vectors or train with word and context vectors being the same vectors without much loss.) reply seanhunter 4 hours agoprevIn general this is a cool article but I worry when TFA observes that cosine similarity and the dot product are the same under certain conditions (specifically that the vectors are unit vectors). It's really important that people who are using these measures understand something as basic as this. It shouldn't need to be said in an article but I feel (as the author obviously also does) that it does need to be said because people are just blindly using it without understanding it at all. Cosine similarity literally comes from solving the geometric formula for the dot product of two Euclidian vectors to find cos theta, so of course it's the same. That is to say a . b = |a||b| cos theta Where a and b are the two vectors and theta is the angle between them. Therefore cos theta = (a . b)/(|a||b|) TADA! cosine similarity.[1] If the vectors are unit vectors (he calls this \"normalization\" in the article) then |a||b| = 1 so of course cos theta = a . b in that case. If you don't understand this, I really recommend you invest an afternoon in something like khan academy's \"vectors\" track from their precalculus syllabus. Understanding the underlying basic maths will really pay off in the long run.[2] [1] If you have ever been confused by why it's called cosine similarity when the formula doesn't include a cosine that's why. The formula gives you cos theta. You would take the arccosine if you wanted to get theta but if you're just using it for similarity you may as well not bother to compute the angle and just use cos theta itself. [2] Although ML people are just going to keep on misusing the word \"tensor\" to refer to a mere multidimensional array. I think that ship has sailed and I just need to give up on that now but there's still hope that people at least understand vectors when they work on this stuff.

      "Cosine similarity, a method for comparing vectors, can be misleading if used without understanding the context, as it may not accurately capture semantic similarities. - Embeddings, such as those from word2vec or sentence embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs), require careful and intentional use to ensure they reflect the desired relationships. - To improve vector similarity results, consider using LLMs directly, creating task-specific embeddings through fine-tuning, and ensuring text is clean and prompts are well-engineered before embedding."

It's not exactly realistic for how the former Marine depicted chose to try to resolve the situation... It does give room to consider just how corrupt it can all be. Consider if you live in a town with only one bank. Clearly the bank and the police have a relationship and in a small town, odds are they all know each other quite well. Say someone withdraws money from the bank. Then the teller sort of rats you out to law enforcement or someone adjacent to law enforcement. They manufacture an excuse to pull you over just as was done in this Nevada story. The movie Rebel Ridge goes into the difficulty in even getting your money back in the first place. At one point they explain a large part of the police departments funding comes from this. Then again, it isn't just small police departments getting kick backs, it's everyone involved to run up the cost for someone who had their money stolen. At some point, civil forfeiture laws will lay the foundation for having any amount of cash being a sort of assumption of criminality. Consider too that smaller banks and even large banks have reserve requirements but not enough to cover all of the deposits.

And I'm not reacting to Trump-era decisions - even under Obama, the justices were watering down the Bill of Rights in cases like Salinas v. Texas (2013). Previously, if you refused to talk to the police, that was considered invoking your fifth amendment right against self incrimination, hence the standard advice from attorneys to keep your mouth shut until they were present. Now, you must explicitly invoke it every time the police question you or your silence can be used against you, even if that silence was in response to informal questioning on the street with no intention of arrest. It all makes sense when you consider how privileged the modern Court is: few of the justices in 2013 or today have actually worked as criminal defense attorneys, and only one has ever worked as a public defender (Ketanji Jackson, for two years; I will give Ginsburg credit for her work at the ACLU, but that is still a notable step above being a public defender). We haven't even had a justice whose read the law (became a lawyer without getting a law degree from a law school) since the death of Robert Jackson in 1954. (Robert Jackson is also the man behind the famous quote \"any lawyer worth his salt will tell the suspect, in no uncertain terms, to make no statement to the police under any circumstances.\") Now, almost all have come from privileged backgrounds, went to Ivy League institutions, live in gated communities, are completely detached from the reality of what the average American knows about the law, and certainly aren't going to be taken advantage of by the cops.

It's a terrible system, but it utilizes the same principles found in other Civil laws.

Seizure is perfectly legal, and even ought to be required pending completion of a court case. Forfeiture is the end means of seizure.. usually. Forfeiture does not require a court case. Forfeiture can, in some circumstances, be determined without a court case. Most often and fairly universally means when no one offers a claim on seized property. I have read on this a many times myself and have conflict with it. I started off with naturally believing it is violation of 5th + 14th amendments. I only hold now that it is likely a violation of the 14th, but its quite complicated. Seizure in this sense ought to be illegal given no due process. However, SC has opinions that property itself can be ruled against. Further, has ruled in many instances that innocent owner defense is not sufficient, thus innocent owner must prove that the entrusted party acted out of consent/contract. I recommend reading 983 article guidelines for asset forfeiture/seizure: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/983 It is not simple, at all.

We have perfectly good ways to handle lost items without forfeiture. Using those systems, the confiscation problem disappears. And if anyone claims a bag of heroin the same way they would claim a lost phone... let them. Then arrest them after they do that. reply db48x 56 minutes agorootparentAs amusing as that would be, forfeiture is how you get judicial oversight of the process. If someone wants to claim their misplaced drugs then they have to show up at the trial and defend their right to posses them. Consider a more nuanced, and more common, case: a shipment of batteries labeled as Apple™ products arrives in port. The shipping address indicates that they aren’t going to Apple, but to one Louis Rossmann. Clearly these must be counterfeits, right? Nobody else could possibly be allowed to own items with “Apple™” printed on them, after all. Customs seizes the shipment with the intent to destroy them. If Louis wants them he can go to court to prove that he has a right to own batteries with the word “Apple™” on them. Clearly we want Louis to be able to clear up the misunderstanding and recover his property (genuine batteries salvaged from damaged phones), and clearly customs doesn’t want to risk storing them forever. Both parties want a definitive end state; they don’t want the disagreement to drag on forever. And certainly Louis wants the oversight of a judge who can ensure that procedure is followed correctly, and that it is the same procedure that was documented ahead of time.

If it means bonus, then this doesn't handle cases of incompetence or malice, they will still get their salary.

In a company, managers are routinely incentivised based on specific metrics (good or bad, typically budget plus some softer metrics). It's the norm, not the exception. It was even the case in communist russia by the way. With horribly designed metrics, like maximising tonnage of a factory output, which lead factory managers to ditch better product for lesser, heavier products.

However, this is completely different from Mao's famous work, which was never called this in Chinese. Mao's book was informally known as \"Hongbaoshu\" (红宝书) meaning \"red treasured book\" and formally titled \"Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong\" (毛主席语录). The apparent connection in English comes from translators using \"Little Red Book\" for both terms (maybe due to training or an agenda? who knows, choosing word-by-word translation for one and popular translation for another), even though they're distinct and unrelated in the original Chinese, and of course in the official desired English \"RedNote\" too. reply porphyra 13 minutes agorootparentOn Wikipedia, it says he chose red because: > The Chinese name was inspired by two pivotal institutions in its co-founder Charlwin Mao's career journey that both feature red as their primary color: Bain & Company, where he worked as a consultant, and Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he earned his MBA.

It's actually just what it's called in the US app stores: \"REDnote—小红书国际版\" reply metacritic12 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah but \"little red book\" (xiaohongshu) in mandarin is not actually how the original Mao Little Red Book is called in Mandarin, either formally or informally. Informally in mandarin it's called hongbaoshu (literally \"red cover book\" and formally, as you can imagine, is like Quotes from Chairman Mao). So this is a case of translators with an agenda translating two phrases with different original mandarin renditions (hongbaoshu and xiaohongshu), and picking and choosing the style of translation (base on usage vs based on character) to get the English translation to merge both of them as \"Little Red Book\". reply seryoiupfurds 11 minutes agorootparentNot really. Mao's book has been known as the \"Little Red Book\" in English for decades, well before the app existed. And the characters for \"小红书\" directly and literally translate to \"little\", \"red\", and \"book\". It's the most literal and obvious translation of the name, no agenda needed. Go ask any Chinese person. The app didn't even have an English name until recently. It was just \"小红书\" which any Chinese person would render in English as \"Little Red Book\". \"RedNote\" is a recent branding exercise. reply jackliuhahaha 1 hour agorootparentprevLittle red book means something different in 1970s China.

I think they'd ban it if it started gaining traction outside of Chinese immigrant communities.

I can't say I like YouTube shorts a lot, but there's often some I find interesting in a long enough window of time — the problem there is more the signal to noise ratio than the volume of the signal. TikTok just feels like my personal signal is just nonexistent. Sometimes I wish I knew what was going on under the hood. There's such a huge difference between how much people like TikTok and how I feel about the content, and I don't understand why TikTok would have such a hard time with me in particular. In general I'm kind of souring on algorithmic-driven social media, or at least short format (video or text). I don't have anything against it in principle, I just find I enjoy longer format posts and articles more in experience. reply rolothrow 1 hour agorootparentTiktoks algorithm takes a while to get used to but it is pretty tameable. Quick way that works for me: - avoid attempts based on \"unliking\" things, I'm pretty sure it treats it as engagement. Instead swipe bad content away. - avoid \"accidentally engaging\", like replying to a comment you feel is wrong or watching something you don't like because you were trying to see where the speech was going. Disengage ASAP with unwanted. - positive feedback for whatever video starts getting close to what you want. - positive implies staying the whole clip, liking, viewing comments, commenting, liking comments and the strongest of all, sharing the video (you can send it to a telegram conversation with yourself or whatever, not sure if the link you shared ever being opened is accounted for but I think nope). Do this on purpose, like if a video is cool just open the comment section and like all comments without looking. -try to \"navigate\". If you want to see tech and it's currently showing you music, maybe engage with music production or Spotify tricks when they appear. It might not be the tech you're looking for, but it's closer to tech than a teenage girl dancing. You'll eventually be shown things more relevant to you, at which point you grab that current. Also do not try to rush the process. I think updating your interests is not instant, and session time might be a metric as well. reply dml2135 49 minutes agorootparentThis is fascinating, I'm curious -- do you find yourself generally thinking in this way when using TikTok? Do you find that your peers that use TikTok do something similar? This is just completely foreign to how I consume media. The idea that I need to try and \"trick\" an algorithm into showing me what I want is just completely unappealing. I'd much rather go somewhere else and actively seek out the content that I want, rather than trying to fight a system that seems like it would prefer me to be a passive consumer. \"Passive\" not in the sense that I shouldn't be engaged, clearly, as the algorithm rewards engagement. But passive in the sense that I should not be seeking out what I want to see, I should just be reactive based on what I am shown, and then the platform will decide from that what I really want. Like, no, this just makes me recoil completely. Why would I want to bother with that? reply HeyLaughingBoy 39 minutes agorootparentYou don't have to do any of this. He's just explaining more about how the algorithm works. To a first approximation, TikTok simply shows you more of what you watch. If you swipe away a lot of stuff in the first second or two, it stops showing you that kind of stuff. If you watch complete videos, it shows you more like that. reply dml2135 33 minutes agorootparentI'm aware that this is how the algorithm works, but the parent comment is not just explaining how it works, they gave suggestions based on things that \"work for me\". So I am specifically trying to sus out how common it is among tiktok users to have this sort of strategic thinking around the algorithm, since it's not something I've heard much of before. reply segasaturn 22 minutes agorootparentThis is very common and I would even say a necessary part of using algorithmic social media now, basically awareness of the algorithm and interacting with content in a way that keeps your algorithm tuned to what you want. For example I avoid clicking anything political on YouTube because as soon as I do, my suggestions become full of political ragebait. reply hmmokidk 38 minutes agorootparentprevAnecdotally TikTok has the best content for me as well. I can’t even place my finger on why I like it more than IG. I don’t know if it’s the slight differences in the content if surfaces. Even if I am just looking through music on both apps (I play guitar) something about TikTok is more pleasant and I really am not sure what. reply cochne 4 hours agorootparentprevI'm in your boat. I tried out TikTok out a few times, including making a new account, but it never showed me good content. I had maybe one or two longer sessions, but never felt the need to go back, like I (unfortunately) do with Reddit or Youtube. I could never understand why it was so popular, but maybe I'm just a curmudgeon. reply derbOac 3 hours agorootparentI think that's part of why it's always been a little bit of a head scratcher for me — I didn't really go into it curmudgeonly, I was genuinely interested in it, people seemed to like it, and I was interested in something new. It just never worked out at all for me. I even had people telling me in all seriousness \"I must secretly like the content\", as in the algorithm knows better than I do what I like. Which is kind of a weird and maybe even disturbing idea to buy into if you think about it. I was told to keep at it, which I did. I'd put aside for a long time, go back to it, repeat the process over and over again. Eventually I just gave up. I always felt like it was targeting some specific demographic by default and never got out of that algorithmic optimization spot for me. reply cjrp 5 hours agorootparentprevSame with Instagram Reels.

The explanation I've seen is basically a unified \"fuck you, I won't do what you tell me, so instead I'm going to give my data to China even harder\". It's a generation of kids who grew up (mostly correctly) assuming all of their data was already all controlled by corporations in league with the government. Worrying about data privacy is too quaint to even consider. There's of course a chance of algorithmic meddling, nudging people to a different Chinese app, but I think spite is a far simpler answer. reply kelseyfrog 2 hours agorootparent> I've seen is basically a unified \"fuck you ...\" My wife is exploring RedNote for this very reason. \"You're telling me I have an easy way to make the US government upset and the more I use RedNote, the more upset they are?\" was her line of thinking.

How can you use this to make them useful to you? reply somenameforme 1 hour agorootparentThis is a very first level consideration of things like this. In general it would not be particularly useful because exactly the first thing that's going to happen is that any victim of said efforts is going to go to their domestic law enforcement which would not only curtail these efforts (or even completely backfire in the case of double agent stuff), but could also blow up into a giant international controversy. And for what? What are you going to gain from trying to blackmail an \"ordinary citizen\"? The risk:reward ratios are simply horribly broken in this sort of case.

My response to JumpCrisscross already applies perfectly to your comment. reply LPisGood 2 hours agorootparentprevFrom China’s perspective, the things the US intelligence official could to China’s citizens is worse than what China could do to those same citizens. I don’t think it’s unreasonable for some citizens to feel the same reply delecti 1 hour agorootparentAs a US citizen living in the US, I think it's entirely unreasonable to fear the Chinese government more than the US government. It seems utterly ridiculous to me to even consider, and seems just as ridiculous that a Chinese citizen could feel the same. Even leaving aside the state's monopoly on violence, agents at any of multiple three-letter agencies could easily ruin my life. An IRS agent could randomly decide to audit my last decade of tax returns. A law enforcement agent (local, state, or federal) could deliberately incorrectly mark my vehicle as stolen. They could SWAT me on a trumped up basis. They could just black bag me, and throw me in some dark pit. China could probably hack me, and fuck up my digital presence, including my finances. But the US government could easily skip a few steps and just declare those finances illegitimate in a variety of ways much more difficult to undo. reply JumpCrisscross 1 hour agorootparent> it's entirely unreasonable to fear the Chinese government more than the US government Sure, individually. If you think about more than yourself, you should recognise a collective threat that requires a modicum of sacrifice to protect against. reply JumpCrisscross 1 hour agorootparentprev> are they any worse for those citizens than what China's own government could do to those citizens? Yes. It's riskier for the FBI to fuck around with an American than it is for the CIA to fuck around with someone in Russia or China. Particularly when we're dealing with extorting someone using embarassing, but not necessarily criminal, information. Or just, you know, sowing chaos. Again, if the CIA had a list of Chinese citizens who may be mentally unstable and are obsessing over e.g. the Uyghurs, could that not be put to use in a way that's harmful to China and that person? Your risk of being fucked with by either Beijing or D.C. is incredibly low. (\"Fucked with\" meaning being harassed for legal behaviour.)

Everyone agrees that \"the algorithm is better\", but this is very hard to quantify. Perhaps something about surfacing smaller creators? Quantity/quality of invasive advertising? Extent to which people feel particular kinds of rage content is being forced on them? reply weinzierl 3 hours agorootparentMain reason besides the algorithm is in my opinion that TikTok has wide but hard boundaries when it comes to content. This leads to diverse but relatively safe content. It is not 4chan where you think twice before clicking a link to avoid emotional damage. It is also not Reddit or Youtube where you do not bother to go because you permanently encounter stuff that is inconsequentially blocked and you are still not safe from trauma. I think most platforms other than TikTok try to be too strict, fail to enforce their unrealistic rules in any comprehensible form and therefore suck for most intellectually curious users. reply scarecrowbob 1 hour agorootparentThis has been my experience and it is what people are reporting from red note. In comparison to instagram I have found it far easier to explore, for instance, black women making leftist political critiques of Harris engaged in long conversations with black women who were actively supporting Harris. Similarly, it has been much easier to find discussions about Palestine, labor rights, indigenous US culture, and numerous other topics. I think those conversations are probably find-able on Ig or Yt, but I have had much more difficult time with those platforms. It's been hard for me to find much engaging content that is close enough to my (admittedly anarchistic) political and cultural views that the conversation changes what I think in useful ways, so I avoid that work on things like FB. These platforms do suck for doing anything other than keeping up with pictures of my nieces. My feeling is that in general the TT algo doesn't really care about US politics so it just shows me engaging content, whatever that might be for me. People here can call that \"addictive\", but in doing so it quickly discards any agency for people who have any actual political disagreements with the radically centrist US political mainstream. I am used to that flippant dismissal- Allen Dulles would have rather believed in mind control than believe that US military personal who encountered Koreans were swayed by genuine empathy for a legitimate political-economic position. By contrast, my feeling is that various other governments don't really care what folks in other countries think about the world so as long as it's not objectively porn or gore they just let conversations happen. That is, of course, quite dangerous if your power relies on maintaining narrative consistency for the population you rule- that's why China and other authoritarian folks do things like limit what can happen on social media in their countries... reply somenameforme 21 minutes agorootparentThe whole concept that one's views can be changed by what they were compelled to watch is what leads to the circus of absurdity in modern times. The fact that the media, corporations, and political establishment will all aggressively repeat a statement only to be rebuffed by the public at large seems to have no affect on their insistence on believing in this nonsense. If it were true than the countless nations which turned to extreme censorship and propaganda to try to maintain themselves would be still standing. Instead, they invariably lose the faith of their people who simply stop believing anything (or supporting their own government) and at that point their collapse is already imminent - even if it might only happen decades later. See: Soviet Union. Or for some predictive power - once China's economy reaches its twilight years where you have to juke the books and redefine exactly how things are measured just to keep eeking out that 1 or 2% growth per year, their entire political system will collapse. People would be happy being ruled by a group of authoritarian mutated frogs who demanded you ribbit in loyalty 6 times a day, so long as their economy and society was booming from the average person's perspective.

Somehow where Meta built a social graph, TikTok built a graph of videos (no need to know who you are, they can just suggest videos based on other videos you watch). And it's apparently difficult to catch up (presumably because they have more users so more data to make better predictions). That would, IMO, explain why people use TikTok and not something else.

I honestly don't know how TikToks ad revenue looks like but from a consumer point of view it appears for whatever reason they have mostly corporate ads where YouTube has the lowest value garbage (perhaps highest paying) ads on MLM and getting rich through real estate. Edit: As a weak comparison I think about Prime Streaming vs YouTube or Hulu. Ignoring that ads suck. Prime gives you a handful of various ads of real products/companies and have done in my opinion a smart job of minimizing the consumers negativity toward it. YouTube throws whatever highest paying garbage at you as much as possible. I tried Hulu once with ads, painful, every like 7mins you are getting an ad and often the same ad over and over. reply PittleyDunkin 3 hours agorootparentIt's also worth noting that TikTok has the \"TikTok Shop\" that allows people to sell directly through the app. Perhaps this allows them to rely less heavily on advertising. I certainly see virtually zero ads on the app. Ideally this is because they've identified that I'm a terrible person to sell ads to, but perhaps they're just less aggressive about pushing them. > Prime gives you a handful of various ads of real products/companies and have done in my opinion a smart job of minimizing the consumers negativity toward it. Sure, I just stopped using prime when they introduced ads. It's also the number one complaint about the service and it regularly shows up any time the service is mentioned.

Not just swipes or likes, but maybe even how still the phone is while you watch it or if you blink less, signs you’re more focused on the video. Maybe they don’t have access to that telemetry but I think that’s kind of the vein of how they measure attention more than just touchscreen actions reply eitally 1 hour agorootparentprevI spend a lot of time on YT, and less time on Instagram... and 0 time on TikTok, where I never created an account. YT Shorts exist exclusively for YT creators who want to publish bite-sized pieces of content for their audience with a much lower expectation of polish than their normal longer form content. Perhaps the algorithm also presents \"random\" YouTubers', too, but the vast majority of what I see is put out by the publishers I'm already following (or other very similar publishers in the same ecosystem). I would suggest that TikTok's successor is Insta Reels. Reels are almost exclusively entertainment and because they tie into Instagram's broader user/connections network the UX is much better than TikTok. Nobody goes to Instagram to figure out how to replace their garbage disposal -- this is squarely YT domain. If YT Shorts can make inroads in the entertainment market [without feeling like a commercial break between pieces of actual content, which is the impression I have and the way I use it]. reply defluct 5 hours agorootparentprevI use both and YouTube Short produces mostly just garbage for me.

Youtube, not so much. reply PittleyDunkin 4 hours agorootparentprev> The UI is better than TikTok ever was I cannot disagree more. I just scroll on tiktok and tiktok populates the scrolling with videos I want to see, and it takes about ten minutes to signal to tiktok what content you like and don't like. Youtube, meanwhile, is an exercise in a far too-busy UI with thumbnails and comments and text and buttons—it's inherently a desktop app shoved into a web browser. Nice if you want to search for a specific topic and watch a four-hour video on it, but terrible for entertainment or killing time. The only use I have for youtube are in solving these two problems: 1) where can I find a music video and 2) how do I do x ...but the focus on the interface obscures why youtube shorts won't ever take off: youtube is extremely bad at pushing content I want to watch.

Once an app becomes too popular with older people the quality and vibes decrease, plus everyone feels awkward about posting.

After some years you now have a ton of connections from past stages of life, and start feeling restricted again in your personal expression. Plus there’s the dual use issue – IG is too commonly shared now so I have current and former coworkers there plus everyone I’ve ever been interested in as friends or more at a party.

Or do we evaluate it based on motivation, i.e. it's ok when we do it because we have good reasons for it? Sounds like the ends justify the means to me. The correct approach would be to increase the critical thinking skills of the population, increase transparency, require corporations to make algorithms fair and equitable. Require all feeds to be chronological or some other uniform, fair rule for showing posts. No boosting certain viewpoints, or paid promotions. But these things would bother corporations and politicians in the west as well as the external forces with \"bad motivations\", so just ban the external social networks. The EU I think has a better approach, of course made possible because we don't have any powerful social networks of our own, and so nobody lobbies against these rules. I'm sure the DSA and DMA would be different (if they existed at all) if at least one of FAANG was European.

Often the creators are expressing a genuine (but rare) viewpoint that China just needs to amplify. This isn't about keeping Americans from reading Pravda. It's not hard to imagine the messages China will be pushing to weaken support for assisting Taiwan in a conflict. \"Don't waste money propping up the corrupt Taiwanese government, spend it on health care /tax cuts at home!\" Then China gains control over TSMC without a fight and much of the American economy is at their mercy. reply pphysch 3 hours agorootparentMuch of the American economy is already at China's mercy, due to the $500,000,000,000+ in goods we rely on from them annually. Hospitals running out of medical supplies will hit WAY sooner than your existing 4090 needs to be replaced by a new Taiwanese product. This whole \"Taiwan is super important to USA\" narrative is itself pure government propaganda, related to military power projection over China's coastline. Surely you can at least admit this.

You're right that Taiwan isn't more important to the US than China or any other major trading partner; the key difference is that China is not threatening to invade and conquer any of the other trading partners.

Whether that's right or wrong, well, that's another discussion. It's a chicken-or-the-egg problem.

More likely than Biden's incompetence is that Bibi now has a variable solved for in the geopolitical calculus: the American election now has a winner.

It's much too early for me to be confident that the current ceasefire is actually going to work better than the last one.

    "originLink": "https://claudio.uk/posts/epub-to-audiobook.html",
    "originBody": "claudio.uk 🙋♂About 📖 Writings 📚 Convert E-books into audiobooks with Kokoro Posted on 14 Jan 2025 by Claudio Santini Kokoro v0.19 is a recently published text-to-speech model with just 82M params and very high-quality output. It's released under Apache licence and was trained on <100 hours of audio. It currently supports american, british english, french, korean, japanese and mandarin, in a bunch of very good voices. An example of the quality: I've always dreamed of converting my ebook library into audiobooks. Especially for those niche books that you cannot find in audiobook format. Since Kokoro is pretty fast, I thought this may finally be doable. I've created a small tool called Audiblez (in honor of the popular audiobook platform) that parses .epub files and converts the body of the book into nicely narrated audio files. On my M2 MacBook Pro, it takes about 2 hours to convert to mp3 the Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins, which is about 100,000 words (or 600,000 characters), at a rate of about 80 characters per second. How to install and run If you have Python 3 on your computer, you can install it with pip. Be aware that it won't work with Python 3.13. Then you also need to download a couple of additional files in the same folder, which are about ~360MB: pip install audiblez wget https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files/kokoro-v0_19.onnx wget https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files/voices.json Then, to convert an epub file into an audiobook, just run: audiblez book.epub -l en-gb -v af_sky It will first create a bunch of book_chapter_1.wav, book_chapter_2.wav, etc. files in the same directory, and at the end it will produce a book.m4b file with the whole book you can listen with VLC or any audiobook player. It will only produce the .m4b file if you have ffmpeg installed on your machine. Supported Languages Use -l option to specify the language, available language codes are: 🇺🇸 en-us, 🇬🇧 en-gb, 🇫🇷 fr-fr, 🇯🇵 ja, 🇰🇷 kr and 🇨🇳 cmn. Supported Voices Use -v option to specify the voice: available voices are af, af_bella, af_nicole, af_sarah, af_sky, am_adam, am_michael, bf_emma, bf_isabella, bm_george, bm_lewis. You can try them here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/hexgrad/Kokoro-TTS Chapter Detection Chapter detection is a bit janky, but it manages to find the core chapters in most .epub I tried, skipping the cover, index, appendix etc. If you find it doesn't include the chapter you are interested into, try to play with the is_chapter function in the code. Often it skips the preface or intro, and I'm not sure if it's a bug or a feature. Source See Audiblez project on GitHub. There are still some rough edges, but it works well enough for me. Future improvements could include: Better chapter detection, or allow users to include/exclude chapters. Add chapter navigation to m4b file (that looks hard, cause ffmpeg doesn't do it) Add narration for images using some image-to-text model Code is short enough to be included here: #!/usr/bin/env python3 # audiblez - A program to convert e-books into audiobooks using # Kokoro-82M model for high-quality text-to-speech synthesis. # by Claudio Santini 2025 - https://claudio.uk import argparse import sys import time import shutil import subprocess import soundfile as sf import ebooklib import warnings import re from pathlib import Path from string import Formatter from bs4 import BeautifulSoup from kokoro_onnx import Kokoro from ebooklib import epub from pydub import AudioSegment def main(kokoro, file_path, lang, voice): filename = Path(file_path).name with warnings.catch_warnings(): book = epub.read_epub(file_path) title = book.get_metadata('DC', 'title')[0][0] creator = book.get_metadata('DC', 'creator')[0][0] intro = f'{title} by {creator}' print(intro) chapters = find_chapters(book) print('Found chapters:', [c.get_name() for c in chapters]) texts = extract_texts(chapters) has_ffmpeg = shutil.which('ffmpeg') is not None if not has_ffmpeg: print('\\033[91m' + 'ffmpeg not found.

Probably cool for some non-fiction. On the other, some of my favorite audio books all stood out because the narrator was interpreting the text really well, for example by changing the pacing during chaotic moments. Or those audiobooks with multiple narrators and different voices for each character. Not to mention that sometimes the only cue you get for who's speaking during dialogue is how the voice actor changes their tone. I have mixed feelings about using this and losing some of that quality. I would totally use this over amateur ebooks or public domain audiobooks like the ones on project guttenberg.

The good podcasts are those view which involve interviewing interesting people, and AI isn't replacing those. There's a lot more to be said for the value of audio books, but the accessibility gains of proliferated auto-generated audiobooks outweigh the downside of losing a small number of expertly produced audio books. For context, I listen to audio books a lot, and for years I have listened to traditional TTS readings of books too.

This can limit their distribution.

Even on the non-fiction side, the narration for Gleick's The Information adds something.

Of course that it would imply a different (and far bigger?) model. Anyway, even if in theory it might, in practice things may end even worse than doing it with a monotone voice. reply micw 8 hours agoparentprevWith this technology, one could produce high quality audio books without having access to high quality narrators by annotating the books with the voice, speed and such things. I wonder if a standardized markup exists to do so. reply albert_e 7 hours agorootparentThere is SSML for speech markup to indicate various characters of speech like whispers, pronunciation, pace, emphasis, etc. With LLMs proving to be very good at generating code, it may be reasonable to assume they can get good at generating SSML as well. Not sure if there is a more direct way to channel the interpretation of the tone/context/emotion etc from prose into generated voice qualities. If we train some models on ebooks along with their professionally produced human-narrated audiobooks, with enough variety and volume of training data, the models might capture the essence of that human-interpretation of written text? Just maybe? Amazon with its huge collection of Audible + Kindle library -- if it can do this without violating any rights -- has a huge corpus for this. They already have \"whispersync\" which is a feature that syncs text in a kindle ebook with words in corresponding audible audiobook. reply micw 7 hours agorootparentGood points, thank you! I just tested it. While ChatGPT was very good in adding generic (textual) annotations, the result for generating SSML where very poor (lack of voice names, lack of distinction between narrator and character etc). Probably the results with a model trained for this plus human audit could lead to very good results. reply pegasus 7 hours agorootparentprevThey still wouldn't be high quality. It's just not possible to capture the precise tone of voice in an annotation, and that precision I believe really makes a difference. My experience is that the deeper the narrator understands the text and conveys that understanding, the easier it becomes for me to absorb that information. reply vasco 7 hours agorootparentHave you tried those \"podcast from a paper\" models? They do some of the things you are saying they don't, although it's not 100% it's also miles ahead of for example human Polish TV lectors, or other monotone style narrations. reply KeplerBoy 7 hours agorootparentprevDon't end to end trained models already do this to some extent? Like raising the pitch towards a question mark, like a human would. TortoiseTTS has a few examples under prompt engineering on their demo site: https://nonint.com/static/tortoise_v2_examples.html reply micw 7 hours agorootparentThat's a bit of basic and random. Some models have the features you describe. From the better models you get a slightly different voice for text in quotes. But the difference to good audio books is that you have * different voices for the narrator and each character * different emotions and/or speed in certain situations. I guess you could use a LLM to \"understand\" and annotate an existing book if there's a markup and then use TTS to create an audio book from it and so automate most of the the process. reply micw 7 hours agorootparentEdit: I actually tried this. I prompted in ChatGPT: \"Annotate the following text with speakers and emotions so that it can be turned into an audiobook via TTS\", followed by a short text from \"The Hobbit\" (The \"Good morning scene\"). The result is very good. reply ahoka 8 hours agoparentprevI guess this is still very useful if you are blind. reply loktarogar 8 hours agorootparentYeah, for accessibility purposes on things that aren't already narrated, this is kind of thing is huge. reply em-bee 7 hours agorootparentthat's the thing. it's not just for accessibility. anything not already narrated is a fair target for TTS. i don't have time to sit down and read books. all reading is done on the go, while getting around or doing daily routines at home. i have a small book that i am reading now, which should take a few hours to finish, but in the time i manage to get done reading it i will probably have listened to two or three audio books. oh, and it's also a boon for those who can't afford to buy audiobooks. reply vasco 7 hours agorootparentYou don't choose to spend your time reading books. You probably roll your eyes when someone tells you they don't have time for some activity you deem valuable. This is the 'no time to exercise' debate in a different shape. They are also different activities, with audio it's easier to listen to more but retention is usually lower. Not casting any elitist \"you need to read\" bullshit by the way, but find it odd to define it in terms of lack of time, and I really like both mediums. reply em-bee 6 hours agorootparentthere is not much of a choice here. sure, i could use the time i spend reading and commenting on HN to read books instead. so technically speaking it is a choice. but i want to do both and many other things besides also having to work and a family to take care of. so the result is, i can't afford the time to read without giving up other things that are also important to me. listening to books allows me to access books i would otherwise not be able to read because of these priorities. there are other factors as well. i love reading so much that i tend to forget time around me. as a result reading would cause me to neglect other duties. i can't allow that, and therefore i am forced to avoid reading. i also don't like long form reading on electronic devices, and as a frequent traveler, printed books are simply not practical and often not even accessible. i agree with the retention issue, but i found that a much larger factor for retention is how well i can follow the story. a good story that is easy to get into is also easier to retain. and finally, reading fiction is for entertainment. i don't have to retain it. reply esrauch 4 hours agorootparentprev> You probably roll your eyes when someone tells you they don't have time for some activity you deem valuable. There's a few categories where it makes sense to roll your eyes, like if they say they have no time to shower or have never been to one of their kid's baseball games. But for things that aren't basic human expectations, I think you'd have to a real jerk to roll your eyes at someone not having time. No time to cook multi-pot dishes? No time to exercise? No time to read? No time to go to museums? No time to meet at the bar for a drink? Any of them sensible. No one can do everything, we all make our priorities and its well within their choice not to have any one optional life thing at the top of their personal stack. reply vasco 4 hours agorootparentAgree completely, my point was indeed they are choices, not lack of time.

They are just saying why they prefer audiobooks thus why general TTS is useful for them. Why are you trying to argue about their preference? They didn't cast any judgement on others with different preferences. This is nothing like “no time for exercise”.

There are so many books that I would want to listen to, but still lack such an adaptation. Also it takes months after the book release before the audiobook gets released. Just imagine what this would do for writers. They can get instant feedback and adjust their book for the audiobook. reply rd11235 5 hours agoparentprevI agree but the opposite can be true too. Sometimes the narrator seems to target some general audience that doesn’t fit me at all, in a way that makes me cringe when I listen, until I stop listening altogether. In these cases I’d rather listen to a relatively flat narration from a tool like this. reply nickpsecurity 1 minute agoprevThe page says it was trained on under 100 hours of audio. Then, the link says “we employ large pre-trained SLMs, such as WavLM, as discriminators with our novel differentiable duration modeling for end-to-end training.” I don’t have time to read the paper to see what that means. Depending on what that means, it might be more accurate to say it was trained on 100 hours of audio and with the aid of another, pre-trained model. The reader who thinks “only 100 hours?!” will know to look at the pretraining requirements of the other model, too. reply delegate 4 hours agoprevThe quality is great (amazing even), but I can't listen to AI generated voices for more than 1 minute. I don't know why, I just don't like it. I immediately skip the video on youtube if the voice is AI generated. Might be because our brains try to 'feel' the speaker, the emotion, the pauses, the invisible smile, etc. No doubt models will improve and will be harder to identify as AI generated, but for now, as with diffusion images, I still notice it and react by just moving on.. reply CMay 55 minutes agoparentHaven't really been following the latest in TTS ML, but I expected this to be better or at least as good-bad as the stuff you hear on YouTube. Somehow it sounds worse. It really is jarring to listen to any of these ML voices and can't really stand it. Nope out of every video that uses them and can't tell if YouTube never recommends them to me for that reason, or just because the recommendations around what I watch are just so rarely going to be from some low reputation channel. Take a moment here for a second though and think about it. Even if these voices got to be really good, indistinguishable almost... would I want to listen to it even then? If it was an NPC's generated voice and generated dialogue in a game to help enrich the world building, maybe in that context. On YouTube or with newscasters? Probably not. Audio books? Think I would still rather have it be a real person, because it's like they're reading a story to me and it feels better if it's coming from someone. There's also the unknown factor, where if it's ML generated it's so sterile that the unknowns are kind of gone. Think about it like this, in the movie industry we had practical effects that were charming in a way. You could think about the physical things that had to occur to make that happen. Movie magic. Now, everything is so CG it's like the magic is gone. Even though you know people put serious hard work into it, there's a kind of inauthenticity and just lack of relevance to the real world that takes something away from it. It's like a real magician has interesting tricks, while an artificial magician is most likely just a liar. Still, I grant that it makes some cool things possible and there is potential if things are done right. Some positive mixture of real humans and machine generated stuff so it isn't devoid of anything connected to real life effort. reply rockemsockem 2 hours agoparentprevThat kinda means the quality isn't great or amazing. Good TTS should be nearly or indistinguishable from a human speaker and should include emoting, natural pauses, etc reply yjftsjthsd-h 22 minutes agoparentprev> I immediately skip the video on youtube if the voice is AI generated.

Best sounding voice I've ever heard, speaks fast, clear, crisp, with natural inflections to the sentences, and if I want to jump to somewhere I just left click the text at that spot. And it's instant - no conversions. Downside is I have to stay in bluetooth range of my laptop, so I'm still looking for a good phone based method. Google Play Books works okay, but gets buggy at 1.6 speed. reply woolion 5 hours agoprevIf you look for a lot of the great classics, audiobooks results are inundated with basic TTS \"audiobooks\" that are impossible to filter out. These are impossible to listen to because they lack the proper intonation marking the end of sentences, making it very tiring to parse. It might be better than tuna can sounding recordings, especially if you want to ear them in traffic (a common requirement), but that's about it. The alternative, if you want real quality recordings, is to stop reading classics and instead read latest Japanime Isekai of murder mystery, these have very good options on the market. Anyway, I don't think it needs more justification that it covers a good niche usage. I'm checking what the actual quality is (not a cherry-picked example), but: Started at: 13:20:04 Total characters: 264,081 Total words: 41548 Reading chapter 1 (197,687 characters)... That's 1h30 ago, there's no kind of progress notification of any kind, so I'm hoping it will finish sometime. It's using 100% of all available CPUs so it's quite a bother. (this is \"tale of a tub\" by Swift, it's about half of a typical novel length) reply csantini 5 hours agoparentYeah, that's a known issue, if the book is all on a single chapter you don't get any sense of progress. I may fix that next weekend reply woolion 4 hours agorootparentIt's not in one Chapter, but Chapters are called \"Section\" (and so ignored!). It should be simple to have a dictionary of the different units that are used (I would assume \"Part\" would fail too, as would the hilarious \"Catpter\" of some cat-themed kid book, but that's more complicated I guess?). It did finish and result is basically as good as the provided example, so I'd say quite good! I'll plan to process some book before going to bed next time!

I once heard an American friend with so-so Japanese ability ask a Japanese woman who had recently had a heart operation how her kokoro was doing, and she looked surprised and taken aback. Side note: After I started reading HN in 2019, I was struck by how many tech products mentioned here have Japanese names.

Years ago, when I was dating someone who spoke Russian as one of her native languages, we had to do a funny compromise when watching films together with her parents: they didn't speak a word of English, so we'd use the Russian dub with English subtitles. I noticed that the Russian dub was just one man reading a translation in a flat voice over what was happening on the screen, no attempts at voice acting or matching the emotions. Usually the dub would have a split second delay to the actual lines, so you'd still hear the original voices for a moment (and also a little bit in the background). At first I found it very jarring, but they explained that this flatness was a feature. You'll quickly learn to \"filter out\" the voice while still hearing the translation, and the faint presence of the original voices was enough to bring the emotional flavor back. The lack of voice acting helped with the filtering. This turned out to apply to me as well, even though I don't speak Russian! My brain subconsciously would filter out the dub, and extract most of the original performance through the subtitles and faint presence of the original voices. Obviously the original version would have been a better experience for me, but it was still very enjoyable. Of course a generated audiobook is not a dub, as there is no \"original voice\" to extract an emotional performance from. But some listeners might still be able do something similar. The lack of understanding in the generated voice and its predictable monotony might allow them to filter out everything but the literal text, and then fill it in with their own emotional interpretations. Still not as great as having proper story teller who does understand the text and knows how to deliver dramatic lines, but perhaps not as bad as expected either. reply arafalov 3 hours agorootparentHere is the rest of that story. When the foreign movies started to filter into the Soviet Union's illegal movie theatres, you would get 3 or 4 movies playing at once in one room. There would be a TV in each corner of the room and 4 or 5 rows of plastic chairs in front of it in an arch. ALL of the movies were being revoiced by the same person. So, if you were sitting in the back of the 5th row, you were potentially getting the sound from an action movie, a comedy, a horror movie and a romance at the same time. In the same voice. You learned to filter really well. So, if that's what they were trained on, watching a single movie must have been very relaxing. reply aleksiy123 7 hours agorootparentprevWatching these as russian/english bilingual is very painful, tho I grew up in western world so maybe I'm just not used to it. To add on a slight tangent. Many books/audiobooks just don't exist in other languages at all. So even getting some monotone is a lot better than getting nothing. I think this is where these models really shine.

Published by the Department of Transportation, it outlines the basic specifications of all the street signs you could expect to see out on roads and highways across the United States. Most are familiar, but if you dive deeper into its pages, you can find some unsettling relics from darker times. Back in the mid-20th century, America was tangling with the realities of nuclear war. Top generals contemplated targeting strategies, while engineers mused over whether there was anything to be done top stop a torrent of enemy missiles falling across the nation. These superweapons seemed to promise destruction on an overbearing scale, threatening the very existence of human civilization itself. Against this bleak backdrop, government administrators turned to the concept of Civil Defense. The idea was to do whatever could be done to protect the citizens of the nation from the horrors of nuclear war and its immediate aftermath. In turn, the Department of Transport worked up some rather depressing road signs to help people get where they needed to be in these bleak and trying times. In this case, “emergency” means “nuclear apocalypse.” Flip open the 1961 edition of the MUTCD, and you’ll find an important section on Civil Defense. It featured a handful of designs for traffic management in a post-nuclear world. Perhaps most interesting was the “MAINTAIN TOP SAFE SPEED” sign, designated CD-4. It’s purpose was highly unique: The “MAINTAIN TOP SAFE SPEED” sign may be used on highways where radiological contamination is such as to limit the permissable exposure time for occupants of vehicles passing through the area. Since any speed zoning would be impractical under such emergency conditions, no minimum speed limit can be prescribed by the sign in numerical terms. Where traffic is supervised by a traffic regulation post, official instructions will usually be given verbally, and the sign will serve as an occasional reminder of the urgent need for all reasonable speed. Our modern mockup of what this sign would look like in the wild. You really wouldn’t want to be the person sent out to stand there long enough to bolt it up. Base image credit: depositphotos.com Basically, if you saw this sign, you’re supposed to be gunning it as fast as you can while still staying on the road. The intention is to limit your exposure to radiation as much as possible while traveling through contaminated areas. ADVERTISEMENT The 1971 edition of the MUTCD expanded further on the Civil Defense section. The DOT had by this time developed a standardized sign for marking directions to fallout shelters, where citizens could wait out radioactive contamination falling from the sky after a nuclear attack. The document also specified a sign for decontamination centers, where those suffering radiation exposure might be treated by experienced personnel. The Fallout Shelter sign, as shown in MUTCD, 1971 edition. A modern version of the sign. Further signs in this series include the “AREA CLOSED” sign used to designate areas of high radiological or biological contamination that are too unsafe for travel. The DOT also specified a blue “Evacuation Route” sign marked with the Civil Defense logo. It was intended to guide citizens to safety along pre-planned routes. Ultimately, the Department of Transport prepared these signs for when things really hit the fan. Thankfully, the worst fears of the Cold War never came to pass, and these signs weren’t needed in any major emergency situation. The “AREA CLOSED” sign is impressively tame. You’d think it would be covered in nuclear warning symbols or something. And yet! Some of these signs persist in the MUTCD standard to the day. The most recent edition still includes some of these signs—like EM4-1b ‘FALLOUT SHELTER’—but now places them under the category of Emergency Management signs. The bleak term of “Civil Defense” is no longer very relevant in government administrative circles. Us car enthusiasts do like driving fast. Still, when the government has put out a sign telling you to floor it, you know the situation has to be dire. In the end, most of these signs have never been put to use, and that’s something we can all be thankful for. Regardless, the Department of Transport stands ready with signage prepared to deal with whatever might happen down the line.

Equally as pointless as duck-and-cover nuke drills. But there was still an air raid / nuke siren on a public building near by. Never heard it go off. 0 Kevin Rhodes 1 day ago Reply to Angry Bob Early in my travelling for a living career I was in some random town in Iowa when all the tornado sirens went off. Being a New England lad that scared the ever-loving-poop out of me. At which point you find out very quickly that they give tornado warnings by county, but if you aren’t FROM there you will have no idea what county you are in. I got in the habit of asking when I checked into hotels… Good times! Growing up in Maine, the volunteer fire fighters were called out by LOUD horns on the two town fire stations. Which they also blew at noon and 6pm as both tests and time markers for everyone. But that sound was nowhere near as terrifying as those wailing tornado sirens! 1 « Previous 1 2 Recent Posts Why Nigeria’s ‘Danfo’ Bus Drivers Might Be The Craziest And Most Skilled Drivers On The Planet January 15, 2025 No Comments How NOT To Buy A Vehicle Off Craigslist, OR, The Dangers Of Being Friends With A Car Enthusiast Why Automakers Like Toyota Have To Unlearn How To Make Cars ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT News Reviews Tips Merch Podcast About Us Advertise With Us Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions FAQ Newsletter Imprint Cookie Policy Menu News Reviews Tips Merch Podcast About Us Advertise With Us Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions FAQ Newsletter Imprint Cookie Policy Sign in Register Menu Sign in Register © 2025 The Autopian.

When in reality it would just be an increase in cancer risk. If it were THAT contaminated they'd use the AREA CLOSED the article mentions anyways. To be fatal within days you need about 10,000 mSv of exposure. Even with heavy fallout, exposure would probably be around 10 mSv per hour. reply somerandomqaguy 18 hours agoparentI'd imagine the concern is the radioactive dust / fallout getting stuck onto the vehicle, clothes, and hair which would increase your exposure time; getting through that zone as quick as possible could limit that dust sticking. But that's just my guess. reply titzer 15 hours agorootparentThis is the problem. It's not just being in the area, it's inhalation/ingestion and direct exposure to radioactive dust. If you look at [https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Quick%2...], the levels just from increased radiation from a single detonation there are certainly not fatal in a few minutes, but with multiple detonations it's not difficult to get a lethal dose in a few or hours or a day or two. Couple that with the inhalation/contamination issue, and yeah, be afraid. If I saw that sign I'd be a hell of a lot more concerned than \"oh, miniscule cancer risk later in life, meh, I guess I'll just slowboat this one\". reply jcgrillo 14 hours agorootparentprevchanging engine and cabin air filters would become an extremely hazardous affair reply deepsun 2 hours agoparentprevEveryone makes this mistake -- reducing radioactive fallout harm to just one metric.

These superweapons seemed to promise destruction on an overbearing scale, threatening the very existence of human civilization itself. THEY STILL DO!!!! This is what drives me nuts about our politics: so many people seem to think we can flirt with the sort of nationalism (1) that led us into WWI and WWII. But, friends, that road leads to your death in every direction. Mutually Assured Destruction is still a thing. Nuclear peace only works as long as all parties persistently work toward de-escalation, which can be measured by adherence to consensus and norms. Nationalism is antithetical to that posture. The iconoclast leaders of national populism are rooted in rulebreaking. They also tend to embrace strong foreign policy talk as a short term bolster to domestic support, again, antithetical to de-escalation. (1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism reply 0xbadcafebee 15 hours agoparentNationalists are not motivated by reason. Just telling them they're going to start a nuclear war isn't a deterrent. Loyalty, sacrifice, obedience, ethnicity, borders, tradition, etc are their primary motivators today. If they have to end the world with nukes to protect \"their\" nation, then by golly, that's what they'll do. Self-preservation isn't as important as preservation of the ethos. Look at any white nationalist terrorist organization. These are people who risk their lives to blow up buildings (sometimes their own government's), commit assassinations. They are aware they are putting their own lives at risk, but they do so anyway because in their minds they are doing the only thing that makes sense. In a competition with belligerent nations, nationalist zealots are happy to die for the cause. The only thing that can stop them is if the non-zealots, who are never as motivated, come out of the woodwork to stop them. As we've seen time and time again, most regular people just aren't willing to risk their own safety or standing in community to speak out against or fight against those who are doing wrong in their community. This is why nationalists win. They are way more inclined to get in people's faces than calmer, more rational folks. Easier and safer to go along with the crowd. And so goes a nation. reply tipiirai 14 hours agorootparentWell said.

E.g. the largest newspaper gets regular accusations of taking sides (in their comments section), but the complaints seem to come from all sides equally. Except for the nationalist party, but over 80% of us probably thinks they have earned the critique they get. reply dp88 12 hours agorootparentprevThe country originally had a program called Henkinen Maanpuolustus.

By 2005 no major competitor for Google had emerged so at least 1995-2005 there only ever was a digital ad monopoly in Finland. Here is an YLE-news article from as corrected by Claude that caught my eye & touches Syria, from last year: \"December 21, 2024 Works Cited Visala, Hanna. \"Analyysi: Erikoisinta Putinin neljän tunnin showssa oli paljastus, kenen kanssa hän mieluusti joisi teetä.\" YLE, 19 Dec. 2024, yle.fi/a/74-20132517. \"Results of the Year with Vladimir Putin.\" President of Russia, 19 Dec. 2024, en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/75909. Note on Sources and Methodology This analysis examines two primary sources: Hanna Visala's article published by YLE (Finnish Broadcasting Company) and the official transcript from the Kremlin website. All translations from Finnish to English are by the author, with original Finnish text provided for verification. In accordance with Journalistin ohjeet (The Guidelines for Journalists), particular attention has been paid to accuracy in source attribution and fact-checking (JSN Guidelines 7, 9, and 10). Executive Summary This analysis examines YLE's December 19, 2024 coverage of Russian President Vladimir Putin's annual year-end press conference against the official transcript. Our investigation reveals significant discrepancies between the reporting and source material, raising important questions about journalistic practices in covering complex geopolitical events. Methodology Our analysis employs systematic comparison of: Direct quotations from both sources Context preservation Attribution accuracy Supporting evidence Omission patterns Key Findings 1. Unverified Attribution YLE's most significant claim lacks source verification: YLE's text: \"Putin myös sanoi, että jos voisi palata ajassa taaksepäin, hän olisi aloittanut sodan jo aiemmin.\" [Translation: \"Putin also said that if he could go back in time, he would have started the war earlier.\"] This statement appears nowhere in the official transcript, raising serious concerns about attribution standards. 2. The Kursk Situation YLE's portrayal: \"Kysymys siitä, milloin Kurskin alue 'vapautetaan Ukrainan joukoista', sai Putinin rykimään hermostuneesti. Putin vastasi, että 'potkimme heidät varmasti ulos', mutta ei sanonut tarkkoja päivämääriä.\" [Translation: \"Question about when the Kursk area would be 'liberated from Ukrainian forces' made Putin cough nervously. Putin answered that 'we will definitely kick them out' but didn't give exact dates.\"] Official Transcript: \"We will undoubtedly drive them out. There is no alternative. Concerning a precise date – I am afraid I cannot specify one at this moment. I have an understanding of the plans, which are regularly reported to me. However, it is not possible to declare a specific date. The troops can hear me now; if I were to specify a date, they would go to great lengths to meet it, potentially disregarding casualties. We cannot allow that.\" The transcript reveals a strategic explanation for withholding dates, contrasting with YLE's interpretation of nervousness. 3. Economic Coverage YLE's coverage largely omits substantial economic discussions present in the transcript. Official Transcript's Economic Data: \"Last year Russia increased its GDP by 3.6 percent, and this year the economy is expected to grow by 3.9 percent, or possibly even four percent... What this means is that our economy will have grown by eight percent over the past two years... Unemployment is at its all-time low of 2.3 percent. We have not experienced anything like this before.\" This omission significantly affects readers' understanding of the complete context. 4. North Korea Claims YLE's assertion: \"Venäjän joukkojen rinnalla taistelevista Pohjois-Korean joukoista Putin ei maininnut sanaakaan. Ukrainan hyökkäys Kurskiin ja Pohjois-Korean joukkoihin tukeutuminen olivat selvästi odottamaton takaisku Putinin suunnitelmassa.\" [Translation: \"Putin didn't say a word about North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces. Ukraine's attack on Kursk and reliance on North Korean troops were clearly an unexpected setback in Putin's plan.\"] The transcript shows no context requiring discussion of foreign troops, instead detailing specific Russian units: \"Fighting alongside them are the 810th Marine Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet, the 76th and 106th divisions of the Airborne Troops, and motorised infantry of the Sever Group.\" 5. Syria Coverage YLE's characterization: \"Toinen kiusallinen aihe Putinille oli selvästi Syyria. Hän joutui vastaamaan yhdysvaltalaisen NBC-tv-kanavan kysymykseen Syyriassa 12 vuotta sitten kadonneen amerikkalaisen toimittajan kohtalosta. Putin yski kysymyksen päälle ja pyysi esittämään sen uudelleen.\" [Translation: \"Another uncomfortable topic for Putin was clearly Syria. He had to answer NBC's question about the fate of an American journalist who disappeared in Syria 12 years ago. Putin coughed over the question and asked for it to be repeated.\"] Official Transcript: \"Frankly, I have not met with President Bashar al-Assad after his arrival in Moscow. But I plan to do it and will certainly talk to him... I promise that I will definitely ask him this question just like we can forward this question to the people who are controlling the situation on the ground in Syria today.\" 6. Military Situation Assessment YLE's brief characterization: \"Putin näytti hyväkuntoiselta ja esiintyi varmasti vuosittaisessa tv-spektaakkelissaan. Hän kehui Venäjän taloutta – kuten aina – ja ylisti joukkojensa voittoja Ukrainassa.\" [Translation: \"Putin appeared healthy and confident in his annual TV spectacle. He praised Russia's economy - as always - and praised his troops' victories in Ukraine.\"] Official Transcript's detailed military assessment: \"The combat readiness of the Russian Armed Forces is the highest in the world today. I assure you it is the highest... As far as I know, the number of armoured vehicles destroyed in the Kursk Region has now exceeded the number of vehicles destroyed on the entire line of contact last year – in any case, these are comparable figures.\" Systematic Issues Identified Attribution Problems: Unverified quotes Interpretation presented as direct statement Absence of source verification for key claims Contextual Omissions: Economic data Policy discussions Strategic context Qualifying statements Narrative Framing: Emphasis on perceived weakness Selective quote usage Interpretative statements presented as fact Balance Issues: Limited perspective presentation Omission of contradictory information Selective context application Recommendations for Improved Coverage Source Verification: Direct quote verification Clear attribution standards Primary source consultation Context Preservation: Complete quote inclusion Relevant background maintenance Balanced perspective presentation Interpretative Clarity: Clear separation of fact and analysis Multiple perspective consideration Transparent reasoning for interpretations Conclusion This analysis reveals significant divergences between YLE's coverage and the primary source material. While editorial choices are necessary in news coverage, the extent of these divergences raises concerns about accurate public information dissemination. The findings suggest a need for more rigorous adherence to journalistic standards in complex geopolitical coverage. Methodology Note: This analysis compared the complete Finnish language YLE article (Visala, YLE, 19.12.2024) with the official English language transcript from the Kremlin website (President of Russia, 19.12.2024). All translations of Finnish text were verified by native speakers. The analysis focused on verifiable content comparison rather than subjective interpretation.\" Claude was given the transcript from Kremlin's site.

It's curious how nationalists, who often claim their stance is grounded in objective truths, almost always champion the nation of their birth. reply dotancohen 11 hours agorootparentFrom what I've gathered trying to talk to reasonable people who have different points of view from me, the main concern is preserving one's way of life. Their culture. I've heard the phrase \"the more of the third world you bring in, the more similar your country will be to the third world\". And be there no mistake - the countries that these people call \"third world\" don't want European or American culture infiltrating their societies either. reply olalonde 10 hours agorootparentThat was sort of my point: it's not a reasoned stance (e.g. culture X is objectively superior), but an emotional one (e.g. I have an emotional attachment to culture X). reply lb1lf 9 hours agorootparentprevThere's this quip (sounds like something Ambrose Bierce would say) Edit: It was G.B.

As far as nuclear weapons go, fear of being on the receiving end is what deters their use. The Russians keep mentioning the use of nuclear weapons; it's important not to back down in the face of that, because if we do, it will only repeat and increase. Iran, well you have to decide if they are just a different ideology, or if they are a death cult. If they're just a different ideology, MAD will work there too; if they are a death cult, you should advocate that we mutually assure their destruction before they get any. running around like a headless chicken setting the hands on a mythical clock does not achieve anything except scaring people, and people don't do their best thinking when scared. reply hommelix 11 hours agorootparent> you have it all backward > > >we can flirt with the sort of nationalism that led us into WWI and WWII > > who are you speaking for? because nationalism didn't lead us, the US, into either world war; a desire on the part of our elected officials to save/preserve our democratic European allies did; that and a direct attack from the Empire of Japan. > There are other people than the citizens oft USA in HN.

The Russians escalated by importing cannon fodder from North Korea. I think the better question would be if China crossed the Yalu River today and joined the North Koreans to assault South Korea, what would the response of the US, South Korea, and Japan be? The latter two can trivially develop nuclear weapons if the US security situation degrades. I think wielding nuclear weapons requires a baseline level of competence to exploit. reply teractiveodular 17 hours agorootparentprevYes? North Korea's own nuclear capability is very limited, and China doesn't care enough about North Korea to use its own arsenal and risk nuclear annihilation. I still wouldn't want to be in Seoul or Tokyo if that happens though, and yes, there's a non-zero risk somebody somewhere gets trigger happy and things spiral out of control. reply killjoywashere 17 hours agorootparentThe Yalu River separates China and North Korea. General MacArthur sent US troops across the Yalu, which is what caused the Chinese to enter the Korean War, and led to most of the US casualties. Truman fired MacArthur for disobeying his order to stay on the Korean side of the Yalu. That was before the Chinese had nuclear weapons. The Korean peninsula has been under an armistice and not at peace for 70 years in large part because MacArthur invaded China in I would characterize as a Cabinet war mentality. Go to the MacArthur museum in Norfolk, Virginia. MacArthur was from an extraordinarily wealthy family and clearly saw himself as an aristocrat with warrant to act unilaterally while deployed far afield. If the US sent its own troops to invade China today, do you think we be here to talk about it tomorrow? That would be no Cabinet war. reply Kim_Bruning 16 hours agorootparentDo you have a source for MacArthur actually crossing the Yalu? I can't seem to find one. reply Spooky23 15 hours agorootparentYou are right. MacArthur surrounded himself with sycophants and completely mismanaged the situation due to the disconnect with reality. He may have wanted to provoke a wider war with China, including nuclear weapons and supporting a nationalist invasion of China.

Crazy to think that we might have had a world with a unified democratic Korea and no North Korea had this not happened. MacArthur was too cocky. reply nl 16 hours agorootparent> MacArthur was too cocky. To say the least. The statement was silent, of course, on the secret testimony of Marshall, Bradley, Vandenberg and Collins. MacArthur thereby escaped the injury the testimony would have done his reputation, but the secrets badly eroded his support among those who should have been loudest on his behalf. Alexander Wiley, Styles Bridges and the other Republicans were compelled by the revelations about America’s vulnerability to rethink their endorsement of MacArthur and the belligerent course he favored. They didn’t recant in public; they wouldn’t give Truman that satisfaction. But they no longer looked to MacArthur as a credible alternative to Truman on military strategy or in politics. They eased away from the general, and because the testimony was sealed, they never said why. https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/redacted-testimony-fu... reply pknomad 16 hours agorootparentprevYep.

We should try one with everyone having nuclear weapons to see if it prevents more wars. Maybe fear of death in the aggressor nations would prevent their evils. reply autoexec 9 minutes agorootparentFailure where everyone does not have nuclear weapons looks very different from failure where everyone does. A scenario where everyone has nuclear weapons can only ever fail one time, because after that humanity will not survive to try anything else to \"see if it prevents more wars\". It depends on how you define success I guess. The very fact that we're alive to have the option of giving everyone nukes just to see what happens means we've already found a measure of success. If everyone has nukes and they use them it means no more humans, which means no more wars, which I guess can also be seen as a success. World peace at last. reply Dalewyn 17 hours agorootparentprev>Japan and South Korea are going to rapidly develop nuclear weapons programs. Japan would need to amend their constitution for that, and that is simply not happening. They have failed to amend their constitution for much more mundane objectives, let alone nukes. reply nocoiner 16 hours agorootparentSo that just means that if they ever make the political decision to pursue nuclear armament, they’ll call it the Japan Strategic Self-Defense Force. As it is, Japan probably already has nukes that are all-but-assembled.

They are not supposed to prevent a country from doing what is reasonable or necessary, as long as people are willing to accept that it was reasonable and necessary. reply YetAnotherNick 13 hours agorootparentprevMilitary breaks constitution all the times, including in US.

Themselves those people are not going to have trouble surviving a nuclear winter (a thought experiment is needed to determine whether they will even suffer from it all that much on a personal level, compared to ordinary people many of whom would just perish). Especially with MAD, but with modern technology in general, caring about survival and prosperity of your own citizens means caring about peaceful coexistence with other countries. In this context, a degree of nationalism is not bad and may in fact be important (if another country is being hostile and you do nothing, that is not a peaceful coexistence); it’s isolationism that is actually worrying: having every mature participant depend on each other is a great way to make them usually not want to eliminate each other. reply option 16 hours agoparentprevyou can’t have de-escalation from just one side.

The only MAD-able nation states in the 1980s were the United States and the Soviet Union. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian successor state has been unable to adequately maintain its military. I have seen ample evidence that the entire Russian military apparatus is a fraud and no evidence that it is not. The examples are too many to list in total so here are some highlights: 1. A string of ballistic missile test failures. 2. Photographic evidence of the poor conditions of their ballistic missile submarine bases and the submarines themselves including submarines that are considered \"active\" but haven't left port in many years. 3. The halving in the last 30 years of the number of Rocket Armies and the reduction of Rocket Divisions within the Rocket Armies. 4. The reassignment of Rocket Army personnel, supposedly the highest-priority and most stringently-selected personnel in the Russian Armed Forces, for duty in Ukraine where they have very quickly been killed. 5. Obsolete equipment rendering their strategic bombing forces ineffective in the face of Ukrainian air defense systems to the point that no strategic bombers enter Ukrainian airspace, instead lobbing cruise missiles into Ukraine from outside the air defense envelope due to numerous airframes being lost to, quite frankly, an inadequate and patchwork Ukrainian air defense network. I find any military that claims to have thousands of nuclear warheads ready to launch but cannot feed or clothe its infantryman to be, as the kids put it, \"sus\". Finally, they seem to have shifted their rhetoric to absurd doomsday weapons because they know we know that their nukes are shit so they have to come up with \"nuclear tsunami torpedoes\" and \"nuclear doomsday cruise missiles\" which are, I'm telling you as an engineer not a poly-sci major who grew up on Cold War fetishism and is now an \"analyst\", impossible fantasies. So you have the nuclear triad: submarines, bombers, and land-based ballistic missiles. Their subs are rusting hulks that rarely leave port, and those that do are at Kursk/Moskva levels of readiness. Their bombers can't even operate over Ukraine, a nation subsisting on single-digit percentages of obsolete NATO equipment. Their land-based ballistic missiles keep blowing up on the ground. Even their saber-rattling launch before Biden's trip to Ukraine, something that they would want to get right, exploded on the launchpad. Let's be very clear: they still have nuclear weapons. But MAD is MAD. Annihilation. Extinction. Not \"fuck this is bad\", but \"fuck we're all doomed, permanently, forever\".

Spoiler: I'm a big fan of Brock Yates. Speed limits are an imperfect tool for an important problem. They were generally much higher, or nonexistent, on US highways before the 1973 oil crisis [0]. They were intended to save fuel, but weren't very effective. Nowadays, most people discuss them as a safety tool. They aren't great for that, either. Speed disparity is the best way to cause an accident, with those going at least 5MPH under or 15MPH over the 85th percentile speed being the most dangerous drivers on the road. Limits force people to choose between going a comfortable speed and following the rules. When the difference between comfortable and legal speed is too high, you get situations where raising the limit can reduce the rate of accidents (citation discusses stats, my suggested reasoning is more speculative) [1]. There are still of course many cases where setting a slower speed limit has reduced accidents [2], but that effect is not universal. Also worth considering is that, even if higher limits reduce the rate of accidents, accidents at higher speeds are almost universally more severe. Consider long, straight, flat roads with 2+ lanes on each side, a median, no sidewalks, infrequent turn and/or merge lanes, with ample room to speed up or slow down, and speed limits of 50 MPH or lower. There are several near me. They are painful to drive, because they breed traffic tickets, tailgating, and accidents. Hell, the people on either side of the \"go a comfortable speed\" and \"go a legal speed\" even fight each other, making rolling roadblocks to slow traffic, or giving way to road rage. Either raise the limit, or add curves, trees, sidewalks, bike lanes, etc to convince people to slow down. I tend more towards the \"I can't drive 55\" side [3] because I think it's generally better for the economy when people and goods can move faster. Edit: For a specific example, from Kansas City, the 9+ hour drive to Colorado Springs or Denver (at 70MPH) makes it nearly impossible to go there. There's very little traffic on I70 past Topeka. Without a speed limit, I could easily do the trip in a little over 4 hours in my C350. That would be FANTASTIC for the economies on either side of that stretch (not to mention along it).

A car next to him going 70 mph sees the same object, has faster reflexes, and hits his brakes at the exact same spot of the road. He slams into the object at 50 mph.

It takes 30% farther to stop going 80 than it does going 70. That's when the issue is stopping distance. The issue on highways is that you have, for example, two cars in the left lane going 55 MPH and a third approaches going 70 MPH. One of the slower cars sees this and moves over but only at the same time as the faster car is changing into the same lane to pass on the right, so now both lanes are blocked, the faster car hits one of them and they're both edged off the road into a stationary object at highway speeds.

Yes their efforts should be remembered too. There are currently 800+ \"voluntary\" prisoner who are working firefighters battling the wildfires in Southern California for less than $5-10/day risking higher injuries than professionals with limited healthcare. Every country in times of need uses their prisoners as does Russia today for their war and they don't get treated the same as civilians in terms of rights. Forced labor in high risk jobs is also true to every draft and conscription in every military ever, not just for soviet union or other oppressive regimes. This is the social contract between a country and its citizens. Nobody is dismissing the all firefighters in California as forced labor without choice in their sacrifice because some of them are prisoners who have limited choice as parent post was implying. I think people who worked in Chernobyl deserve the same courtesy of considering all their sacrifices as voluntary independent of how they got there. --- On a side note we have the least standing to comment on forced work by prisoner in other countries, Slavery is still legal in the constitution for prisoners, we have the highest incarceration rates anywhere in the world even more than most regimes[1] in the world and for-profit prisons who charge prisoners from phone calls to soap a lot of money and also pay very little for the work they do while incarcerated .

Once the wheel either bottoms out in the pothole or hits the trailing edge, the spring sends the wheel up faster due to the energy from the impact. The shock is thus pushed up faster, and upon reaching its full contraction, settles back down into position to level the suspension on the road. The car ends up moving less in space and the suspension regains its position faster. If the car were moving slower, gravity, momentum and the inefficient suspension would end up moving the car itself more which has a larger impact on the ride. reply naming_the_user 18 hours agoprevWouldn't a higher speed turn up more dust and make things worse in general if your aim is to prevent the effects of radiation, given that inhaling alpha/beta is worse than the effects of gamma? reply dangoodmanUT 20 hours agoprevEveryone who doesn't see this sign is also going to die reply danillonunes 19 hours agoparentprobably reply qgin 19 hours agorootparentSo far so good reply tantalor 20 hours agoprevOn a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero reply zzgo 19 hours agoparentI am Jack's irradiated spleen. reply matthewmorgan 3 hours agoprevPages like this are completely unusable on mobile without adblock, and Google recently killed my ad blocker.

Not really an honest attempt at debunking this data, just handwavey \"it's all health care costs and its stupid\". Does it explain some of the divergence? Sure, but it doesn't even come close to making up the wage / productivity gap. I imagine much of the other \"debunkings\" are similarly naive A cursory search of how much of wages healthcare costs as a percentage of total compensation is in the US comes out to 7.6% in 2022. In 1971 it was 2.9% > For employee-benefit plans in 1971, health insurance contributions equaled 2.9% of all wages and salaries. > Insurance benefit costs accounted for 7.6 percent of total compensation and 26.8 percent of total benefits among private workers in September 2022.

If you have rudimentary financial history knowledge, then you would be aware that 1971 was the year Nixon took the US off of the gold standard. At the same time, if you have rudimentary economic history knowledge, then you would be aware that 1973 was the Arab Oil Embargo, and that the 1970s were an era of economic stagnation and inflation whose principal cause was that economic event. If you reevaluate many of these graphs knowing that the 1970s were a period of high inflation, and that there was a significant economic event in 1973, you end up finding that 1971 wasn't actually all that special: indeed, most of the time, when 1971 looks to be a key inflation point, it's because the graph isn't indexed for inflation and so the beginning of high inflation being around 1971 stands out. Where the graphs are indexed for inflation, there's no obvious inflection point around 1971, instead the inflection point shifts a lot more towards 1980. Putting that together, the only reason you have to make an argument for a monocausal economic event that happens in 1971 is if you want to emphasize the importance of the gold standard, and the only reason you'd have to believe it is if you don't have the economic literacy to understand why the evidence just isn't there at all. Put that together, and the reasonable assumption is that the people who made these charts are goldbugs who want to convince you that we need to return to the gold standard. reply nradov 26 minutes agorootparentStagflation in the 1970s was primarily caused by unforced domestic economic policy errors, not by the Arab Oil Embargo.

No thanks. reply matheusmoreira 1 hour agorootparentprev> inflation, bank runs and credit crises The root causes of the problem are right there in your sentence. Of course the banks were facing bank runs, they literally accepted that risk when they lent out the deposited money. When people came and tried to withdraw, they didn't have the liquid funds. Coming off the gold standard just made it a little easier for the government to bail out the banks by literally printing money and giving it to them so that people can withdraw their funds. \"Liquidity injection\" they call it. Credit and fractional reserve banking are the true origins of inflation. A thousand dollars can baloon up into tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars through the magic of repeatedly loaning money. You can run a money printer 24/7 and you will never inflate the money supply more than banks do with their loans. Credit is made up money. It just appears out of thin air when people get loans. It's not real until it's paid back. If too many people start defaulting on debts the whole thing comes crashing down. reply JumpCrisscross 1 hour agorootparent> Credit and fractional reserve banking are the creators of these problems Yes.

As frustrating as it sounds, we haven't found the solution. America solved it in the 1800s with commodity money; the US dollar was worth as much at 1900 as it was at 1800, and there weren't any financial collapses in the 1800s comparable in magnitude to the Great Depression or Global Financial Crisis. reply jcranmer 35 minutes agorootparent> the US dollar was worth as much at 1900 as it was at 1800 Uh, no it wasn't. From the very first search result I got on Google, a rough CPI measure of inflation would indicate that the US dollar was worth twice as much in 1900 as at 1800, a total inflation of -50% [1]. Now, that's not the most accurate assessment of inflation because the very concept of a single number for \"inflation\" doesn't work out well when you start trying to compare monetary amounts across decades, and it especially breaks down when you're bracketing the Industrial Revolution. But the broader point here is that the US dollar wasn't some mythically stable thing during the 19th century that somehow galloped out of control in the 20th century. > and there weren't any financial collapses in the 1800s comparable in magnitude to the Great Depression or Global Financial Crisis. This is \"never-cracked-a-history-book\" levels of incorrect. Severe depressions recurred about every other decade, and practically every decade had some sort of Global Financial Crisis-esque financial meltdown. Back then, most of these were called \"Panic of \" instead of \"depression\" or \"recession\", until you got to the Long Depression, which was called the Great Depression before the Great Depression itself actually existed. If you're familiar with US economic history, far from being a century of economic stability, 19th century American history was an economic roller coaster of soaring heights and terrifying crashes and the transitions between them being sharp, sudden, jarring, and without warning; by those standards, 20th and 21st American economic history is tame. (Indeed, commodity money is one of the causes of the rollercoaster nature of the economy, far from being a moderating force.) [1] Yes, the sign is right. Because, again, bracketing the Industrial Revolution. reply JumpCrisscross 20 minutes agorootparent> a rough CPI measure of inflation would indicate that the US dollar was worth twice as much in 1900 as at 1800, a total inflation of -50% Nitpick: you're comparing two currencies that happen to both have been called the dollar. A dollar in 1800 referred to \"371+4⁄16 grain (24.1 g) pure or 416 grain (27.0 g) standard silver\" [1]. (To drive home how confusing commodity money is, $2.50, $5 and $10 were defined in gold; cents and half cents in copper.) Because \"silver prices rose relative to gold as a reaction to the California Gold Rush\" [2], in 1873, the silver dollar was redefined at \"371.25 grains\" and the gold dollar at \"23.22 grains\" [3]. None of this, of course, has anything to do with the fiat greenbacks we printed during the Civil War [4] and the ensuing nonsense we had to deal with getting that to play with our metal standards [5], all of which culminated in the Gold Standard Act of 1900 defining a dollar at \"25.8 grains of 90% pure gold\" [6]. (94% the amount of pure gold per dollar as was in a 1792 Half Eagle per dollar. But again, we're comparing pre- and post-Gold Rush gold. And early industrial versus well industrialised economies.)

I mean, obviously it prompts the question of why executive compensation grew so fast. Well, executives are paid a ton because they need to compete in an environment where other executives of successful companies are already filthy rich. And why is that? Well, it's actually not because of compensation policy at all. Those other executives are rich because they were founders who hit an exit. That is, it's all HN's fault (and the fault of the VC-based startup money engine more generally). We created an environment where to staff a successful C suite you need to hire away senior people from FAANGs. And you can't do that unless you pay them crazy numbers. And that means the rest of your executive staff, and your board, need to see the same numbers. And so on, across the rest of the economy. You can't have an economy producing huge numbers in the stock market without handing those dollars out, in proportion, to the senior staff, basically. The same analysis does not hold to the regular employees, who don't compete against people getting that exit money. reply lordnacho 2 hours agorootparentWhy doesn't this logic work for all the staff? You need staff for your VC-backed startup as well, don't you? This explanation doesn't seem to explain why the CEO/staff comp ratio goes up. It just seems to say that comp should go up. If CEOs and staff both got their pay doubled by moving to one of these startups, the ratio would just stay the same. reply ajross 55 minutes agorootparentBecause good candidates for normal staff positions are not independently wealthy. Good candidates for executive positions tend strongly to be, having proven their value by bringing up some other startup.

But I think you are also likely correct that one could create a similar website about, if not any year, certainly many different years. I think this website is being rather disingenuous in the way it presents things. Not only in the way they cherry picked a bunch of charts which show drastic changes after 1971 (and which may or may not be related), but also in the way they leave it to the reader to \"do their own research\" while framing the question so as to ensure that 5 minutes of googling will yield the answer they want to plant in the reader's mind. reply jlhawn 1 hour agoprevMy favorite theory is that it's related to zoning, permitting, and the urban built environment. What happened in the early '70s is that many of the US's major cities saw broad downzoning which compounded the effect of urban flight to suburbs, urban renewal, and the construction of freeways in cities which started the decade prior. This ensured that the traditional productivity gains of cities could not be shared as equally any longer. It led to a lower labor share of income (higher share to rent/land) and longer commutes for suburbs which effectively lowered their share of wealth. Productivity gains since have mostly went to increasing economic rents for land owners and monopolistic capital owners. After California's Prop 13 in 1978, many other states followed with their own property tax caps in the late '70s and early '80s which led to even more of the share of economic gains going to property owners. reply bryanlarsen 2 hours agoprevMy favorite theory for the leading cause of the inflection in the early 1970's is energy prices. For the 100 years prior, the price of energy dropped very dramatically every year, Moore's law like. Then we had the oil crisis of 1973 and the price of energy has been roughly flat since.

His life is actually easier now, maybe he should get paid less? reply enragedcacti 14 minutes agoparentThe basic Econ answer is that there is a limited supply of labor and firms will raise salaries in order to attract labor and capture more profit from the increased productivity. From that perspective your question is similar to \"My product got 10x cheaper to make but customers still experience the same benefit so why should they pay less?\" In both cases the simple capitalist theory answer is markets. You can see a corollary to this across the whole economy in the Baumol effect, where industries with no productivity gains see labor costs rise as a result of competition with more productive industries for scarce labor: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol_effect Of course it turns out firms do have a lot of power over employees for various reasons which they use to suppress wages as much as possible but its still bounded. Another perspective is that workers are also consumers and an economy that doesn't increase compensation will have limited ways to capitalize on increased productivity because there will be little increase in domestic consumption.

Simply, there isn't a good reason. That's why we strictly regulate the labour market--we don't like the true price of labour. The broader reason: while there aren't fundamental reasons for the worker to capture that upside, there are great reasons for citizens to. (I'm using that term broadly.) For a variety of reasons, from Protestant morality to concerns about Communism, modern societies have preferred to reward citizens qua workers than citizens qua citizens. reply s1artibartfast 45 minutes agorootparentAlso, I have a pet theory that an increasing ammount of labor is being used to produce and service capital and infrastructure itself, as we transitioned to a service and knowledge economy.

The crisis illustrated vulnerabilities in the postwar economic order, provided a convenient pretext for shifting economic policies, and exposed a population that, for various reasons, was less unified and mobilized than in earlier decades. While the ruling class had long-standing interests in undermining their “extracted duties” under the social contract, the oil crisis gave them a plausible narrative and a set of conditions that made such changes appear more justifiable and less resistible shifting the narrative from away from collective welfare solutions and toward individual responsibility and market-driven approaches. I kind of view it as the oil crisis serving as a stress test that revealed the fraying unity and decreasing mobilization capacity of the general populace which occurred alongside broader cultural and political shifts in the 1970s that coincided with a decline in trust in institutions (partly due to events like the Vietnam War and Watergate). reply aredox 2 hours agorootparentprevYou see a constant growth, and then a plateau, and then divergence.

    "originBody": "How rqlite is tested Philip O'Toole January 10, 2025 Uncategorized rqlite is a lightweight, open-source, distributed relational database written in Go, and built on SQLite and Raft. With its origins dating back to 2014, its design has always prioritized reliability, and quality. The robustness of rqlite is also a testament to its disciplined testing strategy: after more than 10 years of development and deployments, users have reported fewer than 10 instances of panics in production. Testing a distributed system like rqlite is no small feat. It requires careful consideration of various layers: from individual components to the entire system in operation. Let’s explore how rqlite is tested, following its philosophy of maintaining quality without unnecessary complexity. The Testing Pyramid: An Effective Approach Testing rqlite adheres to the well-known testing pyramid, which prioritizes unit tests as the foundation, supported by integration tests, and capped with minimal end-to-end (E2E) tests. This strategy reflects decades of software development experience, ensuring test suites remain efficient, targeted, and easy to debug — and in my experience this approach works. Unit Testing: The Core of Quality At the base of the pyramid lies unit testing, covering isolated components. Unit testing dominates rqlite’s test suite because it offers the best balance of speed and precision. Given that rqlite’s database layer is built around SQLite and a “shared nothing” architecture, most database-related functionality can be reliably tested with unit tests. Testing is also a huge part of the design process. If a component cannot be unit-tested easily, it often signals issues with its design. A little dependency injection during testing is a good thing, but too much indicates an over-reliance on other components. Meeting the goal of easy unit testing means clean interfaces, helping components remain focused on a single task. Let’s look at the numbers. As of version 8.34.0, the entire rqlite code base is approximately 75,000 lines long (including tests, but excluding imported packages). Of that rqlite’s unit test suite comprises 27,000 lines of source code, making it the largest testing investment. Despite its breadth, the entire suite runs in just a few minutes, enabling frequent testing during development. System-Level Testing: Validating Consensus Above unit testing lies system-level testing (also known as integration testing), which focuses on the interplay between the Raft consensus module and SQLite. Since Distributed Consensus is at the core of rqlite, the correctness of this layer is crucial. Tests in this category validate: Replication of SQLite statements across nodes. Behavior of read operations at different consistency levels. Resilience during cluster disruptions, such as node failures and subsequent recoveries, as well as Leader elections. System tests include both single-node and multi-node configurations, ensuring the database operates correctly under varying cluster conditions. As of version 8.34.0, approximate 7000 lines of system-level tests exist, offering comprehensive coverage of these interactions. This test suite is also written in Go, which means it also runs relatively quickly. End-to-End Testing: A Minimal Layer End-to-end testing in rqlite serves as a smoke check, verifying that the system starts, clusters, and performs basic operations. Written in Python, these tests launch real rqlite clusters to ensure “happy path” functionality, guarding against embarrassing issues like a cluster failing to start due to a bug in command-line flag parsing. End-to-end tests are deliberately limited to scenarios that cannot be tested at lower levels. Over-reliance on end-to-end testing is avoided because debugging failures in such tests can become prohibitively costly. For instance, a misconfigured dependency deep in the stack might surface in an end-to-end test, but tracing the root cause would require navigating through numerous layers. A practical example of end-to-end testing is verifying backups to S3. End-to-end testing is useful here because setting up AWS credentials solely for unit testing would be cumbersome and, perhaps, impractical for other developers who wish to run the unit tests. While this approach does mean that S3-related development for rqlite is slower compared to other features, the trade-off is justified. The backup system rarely undergoes changes, so the added complexity of end-to-end testing is worth the effort to ensure reliability. For version 8.340, only 5000 lines of end-to-end tests exist, demonstrating a targeted approach. Performance Testing: Pushing the Limits Beyond functional correctness, rqlite undergoes performance testing to evaluate its limits under load. These tests measure metrics such as: Maximum INSERT rates. Handling of concurrent queries. Comparing memory, CPU, and disk usage across releases. A notable example involves testing with large SQLite databases, sometimes exceeding 2GB. Such scenarios highlight bottlenecks like rqlite’s memory management or disk write latencies, which are intrinsic to its architecture. Generating such large datasets efficiently remains an ongoing challenge, with potential solutions involving prebuilt SQLite databases stored in cloud buckets. Performance testing also ensures stability, identifying issues like memory leaks or unexpected Leader elections under stress. Lessons Learned Testing rqlite has taught me valuable lessons, many of which resonate beyond database development: Start testing at the start: Unit testing is the most effective way to build confidence in your system. Don’t delay writing unit tests during development. If a bug exists, you’ll likely find it faster here than in an integration or end-to-end test. Keep test code simple. Test suites are not the place for relentless refactoring or the DRY mindset. It’s more important that test code is straightforward and easy to understand, even if that means writing more boilerplate than you normally would. Check your tests. When writing a test, it’s a good practice to temporarily invert the expected result and run the test again. A properly written test should fail in this scenario. Surprisingly, this isn’t always the case, as errors in test code can sometimes go unnoticed. To avoid this, always take a moment to sanity-check your tests. It’s a small step that ensures your tests are reliable and truly doing their job. Don’t ignore test failures. Any test failure, no matter how difficult to understand, no matter how rare, is telling you something about your software — potentially something you don’t understand. Those hard-to-debug test cases often reveal a critical flaw in your code. Treat them as a gift and fix them. Maximize determinism. Build mechanisms into your system so you can trigger, on demand, what are normally automatic processes in your system. This allows you to test how your system performs when those operations occur. This approach is used in rqlite to test Raft snapshotting, which normally runs at semi-random intervals but can be explicitly triggered as needed during testing. Be Deliberate: Adding tests at higher levels must be justified. Excessive integration or end-to-end tests can quickly bog down development and debugging. Adapt and Iterate: For example, performance tests revealed that fsync calls were the primary bottleneck, leading to further optimizations in disk usage – such as compressing Raft log entries before writing them to disk. Efficiency Matters: With a suite that runs in a matter of minutes, I can iterate rapidly with confidence, a crucial advantage in maintaining an active open-source project. Quality Matters By adhering to the testing pyramid and focusing on targeted, efficient tests, rqlite maintains high quality while minimizing overhead. Whether through unit tests for component reliability, system tests for distributed consensus, or end-to-end tests for sanity checks, every layer serves a purpose. As rqlite continues to evolve, so will its testing practices. With distributed systems becoming increasingly complex, maintaining simplicity in testing will remain a cornerstone of its design philosophy. After all, the goal is not just to build a database but to build one that works reliably, and is easy to operate, in the real world.

Second and subsequent tests are much easier, especially when using: Parametrised tests let you test more things without copying boilerplate, but don't throw more variants just to get the count up. Having said that: Exhaustive validation of constraints, when it's plausible. We have ~100k tests of our translations for one project, validating that every string/locale pair can be resolved. Three lines of code, two seconds of wall-clock time, and we know that everything works. If there are too many variants to run them all, then: Prop tests, if you can get into them. Again, validate consistency and invariants. And make sure that you're actually testing what you think you're testing by using mutation testing. It's great for having some confidence that tests actually catch failures. reply otoolep 1 hour agoparent>The first test of a class of tests is the hardest, but it's almost always worth adding. Agreed, this has been my experience too. reply t43562 8 hours agoprevThe testing Pyramid makes sense. The problem for (perhaps) a lot of us will be that we're working on things where some or even all of the levels are missing and we have to try to bring them to a sensible state as fast as possible....but we have limited ability to do so. It's managing imperfection. We're also possibly working with multiple teams on products that interact and it ends up being \"nobody's job\" to fill in the e2e layer for example. Then when someone bites the bullet to get on with it....the whole thing isn't designed to be tested. e.g. how does anyone do testing with Auth0 as their auth mechanism? How do you even get a token to run an E2E type test? I have to screen scrape it which is awful. Without those E2E tests - even just the test that you can login - the system can break and even when it's a test environment that makes the environment useless for other developers and gets in everyone's way. It becomes the victim's job to debug what change broke login and push the perpetrator to fix it. With automated e2e tests the deployment that broke something is easy to see and rollback before it does any damage. I suppose I'm challenging the focus in a sense - I care about e2e more because some of those issues block teams from working. If you can't work because of some stupid e2e failure, you can't get fixes out for issues you found in the unit/integration tests. reply hitchstory 8 hours agoparentThe pyramid makes sense for certain types of application - very logic heavy with light integration touch points with everything cleanly dependency injected. rqlite fits this pattern. If you're building a logic lite application which has a lot of integration touch points (I find most commercial code actually fits this pattern) then it makes zero sense - an integration test heavy test suite is what you want - an upside down pyramid if you will. If you have a ball of mud on your hands then it doesnt matter what kind of app it is, E2E tests are the only thing that makes sense and you need to build very sophisticated fakes (requiring a lot of engineering skill) to avoid things like flakiness bugs and the token scraping problem you referred to. If you're writing a parser, you probably want 100% unit tests and property tests for all those millions of parser edge cases. No pyramid of any shape is required, just a slab. The testing pyramid reminds me of microservices: the people who came up with Their Grand Idea had no clue what it was about their specific circumstances that made their approach work for them but still managed to market it as The Way. Realistically, the ultimate shape of your test suite should be an emergent property based upon a series of smart, local decisions - ideally TDD'ed tests which match the kind of code you are writing right now. Making a particular shape a goal is asinine. reply dpc_01234 8 minutes agorootparentIt's very common mistake in SWE to generalize and extrapolate from own situation.

One part I couldn't follow was security - other than items listed (file system, HTTPS, IP based filter), is it correct to say that if you know & have access to the URL API endpoints, any query can be run directly off the db with curl or such tools?

Sorry if this question is inappropriate or too dumb. reply otoolep 16 hours agoparentrqlite supports a few levels security, which you can use separately or together. You can enable BasicAuth on the HTTP endpoints. You can also require that any client presenting BasicAuth credentials has the right permission for the operation the client is trying to perform. Finally you can also enable Mutual TLS, requiring that any client that connects must first present a cert that is signed by an acceptable CA.

So here's my disclaimer: I'm the author of rqlite. I really admire the testing that the SQLite team does[1], and the way it allows them to stand behind the statements they make about quality. It's inspiring. IMO there have only been two really big improvements to software development relative to when I started programming professionally 25 years ago: 1) code reviews becoming mainstream, and 2) unit testing. (Perhaps Gen AI will be the third). I believe extensive testing is the only reason that rqlite continues to be developed to this day. It's not just that it helps keep the quality high, it's a key design guide. If a new module cannot be unit tested during development, in a straightforward manner, it's a strong sign one's decomposition of the problem is wrong.

    "title": "Rewriting my website in plain HTML and CSS",
    "originLink": "https://www.vijayp.dev/blog/rewrite-plain-html/",
    "originBody": "vijayp.dev Blog Projects Rewriting my website in plain HTML and CSS January 15, 2025 This week, I decided to rewrite my website using plain HTML and CSS. When I originally made it, I used SvelteKit for simplicity. It was a more interesting project than I was expecting when I started working so I wanted to share my thoughts on the experience. Why? There are a number of reasons I decided to do the rewrite. One is that I’m currently unemployed so I have a lot of free time for side projects. Another is that, as you can see, this website is pretty simple so I wasn’t gaining a lot from using SvelteKit. I also wanted to move the site over to Cloudflare Pages so this was an opportune time to make some changes. However, the primary reason I decided to make some changes is that I find the Javascript bundler and building ecosystem incredibly aggravating to use. For example, one of the things I set up my old website to do was build the blog section from the set of Markdown posts. I assumed this would be easy to do. SvelteKit and Vite allow you to prerender your website and I had a set of files at build time - I just needed to add some logic to transform them. Instead, it was infuriatingly difficult to figure out a way to just get a handle to a set of files in my tree at build time (let me caveat that I’m not a frontend dev and maybe I missed something obvious). It took me hours of Googling and trying out different options to come up with this awful piece of code that worked to load the contents of a file and give them to my page: import type { PageLoad } from \"./$types\"; export const load: PageLoad = async ({ params }) => { const file = await import( `../../../../lib/assets/posts/${params.slug}.md` ); return { content: file.default, ...file.metadata }; }; I was tired of dealing with things like this for the tiny amount I was gaining from using SvelteKit. And so, I finally decided it was time for a rewrite. How? I think spending too much time on Hacker News gave me the misconception that writing a website using plain HTML and CSS would be a relatively well-paved path in 2025. I spent some time looking around for guides or a “canonical” way of doing this and found that there isn’t really one. Because of that, I decided to just start from scratch with an empty directory and go from there. My website is small enough that I was able to remake a lot of the pages as static HTML. However, I prefer writing blog posts in Markdown. It’s easier to write than HTML, I can pull posts out of my existing Obsidian vault, and I just find it more convenient. Therefore, I needed some kind of script to turn my Markdown blog posts into HTML content. I investigated some options for this and found Pandoc. Pandoc is a universal document converter for converting markup formats. It provides a library and a CLI for converting documents from Markdown to HTML (along with many other formats). To write the script, I wanted something as lightweight as possible but easier to use than a Bash script. This led me to Python and uv. I’ve found that uv basically abstracts away the Python environment in a way that’s really convenient for a tiny project like this. Using Python also gave me a free way to serve my website using the http.server module. Finally, I wrote a tiny Makefile so I wouldn’t have to remember the serve command. Results The outcome was not the most revolutionary because my website was really simple in the first place. But the size of my “compiled” website asset went from ~356kb to ~88kb. My project tree got a lot simpler and the only Javascript on the site now is to highlight code. I’m also just happier about the state of things. I feel like I understand how and why my site works (where before I understood parts but not the whole mystery). Before, with SvelteKit After, with plain HTML Next Steps There are two downsides that I’ve found so far. I’d like to investigate ways to fix or improve these. More code duplication. SvelteKit has a component system so I could make my navigation bar as a component and reuse it. When I removed it, I had to duplicate that code in a few places. Luckily the cost was pretty minor because I only really have four HTML pages. I’m aware that there’s some way to do this using web components. It’s something I intend to look into as one of my next side projects. No live reloading. I have to kill the website to rebuild it now. I’m sure there’s a tool I can find to fix this, or maybe just use something like FastAPI that has automatic reload. But until I do something about it, there’s a minor added cost every time I make a change. Also, I think this repository is now a reasonably good template for someone who wants to make a simple website with some Markdown blog posts without using a generator. I was surprised when I started this project how difficult it was to find a guide about how to write your site without a framework. Hopefully this can help some other people.",

I must say, I quite like this method. There's no substitute for practice when it comes to maintaining your skills at editing HTML and CSS. Yes, you must copy and paste content and not having layout page is annoying at times. But the overhead of just doing it yourself is surprisingly small in terms of the time commitment. Typically, I'll draft a post in MS Word then open the git repo for my site, hosted on github pages, duplicate and rename the template.html page that includes the CSS, footer, and header for my site and then copy my content into it. When I'm happy with everything, I'll make my commit and then a minute later it's live at my custom domain. Seeing that it takes only 11KBs and 26ms to load my landing page strangely delightful. reply tannhaeuser 13 hours agoparent> copy and paste content and not having layout page is annoying at times HTML was envisioned as an SGML application/vocabulary, and SGML has those power features, such as type-checked shared fragments/text macros (entities, possibly with parameters), safe third-party content transclusion, markup stream processing and filtering for generating a table of content for page or site navigation, content screening for removal/rejection of undesired script in user content, expansion of custom Wiki syntax such as markdown into HTML, producing \"views\" for RSS or search result pages in pipelines, etc. etc. See [1] for a basic tutorial.

The DNS lookup and the TCP connection are a high fixed cost for the first .html request. - HTTP/2 (2015) further reduces the cost of subsequent requests, with a bunch of techniques, like dictionary compression. - You will likely still be 10x faster than a typical \"modern\" page with JavaScript, which has to load the JS first, and then execute it. The tradeoff has flipped now, where execution latency for JS / DOM reflows can be higher than network latency. So using raw HTML means you are already far ahead of the pack. So say you have a 50 ms time for the initial .html request. Then adding somemight bring you to 55 ms, 60 ms, 80 ms, 100 ms. But you would have to do something pretty bad to get to 300 ms or 1500 ms, which you can easily see on the modern web. So yes go ahead and add thosetags, if it means you can get by with no toolchain. Personally I use Markdown and some custom Python scripts to generate the header and footer. reply mixmastamyk 2 hours agorootparentYes, I’d add that not merely “raw html” but a file on disk can be served directly by Linux without context switches (I forget the syscall), and transferred faster than generation. reply mixmastamyk 16 hours agorootparentprevSounds like premature optimization for a simple page. If the objects are sized their regions should be fillable afterward without need to resize and be cached for subsequent access. reply liontwist 15 hours agorootparentThe other solutions are even easier and don’t double latency. > be cached for subsequent access.

They are totally different things.

People have asked for it for over 30 years, so it's unlikely that it will be implemented now. That doesn't really fit with the intentions of HTML, and could impose a bunch of extra network latency overhead compared to using SSI instead, leading to either complete rendering delays or jumpy pages as included content is merged in in steps, though I have seen it implemented multiple ways using a bit of JS (some significantly more janky than others). reply mixmastamyk 2 hours agorootparentprevSee my reply about the object tag.

Certainly when I looked into a few SSGs for the purpose of making a simple personal website (without a blog) I found I would spend more time trying to bend them to my will than just writing what I want in markdown and running pandoc on it. reply WorldMaker 1 hour agorootparentMost of them bend to your will very easily if you are the one writing the HTML and not trying to use an existing template/theme. Even Jekyll the \"themes\" are optional and you can entirely ignore them. Also most of the complexity disappears if you aren't trying to make a blog. They generally all have \"simple pages\" support that is much simpler than trying to figure out their blog mechanics. Of course the hard part is picking an SSG you like, and it is easier to just build your own which is a big part of why SSG proliferation happens. Too many options? Make a new one. My main sites are still in Jekyll for now, for historic reasons of GitHub Pages support. My latest discovery and new love in this space is Lume [0]. It's definitely on the simpler side of the scale. I haven't tried it for a full blog yet, but the simple website I have built with it has indeed continued to feel simple throughout the process and even using some of the features Lume's documentation labels \"Advanced\".

More flexible than plain html files and very low learning commitment. I've been doing that for years and really happy with the result. reply oneeyedpigeon 9 hours agoparentprevAnother way of looking at it is that Hugo, eleventy, etc. are reinventions of pandoc, makefile etc. The latter things came first! reply zahlman 9 hours agorootparentI would rather say that the former group are wrappers around the latter group. Using an SSG doesn't just mean converting Markdown etc. source and orchestrating a build process of some sort, but also filling in templates and providing useful build steps to orchestrate (such as generating additional pages that reference the actual article content: archives, collections grouped by tags or categories, etc.). They also generally implement things like the live reloading that the author mentioned as missing. I'm currently using Nikola and have done quite a bit of customization - by hacking around and learning modern web stuff as I go (the last time I did this stuff seriously, jQuery was dominant and Bootstrap was brand new - of course I'm not writing a bunch of JavaScript for a blog, but that also presumably dates my understanding of HTML and CSS). I've found that even though there's way more stuff in here than I really want, it's really nice to have that kind of scaffolding to start, and I can strip it away as I customize. reply alwillis 12 hours agoparentprevIn my opinion, Jekyll is easier and more capable than Pandoc and markdown files for a HTML/CSS website.

Maybe both. reply arnath 17 hours agoparentprevYeah, obviously this is literally what something like Jekyll or Hugo does. It's just (at least to me) a simpler version of that where you can fully see what's happening.

I didn't like how complex that stuff is with Nikola - I didn't have an obvious entry point for making the kinds of customizations I really wanted, and yet there was still so much to look at in order to understand the system. But at the same time I really didn't want to spend hours re-learning CSS more or less from scratch, when I could actually use the examples already in the existing themes. I did something really awful: instead of trying to make yet another layer of theme \"extension\", I copied everything locally and have been condensing it as I go. This had the benefit that I didn't have to decide on a bunch of CSS classes up front in order to have anything look passable. There may be tons of unused stuff, but I'm cleaning that up as I implement my own things - and bit by bit, I get something smaller and more comprehensible that fits my mental models. This conversion process might not be any faster, but I'm certainly enjoying myself more. At some point in the future I'm considering doing a simple templating engine and converting these templates (originally Mako) to it. It just irritates me that I still have to deal with close tags - both in HTML and in template directives - when I'm doing everything in Python. I have a vague memory of a 2010-era JavaScript templating system - I think it was called Express or something like that? - which used indent-based syntax without closing tags. So I'm inspired by my recollection of that. reply catapart 18 hours agoprevGood on ya! HTML+JS is plenty performant for a blog and I'm always happy to see more people eschewing frameworks when they're not necessary.

I also have written a C program for checking the HTML and all the internal links and the use of tags. The program places all updated files into a folder ready for upload with FTP. To edit the HTML, I use an editor (based on Crystal Edit) that also can navigate HTML files: when pressing F5 on a link, it opens the file in the editor (or in the default browser when it is an external link), and if there a tag in the link, positions the cursor at that line.

I looked into a bunch of static site generators and found that direction to be too complicated and slow for me. I still wanted the ability to have a common headers and footers and unique sections without repeating myself in every file. So I created a very small PHP application (just 5 files) and each page or blog post is a single PHP file in a directory. These PHP files have a small bit of metadata code at the top but are otherwise just plain HTML files. In each directory is layout file that wraps the content and these nest up the directory structure. So my site has a common header and footer and each section has their own subheader.

Moreover, as there is also no external input other than fragments from the request URI, which can be laundered easily (e.g., by discarding all non alpha-numeric characters) and checked for resolving to existing file paths in given constraints, this should be also considerably secure. (This is actually a rather short script.) - a server config (`.htaccess` or similar) that parses parts of the request URL to parameters to be used by the template script. (So, adding a post is as simple as adding a new HTML file, copying an entry in the feed file and modifying it accordingly for the new page. And it can be done all in a text editor. The only thing missing may be a full-text search, as there is no DB involved and no representation of the content as normalized plain text. On the other hand, this also keeps the server load low.) reply enmyj 18 hours agoprevLots of people saying they did something similar, so I'll add that I also did something similar for learning / fun(?) with the added wrinkle that it runs on a raspberry pi at my house.

Building a website this way really teaches you why we started having all the complexities in web frameworks today. For certain simple websites like this one, the tradeoffs are worth it.

The colors, spacing, and fonts are very comfy - this is exactly the look I'd want for my blog. reply fractorial 15 hours agoprevFWIW I just import a canned CSS theme (Terminal CSS), MathJax, and the roll the rest in raw HTML; it’s simple and maintainable. reply chazeon 17 hours agoprevThere is a tool called entr, it kill and restart command when any file changes are detected, you could check it out. reply begueradj 11 hours agoprevHow is code syntax highlighting achieved in this context ? reply Bengalilol 9 hours agoparentBrowser -> show source -> inspect element You then see that it uses highlight.js reply begueradj 8 hours agorootparentThank you. reply beka-tom 9 hours agoprevPandoc really looks like a nice tool reply pfych 18 hours agoprevThis is exactly how I generate my site[^1]. Except I use a simple Node script to handle hosting a tiny HTTP server. Node calls pandoc, which converts my markdown into HTML, ESBuild to convert the few JS snippets I run on my site (which I write in TS), and SASS to convert my scss stylesheet into a bundled CSS sheet. It's super lightweight and I like that I can bend it to do whatever weird shit I want my site to have without relying on a 3rd party static site generator. [^1]: https://pfy.ch reply wonger_ 18 hours agoprevHere's some of my tips for a handwritten HTML site, since the author wished more tips existed: - consider using an HTML boilerplate template like this one if you don't know where to start: https://www.matuzo.at/blog/html-boilerplate/ - consider using a CSS template, or a CSS reset, if you don't know where to start with styling. Pico CSS is a good drop-in: https://picocss.com/. Frontend devs always blog about their CSS resets, like this one: https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/. But if you're someone inclined to write their own HTML, then you'll probably also want to write your own CSS. This takes time to learn. Especially learning how to design the page without looking crappy - I copy my last page as a template whenever writing a new page - I don't worry about code duplication. If I need to refactor duplicated content, I use search and replace across files in vim (like https://nithinbekal.com/posts/vim-search-replace/). Hopefully your editor/IDE has something similar, and hopefully you're comfortable with regexes - markdown + pandoc + scripting is a common solution. Technically it's not handwriting HTML at this point -- it's hacking together your own static site generator instead of using an existing framework -- but no biggie - frontend people have made a lot of live reload tools over time. Here's a couple: https://nitoyon.github.io/livereloadx/ and https://github.com/tapio/live-server. Personally, I've cobbled together something with entr/caddy/websockets/userscripts. I've had problems with `python -m http.server` freezing up occasionally, but YMMV - About RSS: you can generate your own feed if you already started your own generator script. Personally, I let this tool generate a feed for me in a GitHub Action: https://feed-me-up-scotty.vincenttunru.com/, but the feed quality is meh - Expect to do a lot of fiddling. You'll reinvent things. You'll lack common features for a while. Embrace this as minimalism. You'll begin to appreciate the tasks that frameworks automate (image optimization, compression, meta tags, validation, etc) - You'll face growing pains after you cross certain thresholds of page counts. Personally, I'd rather be grug-brained and edit more HTML than figure out some new framework. This is fine for a personal website with a straightforward structure reply nyarlathotep_ 2 hours agoparentGreat resources, cheers for this. Totally forgot about CSS resets. reply bpiroman 16 hours agoprevwe need more of this. Thanks for sharing!! reply superkuh 14 hours agoprevPlain HTML and CSS personal site experience can be vastly improved by using server side includes. Your webserver's SSI module is likely just the right amount of templating power so you don't have to re-write the same HTML in $x spots with a minimal attack surface and maintenance burden. SSI hasn't changed in 20 years and the nginx module at least hasn't even ever had a cve....This type of ssi templating is extremely useful for static HTML sites using .html (and other) files on filesystems. I've been using it since hosting my website on my 56k modem in 1999 with Xitami server on Win98. Now I do it hosting from my cable modem in 2025 with nginx on linux. reply robgibbons 13 hours agoparentSSI's were my first foray into \"backend,\" if you can even call it that, sometime around the year 2000. Some benevolent commenter on Slashdot gave me the tipoff, and my growing frustration with copy-pasting HTML snippets between pages was henceforth a thing of the past. Then came PHP, Python, et cetera, and the rest is history. Amazing how such a simple mechanism can remain useful even decades later. reply revskill 14 hours agoprev [–] text is not json. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
