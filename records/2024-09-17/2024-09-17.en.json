    "commentBody": "Dozens of Hezbollah members said to be seriously injured as devices explode (timesofisrael.com)672 points by FridayoLeary 5 hours agohidepastfavorite663 comments sbeam 2 hours agoIf we try to do what we are best at here at HN, let’s focus the discussion on the technical aspects of it. It immediately reminded me of Stuxnet, which also from a technical perspective was quite interesting. I already wonder if this was anything that was planted in the devices perviously, or if the ones responsible had similar devices, and managed reverse engineer them and craft a payload to them, that could be sent over existing cellular protocols/networks and then, similar to Stuxnet, make the device exagerte some existing functionality to a point where it caused a malfunction? Thoughts on this? reply pragma_x 0 minutes agoparent> make the device exagerte some existing functionality to a point where it caused a malfunction? Thoughts on this? I'm actually astounded by the things that must have been in place to make this attack even plausible, let alone viable. At the same time, the ramifications are sobering. Here's where my head is: - Hezbollah failed to inspect electronics that, if tampered with, could have lead to some kind of intel breach. That or the explosive modifications were indistinguishable from the real thing. - Operatives knew what pager numbers were in use by Hezbollah, perhaps exclusively to the rest of the population. From there I have three possible explanations for how this may have been executed: 1. Many shipments of such pagers bound for Hezbollah in Lebanon and other places in the region, were identified, intercepted, modified, and sent on their way with minimal delay. You probably don't get many opportunities like this (how often do you replace a pager?), so this is really quite a hat-trick. 2. Or: there are many more pagers out there with a very dangerous vulnerability on board, with only a special pager sequence that stands between the user and sudden death. This suggests simply infiltrating the manufacturer instead. This also has much more favorable lead times and can leverage the manufacturer's resources to that end. 3. Or: There's a pager manufacturer out there with gob-smackingly bad engineering and software on completely stock units, which operatives simply exploited to (sub)lethal effect. reply some_random 2 hours agoparentprevWe can't really do much more than speculate right now, but it seems like the most likely answer is that a shipment of pagers was intercepted and implanted with explosives. Israel has done this before to assassinate a prominent bomb maker. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Ayyash#Assassination reply mrtksn 2 hours agorootparent> most likely answer is that a shipment of pagers was intercepted and implanted with explosives I agree, there are photos and videos of extensive damage to furniture and injuries that go way beyond what a small lithium battery would NORMALLY do. Also, all the CCTV footage I've seen indicates explosions and not fire. It can be explosives planted, However it can be batteries modified to explode instead of burn&outgas. I recall a video of someone losing their lives when their vape battery exploded. IIRC the vape's metal structure acted as a container that enabled pressure build up and eventual sudden release. There are many stories about vapes exploding, some causing serious damage similar to these: https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/vape-explod... https://www.dailydot.com/debug/e-cig-vape-pen-explosion/ Kind of makes sense to modify the battery because since they still need a functioning battery anyway and the space is limited. reply kergonath 2 hours agorootparent> It can be explosives planted, but maybe it can be batteries modified to explode instead of burn. That is not really a thing, from a technical point of view. Changing the chemistry of the battery (assuming that a suitably explosive one exists; these tend not to be developed very far) would just be swapping an explosive and not a modification. Doing something like adding some vessel to build up pressure within the battery sounds impractical (you’d need something very resistant to heat as a battery fire goes above 2000 K), at which point it’s not worth the trouble. The most likely is either some explosive besides the battery, or something that looks like a battery from the outside, but is actually half explosive on the inside to at least pass superficial inspection. This kind of damage really does not look like a battery gone wrong. It would have left all sorts of chemical residues and burned very differently. reply rdtsc 2 hours agorootparent> The most likely is either some explosive besides the battery, or something that looks like a battery from the outside, but is actually half explosive That is the most plausible explanation. It can’t be an obvious thing or someone would notice it. If it looks like a plain battery pack, nobody would think of cutting it open. reply londons_explore 1 hour agorootparentThe explosive here could be perhaps just 8mm x 8mm x 8mm to do the sort of blasts you see in the videos. Thats fairly small, and could easily be hidden in a device. Inside the battery is perhaps the best hidden, but you'd need to own a bunch of battery manufacturing facilities (expensive). Cheaper would be to simply remove some other component (eg. one of two speakers) and replace it. reply nwiswell 0 minutes agorootparent> Inside the battery is perhaps the best hidden, but you'd need to own a bunch of battery manufacturing facilities (expensive). Do you? What stops you from just taking a smaller battery and packing it with some plastic explosive into the typical \"battery foil\"? I'm sure the IDF is capable of doing that at scale. rdtsc 12 minutes agorootparentprevI don't see someone like Iran or Lebanon being able to do that, but Israel has a great technical know-how and a ton of resources. Making custom batteries, with embedded explosives seems plausible. reply HenryBemis 22 minutes agorootparentprevConsidering the tech industry of Israel and the bottomless military/security budget, this is very plausible. Also considering that a plan like that must have taken many months/years start-to-end, this just makes me wonder what else is booby-trapped(?), fridges? laptops? microwave ovens? the next door flat? flower pots? Stuff like that take the paranoia levels all the way to 11. reply mrtksn 2 hours agorootparentprevYou are probably right but explosives risk detection, either by the militants or by the airport security if taken to a flight to a country with serious security. reply londons_explore 1 hour agorootparentnews reports suggest 1000+ of these devices exploded. In a country where lots of people would happily crack open the lid of a device to replace the battery or otherwise tinker, the explosives must have been well hidden, not just tucked into the case. reply ArnoVW 32 minutes agorootparentit is my understanding that the devices had been delivered recently reply delfinom 1 hour agorootparentprevI work in the battery space. All you have to do is build replacement batteries without the pressure relief vents. You can easily get a Chinese manufacture to do this for a fee and properly some complaining about how stupid it is to do. Then wrap it in some nichrome wire and have a micro run some power through it. The nichrome wire will overheat the cell really quickly causing the cell to rapidly over pressurize and boom. Small pouch or prismatic cells that would be used at the size of a pager generally won't burn. And I speak from experience of doing stupid shit to them in the name of testing, nothing like using the nail puller side of a hammer to puncture them, or rigging up a fixture with 3 concrete nail guns to shoot it or well, fun stuff reply jandrewrogers 55 minutes agorootparentThis wasn't a battery, it doesn't match the damage seen. The evidence has all the hallmarks of a small charge of high-explosive. reply londons_explore 1 hour agorootparentprevThese pagers probably had puch cells - those catch fire violently, but don't explode because the film can't contain much pressure. reply gizmo 1 hour agorootparentprevExplosions are essentially about extremely rapid expansion of gasses. I don’t see how a battery, even one that is rigged to fail, can explode in an instant. Shorting out, overheating, and ultimately exploding because the battery compartment can no longer contain the expansion has got to be too slow by many orders of magnitude. Your theory makes no sense to me. reply Retr0id 1 hour agorootparentPressure vessels without a pressure-relief system explode once sufficiently pressurized. reply wizardforhire 24 minutes agorootparentprevIt’s the simultaneous timing thats a giveaway for me. Maybe you could have a few batteries explode but 2000 of them?

My guess would be that not only the battery but also the main board was modified to initiate the action. edit: why do you think I'm not sure if they are serious? Calculator jokes are not a niche humor :) reply dllthomas 1 hour agorootparent> I see some reports claiming that the trigger message was “07734 58008” but hard to tell if all these accounts are serious.

That does not seems serious. reply mrtksn 1 hour agorootparentprevVery interesting, so the battery modification is plausible it seems. reply highcountess 1 hour agorootparentI agree with this theory even though I am not even sure it would require a specific modification like the mentioned heating wire, if you can simply use the existing circuit with some instruction to cause component overheating with the same effect. Another reason I do not believe it was an explosive is that a clandestine explosive installation would have resulted in far greater damage and included shrapnel. Because why would you not install very high explosives and shrapnel in a shape charge that directed the explosion into the likely body of the wearer if you are taking the risk of intercepting and making a physical modification. This is also less Stuxnet and more infiltrating insecure systems of vehicles to drive by wire accelerate cars into objects. There have been examples of this reply zdragnar 53 minutes agorootparentA shape charge would be pointless because you can't guarantee how the device is worn- one news article mentioned most people carry them in their pockets, so a shape charge would be blowing most of the energy away from the target in 50% of the cases. reply sandworm101 38 minutes agorootparentA shaped charge need not be unidirectional. It could be focuses along an axis, resulting in a two-way explosion that would be more damaging than a symmetrical one. Two copper disks on either side of the charge would constitute a functional two-way shaped charged. reply ChrisMarshallNY 1 hour agorootparentprevWhy was this dinged?

There's CCTV footage of some of them exploding. reply mytailorisrich 1 hour agorootparentThat's still a targeted attack and it seems from the media reports so far that the \"collateral damage\" is remarkably low, actually. reply underlipton 0 minutes agorootparentThis is incorrect in a disturbing way. How can something be targeted if the attackers simply don't know where the attacks are going to take place, physically and geographically? sushid 9 minutes agorootparentprevWhy did the Hezbollah even leverage beepers in the first place? As in why not just use telegram or signal or some other app of choice? reply Hermandw 17 minutes agorootparentprevAmir Tsarfati: The updated numbers: 4000 wounded of which 400 in critical conditions Al Jazeera from a Lebanese security source: The pagers were brought to Lebanon 5 months ago. They were boobytrapped in advance. Each device contained an explosive weighing no more than 20 grams. reply mdasen 1 hour agorootparentprevIt looks like 1-way pagers sold in the US are powered by AA or AAA batteries: https://pagersdirect.net/collections/1-way-pagers. That's not to say that they couldn't have put a lithium AA or AAA battery into the pagers or inserted a modified AA/AAA battery that was a combination of lithium (with greater power density) and explosive. It's also possible that they have fancier 1-way pagers than I'm aware of. reply mrtksn 1 hour agorootparentAccording to this post, the pagers that exploded had rechargeable batteries. They even used USB-C, so Hezbollah must be using somewhat fancy pagers: https://x.com/BabakTaghvaee1/status/1836082246538629490 reply cdchn 1 hour agorootparentI remember reading once that Apollo is pretty much the only name in the game any more for pagers. reply londons_explore 1 hour agorootparentprevSurprising nobody has yet posted the make/model.

Like, aren't they already optimized to have everything for inside super tight? reply LeifCarrotson 42 minutes agorootparentNo, a pager is optimized to be a case size that's comfortable for carrying and reading. The electronics could be the size of the smallest wristwatch, which is already dominated by its own form factor requirements, not the PCB + battery + display subcomponents that are scarcely the size of a nickel. A typical pager is about 60 x 40 x 20mm. Much of this volume requirement is driven by the 16mm diameter 34mm long CR123 battery, a lot of it could be empty. That battery is a relatively safe lithium primary chemistry, not a rechargeable Lithium polymer pounch or lithium ion cylinder that would risk fire and explode if the overpressure vents were omitted and the BMS corrupted, but the primary lasts for years. I bet you could use a CR1216 battery (1.6mm thin, 30mAh, instead if 34mm long and 1500mAh) instead and have quite a good deal of spare volume in the battery for an explosive. If you filled the entire pager, that would be even more room, but much more easily detected. reply ethbr1 29 minutes agorootparent> I bet you could use a CR1216 battery (1.6mm thin, 30mAh, instead if 34mm long and 1500mAh) instead and have quite a good deal of spare volume in the battery for an explosive. I'd be fascinated if that was the physical vector... However, tainting a component pre-integration seems a lot more likely than simply packing explosive in the case. Israel inserts the compromised components upstream in the supply chain, they're duly assembled into pagers, which then make their way to Hezbollah, where they're inspected, look normal, and work normally, and are then distributed. That would still require a firmware hack to presumably trigger though (incoming message stack to component trigger). reply lxgr 28 minutes agorootparentprev> The electronics could be the size of the smallest wristwatch Swatch actually used to sell a wristwatch that includes a pager! Battery life was pretty bad though; it came with a keychain accessoire to store a spare CR2032 and a battery swapping tool. reply tptacek 1 hour agorootparentprevI think it makes more sense to think of these as explosive devices manufactured by/for Israel that are just designed to pass as pagers. reply fencepost 48 minutes agorootparentprevThinner (less durable, but who cares?) plastic shell to free up space for explosives, but would likely be obvious if someone opened it - which might be a common thing if these were being used as remote triggering devices. If they were using a AA battery, replace the battery with something that provides you space to work (e.g. put in a AAAA or button cell that would provide appropriate power but lower capacity) because you don't really care if the battery life drops from months to weeks. reply bluescrn 1 hour agorootparentprevPagers, by definition, are likely to be older technology. The internals could be replaced with modern smaller and lower-power equivalents, requiring a smaller battery, and saving enough space. (Or maybe somebody just donated a batch of innocent-looking devices to 'the cause', or offered a bargain on some 'extra secure' pagers?) reply minkles 2 hours agorootparentprevExactly that. There is a video of a hole blown through a table surface with one. That is not happening with any off the shelf battery technology as is currently being heavily misreported. They were modified with explosives clearly. Of course there is paranoia being sewn now about hacking and the batteries which is likely part of the ongoing operation as it will disrupt anyone they didn't explicitly target. reply highcountess 1 hour agorootparentI’m not sure which image you are referring to but there are images of lithium battery explosions blowing holes into counters and faces. There are some linked here. reply hughesjj 53 minutes agorootparentNot sure a wooden desk is equivalent to porcelain though. Porcelain cracks, just need a lot of pressure in a small spot to make a big break. That said, .... Really glad I quit smoking anything after seeing the damage a vape did to those poor guys reply wkat4242 2 hours agorootparentprevAhh so a simple supply chain attack. I was thinking it might have leveraged the built in batteries. But it was always unlikely, especially in a receive-only device. Still, if you have the capability of such a supply chain attack, I would imagine the rewards of silent surveillance (tracking, audio) would be of much higher value than this kind of attack where 3 out of 1000s targets were killed. reply ddalex 2 hours agorootparent3 killed but thousands inoperative and hospitals flooded - I would expect an immediate armed escalation reply s1artibartfast 39 minutes agorootparentHow would this be an escalation trigger after a year of missiles and airstrikes with 1000 Hezbollah dead and 100k civilians displaced on each side? reply ethbr1 27 minutes agorootparentFace saving. It's easier to put a PR spin on something only a few people actually saw. It's going to be hard to convince their rank-and-file this isn't a bit deal and deserving of retribution. reply s1artibartfast 18 minutes agorootparentHow is it different in terms of visibility than missiles killing and injuring more? reply ceejayoz 12 minutes agorootparentA missile is a demonstration of military force. Everyone in the region knows Israel is capable of blowing up a building. This is a \"we've got you hopelessly compromised as an organization\" sort of demonstration that's far more humiliating. For a similar example, see the US response to 9/11 - two decades of war, taking shoes off at airports, etc. - versus the US response to COVID, which killed a 9/11 worth every couple of days, but resulted in a \"but I don't wanna wear a mask\" response. minkles 1 hour agorootparentprevTheir comms and command infra is now hosed and all the operatives concentrated in hospitals. They are dead in the water. reply s1artibartfast 1 hour agorootparentHezbollah has more than 100,000 fighters, so this would be what, one or two percent injured. Everyone has cell phones that they can use in addition to the pager, so I don't think it's very accurate to say the communications are hosed either reply bguebert 1 hour agorootparentHezbollah has been warning its members not to use cell phones because they get targeted by using them too. Seems like the pagers were supposed to be the workaround for that. https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sya00qlswa reply s1artibartfast 49 minutes agorootparentNot having a Hezbollah issues phone is very different from never using a phone. The idea that Hezbollah members have and had no means of communication other than pagers in a country full of cellphones and landlines is a farce. reply londons_explore 1 hour agorootparentprevWhich is dumb, because pagers are just as trackable as phones. reply vel0city 56 minutes agorootparentLots of pagers operate in one-way only mode. Towers transmit messages without expecting acknowledgement a few times, pager is configured to filter out and only alert on messages routed to its ID. Sure, theoretically one can detect a receive-only radio, but its massively more difficult than detecting something which actively transmits. reply wkat4242 21 minutes agorootparentMost pagers do, yes. They are also usually unencrypted. And due to the one way nature, even if they are encrypted, PFS (perfect forward security) is impossible. Meaning that if someone captures the encrypted messages they can decrypt them all the way back when the encryption key is obtained. But the impossibility of any kind of location tracking is definitely a plus of one-way pages. Not just for terrorists. I'd get one if there were still a network where I live. tonyarkles 54 minutes agorootparentprevMany pagers are receive only. The tower has no idea who's listening; it just broadcasts out the messages that it's told to. Pagers are much less trackable than phones. reply toyg 56 minutes agorootparentprevThey might have watched The Wire: you page Alice, and she uses a public phone to call you. Undetectable unless you wire all public phones in the city, or someone is dumb enough to always use the same phone (which is what happens in the series; they eventually switch to burner mobiles). reply tptacek 1 hour agorootparentprevApparently not these ones. reply minkles 19 minutes agorootparentprevIt looks like a command structure attack. There’s now 98,000 people with no orders. reply xdennis 7 minutes agorootparentprevThey recently introduced pagers because they're less trackable than phones. Presumably the ones which have pagers are more important so its probably more impactful than targeting 1 or 2 percent of the regular terrorists. Electricniko 1 hour agorootparentprevCell phones that, if distributed from the organization like the pagers were, could be compromised as well. reply mupuff1234 55 minutes agorootparentprevThe people with the pagers could be the more important people in the organization. And the 100k number seems quite exaggerated. reply s1artibartfast 35 minutes agorootparentI stand corrected and Minkles is right. Hezbollah is defeated. reply InsideOutSanta 1 hour agorootparentprevThey have about 100'000 members, and this attack has killed about a dozen, and injured about 2000. Only one recent shipment of pagers was affected. I don't think they are unable to respond. reply dotancohen 19 minutes agorootparentprevHezbollah has been escalating their armed attacks against Israel for almost an entire year, parallel with the war in Gaza. Every day tens of rockets hit Israel, almost the entire north of Israel is evacuated of civilians. For some reason, though, none of this makes the news. reply ericmcer 1 minute agorootparentThe \"news\" doesn't even seem to exist anymore. News providers have adapted to the readers only wanting hear their own views supported. Not only are there specific providers for specific worldviews, but major providers seem to spit out articles catering to every viewpoint. You can find probably find multiple pro Israel and anti Israel articles coming from a single news source on a single day. So, I dunno maybe we need some kind of cumulative news app to get any kind of meaningful idea of how things are actually leaning. Like an AI summarizing sentiments of the 20,000 articles on Israel in the last week to determine if the news is slanted. ceejayoz 7 minutes agorootparentprevAs tends to be the case with this sort of complaint, it absolutely makes the news. Quick sampling of examples: https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20240908-hezbollah-f... https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/4/hezbollah-fires-reta... https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw9y7wqn8j5o https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-hamas-ro... It doesn't make a big splash in the news because it tends to be severely ineffectual, but it has been pretty widely and continuously covered. reply frabbit 2 hours agorootparentprevOf course, while we don't know who did this yet, Israel is desperate to provoke its neighbors into more conflict so that it can then draw in the USA as a shield. Hopefully Hezbollah and others do not take the bait. reply rbanffy 1 hour agorootparentWe should avoid using the name of the country as a proxy for its current government. The people has nothing to do with this - this is all planned and executed under the auspices of the current prime minister and his associates. Even though the people largely supports their agenda, an action that targets three people but affects 2,700 people as collateral damage would not pass by their parliament. reply anigbrowl 52 minutes agorootparentWe should avoid using the name of the country as a proxy for its current government I understand your point but synecdoche is the oil on the gears of discourse. This required a lot of people's involvement, from those issuing the orders to technicians at the bottom of the chain of command. It's not Netanyahu's cabinet that did the work of placing explosive charges in thousands of compact devices and then repackaged and shrinkwrapped them. Obviously once could refer to the 'Netanyahu regime' or some other more specific term, but then someone else would complain that this was a mendacious mischaracterization of the country's political system or suchlike. To the extent that civilians there don't with to be identified with their political leadership or take on the moral responsibility for its decisions, they'd better step up their efforts to topple the government by means of a general strike or some other time-honored method. reply wkat4242 1 hour agorootparentprevThe people voted for this government. I do think we can hold Israel as a country responsible. But what we can't do is blame Jewish or even Israeli people in general. Though I don't see anyone doing this. The current government is always quick to draw the antisemitism card when being criticised but I never see anyone actually doing that. reply ethbr1 24 minutes agorootparentVoted for it at one point. Most of Netanyahu's recent actions are because he knows he'd be voted out in an election called today. reply CaptainNegative 1 hour agorootparentprevWhy would you assume this targeted three people? I assume the most likely scenario is that the attackers targeted as many Hezbollah members as they could, and were extremely successful at it. reply rbanffy 1 hour agorootparentThat's a very good point - if the goal was to disable comms and incapacitate as many targets as possible, then collateral damage numbers are much lower. It's unknown how many were family members of targeted individuals, and whatever the number actually is, it'll be misreported. reply tptacek 43 minutes agorootparentWhy would the family members of a Hezbollah operative be carrying a pager tuned to Hezbollah's private communications network? A reminder that Hezbollah operates a parallel phone system, and is in many ways more sophisticated and organized than the de jure government of Lebanon, whose military forces Hezbollah outnumbers. reply thisoneworks 1 hour agorootparentprevSince when did naming a country for their military action signify the opinion or inclination of the majority of civic population? When newspapers report on \"country A did X\" it almost always means their government did X. So I'm not sure what point you're trying to make reply anigbrowl 1 hour agorootparentprevWhy not both? Location data would be relatively easy to collect and forward, audio not so much (much higher storage and transmission throughput requirements for very low quality source data given the limitations of piezoelectric microphones and the fact that pagers are usually worn on belts). If you're getting GPS data, collecting people's movements for a month or three probably provides 99% of what you will ever want to know. Once the patterns have been established you're into diminishing returns territory, while the risk of discovery goes up, which would neutralize the value of the explosive attack. The strategic value of such a perfectly targeted surprise attack is massive, notwithstanding the relatively low fatality rate. Injuries are expensive and often devastating, and the psychological impact is brutal. Logistically, Hezbollah (and many other organizations, militant or not) are going to have to review and/or replace part of their communications tech. That's a massive technical disruption, a significant economic cost, and risks further exposing supply chain information. It's also going to create paranoia about many other electronic devices, poison in the food, and so on. I'm not sure about the ethics of this. If one were certain that only Hezbollah officers were being targeted then it would be an acceptable kind of asymmetric attack through a novel vector. However this also seems to have impacted quite a few civilians, and there is a claim (unverified so far) that a hospital just replaced all its pager equipment a couple of weeks ago and would otherwise have been impacted: https://x.com/SuppressedNws/status/1836080190855795092 If this happened in the US pursuant to one of the wars we've been involved in, we'd definitely be calling it terrorism and/or a war crime. It's a big strategic win for the Israelis in the short term but can hurt them two ways in the longer term. Hezbollah and other enemies of Israel will be significantly more motivated retaliate in some equally creative/unpredictable fashion, and non-aligned economic partners of Israel are likely to view Israeli products with renewed skepticism, hurting exports. reply tptacek 45 minutes agorootparentIt would be a bit rich for us to call this a war crime, since our standard M.O. for targeted strikes --- like everybody else's --- routinely kills innocent civilians in much larger numbers than this. reply hadlock 26 minutes agorootparent\"Everybody else is doing it\" isn't valid justification for murdering civilians reply rabidonrails 12 minutes agorootparentprevA couple of things on this: 1. It appears that the AUMBC referenced replaced their equipment but that had nothing to do with this and their doctors weren't impacted. 2. Your note of \"...other enemies of Israel will be significantly more motivated retaliate in some equally creative/unpredictable fashion...\" is strange considering that this is already the norm. Almost all (perhaps all) of the attacks against Israel have been from terrorists targeting civilians. reply sitkack 38 minutes agorootparentprevI think they burned an asset right before the last time they had a window to use it. Maybe even on accident.

Its a whole other thing to do a supply chain intercept on an entire factory run of pagers, build a difficult to detect explosive into them, get them into the hands of your enemies, and remotely trigger them over infrastructure you don't directly control. This is an incredible level of execution. And, presumably, the IDF or some attached intelligence agency demonstrating how deeply they own their adversary's networks. reply svnt 4 minutes agorootparentYou probably need firmware and some major component modification, such as a display or battery, but not more than this, to pull it off. So at a minimum, two components, or perhaps one smart component such as a display. It seems the model was the AP-900, not the AR-924, which used alkaline (ie removable) batteries, so a new theory is an EFP (explosively formed penetrator) manufactured into the device. It appears the devices do not function on cell phone networks but instead on internal radio networks such as those used within industrial or medical settings. Best guess is the displays because: 1) there is enough room for the EFP, 2) you could modify the component to trigger itself, meaning it doesn’t need coordination between any other parts of the device 3) there are a lot of injuries to the face reported — with a display you could trip on button push without needing access to the button, when people tend to be looking right at the EFP 4) in the videos the explosions look very directional moduspol 1 hour agorootparentprevI'm not sure they necessarily need to deeply own their adversary's networks. I'd be impressed if Lebanese pager tech has any serious kind of encryption, for example. And we're already accepting at face value that they sabotaged the devices, so it's possible this was done with a separate RF signal than their own cellular network, even if it is locked down.

No doubt there were many dozens of civilian casualties, but if the numbers net out the way you'd expect they would (ie: people carrying these pagers, which link to Hezbollah's own communications network --- they run their own phone company --- are overwhelmingly Hezbollah operatives) this is going to pencil out as one of the most surgical attacks of all time.

Regardless of the particular target it's of course the question whether this is a desirable practice in cyber warfare. For such a new field there are very few ethical guidelines yet, like we do have for more conventional warfare. reply jakeinspace 2 hours agorootparentUnlike stuxnet, this attack had a lot of non-hezbolah civilian casualties. It’s \"targeted\" in a sense, but not really much more targeted than a drive-by assassination attempt. Anybody close to these people could have sustained serious injury, and there are reports of children injured and dead. We’ll have to wait for details to emerge. Politically, this is the sort of action that invites comparison to conventional terrorism. It also begs the question of why Hezbollah or other actors shouldn’t try a similar attack against civilian targets. It’s almost like a chemical or biological attack, which most countries shy away from because it’s so hard to defend against (a big part of why it’s illegal). No country can perfectly safeguard its supply chain from intentional sabotage. I’m afraid that the entire world is a little bit less safe after this move. Maybe Israel is goading Hezbollah into all-out war, who knows, but this affects all of us. reply tptacek 1 hour agorootparentFor a non-infantry massed attack on a military asset, the ratio of military to civilian casualties here is probably going to end up being unprecedented in the history of modern warfare; this will probably end up being an extraordinarily surgical attack by any military standard. Civilians are routinely killed in targeted strikes, because targeted strikes are almost always conducted by air. This attack may end up being distinguished by how few civilians were harmed. Neither Israel nor Hezbollah is mobilized for all-out war here. Hezbollah is depleted from its disastrous efforts in Syria; Israel is fully committed to combat operations in Gaza. The north of Israel has been evacuated for months because of indiscriminate rocket attacks from Hezbollah. Hezbollah is an arm of the IRGC, which is more or less at open war with Israel.

Glad you got a giggle out of it all. frabbit 1 hour agorootparentprevThat's a good summary of the dangers of normalizing the actions that previously were the domain of only terrorists. The world works because most countries and people rejected amoral results-based reasoning and considered such actions in the light of another dimension: morality. It's difficult to define, but there was some sort of consensus. How long those agreements, formal and simply normative, will last remains to be seen. I do not look forward to their further erosion. reply tptacek 1 hour agorootparentIt does not make a whole lot of sense to distinguish the explosives packed into the warhead of an AGM-114 Hellfire missile from those of an explosive vest or a compromised pager. What distinguishes terrorism from military action is target selection, not weapons choice. reply frabbit 1 hour agorootparentI cannot see any comment in the immediate sub-thread making a distinction between explosives per se? Certainly to me I don't see the difference between explosives supplied in a missile produced with US tax-subsidies to arms profiteers or explosives produced by someone else. Except that in the first case US voters have some control over the supply -- not much, but some. The GP comment is clearly talking about the lack of precision or targeting. Here you may have a point if we consider absolute quantities instead of some relative measurement: a US-taxpayer-supplied-with-profits-to-a-private-company Hellfire missile fired into a refugee camp full of women and children might kill 10 obviously-innocent people for 1 presumed-to-be-a-terrorist-without-any-sort-of-trial person; whereas a pager bomb exploding might blow up the we-dont-know-yet-anything-but-he-was-in-Hezbollah and his ten-year old daughter. If I were a moral simpleton I might argue that the Hellfire missile murders were worse than the pager murders. But what do I know? After all hundreds of years of protocols and treaties and norms about this sort of thing are probably just old and in need of being re-envisioned by some clever code jockey. reply tptacek 54 minutes agorootparentDo you honestly believe that \"protocols and treaties\" established \"hundreds of years\" ago have any bearing on modern conflict? Do you have any arguments that would be persuasive to those of us who believe them to be more or less irrelevant since the Franco-Prussian War? I'm an American. We firebombed Dresden and Tokyo, then got up the next day and made breakfast. Pick another major combatant nationality anywhere on the globe, and I'll tell you a similar story.

Can you point to any well known, well-distributed \"Pallywood\" incident involving children? reply shadowgovt 1 hour agorootparentprevBased on the video shared by Reuters, I'm not seeing anything that would focus the attack to the pager's carrier. Anyone standing next to the target would also risk severe injury or death. ETA: I should perhaps clarify: focus the attack exclusively on the pager's carrier. It does appear to be modestly shaped in some way (in that we're not seeing the pagers go up in a 2-meter-radius fireball), but it's also not contained exclusively to the carrier, has no verification that the carrier is holding the device, etc. Whether one considers that \"focused\" is left as an exercise for the reader. Certainly more focused than a rocket; a bit less focused than poison. reply s1artibartfast 1 hour agorootparentHundreds of dead children would mean the devices killed 10x more child bystanders than the military personnel carrying the devices.

Most people are familiar with MG an infosec hardware researcher. He's well known in hacker circles for creating the OMG cable.

It’s kind of a basic part of the whole intelligence covert and clandestine operations capabilities expected of a “first world” nation. Israel is one of the better countries at doing this undetected so, no surprises here. reply markus_zhang 1 hour agoparentprevMy hunch is that IL intelligence bought some 3,000 - 4,000 pagers of the same models, fixed them with explosives and trigger systems, and swapped them with the package sent to Hez in the middle of transport or (probably) in the Lebanon distribution center. So they needed to know: which company manufactured those pagers; which models are sent to Hez; when they were in transport and arrived at the distribution center; which packages went to Hez operatives, and much more information. BTW rumors says the pagers were manufactured by a Taiwanese company, not confirmed though but some of my friends were able to read from the pictures that show what was left of the pagers. reply limit499karma 25 minutes agoparentprev> Stuxnet Rather not, since this is targeting devices potentially in use by general public.

Also, assuming it was unmodified way, it will go both ways so I doubt it. reply FrameworkFred 18 minutes agorootparentprevI agree on both points and it's worth noting the cell phone in everyone's pocket has a lot more battery in it than a pager does. IF this was truly done to unmodified pagers, then we ALL probably need to reconsider how we use and carry our phones and what the mAh rating on our batteries implies in the context of a similar attack. reply uoaei 1 hour agoparentprevThere is no way an unaltered pager has enough potential to explode in any way that could be harmful using a software-based exploit. Unless somehow the BMS (even if there was one) allowed you to short the battery with software, which seems really stupid to design into such a system. reply megous 1 hour agoparentprevIf it's basically a remotely controlled IED via a public communication network, then there's nothing technically interesting about that, really.

You can generate many questions about that aspect. Like the whole why on both strategic and tactical levels? How does this fit with the international law? Why are people kinda chill about this? Re the response below: No proof of specific targeting of combatants, yet.

Complaining about others generally doesn't have that effect. Responding to complaints of others, even constructively, is at best marginally effective as well, of course. I'll be the first to admit that the politics of the Middle East is exceedingly complex, most hats are at best grey, and I find myself often critical, occasionally impressed and supportive of, various parties. One factor which might help is distinguishing direct beligerants and forces (regular or irregular) and political factions on the one hand from the civilian populations at large on the other (both sides face a high degree of risk, whether as collateral damage or as direct targets).

If you were to consider the fact that Hezbollah has been shelling Israeli cities and civilians on a daily basis for the past 12 months (killing many, also children, and driving hundreds of thousands of people out of their homes), with the UN peacekeeping force failing to keep Hezbollah north of the Litani river - then perhaps you would understand that this is likely as close as you can get to a \"precision strike\" on an enemy you're at war with. This may in-fact be the most precise military strike on an enemy paramilitary group in the history of modern warfare. You either have a very unrealistic idea of what a war actually looks like (0% civilians casualties or injuries), or an agenda. reply dnakqozkfnrjq 0 minutes agorootparentI’m not particularly interested in debating the meaning of “terrorism”, but it’s a mistake not to acknowledge civilian casualties, and not to feel sorrow and even anger. I say this as a very conflicted Jew. My grandfather survived a concentration camp, and my father was born into a village decimated by the genocide, with nearly all of my family having been killed. The remainder of my family continued to be violently persecuted, with my dad eventually coming to the US as a refugee (having survived at least 1 attempted murder for being Jewish). His cousin escaped to Israel. So while I absolutely bristle at the uneducated, “well-meaning” liberals who deny Jewish indigineity, call us colonizers, and parrot things like “Free Palestine, Kill All Jews” - yes, I have heard those words - we cannot turn a blind eye to needless death. This attack which hurt Lebanese civilians, and the continued conflict which is hurting Palestinian civilians, has a human cost. Kids, non-combatants, the sick and the elderly. People who don’t want to fight and don’t have a choice. Their lives matter too, and they don’t want to get dragged into this. I get it though, it’s hard for me to criticize Israel publicly, because for some it’s a license to descend right to the depths of Jewish hate. During the wave of campus protests a few months ago, somebody spray painted “Save a life, kill a local colonizer” on a building. I don’t want to die for the current Israeli government. As far as I’m concerned, my family tradition is getting stabbed in the chest for being Jewish, as it has happened to at least one member of every generation before me as far back as my family remembers. So mostly I stay silent. I weep at the misguided liberals who are allowing, excusing, inflaming and denying the reality of rising Jewish hate. If there is a Jewish genocide in the US in my lifetime, it will be driven by the far left, not the far right. But still.

Lately, I’ve been enjoying watching random electronics repair channels on YouTube. There’s something oddly satisfying about watching someone take a broken device from totally nonfunctional to perfectly working, all by replacing a $0.05 capacitor that has failed shorted or maybe a blown $0.75 IC. Two of my favorite channels about this topic are Buy it Fix it and StezStix Fix?. The videos inspired me. I thought, “I should totally try this!” So I went on eBay and looked for broken devices. I have a pretty decent understanding of how video encoders and decoders work, so I thought it would be a fun project to try to fix an HDMI capture card. I found a broken Elgato Game Capture HD60 S USB 3.0 device. The listing said that nothing happened when you plugged it in. When it arrived, I was able to verify exactly what the listing said. Nothing showed up on my computer when I plugged it in. I cracked it open and had a look at what was happening internally when it powered up. I started by poking around at voltages on the board with it plugged in, and it was pretty obvious that something was dragging the power rails down. Little did I know at that point what I was getting myself into. Honestly I could tell what was getting hot just by feeling around with my finger, but this was a good excuse to use my thermal camera to take some fun pictures. In this one, the red cursor indicating the hottest point in the image is pointing to a small chip in the upper-left corner of the board marked “fiVJVE”. This was pretty clearly some kind of a switching regulator, which I concluded due to its proximity to the “2R2” inductor (meaning 2.2 uH). Measuring the pins, I could see 5V going in, but obviously something was wrong because the voltage at the inductor (the output) was far too low. There was also another fiVJVE chip on the board, with a pretty much identical circuit next to another 2.2 uH inductor. The circuit was missing a component, but I was pretty sure it was normal because the solder blobs looked like they came that way from the factory. It wasn’t getting hot, but it was also putting out a low voltage so I suspected something was wrong with it too: In the heat image above you can see another area on the board (near the bottom) that was also getting hot. It turns out it was actually originating from the other side: Yeah, that’s my finger in the picture. It helped adjust the levels in the image so the chip that’s getting hot is easier to pinpoint. This chip was labeled PFNI: OK, so what could I do with this information? I found two chips that were getting hot, and another chip that likely wasn’t putting out its correct voltage. I started out by trying to identify what they were. Small chips with markings like this can be quite difficult to figure out. Luckily, there are a few SMD marking code search engines out there. Searching smd.yooneed.one for fiVJ didn’t result in any exact matches, but it did point out that the code “fi” went with the Fitipower FP6121-IS9P. This led me to Fitipower’s website, where I saw they had a bunch of different chips. Using Google’s help I was eventually able to narrow it down to being the FP6373A. The pinout made sense on the board, and the fiV marking also matched. Yay! Now I had an idea what I was looking for. The PFNI chip ended up being even easier to identify. Google led me straight to the TI TPS60403DBV voltage inverter: One thing in common with all of these chips is they were all taking in 5V for their input and I was measuring that their outputs all had a pretty low resistance to ground. I started wondering if maybe someone fried this device by somehow putting more than 5V into it. How they did that, I have no idea. I wasn’t sure why the other FP6373A regulator wasn’t getting hot. It wasn’t putting out much voltage and nothing else was getting hot on the board, so I decided to try injecting voltage on its output power rail instead to see where the low resistance was coming from. I could deduce its correct output voltage because it was going to a Winbond W25Q32JVSSIQ SPI flash chip rated for 2.7 to 3.6V. I was pretty sure it was on a 3.3V rail. I soldered wires to the regulator’s output and ground and used my bench power supply to inject 2.7V into the circuit with a small controlled current that I could slowly turn up. The idea was that I could find what was getting hot on the board and determine what to blame for this power rail being bad. This process pretty quickly revealed the FP6373A itself as the root problem. I think maybe during normal operation when it was being supplied with 5V, it was putting itself into some kind of safety shutdown mode and killing its output power rail. The datasheet does mention overcurrent and overtemperature shutdown capability. When I injected voltage directly, the regulator couldn’t shut off the power rail so it had no choice but to get hot and announce “hey, I’m the problem!” through my thermal camera. This was actually great. I wasn’t totally confident about whether the TI chip was to blame rather than something downstream of it, but since two other chips on the 5V rail were also fried, I thought a good first step would be to replace all three of them and see what would happen. Unfortunately the FP6373A isn’t available at the usual US distributors, but I was able to find it for sale on LCSC at $0.17 a pop, and the TI chip was conveniently also available there for $0.58. Would it really be this easy? Just replace three chips totaling less than a dollar in value, even in quantities of 1? The shipping and handling was orders of magnitude more expensive than just the parts themselves! After the parts arrived from China, I was able to successfully replace them. I’m always paranoid about upsetting nearby resistors and capacitors when I’m using hot air, so I like to use Kapton tape to shield everything else. The process of soldering in the new chips was mostly easy, but the ground pins did soak up quite a bit of heat. I think this PCB design doesn’t have great thermal relief on the grounds. I did accidentally lift a pad for one of the regulators, but it wasn’t connected to anything (the “PG” signal) so there was no harm done. The fact that it wasn’t connected to anything was exactly why it was so easy to lift it. Also, the heat that the ground pin was eating up misled me into thinking I could use the same heat on the other pins. In addition to my lifted pad (middle pin on the right), you can see here how much trouble I had soldering the ground pin (middle pin on the left). It really didn’t want to heat up. I probably could have heated the whole board to help my soldering iron out, but hey, it’s connected. Anyway, after replacing all three chips, it worked! None of the new chips were getting hot, the HD60 S showed up as a USB device when plugged in, and it worked perfectly for capturing and passing through an HDMI signal. I was pretty excited to successfully fix it, but there was still a problem: none of the indicator lights worked. There are seven white LEDs and seven red LEDs, and they are supposed to do various things to tell you what’s going on. The white lights are supposed to blink twice when you first plug it in, for example. This was a little deflating. I had kind of fixed it, but not really. Now what? Back to the drawing board. I looked closer at the PCB to understand how the LEDs work. The relevant chip is the IT1504, made by Innochip. Looking further at its datasheet, it is a 16-channel LED driver chip. You talk to it with a serial data interface that appears to be very similar to SPI. It turns out a lot of LED driver chips from many manufacturers such as Toshiba and ST also use this same communication scheme. At first I though it was odd, but it seems pretty standard. It’s a variant of SPI where you send a particular number of clock pulses to choose which command you want to perform. I monitored the relevant data input pins on the IT1504 using my oscilloscope, and I could definitely see some traffic being sent to it. By the way, I followed the traces and discovered that the IT1504 is being controlled by a Nuvoton M031LD2AE microcontroller, which is an ARM Cortex-M0. The presence of SPI traffic here proved it was at least trying to do something, so I assumed that the LED driver chip was probably fried. That presented a pretty big problem though: how could I find a replacement for the IT1504? It wasn’t stocked anywhere. LCSC didn’t have it, and of course none of the US distributors had it either. I couldn’t even find any sellers on AliExpress or utsource. I reached out to Innotech, who surprisingly wrote back the next day and kindly offered to send me a few free samples for the price of shipping, but then realized they only have full reels in stock so they couldn’t send me any samples. That was nice of them to check, but I definitely wasn’t going to buy a full reel of IT1504 chips just to fix this one problem. This pushed me toward a huge search all over the internet for LED drivers to try to find a suitable equivalent replacement. The IT1504 datasheet I had access to didn’t include the full command info, so I wasn’t sure exactly what I was looking for. There were several discontinued parts from other well-known manufacturers that looked similar, but I wasn’t finding any exact matches. That’s when I discovered something really strange. I somehow stumbled upon Macroblock‘s product offerings. Specifically, the MBI5040. The datasheet seemed to match up pretty well with the IT1504. In fact, a little too well. Here is an example of what I mean (click if you want it larger so you can read it): Here are a few more side-by-side comparisons to really hit the point home: They’re almost exactly the same! Everything is laid out in precisely the same order. The current output specs differ slightly, but aside from that, they’re the exact same product, right down to having identical block diagrams. The wording has been tweaked here and there, but both of these datasheets are clearly from the same source. These companies are both based in Taiwan. Maybe one of them licensed the design from the other? Or perhaps there is some industrial espionage going on? There is definitely some funky stuff going on with the fonts on the Innochip datasheet’s general description page. It randomly switches around between serif and sans-serif. It’s the kind of thing you notice when you’re reading an email that somebody sent and you can tell they’ve obviously been copying and pasting while writing it. That doesn’t necessarily mean anything, but I thought it was weird. Heck, even the part numbers are pretty much the same. If you pretend that the capital letter “I” in MBI5040 is really the number 1, you have MB15040 and IT1504. I have no idea which product is the original here, but either way, this was really good news for me. I had successfully discovered another chip that would likely be suitable as a replacement for my assumed-to-be-fried IT1504. Additionally, the MBI5040 datasheet actually had command info, so if it came down to it, I could dive deeper and really try to understand what the SPI traffic was doing. I was able to find the MBI5040GF available for purchase on both AliExpress and utsource, so I bought a few. Replacing the LED driver chip was a pretty simple job. Once again I used Kapton tape to protect me from myself. I was feeling pretty good about my situation at this point. I cleaned up all the flux residue and anxiously plugged in the HD60 S to my computer. Video capture worked fine, so I didn’t make it any worse, but the lights were still not working! What in the world? Next I started wondering if perhaps the LEDs themselves were broken. I rigged up my bench power supply and a resistor so that I could pass current through them (without the whole device powered on, of course), and the LEDs all tested out fine physically. I was able to light each one up. I was totally out of ideas at this point. A brand new chip didn’t fix it, and the LEDs were known good. That’s when I started searching on Google and found something shocking: apparently the LEDs going out on these Elgato HD60 S capture cards is a known problem that multiple people have experienced. In particular I found two different Reddit posts with four unique users complaining about running into this same problem: https://www.reddit.com/r/elgato/comments/pcvtqj/why_doesnt_my_elgato_hd60s_light_up/ https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/qfdxuu/elgato_hd60_s_can_anyone_help_me_with_this_issue/hhzsvez/ Not only that, but sometime during this whole saga I also bought another “dead” HD60 S on eBay that turned out to work fine but had the exact same LED fault. It was starting to look like this indicator light failure was actually quite common! So yeah. It’s very likely that the LEDs on this one weren’t working even before the voltage regulators originally got fried. This led me to a new bonus challenge: Could I figure out why the LEDs didn’t work and fix them? After all, I now had two different units both experiencing this failure and I knew of at least four other people with the same problem. If you go to the parent post at the second link above, there’s a video that shows how the white LEDs are expected to flash white twice when you first plug it in. My first idea was to verify that the actual LED circuitry on the board was functional. To perform this test, I lifted the relevant SPI input pins on my replacement MBI5040 LED driver and soldered wires to them, as well as ground: This allowed me to rig something up with a Raspberry Pi Pico to manually control the LEDs by sending the appropriate commands as documented in the MBI5040 datasheet. I’ll let this picture speak for itself: It was at this point that I became very confident there was nothing physically wrong with my repaired HD60 S at all. I could perfectly control the lights with my Pi Pico, so the circuit was fine. The Nuvoton Cortex-M0 microcontroller was simply never deciding to turn them on. This whole MBI5040 replacement story was all for nothing! I was so proud of myself for finding a suitable substitute IC, but it was all mostly just a big waste of time. The original chip was probably fine all along. I decided to confirm that theory just to be sure. I put the original IT1504 chip back onto the board. In order to avoid having to bend pins, I covered the 3 pads that I wanted to avoid soldering to the chip with Kapton tape. This kept them insulated, and then I just soldered all of the other pins normally. Then I resoldered the wires and repeated the experiment with the Pi Pico. No surprises here — the original chip was totally fine too. After I was done tinkering, I simply pulled the Kapton tape out and then was able to solder the remaining 3 pins normally. I thought this solution was pretty clever and saved me some time! Here’s a view after I pulled out the tape, but before I soldered them down. And yes, I know pin 1 looks messy. Once again, it’s a ground pin and I guess they didn’t add thermals on the ground pins on this board. It was a pain to solder. I fixed it up afterward though. So yeah. The original IT1504 chip worked fine. I was a little annoyed, but this side quest wasn’t entirely a waste of time. Getting ahold of the MBI5040 datasheet importantly gave me a perfect reference for how the LEDs are controlled by software. It was looking more and more like this was a software problem as opposed to a hardware problem. I was invested in this problem at this point. I couldn’t give up now! I began the next phase of this project with a simple idea: ask Elgato if there is some kind of known issue with the status lights. Maybe there was a setting I was missing that allowed you to disable them. Essentially, they politely told me to take a hike: That’s okay. I felt like solving it on my own anyway. I decided to focus on understanding what was going on in the firmware running in the Nuvoton M031LD2AE microcontroller. By a stroke of pure luck, I had gained some experience last year with Nuvoton MCUs when working on my Mac ROM SIMM programmer. I already had a Nu-Link2-Me that was bundled with the dev board I bought for that project. The next step was to figure out how to access the programming pins on the microcontroller. It turns out that there are a couple of small JST connectors on the board: a 4-pin one and a 6-pin one. Tracing out the pins one by one, it quickly became apparent that the 4-pin JST connector was for programming the MCU! I hooked it up using the only 4-pin JST cable I had on hand, which had grabbers on the other end. I didn’t check, but I think it’s a pretty good educated guess that the 6-pin JST connector next to it is for programming the Altera MAX II CPLD that is also on this board. It just makes sense. I didn’t care about the CPLD though. I tried to read the firmware out of the Nuvoton chip using NuMicro ICP Programming Tool, but of course Elgato protected the contents: Never fear, though. It turns out that Elgato includes the latest firmware with their 4K Capture Utility: Reading the included ElgatoDeviceCapabilities.json file in the same folder also provided some insight. This firmware is specifically for the version of the device with USB product ID 118 (0x0076), which definitely matches mine. Elgato refers to this device as the “Game Capture HD60 S Rev.4”: The firmware was already up to date when I checked in the 4K Capture Utility. You can also control-click the settings icon to enable an Update Firmware button, but it did nothing because the newest firmware was already installed on it: This was great though! The FW_HD60_S_MCU.bin file looked very much like a normal Cortex-M0 firmware binary. You can tell by looking at the start of it in a hex editor. The very first 4-byte word should be the initial stack pointer, so something in RAM. Then following that is a bunch of interrupt vectors including the reset vector. This all checked out. 0x20000E70 looks like a valid stack pointer, and each 4-byte word following that looks like a valid flash address. It looks exactly like a Cortex-M0 vector table. I loaded it into Ghidra and also used SVD-Loader to try to map out some of the registers. I had to modify the SVD file (M031AE_v1.svd), which I got from the NuMicro_DFP pack on keil.arm.com, to get it to load with the plugin. Apparently it doesn’t like if you have multiple addressBlocks per peripheral, so I modified the first one in each peripheral to contain the full range of addresses. And thus began the humongous effort of trying to figure out what this little MCU was actually doing. The SVD file helped me identify the various peripherals being used: mostly GPIO, a timer, and I2C. Nuvoton’s M031BSP project was very valuable for identifying a ton of functions. I did it by hand, which was probably slightly insane, but I wasn’t sure what compiler had been used. Since I knew which pins were hooked up to the LED controller chip, I was fairly quickly able to identify functions that control the LEDs. It was hard to understand their purpose in the grand scheme of things though. Sometimes they were buried deep inside multiple layers of function calls. Knowing that I2C was being used was very helpful, because I saw there were other chips onboard that would communicate through it: the ITE IT6802E and IT66121FN. The IT6802E is an HDMI receiver. I don’t have any detailed documentation for it, but I’m pretty sure it converts an incoming HDMI signal into a parallel data stream suitable for the capture portion of the device to read in. The IT66121FN is the opposite. It takes a parallel data stream and sends it out as HDMI. This would be necessary for the passthrough functionality, providing an HDMI output signal to go through to your TV or monitor. Anyway, I found some ITE driver code in some random GitHub projects such as this one, which quickly helped me identify a bunch of functions and variables as belonging to ITE’s drivers. This helped me gain a better understanding of what was happening in the firmware. I actually spent way too much time on this, but I think it was useful in the long run. Plus, it was good practice with Ghidra. Once I had a good idea of the overall structure of the firmware, I decided to try figuring out how I could debug the code. The chip was protected, but I figured that I should be able to erase it and reflash the firmware. To be safe, I desoldered the original M031LD2AE chip and put a new empty one onto my board instead. They only cost $1.14 on Digi-Key in quantities of 1. Why not? When I flashed FW_HD60_S_MCU.bin onto my brand-new blank chip, it definitely worked fine, but it re-protected itself so I couldn’t do any debugging! The offending code was pretty easy to find in Ghidra. There’s a function that is called to update the config registers with the proper locked state as well as the number of 512-byte data flash pages to reserve from the application ROM. I simply had to hack this function to always leave the chip unlocked. Then I reflashed the chip and I was finally able to debug the code! I inserted some breakpoints and stepped through the initialization code with OpenOCD and GDB to figure out why the LEDs weren’t being controlled. I found some places in the code where LED control would happen, but they were being skipped. I decided to force the code to run by filling in register values and RAM in GDB, and sure enough, I was able to at least force the lights to turn on. So clearly the code was there to control the lights, but it wasn’t running for whatever reason. This chip unlocking mess led me down another rabbit hole. I assumed that the original Nuvoton MCU I removed had some other protected contents like a bootloader, so I decided to see if I could extract it by installing my new unlocked firmware file as an update through Elgato’s software. The idea was that after my new unlocked firmware was installed, the protection would be disabled and then I could read out the entire contents with my Nu-Link2-Me. Why would I want to do this? Well, it would just be nice to have as a backup in case I screwed up one of the chips, plus the bootloader might contain other clues. I tried it out on my other HD60 S with broken LEDs which still had its stock Nuvoton MCU fitted. This required modifying ElgatoDeviceCapabilities.json to point to my unlocked firmware. I also had to change the version listed in this same file so that it would think it was out of date. After making these changes, the 4K Capture Utility allowed to install my new firmware through the normal firmware update mechanism. The utility did tell me the firmware update failed after it finished (more on that later). This totally freaked me out because it appeared to brick the device. It didn’t work as a capture card anymore. But luckily, but I was left with an unlocked chip, just as I had hoped! This allowed me to read out the rest of the content of the flash that had previously been protected, including the LDROM (containing Elgato’s first-stage bootloader), data flash contents, and the correct original config register contents. This was really exciting because it meant I now had everything I would need in order to completely program a brand new Nuvoton MCU to contain Elgato’s stock firmware, including their bootloader. I rewrote the original Elgato firmware back to this second HD60 S’s APROM (application ROM) using Nuvoton’s tools, and re-locked the chip. Thankfully, this fully restored it to working order — except for the LEDs of course. I also disassembled their small LDROM bootloader that I was able to read out of the chip, but it wasn’t really anything exciting. It receives commands and data over I2C and is capable of reflashing the APROM. Interestingly I discovered that if the chip is set for unprotected mode, the bootloader actually waits around for update commands instead of booting the application firmware. So Elgato is using the locked/unlocked bit as a way of signifying whether it should stay in the bootloader or not, which I find to be a little bit weird. That completely explained why my second HD60 S stopped working after I installed my unlocked firmware — it was stuck in the bootloader waiting forever because the chip was unprotected. Anyway, I’ve really started to ramble on about things unrelated to the LED problem. Let’s get back on track. The point I’m trying to make here is that I was able to read out all of the stock microcontroller contents, which gave me the confidence I desperately needed in order to start tinkering even further to figure out the LED problem. I was kind of stuck at this point though. Why was the Nuvoton chip not controlling the LEDs? Some of the LED control happened over I2C from something else, so I was beginning to worry that the actual problem was once again at a different level. Fortunately though, I was gaining a better understanding of the architecture of the entire product at this point. Here’s a broad overview of how it works: The main Cypress/Infineon CYUSB3014 USB 3.0 peripheral chip, which I haven’t mentioned until now, is an ARM926EJ-S. It sends commands to the Nuvoton MCU over I2C. This is the chip that actually communicates with the host PC through the USB 3.0 port. The Nuvoton ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller sets up and monitors the ITE video receiver and transmitter chips through a separate I2C bus. The Nuvoton MCU also controls the LEDs. The Nuvoton MCU communicates status information back to the CYUSB3014 through I2C. The CYUSB3014 receives the video data stream from the IT6802E (likely through the MAX II CPLD, putting it in a format suitable for the CYUSB3014 to grab) and sends it to the computer over USB. I thought I would take a break from the Nuvoton chip for a while and start trying to understand the main Cypress processor instead. Yes, as I just mentioned above, there are two different ARM processors working together to implement the video capture functionality. Fortunately, Cypress/Infineon also provides a free SDK for these USB chips. The firmware is stored unprotected in the Winbond W25Q32JVSSIQ flash chip that I talked about very early on when I thought this was purely going to be a hardware repair project. I desoldered the SPI flash chip and read it back using a programmer. It’s a 4 MB (32-megabit) chip. I also tried to do it in-circuit without removing the chip first, but I didn’t have any luck. I even accidentally knocked a small 0402 0.1 uF decoupling capacitor (seen above on the right) off the PCB while I was trying to clip onto it. Luckily the capacitor wasn’t damaged and I was able to put it right back on. After dumping the chip contents, I used it to start trying to work my way through understanding what the CYUSB3014 was doing. I was able to use Cypress’s existing SDK binaries to help identify a lot of the functions in the dump. It turns out that the Cypress SDK uses the ThreadX RTOS under the hood. I really didn’t want to dive deep into this firmware to the same level that I did for the Nuvoton chip though. I was already worn out from that disassembly. At the very least, I was able to see that the Cypress chip sends commands over I2C to the Nuvoton chip. Looking through the rest of the SPI flash dump, I could see that starting at offset 0x300000, there were a bunch of small data chunks that looked like little pictures. Here’s an example: I couldn’t figure out why there would be little pictures in the flash chip here. What would the purpose be? It made me wonder if maybe it was some kind of small icon, since I’ve seen similar data for icons while analyzing old Mac ROM dumps. Given the context of this blog post, you might be screaming at me right now telling me what this data obviously is, but at the time I was totally oblivious. I ended up solving this mystery as soon as I started looking into what was going on with five unknown GPIO pins in the firmware on the Nuvoton chip. There were a bunch of functions that controlled these pins, but I wasn’t sure what they did. I traced them out on the PCB and discovered they were going to a Diodes Incorporated PI5C3257 quad 2:1 mux/demux bus switch. This was the magic discovery that finally unblocked me. This bus switch is being used to decide whether the CYUSB3014 chip or the Nuvoton microcontroller should be wired up to the SPI flash chip. Prior to this moment, I thought that the SPI flash was entirely dedicated to the CYUSB3014. In reality, the Nuvoton microcontroller takes over control of the SPI flash after the CYUSB3014 has finished booting. This enabled me to disassemble a bunch of new functions which were all related to bit-banging SPI transactions, as well as higher-level functions for SPI flash chip erasing/reading/writing. A light bulb went off in my head. Yes, these chunks of data in the flash chip were pictures! But not in the conventional sense. They were describing the various LED animations. Each set of 16 bytes is an animation frame written to the 14 LEDs. In the example above, a single red LED turns on and six of the seven white LEDs do stuff. The last two bytes in each row are a delay time before moving onto the next frame. The first 16 bytes looked kind of weird though. They looked like they possibly contained some header data for the animation or something. I also found some code that was reading data from the start of the 0x300000 section, but in my SPI flash dump that section was pretty much completely empty: Everything was starting to make sense. There was a check in the Nuvoton MCU firmware to see if the first two bytes contained the 16-bit word value 0xAA55: In my dumps of the SPI flash chip contents from my units with nonfunctional LEDs, that section of the chip was empty. It was programmed as all 0x00. The firmware was bypassing all of the LED control code because expected data wasn’t stored starting at 0x300000 in the flash chip! I confirmed this data was missing on both of the HD60 S devices I was testing with. Unless I wanted to go overboard trying to figure out how to artificially populate all this data from scratch, I had no choice but to buy a third HD60 S that was confirmed to be fully functional. That’s what I ended up doing. Unfortunately it was an older revision and had a completely different PCB, but it was still based on the CYUSB3014. It also used a Nuvoton microcontroller, but it was a different model. It still had an IT1504 for LED control though, as well as a Winbond SPI flash chip, so that was promising. I confirmed that its LEDs worked fine, and then I dumped the SPI flash. By this point, I had figured out how to dump the flash contents without any soldering by forcing the CYUSB3014 to boot over USB (removing a jumper on the board) and then uploading a Cypress-provided RAM bootloader capable of dumping the SPI flash (cyfxflashprog.img), but I don’t want to stray too far from the LED issue at this point. Here’s the start of the good data at 0x300000: Okay, that data makes way more sense. The first 16-bit word (little-endian) is 0xAA55 just like the firmware was looking for. It also has a bunch of other header data, indicating there are 26 different LED animations, and including info about whether they are even animations at all. To be honest, I haven’t figured out what every piece of this data actually means, but each animation has a 16-byte summary. They start at 0x300008. I think the last 4 bytes for each animation are probably a CRC-32 of something. Also, if you noticed in the original chip dump, there was a section starting at 0x3000B8 with a bunch of 0xE5 bytes. This is the dot correction data that gets loaded into the IT1504. Based on the decompilation above, it’s actually supposed to be at 0x3007F8, which is exactly where it is in the good dump: The 0x521114A7 that follows is a CRC-32 of the preceding 16 bytes of data. Further inspection revealed that the data in the SPI flash of the broken devices differed quite a bit. In fact, they were different from each other as well. This led me to believe that the animation data was probably corrupted in them. For example, here’s what the animation at 0x31E000 looks like in the good HD60 S’s dump: Notice how there is no weird header at the top like the original “picture” I was inspecting from one of the other dumps? It just immediately starts with animation data that is consistent with the rest of the nearby data. It’s also longer. This data makes a lot more sense. On the other hand, it was corrupted in two completely different ways in my two HD60 S devices with nonfunctional LEDs. Several (but not all) of the animations in my nonworking devices started with a weird “AB 03 12 39” header. I don’t think the header is supposed to be there. Maybe there was a bug in an update procedure or something? The Nuvoton firmware indeed has functions capable of erasing and rewriting data to the SPI flash chip. I’m wondering if that code ended up running and somehow destroying the original contents. You may be able to guess what I did with this new knowledge. I took the original SPI flash contents from the two devices with nonfunctional status lights, and simply replaced all the LED data starting at 0x300000 with the data from the working one. Then I flashed this new “hybrid” image to the non-working devices. Oh, I should point out that each device has its own unique flash dump. The USB serial number is embedded in there somewhere. So I preferred to preserve the data from 0 to 0x2FFFFF for each individual device. I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect by trying this. The good SPI flash data came from an older revision of the product with a different Nuvoton microcontroller, but it sure looked like it matched what the newer firmware was looking for. Here’s a picture of what I saw as soon as I powered one of the problematic devices after I reflashed its SPI flash chip: It freaking worked. The white lights flashed twice, and then the red lights briefly flashed once. I think the red flash just means the signal was lost, because it also does it every single time I unplug an HDMI source from it. The older model doesn’t do this red flash on every powerup, but maybe it’s just a firmware difference about whether it should say “signal lost” immediately at startup with nothing plugged in. I’ve seen some mention online of red lights meaning that the signal is HDCP-protected, but I think that’s a different longer red blink which I’ve also seen when I first plug in my iPhone as an HDMI source. I’ve also noticed that some of the animations that Elgato says it should do, like when I start or stop recording, don’t play on this newer model, even though they work fine with the older model. I haven’t been able to figure out if this is just a known difference with how the newer model works. I may try to get a good SPI flash dump of the correct LED animations from a newer matching model to confirm it for sure, but I have a feeling the animation data will be identical. I also recently realized that the raw data for each animation is sitting around in C:\\Program Files\\Elgato\\GameCapture\\Animations if you have the older Game Capture utility installed, or /Applications/Game Capture HD.app/Contents/Resources/Animations on Mac. Looking through each file (01.ani, 02.ani, etc.), it looks like the animation data perfectly matches my dump of the older working device. The bytes for each LED are out of order, but if I reorder them correctly, I can create an identical copy of all of the animation data that I extracted from the good flash chip. Since those animations live inside the Game Capture app (or next to it), it seems as though the software has the capability to load them into the flash chip. I wonder if that explains how the stored animation data ended up corrupted in the first place. A botched update perhaps? That would make sense to me. Maybe they disabled the ability for their software to upload them after they discovered it was screwing up people’s devices? It might be interesting to disassemble the Windows and/or Mac software and try to figure out how to convince it to directly upload the animations, but I’m honestly out of motivation to do that at this point. It looks like LedCtrlDll.dll might be an interesting file to look at if anyone else is hooked enough to continue diving deeper. It contains classes with interesting names like Ub530LedSpiRom and I2cIO_Ub530. Some quick disassembly in Ghidra indeed shows it creating a 0x80C-byte array for the header data that would go into the flash chip at 0x300000, and populating the contents with the dot correction data. One last thing I noticed is if I do a firmware update of the HD60 S inside of Elgato’s 4K Capture Utility in Windows, it doesn’t wait long enough. It seems to work fine on Mac, but Windows has some issues. The firmware update is still in progress when it tells me that it failed. If I sit there and wait, eventually the lights flash on the unit and it successfully reboots into the new firmware. If instead I unplug it quickly after Elgato’s software tells me the update failed, I end up with an incomplete flash. I wonder if this has fooled people into bricking their devices? Especially if the status LEDs don’t work at all. I was able to successfully fix this problem by increasing the updateDurationSec in ElgatoDeviceCapabilities.json from 40 to 80. I get the feeling Elgato’s firmware update functionality is a little flaky, at least on Windows. In Elgato’s defense, they specifically recommend not to update firmware on the HD60 S unless their tech support tells you to. And they hide the functionality behind a special key combination when entering the settings screen. I would like to figure out a way to share how to easily fix the LEDs for anyone else who runs into this problem, but the process is admittedly quite convoluted. It requires you to begin a firmware update (modifying ElgatoDeviceCapabilities.json to even allow you to install an update in the first place) and immediately unplug the device — otherwise the Nuvoton MCU takes control of the SPI flash, and you really need the Cypress chip to be in control in order to reflash its contents. Then, you remove the jumper on the PCB (instructing the Cypress chip to boot from USB), upload cyfxflashprog.img to RAM using download_fx3, and use a modified version of fx3_spitest to download the entire SPI flash contents and replace it with your patched LED section. Those are tools from the CYUSB3014 SDK. Finally, you unplug it, put the jumper back in, plug it back in, and perform a normal firmware update in 4K Capture Utility to restore the firmware back to the Nuvoton chip. You ignore the update failure message and wait another minute or so, and eventually it boots back up with working LEDs. If there ends up being enough interest in recovering these things, it might be possible for me to throw something together to automate the process, or at least provide binaries for everything. It would also be nice to figure out how to use Elgato’s software to directly reprogram the LED animations. For now though, I’m just going to sit back, relax, and celebrate my victory on this! So in conclusion, yes, it really was that simple. All I needed to do was replace three chips for a total of less than $1 to bring this thing back to life. Every bit of extra time and money I spent on this project after that was all about figuring out a well-known indicator LED problem that really had nothing to do with my actual repair. I put way more effort into this than I should have, and yes I am probably a tiny bit crazy for actually doing this, but at least I now have an answer and fix for why the LEDs don’t work on some of these capture cards. It’s some sort of software/programming/update bug. I’m not sure which. Way to go Elgato!

Sometimes they were buried deep inside multiple layers of function calls. I must say this is often true even when I'm looking at the source code. I think the vast majority of software out there is heavily overabstracted, and MCUs have gotten big and cheap enough (two ARM cores in an HDMI capture device!?) that this is appearing in embedded stuff too. This device shouldn't have needed more than one MCU. reply ghoomketu 9 hours agoprevGrowing up in India about 20 years ago, we often repaired or renewed almost everything because our buying power was low and things were expensive. We used a lot of hacks, known as *jugaads*, to make things work. Even clothes were reused, with tailors doing *rafu* (patchwork) to extend their life. This was especially common in middle-class homes like mine. My dad, who worked in a garment export house, used to tell me stories about how people in the West preferred disposable items and often opted for newer stuff, whether it was cars, gadgets, or clothes. At the time, I didn't understand this mentality. But now, with increased buying power and lower costs (thanks to China), we too tend to just chuck things away and get replacements. I deeply admire people who don't give up midway and think it's easier to buy new. This type of persistence and resourcefulness is truly commendable. reply toast0 1 hour agoparentCost to repair has grown while cost for new has reduced. If you can repair things yourself, and you can find the parts you need to repair things, then sure. But if it's something I've got to pay for someone's experience and wisdom, that's pretty expensive these days, at least where I'm living, and it's just plain hard to find people who repair things too; lots of signs for TV repair outside empty shops. Thankfully I'm semi-retired, and am on a salary for part time work, so my marginal time has no dollar cost, so I can take a day to try to repair a dishwasher, and then another day to install a new one when it rebreaks a couple days later. A professional installer probably would have had the new one installed in an hour instead of my all day, but I didn't have to wait for scheduling, at least. reply Cthulhu_ 9 hours agoparentprevThis was how things went for a long time in my region (western europe) as well, my parents grew up patching clothes and repairing stuff a lot. It's only in the past 50 years or so that consumerism has gone up and the quality and cost of e.g. clothing has gone down. I've been doing maintenance on my motorcycle myself recently, it does take some small investments in some tools to get started (like a tool to undo the oil filter, although in hindsight a strap and a stick would do the job) and you need to source some parts and replacements (fluids, copper washers, but also replacement screws for the weathered brake fluid reservoir ones), but it's in the region of €100-€150 instead of the €1000 the garage quoted me for. reply masklinn 8 hours agorootparent> It's only in the past 50 years or so that consumerism has gone up and the quality and cost of e.g. clothing has gone down. The “quality” part is a big factor, cost optimisations and fast turnaround means it’s often not worth repairing things at all e.g. a fast fashion T designed to survive for a season (if it survives even a wash). An other major issue is scams around price signals and brand degradation. It used to be you got what you paid for and some brands were known for quality, so you could pay a fair amount of money to a reputable brand and you’d get stuff worth maintaining and repairing. But big groups and P-E have taken to “value extract” from brands, so they take a reputable brand and start white-labelling / cost-optimising, initially keeping prices in order to get maximum money for the moo their start selling instead of milk. Then they drop the price as understanding slowly spreads, until a once reputable brand becomes bargain-bin fare even to the general public. There’s a similar issue around more bespoke products, which optimise for quality signals (e.g. external design and materials) and sell generic inner parts (or outright garbage) for top-shelf prices. Then there’s the shuffling of 6 months brands on generic white label goods (amazon is absolutely infested with that, you’ll get the exact same product under half a dozen brands, and 6 months later most of those have disappeared). reply Panzer04 4 hours agorootparentIt seems to me the real problem is that repairs are, in general, labour intensive. Few products today are sufficiently valuable that a repair is better than a new item. Cars are worth fixing, a 10$ shirt is not, if you value your time. This only becomes more true as expertise becomes required to effect a repair, since you become less capable of repairing and the time of the repairer becomes more valuable. reply ghoomketu 8 hours agorootparentprevYes Reflecting on it, making things last longer had some great side effects. For instance, almost every woman in my family knew how to *rafu* clothes (1), and people understood how things worked under the hood of a car (like you my father did all the maintenance too). These skills were passed down through generations, becoming a part of our everyday knowledge. I guess a lot of things aren't that simple or accessible as most of it is often a black box nowadays. But anyway, Skills like these not only saved money but also fostered a sense of self-reliance, resourcefulness and stuff your parents taught you as life skills.

The main reason to change them is under compression the copper work hardens to seal up. To get a good seal though you just need to re-anneal the copper so it's soft - heat it to cherry red and let it cool down.

My father fixed everything in the house and the vehicles. I inherited my older siblings clothes, and my younger siblings inherited mine. My mother would hem pant legs shorter when we were young, and then let them back out as we grew older. If you wore a knee or an elbow out of clothes, it was getting patched. This instilled some good and bad tendencies in me. I do almost all of the repairs around the house myself. I work too much though, so I don't always have enough time or energy. Even though I can easily afford it, I have a hard time paying someone else to do them. This means I live with broken stuff longer than I should. I'd probably have more money if I spent that time working on side projects instead of doing maintenance and repairs. reply mschuster91 7 hours agorootparent> This is how it was for me growing up blue collar in the northeastern USA in the 80s.

Thing is, they were able to in the first place. Forget about fixing a modern car. The electronics side is a mixture of \"a datacenter on wheels\", DRM and anti-tamper technology (sometimes enforced or heavily suggested by law such as in emissions control, sometimes by reality, e.g. \"Kia Boys\") and high-speed protocols instead of early age wires and relays that you could troubleshoot with a decent multimeter. The physical side is a ton of plastics designed to absorb crash energy and finely tuned metal alloy stuff (with the form also having crash safety implication) that your average DIY person cannot reasonably weld instead of plain old steel sheets. You can't buy a \"reasonably repairable\" new car any more because of the legal mandates and because you don't want it to be stolen by some kid having watched a YouTube or Tiktok video showing how to bypass the locks. And clothing... patching a 1980s piece was possible, the fabrics had weight and structural integrity of their own. Nowadays it's extremely thin fabric everywhere that shreds itself after a few washing machine cycles. Try to patch it and you'll more likely than not find out that your very act of pushing a needle through it to apply the patch just causes the next rip to appear. You are still able to purchase better quality clothing technically but you end up paying like 4x the amount and it's still made in some Bangladeshi or Chinese sweatshop under horrible safety and employee rights standards. reply mc32 7 hours agorootparentprevI feel like it’s giving good money away when you hire someone to do work for you that you know you can do.

I intentionally do not make myself lust after the 'latest and greatest' of anything since I realise that such a lifestyle puts you on a treadmill, always running for the next treat. Hence I'm typing this on a computer from 2009 I got for free because the video card was 'broken' (27\" iMac, a short stay in the oven later fixed the video card) connected to a second monitor I got for free because of a broken power supply (two capacitors later it worked again) which sits on a stand-up desk I got for free because of some trivial electrical defect (quickly fixed). In a way I still partake of the 'fruits' of that latest-and-greatest lifestyle, only with a decade or so of delay and without the compulsion to 'upgrade'. Why do I do this? For a few reasons, most of them quite basic. I like fixing things. I get far more satisfaction out of using abandoned hardware which I have fixed myself than I get out of using whatever new gizmo I happen to lay my hands on because I know I can keep the former working (or find an alternative which I can get to work) while I do not know that for the latter. I like being self-reliant. With a soldering iron, a BGA rework station, a few old oscilloscopes and meters and a few decades worth of experience and scavenged parts I can keep things working for the most, design and build circuits to extend whatever is needed, etc. The advent of cheap and relatively open microcontrollers - the ESP series, Arduino, Raspberry Pi pico etc - has given a boost to the DIY electronics sphere which adds to the appeal of keeping older stuff working, e.g. I'm currently looking in to replacing the worn out control circuit and assorted switches of our 35 year old oven with something totally different and more functional, not because I can't get a new oven but because the current one works quite well apart from those switches. The same goes for the tractors and car, motorbikes (Russian Ural and Ukrainian Dneprs with sidecars), etc. There are no electronics in my tractors, they are purely mechanical. They can be repaired by anyone who knows how without the need for proprietary tools, dealer-only computer terminals and such. Of course I could save a lot of time if I abandoned this 'life style' and just went with the flow, buying new clothes as soon as the old ones needed mending, buying a new computer every 3 years, a new car every 5 years, a new tractor every 10 years, a new dishwasher every 7-12 years, a new washing machine every 10 years, etcetera. I could stop cycling to the village and just take the motorbike, that would be much quicker after all. Think what I could do with all that time saved: - instead of cycling to the village I could spend time at a sports school for exercise - instead of fixing that computer (and learning a bit more every time I fix one) I could watch some series on some streaming service - instead of mending that hole in my trousers (using the Elna sewing machine I got for free because it was 'jammed', took me all of 5 minutes to unjam it) I could browse the web looking for some new trousers - something I'd have to do every few weeks since my clothes somehow seem to acquire holes quite easily, why would that be? - instead of building that barn I could be working a few more months to pay someone else to build me a barn - instead of gaining self-reliance I could make myself become more and more dependent on outside sources and 'experts' Well, thanks but no thanks, I'll just keep on mending my own stuff simply because I can and I like it that way. Here, in Sweden, in the land of plenty. reply ddalex 8 hours agoparentprevI agree that repairing is vastly preferable - I grew up in a poor communist country, where repairing and self-resourcesfullness was the norm. However it's not the consumerist mentality driven by increased buying power - it's sheer economic sense - the time and effort is way better spent, economically speaking - by simply replacing. It's the lower price of goods that drive this thing. My fridge broke the other week. I called the repairman who quoted a repair bill that was 10% MORE EXPENSIVE then buying a new fridge. Simply the time of the repair shop and the transportation from home to shop and back was more expensive them just buying a new fridge, chucking out the older one, and calling it a day. My grandparents, nah, my parents would be horrified by throwing up a \"nearly\" good fridge. To me, it makes economic sense. reply iam-TJ 7 hours agorootparentThis is often due to the total costs being externalised (pushed off to others) and therefore not reflecting the true cost of the replacement nor the costs of (safe) disposal of the old unit. Externalised costs such as emissions from manufacturing of new raw materials (metals, plastics, gases, etc.), transportation, disposal, and more. Obviously it depends on what exactly fails. I've kept 'white goods' going for over 20 years despite: 1) known defect where Hotpoint Fridge/Freezer evaporator thermistor fails due to freeze/defrost thermal cycle. Replaced more than 10 times; cost of new thermistor is pennies; time to replace (after initial explore) 10 minutes. 2) Freezer control PCB misreading thermistor; replace PCB: UK£35. 3) LG Washing machine bearing failures; replaced about 6 times; time to replace (after initial explore): 45 minutes. I think sometimes repair-or-replace depends on one's state of mind. Figuring out what is wrong and how to fix can be frustrating but, equally, it can be extremely satisfying to realise you can do it and are no longer reliant on some mystical \"expert\" !

Self-reliance is one of the drivers of hackers and tinkerers. reply robocat 3 hours agorootparentMy economic theory is that the price reflects ecological costs fairly well. At first glance it might appear that fixing would have a lower environmental cost.

The last two bytes in each row are a delay time before moving onto the next frame. The first 16 bytes looked kind of weird though. They looked like they possibly contained some header data for the animation or something. I have independently invented this format, albeit in text instead of binary, for animating my Hue lamps. Animations in my version look like this: bulb1 bulb2 dly R G B WW CW R G B WW CW 100 10 25 20 0 0 25 10 20 0 0 200 10 50 20 0 0 50 10 20 0 0 where the first value is the number of milliseconds to delay before moving to the next line, then each led channel's brightness (out of 100) is represented on each line. A line that starts with anything but a number is a comment, and any number of spaces (1+) are allowed between channels. I'm tickled to see a similar (binary) format in a commercial product. It really is quite obvious, but still interesting to see. reply KeplerBoy 10 hours agoprevWhat a humbling writeup. This is real fullstack engineering. reply abraae 10 hours agoparentHumbling all right. I think it would take me weeks to achieve this - and that's assuming I had this article to start from! reply Cthulhu_ 9 hours agorootparentI suspect it may have taken the author weeks as well, given they indicated waiting for chips from China and that there was communications with Elgato's customer support. This writeup looks like it's the report of a few weeks if not months of on and off work. reply dougg3 5 hours agorootparentI'm the author of this article and you're absolutely correct! This was a long, drawn-out project. For some context, I ordered the replacement regulators in February. The new LED driver chips were ordered in March, so that was around the time that I actually had the failed hardware fixed. Then everything sat idle for months. The firmware reverse engineering to figure out the LEDs was several weeks of on and off work in my spare time. This type of thing is definitely not something you can just figure out in a couple hours (or even days). reply robocat 3 hours agorootparentYour writeup is inspiring. I most appreciate the honesty about mistakes and failures and dead-ends. Too often wasted effort and small failures are elided from articles and instead you get something that is written retrospectively as though everything went perfectly... reply fhackenberger 9 hours agoprevWould love to see Elgatos response to your writeup :-) reply squarefoot 7 hours agoparentSame here. I can totally imagine the excitement in their engineers eyes after reading this fascinating writeup, paired with their managers anger while they ask for a better way to protect the company's IP. reply 1-6 5 hours agoparentprevIt’ll have to come from Corsair who now owns Elgato. IMHO, they’re a ‘conventional’ company with stock listed on the exchange. If they respond I will be pleasantly surprised. reply aftbit 2 hours agorootparentBuy one share of their stock, then call investor relations and ask them why a hobbyist was able to fix the LED bug that their support claimed didn't exist while their whole expensive engineering team was not. reply KeplerBoy 6 hours agoparentprevNow i am curious if they know what causes their LED troubles or what causes the underlying memory corruption. reply flimflamm 11 hours agoprevThanks for the writeup! It was great as you explained the tools and rabbit holes you went it to. reply ryukoposting 4 hours agoprevGreat work! I find it bizarre that they even bothered with this wild SPI Flash muxing thing if all it does is drive some LEDs. Seems massively overengineered. reply russdill 11 hours agoprevThe reason it likely goes into bootloader when the lock bit isn't set is that it's likely using this as a \"flashed successful\" signifier. reply echoangle 10 hours agoparentThats explicitely stated in the post: Interestingly I discovered that if the chip is set for unprotected mode, the bootloader actually waits around for update commands instead of booting the application firmware. So Elgato is using the locked/unlocked bit as a way of signifying whether it should stay in the bootloader or not, which I find to be a little bit weird. That completely explained why my second HD60 S stopped working after I installed my unlocked firmware — it was stuck in the bootloader waiting forever because the chip was unprotected. reply jwong_ 12 hours agoprevReally enjoyed this write up. You both had the skill and the patience to even buy a working version to fix the broken ones! reply aftbit 3 hours agoprevGreat writeup, with very handy links! reply mschuster91 11 hours agoprevElgato stuff is cheap but horribly unreliable in my experience. Thanks for the writeup, it's showing why that is very detailed... reply J_Shelby_J 3 hours agoparentIt’s sad because their stuff, like the key lights and the stream deck are neat and really useful. and the software has all the features you’d want and you can make your own plugins for it and they document the process for making the plugins. All really cool. But in practice I’m constantly having to power cycle my key lights and having to restart the stream deck app on windows. reply ajolly 2 hours agorootparentBtw I switched from using their app to bitfocus companion instead. Still lets me control my stream deck but no more elgato Corsair bloat reply db48x 10 hours agoparentprevThe flashing and corruption problems point to a very poor software engineering culture. reply robocat 3 hours agorootparentThat is awfully close to blaming the engineers. You don't know what kind of pressures they are under to deliver. I know of significant compromises in all the software I have written, and I would make hardware mistakes if I had taken the electronic engineer path. Sometimes we have to prioritize and I've never had an unlimited time budget on any project (not even my own). Projects with no issues are mostly dead! reply aftbit 2 hours agorootparentWell high pressure to deliver is sort of a poor culture isn't it? I agree we should be forgiving of others mistakes, but I also think we ought to strive to develop better solutions that lead to fewer bugs at any given velocity. reply KeplerBoy 6 hours agorootparentprevHow does the corruption point to a software engineering issue? What could cause corruption and how could it be avoided by better software engineering? reply mschuster91 6 hours agorootparentIt's a culture issue when such cases don't get caught in testing and support staff either doesn't know about it (=the scripts are bad), doesn't get told that there is a workaround (because clearly there is), or (the worst of the possible options) gets told to act like everything is fine. reply crote 4 hours agorootparentIt's a race condition which involves physical interaction with the product, which only occurs during a very rare operation, which looks pretty much identical to a genuine hardware defect. This isn't something you can just trivially unit test. If you don't see this happen multiple times during initial hardware development, you are never catching it. A single failure of a prototype can easily be attributed to a manufacturing defect - especially if it was hand-soldered. Once it's in the field replacing the 0.01% of units suffering from random issues under warranty is far cheaper than having an engineer spend weeks trying to diagnose every single weird failure mode. Unless it affects a number of units, it's just not worth the money. You have to consider that support doesn't get a \"the LEDs stopped working when I unplugged the device immediately after flashing it\" message, they just get \"the LEDs don't work\". Support scripts are made for horses, not zebras. reply mschuster91 4 hours agorootparent> Once it's in the field replacing the 0.01% of units suffering from random issues under warranty is far cheaper than having an engineer spend weeks trying to diagnose every single weird failure mode. Unless it affects a number of units, it's just not worth the money. It does affect a number of units, that's the point, and it's serious enough that the brand image is suffering. Just google \"elgato unreliable\" - tons of results, and when the top result is a Reddit post in the official Elgato subreddit of all places literally titled \"My elgato experience has left me with nothing but hate in my heart\", all alarm sirens should go fucking off. To top it off, Elgato used to be a German brand right out of Munich [1]. German products used to be noteworthy for top-notch engineering and reliability...

This guy walked a deep deep spiritual path to exploring something of the mundane world. It's just so sad, so frustrating, so hellish & infernal that devices do resist us. Computers & devices should be amplifying & radiating the truths they are made of. But humanity is trapped in shells of their own making, in descending consumerism that rejects engagement & learn ability. Computers, alas, especially so, are often the prime obfuscater of truth and understanding! What a vast disuse of so much potential! I hope we see some break through currents, of machines that are open, emerge in my lifetime. Well done, this dude Doug. reply rkachowski 9 hours agoprevamazing work! ultimately it comes down to a firmware bug - I would not have had the fortitude to continue when it came to debugging reply Topgamer7 12 hours agoprevWhat a well written reverse engineering project :) reply londons_explore 6 hours agoprevIf the right to repair movement succeeds fully, OP would have had access to the complete source code and hardware schematics of this device, and the fix for his flashing lights probably would have been a 5 line shell script that someone else had already put on github. reply Aurornis 6 hours agoparent> would have had access to the complete source code and hardware schematics Forcing every company to open source their products is a pipe dream. This is never going to happen. Even if one country passed such a law, manufacturers would move their production to a different country. The products would then be imported and redistributed as foreign products, circumventing the law. reply londons_explore 6 hours agorootparentPeople would have said the same 100 years ago about forcing food companies to reveal their ingredients list. Yet now it is required in almost every country, and doesn't appear to have been that detrimental to the food industry. reply hex4def6 53 minutes agorootparentI agree with the sentiment, but: To what level would the \"source code\" have to be published? Chip-level? Should I expect HDL code that allows me to reproduce the microcontroller? If not, expect a bunch of gadget companies to pay cypress or whoever to make \"custom\" chips with their firmware burned in. After all, what's the difference at that point between HDL and firmware? If yes, expect most companies to simply refuse, and not authorize their chips for sale in the US. International IP / licensing agreement would make it literally impossible for them to comply without being sued into oblivion by the Taiwanese company they licensed the IP from. I think stuff like design files and source code should be held in escrow by the government. If you continue to provide replacement parts to customers, the information remains protected. Once you stop providing reasonably priced replacements (\"reasonably priced\" = less than the cost of the product), the information gets published so others can reproduce it. reply dannyw 5 hours agorootparentprevIngredients listing don't tell everything about how it is made, etc. A closer analogy might be detailed API specs. reply londons_explore 3 hours agorootparentHardware schematics and full source code doesn't tell you everything about how a piece of hardware is made either. How was the hardware tested? How was it calibrated? How was it assembled? An ingredients list tells 90% of the story about how food is made, and in most cases an expert could guess the remaining 10% to get a decent result. Likewise, hardware design+code tells 90% and an expert could figure out the remaining 10%. The government could totally require all consumer products have published source code. (published source code != a license for others to use the code) reply immibis 4 hours agorootparentprevFor electronics it would probably show the part number and position of each component on the PCB, without showing how they are connected. reply sydbarrett74 12 hours agoprev [–] We need to encourage our kids to repair stuff. It aids the environment (less e-waste) and teaches them a valuable trade. I know that's it's typically cheaper to replace than repair, but to me that's a market failure. reply pjc50 9 hours agoparent> market failure Industrialization has massively optimized the \"hot path\" for any kind of production, largely by taking out the humans. It is incredibly cheap to manufacture consumer electronics - because everything is standardized and predictable and amenable to machine operation. This is what market success looks like. The downside is that as soon as there is a deviation from the process, it gets more expensive. It's worth thinking about what happens to repair inside the factory. Some percentage of units will be coming off the production line defective and fail initial QA. This is usually a very low percentage, well below 1%, because the entire economics of the factory depends on not having to do any rework. Even there, the technicians will take a look, determine if it's something that can be fixed quickly, or is a novel kind of failure, and if not just throw it away right there. Why? Because while you're standing there looking at it, another hundred have come off the production line. The broken one in your hand is not a unique snowflake. At the start of a run though, this is an interesting and important job, because any failure is a novel failure. The first batch through the process should have high yield, but it might not, and then you stop the line ( https://mag.toyota.co.uk/andon-toyota-production-system/ ) and figure out what's happened (something misaligned? Defective inputs? Material problems? Design issue?) The first batch will often get reworked and sent out as demo units. reply KeplerBoy 8 hours agorootparentWhat happens when a unit is defective and not easily repairable, maybe because the PCB itself was already defective? Do technicians salvage the high value components, like the CPLD in this case, off the board? That chip alone is probably worth 15$. reply pjc50 6 hours agorootparentAs other commenter says, spending human time to save a $15 chip is uneconomic. This only happens if they're especially expensive parts or (as during COVID) supply is short and you can't just buy some more. (COVID shortages saw the opposite phenomenon in a few places: working consumer electronics being bought and stripped for a particular part critical to something else, then the rest thrown away!) Remember that after you've hotgunned it off the board and cleaned the solder you have to re-ball BGA parts. Again, a process that's cheap in the original manufacturing line and very hard to do by hand. It also means the part has been through more thermal stress which will shorten its life. You don't want to have to rework a unit again if you put a recycled chip in it which fails. reply ElectricalUnion 7 hours agorootparentprevThe engineering time to \"salvage\" and test the 15$ chip, and the cost of downtime reintegrating the part to the production line is probably worth more that 15$, so unless the lack of that specific part is a bottleneck, probably no? reply KeplerBoy 6 hours agorootparentYeah, probably, but I do wonder where it starts to make sense to desolder a chip and give it another try. Surely at the point of high end GPU Boards one would invest considerable amounts of time and money to salvage a chip, which could sell for thousands of dollars. reply coldpie 4 hours agorootparentI think you're right that for high end chips, it is worth the time to salvage it[1]. But I think that's the vast minority, like you said, most stuff being manufactured isn't at the cutting edge of consumer tech like GPUs are. [1] They show a bit of the RMA/failed unit process towards the end of this surprisingly good GPU factory tour from Linus Tech Tips. There's some discussion of de-soldering and testing retrieved components. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS35VHEfFDU reply xnzakg 2 hours agorootparentprevNot the user you replied to from my experience usually it's not worth it due to several reasons: - desoldering the chips takes time and is a manual process ($), with risk of tearing off a pad or bending leads. In case of BGA ICs reballing is needed to reuse them. - components are usually not rated for a lot of reflow (heat/cool) cycles, and some are moisture-sensitive and may crack if they have managed to absorb moisture - you usually end up with some solder and flux left on the IC, which can cause issues - ICs come on tape for feeding into automated pick-and-place machines, so you would need to feed and mount them manually ($) And if you only realize you have damaged the IC after mounting it on the new board you end up having to rework it again ($). Sure, it might be worth it if the chip is really expensive or hard to get, or you're soldering everything by hand anyway, but usually the math just doesn't work out. reply not_your_vase 11 hours agoparentprevMost devices nowadays are unfortunately not only not repair-friendly, they are straight impossible to take disassemble. They are welded, soldered, glued together, and any attempt at a repair is intentionally destructive :( This one is an odd exception, that usually happens only with the early versions of a product. reply addandsubtract 10 hours agoparentprevGermany is rolling out an incentive to get products repaired. For example, repairs that can be done by yourself or in a repair café will be subsidized by €200 and repairs that require a professional or sending in, will be subsidized by 50% up to €200. reply the_biot 8 hours agoparentprevIf the US gets into a full-blown trade war with China, i.e. massive tariffs on everything, I expect consumer electronics, clothing etc to become much more interesting to repair instead of replace. reply PUSH_AX 9 hours agoparentprevI agree with the sentiment, but in this example, how much domain expertise was required? reply Razengan 9 hours agoparentprevI appreciate the intent, but.. Do you suppose time is free? and renewable? Time that could be spent doing other things instead of learning how to repair, buying the tools, and repairing something that you could just hire someone else to repair, or buy anew? As for environmental waste, figure out ways to make stuff out of more easily degradable stuff, or to reuse it, instead of _guilting_ people into repair. reply pjc50 6 hours agorootparentTo repurpose a sentence from somewhere else, repair is only free if your time is worthless. (Imagine trying to contract someone to do the OP's level of thorough work; it would be a five-figure dollar sum) reply blitzar 8 hours agorootparentprevA robust economy for parts and repairs would be ideal. Parts are (reasonably) obtainable, however, professional or even decent repair is about as reliable as a used car salesman. reply XorNot 7 hours agoparentprevThis repair makes the case I've found more obvious though: we need microcontroller firmwares to be made available (I would argue as a public government archive honestly). I've had several Yamaha amps blow micro-processors or DSPs, and on the older ones there were no firmware upgrades so you just plain couldn't do anything afterwards. I've got the same problem with the controller for my heat exchange ventilation - microcontroller is dead, and while the chip is easy to get and replace, there's 0 chance I can source a replacement firmware for it. reply varispeed 9 hours agoparentprev [–] Unfortunately, due to lobbying, it's now less of a trade but skill that corporations exploit for profit. In Western countries working on your own account is getting more and more restricted under guise of tackling tax avoidance (many tax authorities engage in anti-small business propaganda), so that the profit people generate is captured by corporations they have to work at if they want to pursue their \"trade\". edit: I find it fascinating that working class supports this, even though it is against their interest. It has a lot to do with crabs in the bucket mentality and the cultivated perception that venturing out of ones lane is wrong. Most people think they need to serve the rich masters and that is their calling and reject the idea that concept of class has been created to keep them in mental captivity. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Screen-recording permission once every week ? 2. No more sudo spctl —master-disable. Alternative way is bit complicated. 2. No more control+ click to bypass gatekeeper. 3. Why tcutil reset Accessibility not working for a specific app? It works for “All” . 4. Script to convert NSURL node ref url to posix url not working. 5. Normal usb Mouse pointer acceleration is not smooth. May be need to re tweak those again. Anything else ? Otherwise all good. reply ericol 21 hours agoparentThank you for this. I'm not an advanced user but I do use some advanced features, and having to fight the OS in order for it to make what I want is not in my list of desirable \"features\". Will delay this update as long as possible. reply ilrwbwrkhv 17 hours agorootparent> macOS Sequoia, the latest version of the world’s most advanced desktop operating system. From their opening sentence in that press release. Lol. reply kemayo 20 hours agoparentprev> 1. Screen-recording permission once every week ? Every month. (Which is still annoying, but not the raw level of frustration that weekly would be.) reply gorkish 19 hours agorootparentDo you still have to quit and restart the entire application after you give the permission? Holy shit mac users are gonna become a meme in meetings. MacOS is turning into quite the poo log lately. I respect that Apple has every right to completely destroy the legacy of the Macintosh, but they are slow playing it so that it's just a little bit better than the alternatives. The end result is my life gets just a little bit more difficult with every release. I feel like the freaking frog on the stove while the water slowly heats up. When is it time to jump out? reply iknowstuff 19 hours agorootparentLol calm down its only for apps which failed to upgrade to their new window selector API. reply gcr 19 hours agorootparentWhich major apps (chrome, google meet, zoom, tuple) have actually done so yet? reply nl 18 hours agorootparentZoom and Chrome both seem fine reply jonathanyc 16 hours agorootparentprevIronically, the last time I checked, the built in screencapture command-line program hadn’t been updated to use ScreenCaptureKit yet. The company I was contracting for ended up shelling out to it because its window picking UX was a lot better than ScreenCapureKit’s. (You can’t do this if you’re sandboxed, though, AFAIK). reply ezfe 18 hours agorootparentprevThat requirement doesn't apply to most apps even though it says it does. Zoom/Teams/Slack all pick up the permissions immediately. reply OJFord 17 hours agorootparentSlack seems to randomly lose microphone access (whether permissions or not) requiring restart anyway, so doesn't really help. And unless that's really recent, no, I have colleagues drop out of Teams meetings to enable microphone or screen sharing access all the time. reply ezfe 4 hours agorootparentYes because it says you have to. The system claims it won't work, but it works fine. reply latexr 8 hours agorootparentprev> I feel like the freaking frog on the stove while the water slowly heats up. When is it time to jump out? Whenever you feel like it. Just like frogs do: > While some 19th-century experiments suggested that the underlying premise is true if the heating is sufficiently gradual, according to modern biologists the premise is false: changing location is a natural thermoregulation strategy for frogs and other ectotherms, and is necessary for survival in the wild. A frog that is gradually heated will jump out. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog reply Elidrake24 19 hours agorootparentprevYou do not, providing you have given permission previously. Most Video Conferencing solutions have you test your hardware prior to joining a call, so shouldn't be an invasive issue. reply tl 7 hours agorootparentprev> I respect that Apple has every right to completely destroy the legacy of the Macintosh I disagree. Apple's various machinations to control the best available supply lines (deals with TSMC, etc...) make me feel quite entitled in saying what is and is not acceptable behavior on their part. This feeling amplifies with every \"courageous\" announcement they make sunsetting some useful feature they no longer feel like supporting. reply seec 3 hours agorootparentI would also add that since Apple chose to lock their software and support of various file format/data storage to their own hardware solely; they have a responsibility toward their longtime customer to provide a good long-term experience. Otherwise, the only \"solution\" is to get stuck in time at a particular OS release and it doesn't work in IT for many different reasons. There is a large difference in computing devices versus other simple objects, in that they need software and software can change which is problematic but should not be a problem for the customer/user... In my opinion Apple is largely failing at providing a worthwhile platform, when they don't just discontinue stuff for their bottom line, most of the changes are for marketing reasons or increasing lockdown to extract more money from customers. There is not a whole lot of useful stuff that have been added in the last 5 OS iterations but a lot of major annoyance or downgrades/roadblock/complications for usage, etc... reply e40 5 hours agorootparentprevAnd how are our parents going to do this without us being there? It once took be 3 hours to accomplish it with my father. He’s 3000 miles away but it was only marginally better than a plane trip. reply mystcb 10 hours agorootparentprev> Do you still have to quit and restart the entire application after you give the permission? The funny thing about this, even on Sonoma - I could click the button to allow it, when it said \"restart app\" I closed the box (or clicked cancel), and it worked anyway. Specifically, I noticed it more on things like Teams/Zoom where I was doing a screen share, it just \"worked\" - no need to restart the entire application. reply robinsonrc 13 hours agoparentprevmacOS is very gradually moving in the wrong direction for me. I never really saw myself considering desktop Linux again but I’m almost starting to get excited by the idea. For now I’ll just hold off on the update as none of it seems particularly compelling, especially as a happy Rectangle user (with all its key bindings nicely isolated from macOS preferences and synced along with the rest of my dotfiles) reply rahen 10 hours agorootparentI feel the same and decided my next update would be to Asahi (Fedora or Ubuntu). I switched from Linux to macOS a few years ago, but I never really felt like I was the target user for this environment. It always feels like I have to adapt to the walled garden of Apple's ecosystem, rather than it adapting to me. reply thisislife2 11 hours agorootparentprevThe iShittification of the Mac platform continues ... I predicted this a long time ago when Apple released its first Mac mini with soldered SSD. Then the ones with security chip. And now we have soldered RAM + SSD behind a custom SoC that can only run macOS (yes, it is a macOS only system despite the PR of \"ARM Linux / xBSD on M1+\" because all these are crippled version of OS that cannot fully exploit the hardware because there are no literature on it for system developers, and they have to literally reverse engineer at a slow pace to make the OS run on it). As the hardware iShittification continued, macOS too was also being slowly stripped of features to ensure Apple controlled your data and what you could run on it. Support for independent Kernel extension (outside of Apple's control) was removed mainly to cripple existing independent Application Firewall and virtualisation software. Apple-made OS APIs for these were integrated to the newer macOS and offered as replacement to ensure Apple controlled how Application Firewalls and Virtualisations should / would work on macOS. (Such restriction on the kernel extensions for independent system developers is also meant to prevent support for other filesystem, like ZFS for example - the OpenZFS project is maturing fast on Linux, Windows and macOS and can be a game changer as its usage has the potential to \"free\" our data from a closed and controlling ecosystem, to be used on any platform of our choice. Whether you are a developer or a user, a \"consumer relationship\" with Apple feels like a relationship with a controlling and abusive spouse who repeatedly gaslights you that you are imagining things and are the one at fault because \"you just don't understand them\". reply n42 21 hours agoparentprev> No more control+ click to bypass gatekeeper Can someone expand on this? How do you run software that isn't code signed? reply jiripospisil 21 hours agorootparent> The right-click/control-click option for easily opening unsigned apps is no longer available. Users who want to open unsigned software will now need to go the long way around to do it: first, try to launch the app and dismiss the dialog box telling you that it can't be opened. Then, open Settings, go to the Privacy & Security screen, scroll all the way to the bottom to get to the Security section, and click the Open Anyway button that appears for the last unsigned app you tried to run. https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/macos-15-sequoia-mak... reply veeti 17 hours agorootparentOh, but I was assured by Cupertino sycophants that you \"just\" need to CTRL-click open an unnotarized app and there is no protection racket for distributing apps, no big deal. The frog continues boiling. reply Pesthuf 20 hours agorootparentprevOne huge step closer to iOS. Damn it. I actually liked macOS but these changes are terrible for everyone but the most basic users. reply simonask 19 hours agorootparentReally? This is _huge_ to you? How many unsigned apps are you downloading and running? This is one of those features where the benefits seem to very obviously outweigh the drawbacks. 99.9% of users just aren't running unsigned software, so the moment that happens, it is most certainly malware. If you're developing software yourself, this isn't an issue either, since all the relevant toolchains, debuggers, etc., work just fine under this model. That's a supported workflow. The only thing that isn't supported is downloading some random unverified app bundle from who knows where and treating it as if you could trust it. You 100% can't. And yes, I also believe that if an OSS project considers \"muggles\" their target audience, they should prioritize setting up code-signing. Consider it a service to their users. If the fee is a problem, it's important enough to spend the effort to find a way to finance it. If you can't find someone who is willing to put their name on it, you shouldn't ask people to run your software on their machines in the first place. reply mort96 19 hours agorootparent> How many unsigned apps are you downloading and running? For me, quite a few? Internal tools at work, open source projects which publish builds on their github, that sort of stuff. (And no, paying Apple a yearly subscription for the privilege of letting users run an app is not a reasonable expectation of small open source projects) reply samtheprogram 17 hours agorootparentYeah, but you only need to approve an app once. I think I Ctrl+Open an app like once a quarter on average, sometimes going most of a year. This really isn't a big deal. reply throwme_123 18 hours agorootparentprevJust tell these advanced users to compile it themselves. Problem solved. reply tengbretson 18 hours agorootparentThe users are too busy buying their mom iphones. reply jezek2 17 hours agorootparentprevAs a creator of a programming language that can compile binaries of any supported platform from any platform it is an unsolveable problem. I can't do the signing as it requires Apple stuff. Not to mention it is unethical to require it as it's used for gatekeeping not just security (requiring Apple to decide if you can run an executable is unacceptable). Compare it to Android where you can use self-signed certificates and it has an actual function, it allows updates signed with the same certificate to access the existing stored data on the device. It improves security without gatekeeping. At least that was on the older Androids, haven't done work on any newer ones. I can't do some kind of universal launcher that is signed by me because it would allow to run arbitrary code and therefore it would be banned. Therefore the only solution is to search for various workarounds (eg. by teaching the users how to run the software) or if not possible anymore stop supporting newer versions of MacOS and rely on web applications to support the platform (like it's the only way on iOS). Which would be even worse on the desktop as the usability can be quite bad, but at least users would have some chance to use the applications even on their closed system. reply simonask 10 hours agorootparentI hope you're able to see how your use case is incredibly niche, and should not be a priority for a general security model for an operating system. Your problems are extremely insignificant in the big picture, where the priority of a serious operating system should be to support regular people in avoiding malware and malicious social engineering. macOS is a general purpose operating system, not a hobbyist or tinkerer OS, and the vast majority of its users are non-technical. I get that it's annoying, but pushing the work on you is a massive benefit to your users. reply jezek2 9 hours agorootparentYou're right that as a developer of the language it's quite niche position, however the language is then used by developers to create actual applications and they're affected by this, or rather the users are. It also allows to be used from a C/C++ project so you can do all the required steps, but it's quite more involved compared to simply building the software for all platforms at once. It's also not related to how popular my language is. It affects any language including C/C++ if you want to have unified cross-compilation to all supported platforms (which is quite typical for any serious project). You may not be aware but Apple has put roadblocks for such usages as well, you can't rent a Mac VM for automatic builds, it has to be rented for 24 hours at minimum. Using someone's private Mac for building may not be a good idea for various reasons. And then you compare it to other platforms that don't require anything like this. I even mentioned Android which shows that you can use signing to provide a security aspect without the gatekeeping aspect. The issue is wider and basically it's an anticompetitive behavior of Apple to any competitor to Xcode. reply shepherdjerred 16 hours agorootparentprevYou can sign macOS executables without macOS hardware reply jezek2 16 hours agorootparentA paid developer account would be required by every developer wishing to publish their cross-platform application also on MacOS. Even if it was free it would be an issue because it would require an extra registration and workflow that requires internet access and having Apple to arbitrarily decide that your application (or you as a developer) is banned. Therefore instructions how the users can run the application is the only solution. reply Pesthuf 19 hours agorootparentprevQuite a lot apparently considering how often I have to bypass gatekeeper. I don't really see how the average user is positively affected by these changes - it's not like they will accidentally open terminal and enter random strings infinite monkey theorem style until they hit sudo spctl –master-disable. Ctrl-click was at least possible to stumble over, but I see no good reason not to at least provide a .plist setting to re-enable that behavior. Except to bully more devs into getting signing certs. reply simonask 10 hours agorootparentThe problem is not - and has never been - accidentally stumbling on insecure features. The problem is social engineering, where inexperienced users are guided by malware operators to run insecure software, either over the phone or through countless malware sites on the web that claim to solve their problems. These are real, tangible risks. reply eviks 14 hours agorootparentprev> How many unsigned apps are you downloading and running? Enough for this to be annoying. Plenty of tiny tools don't pay for the privilege of doing free work, so aren't signed > This is one of those features where the benefits seem to very obviously outweigh the drawbacks. 99.9% of users just aren't running unsigned software, so the moment that happens, it is most certainly malware. You're obviously wrong with your made up stats (you don't need to be a power '1% user to want to install some a single useful unsigned app over the whole lifetime of using a Mac) and ignore the fact that part of the reason why it's 99% and not 88% is precisely because of features like this that make it harder to do so. But there is an easy way to reconcile - make the old behavior configurable then the imaginary nonexisting 0.0000% users can continue without permanent disruptions reply raxxorraxor 11 hours agorootparentprev> This is one of those features where the benefits seem to very obviously outweigh the drawbacks That has never been true. Neither for pro- nor casual users. This might be good for the bottom line of Apple, but I doubt that too, since they squander their reputation. This is non-engineers calling the shots, just like Jobs warned us about. I do run quite a few unsigned apps and I don't even use a mac that often. This is just stupid... reply __jonas 19 hours agorootparentprevMy god, I had no idea there was a shorter way than that, can't believe I'm finding this out just as they remove it, so annoying! reply weaksauce 21 hours agorootparentprevat least it's still possible (and maybe more accessible) if not a bit more inconvenient. the ctrl-click thing was kinda a hidden feature. reply whywhywhywhy 20 hours agorootparentlets stop pretending this is anything other than trying to make apps that don't pay $100 a year feel scary. reply quesera 18 hours agorootparentAre you suggesting that Apple is making it less convenient for users to run unsigned binaries, because they want to increase developer program revenue? reply rpdillon 16 hours agorootparentNot developer program revenue. At every turn where they have a choice, Apple does the same thing: sell devices increasingly locked to their own ecosystem, and sell it as a feature to protect folks. This strategy works really well: they actually have folks arguing that giving all Apple users fewer choices is a feature. They have been ratcheting down on freedom in OS X (and then MacOS) since 2011 or so when I stopped using Apple for personal use. The introduction of the Mac App Store, subsequent lackluster performance, and introduction of scary warnings about running unsigned code in MacOS tell most all of the story. This latest update is just another step in that direction, making running unsigned code that much more difficult. The obvious endgame is to raise the next generation of Mac users to only use the Mac App Store for software, effectively replicating the golden goose that the iOS App Store has proven to be. reply nozzlegear 3 hours agorootparentI don't think I agree with your conclusion about their endgame being a replication of the iOS App Store golden goose, but I do see how it could come about. The reason I disagree is because changes like this oft remind me of the problems Facebook used to have (still do?) with stolen tokens and cookies that would come about from people pasting JavaScript into their browser's devtools console. Some poor schmuck would find a viral comment that said something like \"Mark Zuckerberg doesn't want you to know how to get Facebook Premium! Copy and paste this code into your browser, ignore Facebook's warnings, they don't want you to get it for free!\" And badabing badaboom, stolen credentials get sent to some server. I don't work at Apple and can only speculate on their motive, but since I advise my family to use macOS, it's my hope that this change would prevent them from reading something like \"download this scary blob and then ctrl+click on it to open it for free Photoshop! Ignore Apple's warning, Adobe has paid them because they don't want you to get it for free!\" It does make it slightly more inconvenient for me, but I think chromedriver may be the only unsigned code that I run regularly. reply drexlspivey 18 hours agorootparentprevDon't Windows do the same? I feel like every single program I run, signed or unsigned, a dialogue pops up where I have to give permission. reply makeitdouble 17 hours agorootparentThis change is about macos removing the pop up altogether so you need to go dig into the settings to give permission. reply lokar 17 hours agorootparentprevThey don’t care about the money reply nozzlegear 17 hours agorootparentprevWouldn't they just make it impossible to bypass gatekeeper in that case? reply wpm 20 hours agorootparentprevPrecisely the kind of hidden feature that makes it easy for power users to bypass the \"rules\" Apple imposes on the platform, while still making it highly likely every day users won't know how to bypass the rules meant to protect them. More and more, I find that these sorts of \"we know best\" attitudes towards security utterly distasteful and the total opposite of empowering. Infantilizing, more like. reply schrodinger 19 hours agorootparentI want that for my mom on her macbook pro. had an ipad, prefers laptop form factor. What I'd like is upon setup it asks if this is a dev machine, and change the preferences. reply raxxorraxor 10 hours agorootparentprevThese rules do not protect the normal user. At some point they fail to install something they want to have and then my phone rings because their OS is shitty. reply IshKebab 20 hours agorootparentprevWe're getting closer to the bottom of the slope! I wonder what their next step will be. 1. Need to disable gatekeeper to run unsigned code. 2. Need an active developer account. 3. You can't run downloaded unsigned code. reply api 20 hours agorootparentThat's when I think about jumping ship. If they require the App Store that's the end. reply deafpolygon 14 hours agorootparentThey can't, and they won't. Just look at the upcoming changes being forced on iOS in the EU with sideloading. reply raxxorraxor 10 hours agorootparentIf these features need to be forced by legislative action, the product itself is probably shit. And most importantly, not in the interest of users, like some like to argue. reply IshKebab 7 hours agorootparentprevApple doesn't have a monopoly on Mac (or they're not a \"digital gatekeeper\" or whatever) so that wouldn't apply there. reply ryandrake 20 hours agorootparentprevIf you zoom out and look at the trajectory release after release, all of these things are obviously coming. Every release we act surprised that it's slightly more difficult to run unsigned, un-notarized, un-sanctioned code, but somehow that Voice Of The Fanboy within us has us convinced that \"surely this last change is where Apple will draw the line and stop!\" reply schrodinger 19 hours agorootparentdev machines are their bread and butter though! if they were going to have done this and merge iOS and macOS, I think they'd (stupidly) have done so. reply ac29 17 hours agorootparentMac isnt even 10% of their revenue, and my guess is developers on Mac are maybe a percent or two at most. reply ibll 17 hours agorootparentto be fair, developers on mac create like 100% of their highly profitable iOS app store revenue because you can't hardly make iOS apps without a mac. reply api 6 hours agorootparentprevMicrosoft figured out long ago that having developers use your platform is a small direct source of revenue but a massive indirect one, not to mention the thing that keeps your platform relevant. Driving them off Mac would be a gigantic mistake that over time would lead to the fading of the whole Apple ecosystem. reply seec 2 hours agorootparentWell yeah but you need someone that has some understanding of what he is actually selling to come to that realization, not the greedy bitch that is Tim Cook. I think the mistake already happened, you can see fewer and fewer macOS only software and there is very little in the way of novelty/exclusivity (both iOS/macOS). Devs are now more and platform stuff more and more (mostly web technologies because it makes for good UI even though performance is not the best, it doesn't matter with today's powerful machines. I'll add that one key point that Apple was better on is becoming very moot: software optimisation (performance and UI) matters a lot less in today's cheap powerful computing. Apple is supposedly selling top of the line hardware but skimping every way possible so in the end, when price matched, competitive hardware does not do worse no matter how bad the softwares are optimized on concurrent platform. reply jezek2 17 hours agorootparentprevYeah, but such concerns are from a long ago and it didn't happen yet. So the best approach is (and has been) to just support the platform until it is not possible anymore and don't be emotional about it. We just know that one (still quite distant) day it will happen. Then the usage of the platform will end for many users & developers. One could still live a quite long time on the older systems to ease the transition out. reply raxxorraxor 10 hours agorootparentBut why should I develop for a platform that is doomed to be shitty in the near future. I do create macOS binaries, although they mostly are just a byproduct if targeting it is trivial. Of course I do not sign any of them, to me that is more or less a scam comparable to ransomware. reply jezek2 8 hours agorootparentTotally understandable. My motivation is that I want to reach out to the users as much as possible, doing an extra amount of work if needed. They benefit from cross-platform applications. And I need it to do just once in my programming language as any application using it benefits automatically. This way I support Windows 2000 or newer, MacOS 10.6+, up to 15 years old Linux distributions with the same small binary for each platform, I did an extra mile in supporting WebAssembly target so it's easy to compile the applications to the web. This also allows to create applications for smartphones without the need for approval and having to follow any weird arbitrary rules. Why support such old versions? Real world users are often stuck with old versions for various reasons, it's a minority of users but they can be the most important ones. And technically because the difference between these old systems and new systems is not that big. Often it just means to use some older API or do a few extra steps. It's all hidden in code that handles multiplatform stuff so it's not in the way. It doesn't add bloat either. reply IshKebab 7 hours agorootparentprev> Yeah, but such concerns are from a long ago and it didn't happen yet. Well yeah because they are very sensibly doing it extremely slowly. Microsoft is doing the same thing; they're just a fair bit behind Apple. reply deafpolygon 14 hours agorootparentprevWeird, that's been how I was doing it ~4 years ago before I switched to Windows for a while. reply nailer 19 hours agorootparentprevSame nightmarish UI path as installing an app store on an iPhone. reply captaincrowbar 20 hours agorootparentprevDoes the command line to remove the quarantine flag (xattr -d com.apple.quarantine filename) still work? reply lapcat 20 hours agorootparentYes. reply givinguflac 21 hours agorootparentprevFrom the same place is system security settings you could always approve it, bummer about ctrl click though. reply crindy 21 hours agorootparentprevBefore this update you could hold control and click the application, then select \"open\" from the menu. It would give you a warning and let you confirm you'd like to run it anyway. reply deergomoo 21 hours agoparentprevI’m having difficulties with the keyboard shortcuts for the new window snapping stuff. My desk keyboard doesn’t have a Globe key (like most non-Apple keyboards), but the shortcuts don’t work with Caps Lock remapped to Globe.

I bet I know the answer. Did this conveniently break Rewind AI? reply threecheese 19 hours agorootparentNot sure if it is broken, but I took the opportunity when upgrading today to say No and just disable it. The product is EOL anyway, there are a few upstarts in the open source world, and I am hoping the best for Apples on-device SLMs (or oss ones) mooting the requirement for OpenAI. reply lostmsu 19 hours agorootparentWhat do you mean EOL? I see nothing of the sort on their website. reply gcr 19 hours agorootparentprevagain, i keep asking: which apps have actually switched to the new screen sharing API and which apps have not? does zoom, chrome, google meet, etc still require this? reply gareim 18 hours agorootparentYou sound entitled, phrasing it that way. No one owes you an answer here. Discord updated to the new API already, as one example. reply nozzlegear 17 hours agorootparentprevOf all the apps I use that record my screen, literally all of them have updated to this new API ages ago. That includes Discord, Slack, Teams, Zoom, FaceTime, OBS, and Safari. I want to say that Firefox has as well but can't remember for certain. reply clumsysmurf 21 hours agoparentprevSeems that bclm no longer works https://github.com/zackelia/bclm/issues/49 I had to start using it because macOS insisted on keeping my battery charged to 100% no matter what I did, and that can damage the battery. reply clumsysmurf 18 hours agorootparentEdit: Seems like its also broken on 14.7 now, battery went straight to 100%. reply gcr 19 hours agoparentprevHow do you bypass gatekeeper now? How often do you have to re-authenticate your existing binaries? reply ezfe 18 hours agorootparentThe official way, which is by going to the Privacy & Security screen to click the override button reply kccqzy 16 hours agorootparentNo the official way is the control-click. It was suggested by Apple in the UI of System Preferences back in the Mountain Lion days. https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/gatek... reply ezfe 4 hours agorootparentOkay, in Mountain Lion sure. However that phrasing has not been around for a while. reply Hamuko 21 hours agoparentprevApple locking down the OS even more by making Gatekeeper harder to bypass makes me want to skip this version for as long as possible. The screen recording permission thing also doesn't help since I'm using Ice (https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice) because somehow Apple still can't Sherlock this feature. reply user3939382 21 hours agorootparentThe way it's even implemented now is like the nightmare realized from everything Richard Stallman warned about for decades. Especially for non-technical users, they've practically implemented a system where Apple decides what software you are and aren't allowed to run on your own computer. They can muddy the issue by claiming it's for safety/security but I don't buy it. They could have made the override still clear but much easier to access. reply chongli 20 hours agorootparentEspecially for non-technical users, they've practically implemented a system where Apple decides what software you are and aren't allowed to run on your own computer. For non-technical users the choice is simple: either Apple decides what is allowed to run on their computer or cybercriminals do. After years of getting burned, non-technical users made their choice. I think it was the right one but the jury's still out for the future. Perhaps one day these users will get squeezed out of computing entirely. That will be a terrible shame. The same thing is playing out with everything else though. Look at cars and household appliances. reply willtemperley 16 hours agorootparentIt’s still perfectly possible to run whatever you like on Mac via virtualisation, which Apple have tried to make easy with a reasonably decent API reply simonask 19 hours agorootparentprevAlso, let's not fool ourselves. I'm not sure even most technical people running macOS or Linux would know if they had malware running. I probably wouldn't. It's not like antivirus is commonplace on those platforms. The notion that you can reasonably have knowledge of and control over all the software that is actually running on your machine has not been realistic for decades. reply AStonesThrow 19 hours agorootparentMy router was pwned, not once but possibly 3 times, and the major compromise I only discovered due to the third-party DNS filtering service I'd set up on it. It is practically impossible for any consumer to detect a compromised router, due to their embedded systems and lack of meaningful logging or diagnostics. Therefore I concluded that consumer routers are the weakest link in anyone's home network, and I was pleased as punch to begin renting one that my ISP manages. Peace of mind indeed. My Windows 10 box became so bogged down that I was convinced it was running some undetectable malware. AV detected nothing, but after a critical look at open ports I just decided to wipe and go to Windows 11. Here are some of the biggest risks today. Running third-party apps at all, unless they are absolutely necessary. I try to do everything possible with Google-provided apps within the Google ecosystem on my Android phone and the other devices as well, which limits the third-party attack surfaces. My Windows machine runs practically nothing outside of MS or Google. I don't need to. Other big threats are beyond personal devices at this point. Connecting third-party SaaS to your accounts is a real problem. Facebook, Google Workspace, Slack, GitHub, any service that acts as a platform and runs third-party integrations, that's where you'll get bitten nowadays, and your local AV scans are powerless to shield you from footguns. Just to use HP printer features, HP wanted full, unscoped, read/write/delete access to my Google Drive! Everyone's \"hacked Facebook account\" has really been just some stupid game that went rogue. Supply-chain attacks through browser extensions and the rest. Extremely difficult to police from the end-user's position, but deadly and dangerous, because they're out on the net and in the cloud. reply adastra22 21 hours agorootparentprevAnything you compile on your own system you can run.

What is the security benefit of removing the command-click shortcut? reply tpmoney 2 hours agorootparentOne argument in favor of removing it (not saying it’s the reason or that they didn’t have other options) is that ctrl-click and open did not obviously do anything different. That is, whether you ctrl-click and open a signed app or an unsigned app, the command in the menu was just “open”, with no indication that you were overriding a security policy. Then the dialog it popped up wasn’t particularly distinct from the “first time run” dialog. There is an argument to be made that going to the security settings and specifically allowing an app is a more clear expression of intent. Kind of in the same way you probably want to open a file you download from the web, but good security practices means the browser doesn’t open it for you on download, you need to explicitly go do it. That said there’s no reason they couldn’t have fixed either of those issues instead reply skrrtww 20 hours agorootparentprev> Once you need to be in the apple developer program to build and run from source or something, that’ll be a legitimate nightmare.

So the category of software will still have some working entries (existing players will try to get approved, and probably will), but it's hard to imagine anyone will want to build a new one knowing its viability on modern macOS completely depends on filling out a form and hoping Apple's approval bureaucracy likes you. Anyone who's used these unusually locked down entitlements know whether you can apply for it before building the software, or if App Review needs to have their hands on something functional first to approve it? reply antfie 20 hours agorootparentIn my experience the app submission needs to be fully functional and then it will be rejected for this reason. reply modeless 23 hours agoprevWindow tiling! If you drag a single window to the top does it maximize, and unmaximize when you drag it away? That's been my most wanted feature in macOS since forever (yes I have tried the third party ones).

I’m in general pretty satisfied with the Finder keyboard navigation/editing. Especially with “enter” for rename, copy/paste/cut/move and deletion too… reply JoBrad 22 hours agorootparentI never understood the enter for rename shortcut. People open (or \"execute\", which is the general understanding of the action for the \"enter\" key) files far more than they rename them. reply jwells89 21 hours agorootparentIt makes sense if one considers the angle of how single-key shortcuts are much more disaster-prone. For example, if the user has a large number of files selected and accidentally triggers the open shortcut by hitting enter, their computer is going to be stuck spinning its wheels for a while (the more files involved and the heavier the applications they open in, the worse it'll be) unless they force restart. Involving a modifier key filters for intention pretty well, and so while this scenario is possible with ⌘O, it's far less likely. Most Mac shortcuts seem to follow this, with those that are single-key by default doing relatively harmless and easily reversible things. reply tivert 21 hours agorootparent> It makes sense if one considers the angle of how single-key shortcuts are much more disaster-prone. > ... > Most Mac shortcuts seem to follow this, with those that are single-key by default doing relatively harmless and easily reversible things. The enter-to-rename behavior has been in Mac OS since near the beginning, when versions were just named something like \"System N.M\"). IIRC, I've heard they had very detailed UI design documents back then, that explained their choices (e.g. I've heard they explained the reason for the menu bar being at the top of the screen rather than the top of a window was the cursor will just stop there, requiring less mousing precision). So if that's the case, there should be documents confirming or denying your speculation. reply int_19h 17 hours agorootparenthttp://interface.free.fr/Archives/Apple_HIGuidelines.pdf (you can compare to the current ones and similar docs for other platforms: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_guidelines) reply dkga 21 hours agorootparentprevThank you, now I finally understand why the difference between \"enter\" and cmd+O! reply Cockbrand 21 hours agorootparentprevThe Mac didn’t have a CLI in the first 16 years or so, so there’s no traditional “execute” meaning for the Enter key. I’d argue that the thought here was that by pressing that key, you’d want to enter a new name for the selected file. reply hoistbypetard 21 hours agorootparentThat's not a bad thought, but traditiona Mac keyboards didn't even have an \"enter\" key. (And nor do their current tenkeyless ones.) They just had a \"return\" key. The \"enter\" key only came around when the 10-key numpad was introduced, and it gave a different key code than the return key (which lives/lived where \"enter\" lives on PC keyboards). I don't recall whether \"enter\" renamed files, and I can't check whether it does at the moment because all my mac keyboards within reach are tenkeyless, but \"return\" always has. reply mrkstu 20 hours agorootparentJust checked- both 'enter' and 'return' active the rename action. reply setopt 12 hours agorootparentprevI don’t mind most of them, but the cut/move is IMO unusable. reply agys 11 hours agorootparentopt-cmd-v for move vs cmd-v for copy? Pretty usable imho! reply setopt 6 hours agorootparentIf it worked like that in other Mac apps, I wouldn’t mind. Then you would just adjust to “this is how MacOS does cut-and-paste” and after an initial adjustment it would make complete sense. But in every other Mac app, even in TextEdit, you would Cmd-X to cut a piece of text and Cmd-V to then paste it somewhere else. The same logic is used to e.g. move an image within a note or email, which is also a file. So Finder is simply inconsistent with the rest of the OS, and after 4 years as a Mac user I have just given up and use either drag-and-drop or a terminal when I need to move stuff. reply tpmoney 2 hours agorootparentThe finder probably chooses this paradigm because cut + paste is destructive. If you cut text and never paste it, the next time you copy out cut you lose that text forever. So if you used the same paradigm for files in the finder, you could accidentally and permanently delete a file because you cut it and then fat fingered copy instead of paste. If this happens with text from a file you can often just close the file and not save to get your text back, or hit undo because cut text is part of your undo history (usually). But storing whole files in some undo history seems like it could go wrong real quick since either you couldn’t actually delete the file from disk until the history expired or the finder was restarted, or an undo might take a significant amount of time because you moved between file systems. Or imagine if the destination file system crashed during transfer or unmounted after. Then you couldn’t undo at all. reply agys 4 hours agorootparentprevI think the issue is if you do cmd-x on a file and then don’t paste it will it be deleted…? cmd-c & cmd-opt-v is a different, “safer” operation. reply dur-randir 7 hours agorootparentprev- 'cos of backward logic compared to all other applications' move/copy logic - cmd+opt is a hell of a combination to type reply NetOpWibby 22 hours agorootparentprevYes, it is too much.

Im not sure where your expectation of changing this comes from. reply NetOpWibby 20 hours agorootparentWho said I expected macOS to change? I am not changing, so that's why I install an additional app. reply lathiat 17 hours agorootparentprevI use the \"Multitouch\" app from the same developer which integrates Rectangle with some other things. Trying out the new macOS version.. it's a little fiddly to activate sometimes didn't want to go. Then the margin/spacing between the edge of the screens was annoying. Though I discovered that there is an option under \"Desktop & Dock\" in settings you can turn off called \"Tiled windows have margins\". What I haven't figured out is if you can create a keyboard shortcut to tile left or right without using the mouse... so far have not figured out how to do that. Couldn't see an option for it. Those settings revealed another option though to \"Hold key while dragging windows to file\". If you hold that key you don't actually have to drag to the edge, just move it to the correct side of the monitor (or not really move it at all if it's already on that side). Interesting alternative. But I really often specifically use a keyboard shortcut for tile left, tile right or tile left third/middle third/right third (on a 35\" Ultrawide). reply touristtam 14 hours agorootparentI can't believe I have not had the curiosity to lookup the devs' other apps.

One caveat to this is if your application saves window sizes on close and you close with a full screen window and re-open, it won’t shrink again because the “original size” was full screen when the window was opened reply JoBrad 22 hours agorootparentSetting the \"Double-click a window's title bar\" action to Zoom just fills the vertical space. It doesn't adjust the width to fill available space, which is usually what I want. Finder, as an example, almost never sets the width to something usable. reply tpmoney 20 hours agorootparentTrue, it would be more accurate to say that what \"zoom\" is designed to do is expand the window as much as possible to display all the content, however the application defines that. For many applications, the result is a fully maximized window. On my MBA, Notes, Messages, Calendar, iTerm, Solvspace, and Mail all just fill the screen. For other applications that report specific content area to the OS that can mean something different. A finder window generally reshapes to show all the icons in icon view, or to maximize columns and names in list view. reply int_19h 11 hours agorootparentThe most annoying one is Safari, which arbitrarily decides on what the \"best\" window width is, even if the website could easily reflow to fit a wider window. reply drewolbrich 22 hours agorootparentprevI didn't know about this one, thank you for posting. Also, on most windows, you can option-click the green window bar button and get this same behavior.

According to Apple, that should have had happened once a week, so I gave a follow up feedback about definitely me not wanting to repeat this more than once.

Is it apple having a flap about recent DMA/Whatever regulations they don't like or is there an actual technical reason why what's probably a fancy version of VNC can't work without breaching European regulations? reply quitit 22 hours agorootparentThey haven't given a detailed reason, but pundits who have paid more attention to the DMA suggest that it's because the feature does not allow 3rd parties to offer the same integration. While the DMA's changes to the app store received the most publicity, the DMA mandates for modularity for any feature where a home-advantage could be granted by the gate keeper. Since features like AI and screen mirroring are already established markets with competitors, Apple offering these as built in functions could be interpreted as actions against the DMA unless they offer a way for others to tap into it via APIs. However this is just a guess. There is a cynical rhetoric that it's to punish the EU but this is a pretty flimsy idea since it's clear that Apple is relying on these new features to propel upgrades to M series macs and new iPhones. Currently there exists no tentpole feature for people in the EU to upgrade. The other reason is that it's pretty tenuous to think that the EU masses will rise up against the EC because they don't have screen mirroring or image playground. reply deergomoo 20 hours agorootparentThis is an interesting one because, to my knowledge, and unlike alternative App Stores etc on iOS, there’s surely nothing stopping an Android phone manufacturer from developing a Mac app to offer equivalent functionality? I’m unsure whether the DMA compels them to provide specific APIs beyond the ability to connect to arbitrary devices and draw to the screen, and it’s maybe a little bit concerning if it does. My understanding was that nothing in the DMA specifically compelled Apple to create e.g. MarketplaceKit, it’s just that the alternative would be to open up iOS far more than Apple is willing to do. reply cyberpunk 20 hours agorootparentI can install a whole number of AppStore or opensource apps that allow me to access other machines graphically. I really don't see why accessing the GUI on an iPhone should be treated any differently than accessing the GUI on a terminal server or an android or linux box or something.. The argument doesn't really make sense to me.. reply quitit 20 hours agorootparentprevWhile your guess is as good as mine. I can see that the screen sharing feature goes beyond what is currently possible with 3rd party mirroring tools, including apple's own earlier tools. For example right clicking brings up extensive contextual menus that aren't accessible in iOS, and I can see these also leverage the continuity features between the platforms. reply bri3d 22 hours agorootparentprevIt's DMA. Certainly part of it is punitive, but it makes sense, too - building and especially supporting interoperability for these protocols is a burden that they can avoid by not shipping features to the EU. They're free to change the key exchange, APIs, wire format, etc. without having to deal with documentation, key issuance, etc. outside of their walls. And, being forced to open up Screen Mirroring would reduce its value as a moat, since someone would presumably be able to build an Android client quickly and with no reverse engineering work. reply cyberpunk 20 hours agorootparentSo do I understand it correctly; the problem is not MacOS having a client app, the problem is iOS acting as the server with only apple approved client implementation? I really don't see how it falls outside of the DMA. reply threeseed 22 hours agorootparentprev> supporting interoperability for these protocols is a burden Also an unprecedented and unacceptable privacy and security risk. You would be allowing third parties the ability to continuously record your iPhone's screen. Which includes websites you browse, apps you open, health information, text messages etc. And the Mac is so much open that you could do this, have a local model to transcribe it and ship it to a remote server without the user noticing.

MacOS is not secure in the way you would like to think it's secure. This is already risk. And Apple really could do this right: make screen mirroring use the DRM playback paths, and open up the API to trigger it to competitors (who would get precisely the same DRM-playback-pathed result of a screen mirror showing up in a window from which they cannot read). I don't really know why a competitor would want to compete here, but they could. reply threeseed 22 hours agorootparentMost people interact with apps like Health on their phone not their Mac. And there are also many third party apps that never made Mac versions. So the amount of data we are talking about exposing is significantly higher. And the issue is that the DMA is ambiguous about what competition and interoperability specifically means and so it would just take one company to complain about your solution for Apple to be fined 10% of global revenue. reply Nextgrid 21 hours agorootparentMany people log into their Mac using the same credentials (Apple ID) that give access to the Health data, and in fact Apple makes it really hard or even impossible to use it without (you can't selectively grant access, you need to use a separate Apple ID but then you lose some useful features such as universal clipboard, etc). This is again a misinformed take. Your Mac can already get all your iPhone's data from the cloud where it is synced without viable opt-out or compartmentalization. reply threeseed 20 hours agorootparent> Your Mac can already get all your iPhone's data from the cloud Only if the data is available in iCloud and it is stored in files and it is not encrypted.

Health data is available in there, just to go after your example. iPhone backups are also available in there. At no point am I being asked anything else beyond my Apple ID, password, and two-step approval on another device (such as the Mac) to set up a new iPhone and download all my data. Thus the outcome is that the Mac indeed has everything it needs to get access to all your iCloud data. In fact, reverse-engineering how to get it directly is unnecessary work - instead, just reverse-engineer enough to capture the Apple ID password (or prompt to it - given there's still no way for the user to tell a real system dialog from one drawn by malware) and approve the 2FA prompt, get an actual, real iPhone and sign into the person's account and then extract all the data from there (via screenshots if necessary). reply amluto 18 hours agorootparentprevThere’s a universe in which your Mac is a locked down device like your iPhone, with a proper immutable filesystem, carefully controlled persistent state, and a strong sandbox in which the terminal, Homebrew, and apps (App Store and otherwise) can act within the sandbox but cannot do things like, say, reading your entire iMessage database.

They managed to reverse-engineer it, build a compatible client and clearly proved Apple's claims were BS (and no, this didn't lead to a mass-scale compromise of iMessage, contradicting fanboys' claims). If the feature allows to pull up the iPhone's screen without any user consent, then it is vulnerable to begin with - the reverse-engineering requirement would become an insignificant hurdle compared to the value of such a vulnerability. Presumably however, there will be a consent step, either on the spot or prior (maybe it can reuse the cryptographic pairing mechanism that happens when the phone asks you to \"trust this computer?\" the first time), and no third-party (whether using an approved API or reverse-engineered) would be able to bypass it without the user intentionally consenting. reply latexr 7 hours agorootparent> It is sad to see such a misinformed take on a technical forum.

No, they did not. We already knew Apple not allowing iMessage on Android was a lock-in choice.

It is borderline impossible for any ordinary developer. And people that bring up the \"just ask the user\" argument clearly don't remember how poorly that has worked in the past e.g. Microsoft Vista. Users will blindly approve any dialog which is why Apple has been so careful to limit them to targeted actions which a \"do you approve this app to record everything on your iPhone\" is not. reply Nextgrid 16 hours agorootparentYou're approaching this from the idea that the impenetrability by third-parties is the primary security feature. If this is true, then my worry isn't even about malicious attackers, it's my neighbor (with a real Mac) being able to (accidentally!) eavesdrop on my phone screen (since according to you this is the primary security measure). It's obviously ridiculous, and the primary security measure is that there must be a prior key exchange and consent step. If that part is secure, then it would be secure against a third-party. If that part is not secure, then no Secure Enclave-ing will help you, because worst case scenario, the attacker can just use a real Mac as part of his attack to pass the secure-enclave-protected authentication step, or just exploit the good old \"analog hole\" by using the real Mac as the main attack vector (and then just capture its HDMI output and feed in inputs via a USB-capable microcontroller simulating a keyboard). reply isodev 22 hours agorootparentprevApple doesn’t say.

That's literally all that's required from them. Actually they don't even need to - they can just promise not to sue anyone who reverse-engineers it and publishes a commercial client. That's how adversarial interoperability worked for decades (and gave free software the ability to interoperate with proprietary formats, see LibreOffice for example) before abusing the DMCA and/or threatening legal action to take down compatible implementations became common practice. I do not recall of any security breaches as a result of this. Apple are however not going to do that, because doing so would overnight destroy their moat around Universal Clipboard and all their existing interoperability features. So instead they make up some bullshit that non-technical governments and courts will take years to disprove, buying them more time to operate anti-competitively. It is however sad to see a member of a technical forum gobble up said bullshit. reply threeseed 19 hours agorootparentCan you articulate where in the DMA where it says that all Apple has to do \"is promise not to sue anyone\" to be in compliance. Or where it talks about protocol publication. Hint: it doesn't. reply Nextgrid 16 hours agorootparentThe DMA is about preventing gatekeepers from using arbitrary restrictions to prevent competition. It does not try to predict and anticipate every possible example nor solution. The existence of competitor would by itself be enough proof to the fact that Apple is not restricting competition. But for such a competitor to exist, they would require enough assurance that the business will be viable and they won't get sued out of existence. Apple either publishing the protocol or at the very least publishing an official licensing agreement allowing anyone to reverse-engineer and reimplement said protocol would achieve this. reply kaba0 22 hours agorootparentprevThen I guess you know better than all the hundreds of lawyers actively working out the issues on both Apple and EU sides.. reply isodev 22 hours agorootparentI know that Apple wants their cake and eat it too, looking for ways to wiggle out of this while still dodging their responsibilities. This is why they need years and a small army of lawyers. reply jwells89 22 hours agorootparentprevOnly speculation, but it might be to try to avoid having to support mirroring for Android devices too. reply samatman 22 hours agorootparentprevPretty simple really. The EU can't fine Apple for not doing business in EU countries, including not rolling out a feature. But if they do roll out a feature, EU has decided it can fine them 20% of global revenue if it isn't just how the EU wants it to be. Not doing so only costs Apple whatever marginal business they expect to lose in EU for not offering this or that feature. So I'd expect more of this going forward. reply Nextgrid 21 hours agorootparentIt's only a matter of time before the EU gets wise to this - this move is simply to delay the inevitable and buy themselves some more time to act anticompetitively. When they feel like the EU is closer to disproving their argument (because there is no technical reason this can't be opened to third-parties in a secure way), they will suddenly announce that they have found some magic and miraculous way to do it and release the feature, bringing them back into compliance. reply samatman 19 hours agorootparent> It's only a matter of time before the EU gets wise to this \"gets wise to this\" how, exactly? The EU can certainly set conditions which Apple must meet to ship a feature. They have no legal grounds whatsoever to demand that Apple ship that feature to Europe, specially modified to meet their exacting requirements. How would that even work? One way to comply with the EU's demands that a product work a certain way, is to not sell that product in the EU. Is your stance that EU has a right to force companies to sell their wares in the EU? reply Nextgrid 16 hours agorootparentGets wise that this is blatant malicious compliance, and use this to inform potential enforcement action and/or revisions to the regulation.

There are some rough edges, like needing to manually unlock your phone—unless you do what I did and rig up a complicated Tasker flow to automate the process. This update makes jumping over to the Apple ecosystem surprisingly tempting, since Continuity with mirroring sounds like a more polished version of Phone Link. I can't imagine giving up my ThinkPad, though. reply isodev 22 hours agorootparentprevBut that was already part of continuity or was it previously limited to user activities? It’s hilarious that Apple made such a big deal out of it and then failed to release it for everyone. reply jwells89 22 hours agorootparentNSUserActivity didn't forward notifications, it just provided a way to move whatever you were doing on your other Apple devices to the one you're currently using and only covered things that the dev specifically implemented. This works for all notifications from all apps. reply isodev 22 hours agorootparentOh interesting! Does it mean that the content of these forwarded notifications goest through Apple servers then? With no way for the source app to prevent it? reply jwells89 22 hours agorootparentI haven't picked it apart, but if it's like the other Continuity features it all takes place locally over bluetooth and ad-hoc wifi.

Cheers! a-ungurianu 6 hours agoI’d love a good summary on why Cursor, Void (and I assume other tools) decided to build new editors instead of just extending the incumbents (VSCode extension, Jetbrains plugins). Is there a technical limitation of the extension APIs or is it easier to “market” a new editor than an editor extension?

It manages to break my entire VScode environment, including vim hotkeys. reply boomskats 13 hours agoprevCongrats on getting it this far! The fun is just beginning, but it does sound like you have an idea of what you're getting into. Here are some thoughts: There are quite a few extensions and AI editors offering the snippet-like 'tab autocomplete', but Cursor are the only ones afaik who have nailed the full file no-look 'tab-tab-tab-tab autofix' workflow, with what I assume must be a combination of monaco/vscode hackery similar to what you're doing, and their own tuned model (i.e. not an off-the-shelf llm). Is this the piece you're going after when you say 'all of Cursor's core features', or are you primarily focused on something else? On the topic of extensions, as an occasional user of Cursor I noticed that they've always been able to quite happily 'import' extensions you've already downloaded to a local VSCode profile, which makes sense, but they've occasionally struggled to use the same marketplace APIs for searching for extensions. I'm not sure what you're hoping for here, but I'd suggest you settle for that approach as a starting point. Also be conscious that you're dealing with Microsoft, so be mindful of things like their brand guidelines[0], and avoid telling the world that you're 'hacking away' at their APIs. These things may seem insignificant and it's true that they probably won't cause you a problem unless you're successful. Lastly, assuming that you're hoping to recruit contributors (which I assume is some of the motivation behind this post): you really need to sanitise your Github workflow and your repo CI. Your commit history[1] currently seems to mostly consist of you updating your docs and committing straight to your main branch with no review process or checks, and the only commit I can see that does have any kind of check in place, your initial commit, has a failed monaco check that you seem to have subsequently just disabled. You'll need to tidy this up a _lot_ and establish a testing baseline if you want to successfully scale the project or attract the calibre of contributor you'll need to be successful. Hope that helps, best of luck with the project!

Just maintaining sync with upstream is a massive rod for your own back, and I don't see what you gain.

For me in the beginning one of the selling point is if I can bring my own key (ideally with GUI setup instead of some config file and working with OpenRouter key). Then if something is open source is also a selling point. I would recommend update double.bot landing page to have all features shown in few gifs on the same page and 'show in action' short video' - continue.dev had actually pretty good landing page. CodeSnap is probably something similar like cursors' 'apply' but double.bot landing page feels more like documentation. Also at this stage probably worth to add additional comparison to cursor same like you have for copilot reply giancarlostoro 4 hours agoprevI wish someone would fork Omnivim2 instead in order to better compete with VS Code. The editor looks like VS Code, but it is natively compiled and supports VS Code plugins is my understanding. Unfortunately the project seems abandoned. Its coded in ReasonML. I'm sick of dev tools being built around web browsers. We used to have fully native apps in the 90s and 00s that didn't require so much complexity compared to today.

There are mile long inheritance chains, everything is a class, and it is a giant bowl of spaghetti. To some extent, I understand why they used that development approach. It doesn't use a UI framework, just DOM APIs, so classes make sense in lieu of components, but it's still bonkers. > By the way, isn't OOP by far the most popular paradigm for building desktop UIs? Yes, but I wish it wasn't. My day job is desktop development (with Electron), and I avoid OOP as much as I can and try to use a functional approach. After jumping all over the VS Code codebase to try to understand how some of this stuff works, and seeing how hard it is to navigate, I think heavy OOP is a bad idea. reply k__ 5 hours agoparentprevAlways interesting to hear such claims when graphic editors like Penpot, which have much tighter perf requirements than editors, are so fast while using React. reply rovr138 5 hours agorootparentHow do you implement a text editor?

So I went a’hunting, and settled on the Codeium vscode plug-in free plan which while not as good as cursor/sonnet combination but is quite capable and their “free” models are capable enough for what I am working on (believe they even use a llama 3.1 model— I think they have various models, but left it on the “base model” and it’s been pretty good) reply nunobrito 11 hours agoprevPlus points if keeping the tool free for home/OSS users and then charge for corporate or on-premise deployments. One critical question to the users: Is Void able to understand the source code files from the project as a whole? What I mean is being able to read the project, and then make suggestions based on the code that was written and propose new functions? For example, I would see it as fantastic to write unit tests where I'd say: \"Please write a unit test that is verifying the functions on ABC.class\" or \"update the unit tests for ABC.class\". I know it is difficult for an LLM to create a valid result on the first try, but at least it does same me a lot of time creating a skeleton with most of the functions and samples already there. Most times just have to fine tune or fix a few parts but can say it amplifies my output speed by at least 10x to have that kind of functionality. What is your impression? Can it read all source code files on the project? reply jbkkd 6 hours agoprevWhy is there a waiting list if it's open source? reply prasoonds 13 hours agoprevThis is cool! I'm a regular user of Cursor (I barely write any code now - just prompt and tab tab tab). The thing that's really keeping me in Cursor (vs decamping for Zed) is NOT the Cmd K or the sidebar chat. It's actual Cursor's Tab autocomplete model. I've tried many other tab completion models and Cursor Tab blows them out of the water. Supermaven's new release is promising, however. For the use-case you're solving for (issues with code-privacy), I think something like https://codeium.com/ does already allow for on-prem deployments with enterprise support. I'm trying to think of who would be served well by a fork of VSCode vs Continue.dev or something like a codeium VPS deployment. reply thih9 13 hours agoparentCurious: what is your use case for cursor, i.e. what is the problem domain or complexity level (on a scale from boilerplate code to core architecture) that you typically work with? Also what plan are you on and is that enough for your needs? reply prasoonds 11 hours agorootparentHi, we're working with an large typescript codebase and I develop fully fledged features with Cursor which involve non-trivial UI wiring up work. Decent amount of state management using React too. It's definitely not boilerplate level code - but it also also stops well short of architecture level work. Here's a recent prompt of me trying to implement line-by-line diff generation: https://pastebin.com/WRJpNwqc When I need to do architectural/design work, I do it in multiple passes, not generating any code, just lots detailed text with tons of feedback/back-and-forth with the model.

Then, I revert to using Sonnet 3.5 via API key. reply boomskats 13 hours agoparentprevBig fan of Codeium here. They're the only player who took vim/neovim users seriously from the start, and it's great to see people building extensions like monkoose/neocodeium.

    "originBody": "NEWS California jewelry business sues Indiana over cash seized at FedEx facility Ryan Murphy Indianapolis Star In April, police inspectors at the Indianapolis FedEx distribution center seized a box containing nearly $43,000 in cash. Even though no criminal charges have been filed in connection with the package, it’s been in the government’s possession for about four months. Now, the box’s intended recipient, Henry Minh Inc., is pursuing a class action lawsuit against the state of Indiana. The jewelry wholesale business consists of the husband-and-wife duo Henry and Minh Cheng. Working with the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit focused on civil liberties, Henry Minh alleges a widespread pattern of unlawful package seizures at Indy’s FedEx processing facility. In court documents, the Marion County prosecutor’s office wrote that shipments of bulk cash are typically associated with criminal activity. Even though Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department dogs alerted handlers to the smell of drugs in the box, no contraband could be found once it was opened. A Virginia client sent the Chengs the box of cash in exchange for gold chains, according to an itemized receipt included in the lawsuit. Henry Minh’s box was one of 130 cash parcels seized by the government from the FedEx facility in the last year, according to the lawsuit. The government took the box through a process called civil forfeiture. The practice allows law enforcement to confiscate property from people suspected of criminal activity, even if they haven’t been charged with an offense. If the court does not return the box to the Chengs, the prosecutor’s office will be required by statute to disburse the money into attorneys' fees, law enforcement and school funds. The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office has filed forfeiture cases for more than $2.5 million since 2022, according to the Henry Minh lawsuit. “It’s so far removed from a law enforcement function. It’s simply profiteering,” said Marie Miller, the IJ attorney representing Henry Minh Inc. The Indianapolis facility is the second-largest FedEx processing center in the country. It can sort up to 99,000 packages per hour. Many packages traveling from coast to coast – like the Chengs’ – go through the Indy hub at some point on their journey, even if they aren’t being sent from or to Indiana. The Marion County prosecutor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Representatives for FedEx declined to comment on the case, citing that they are not a named party in the lawsuit. “I think it’s unfair, and it just shouldn’t happen in America,” said Henry Cheng in a Monday news conference. The case’s next hearing is scheduled for Sept. 16, where the judge will rule whether the case can proceed as a class-action suit.",

Two conditions contained decoy scents (food/toy) to encourage dog interest in a false location (dog influence). Conditions were (1) control; (2) paper marker; (3) decoy scent; and (4) paper marker at decoy scent. No conditions contained drug or explosive scent; any alerting response was incorrect. A repeated measures analysis of variance was used with search condition as the independent variable and number of alerts as the dependent variable. Additional nonparametric tests compared human and dog influence. There were 225 incorrect responses, with no differences in mean responses across conditions\" \"To test this, we influenced handler beliefs and evaluated subsequent handler/dog team performance according to handler-identified alerts.

Think about that. The charade actually went on so long that some people would have lived their entire adult life, their entire career lying their asses off. It was later found that at least 90% of cases contained errors. During this time someone could have similarly proved that it wasn't so because were it so surely someone could have challenged it. An alternative explanation is that forensic science or indeed any sort of science as practiced by law enforcement has always been a joke and the bar to do something about it is always very very high. The cost of challenging anything is often prohibitively expensive both in terms of legal costs and in risk of drawing a sentence several times worse than a plea and any case which might result in police losing a valuable tool can be mooted by simply dropping that particular case after that high bar is met. Remember also that the prosecution and the judge aren't scientists but ARE colleagues. Perceptively evidence from dogs are brought only when they actually find something so even if they don't provably always \"work\" in the scientific sense they perceptively help them nail bad guys. The idea that the judge would be liable to remove that useful tool because it didn't pass scientific muster is both optimistic and naive. https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-testimony-on-mic... reply more_corn 15 hours agorootparentprevAll contraband dogs are trained to alert on cash. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 13 hours agorootparentBut…nearly everyone carries or handles some amount of cash.

The deodand required the forfeiture of any object responsible for a death—say, a knife, cart, or horse—to the Crown. Today, the idea seems much the same even if the practice now sweeps more broadly, requiring almost any object involved in almost any serious offense to be surrendered to the government in amends. The hardships deodands often imposed seem more than faintly familiar, too. Deodands required forfeiture regardless of the fault of the owner, himself sometimes the deceased. Not infrequently, the practice left impoverished families without the means to support themselves, faced not only with the loss of a loved one but also with the loss of a horse or perhaps a cart essential to their livelihoods. Sometimes grieving families could persuade authorities or juries to forgo a deodand, but often not, and generally the burden to avoid a deodand was on them. As time went on, too, curiously familiar financial incentives wormed their way into the system. Originally, the Crown was supposed to pass the deodand (literally, a thing given to God) onto the church 'as an expiation for the sou[l]' of the deceased. Over time, though, the Crown increasingly chose instead to sell off its rights to deodands to local lords and others. These recipients inevitably wound up with a strong interest in the perpetuation of the enterprise. Ultimately, the deodand’s appeal faded in England, and this Court has held that it 'did not become part of the common-law tradition of this country.' But has something not wholly unlike it gradually reemerged in our own lifetimes?

We'll assume for a second this was purely state to state (ie no customs involved) since that seems to be the case. Even then, they generally don't get involved unless a package smells funny, is leaking, or making noise. But if it does, it may get opened or dog sniffed or inspected (fedex itself generally does not open packages, they would set them aside. Chain of custody and all that. While they probably reserve the right to open whatever, the in-practice exceptions mostly about trying to find a receiver when the label/other identifying info is destroyed somehow.). There are also some amount of random checks. But to put this in perspective (and again, i think civil forfeiture is nutso), thi is is a fedex site that processes about 100k packages an hour.

Stephen told the officer that his life savings was in the trunk. Another group of officers arrived, and Stephen gave them permission to search his car. They found a backpack with Stephen’s money, just where he said it would be, along with receipts showing all his bank withdrawals. After a debate amongst the officers, which was recorded on body camera footage, they decided to seize his life savings. Well they must really believe they have a strong case then, right? >...So Stephen teamed up with the Institute for Justice to get his money back. It was only after IJ brought a lawsuit against the DEA to return Stephen’s money, and his story garnered national press attention, that the federal government agreed to return his money.

Since they can say ‘Your honor, the prosecution can not identify any articulable factual basis, or even concrete suspicion as to why they should have seized my clients money. The money my client just withdrew from the bank that he earned lawfully, paid taxes on, was held in a regulated institution, and that he intended to use for lawful purposes. In fact, as is clear from opposing councils arguments, they not only didn’t even attempt to investigate to discover if a lawful basis existed to seize my clients funds, they actively ignored documentation that my client attempted to provide them showing the funds were from a legal source. Additionally, it’s clear they have since been unable to identify any lawful reason besides a generic ‘my training and experience says this was okay’, and in fact are not even able to identify which parts of their training and experience support it, even with x months of time. This is in violation of the federal rules around these seizures (cut and paste the sections), and their own policies (cut-n-paste from their policy book). Additionally, that they persist in not only defending these tactics, but continuing to keep my law abiding clients funds, shows a complete and continuing disregard for the law, my clients rights as a law abiding citizen of this great nation, their own policies, and the integrity of this court. ’ If they still persisted (historically they haven’t, even in far more ambiguous cases), I can’t imagine a judge being unsympathetic to punitive damages (3x) on top of everything else.

If property is confiscated as part of punishment for a crime (e.g. places that make you forfeit your car if you get a DUI), then it is subject to the 8th amendment. 2. If the property itself is suspected of being a criminal tool (e.g. money earned illegally), then it is not. 3. Since in #2, it is a civil case against property (rather than a criminal case against a person), the property has no right to an attorney, and the burden of proof is merely \"preponderance of the evidence\" (i.e. neither side is privileged for evidence). There are also other more lenient due-process rules compared to a criminal case. So, for example, in a criminal case if the government's entire case is \"this looks suspicious\" then the defense can be \"you haven't proved anything\" but in a civil case, the defense would have to offer enough evidence to outweigh the suspicion. And since there is no right to representation, the defendant has to find and pay for their own lawyer. reply kergonath 12 hours agorootparentThat is ridiculous.

Once again, I’m not sure where you’re from, but here in America, we’re innocent until proven guilty, and that’s a pretty big deal. Also, the burden of proof is on law enforcement to prove that a citizen is guilty of a crime, not on the citizen to prove that they’re innocent. Legally, it’s entirely irrelevant that you or anyone in law enforcement believe it to be strange that someone is either carrying large amounts of cash or sending cash via mail—it’s perfectly legal behavior. My grandma has never ever put a single dollar in the bank, because she doesn’t trust them. I don’t have her experience, but she should be able to do as she pleases with her cash without law enforcement treating her as a criminal just so they can steal her money.

It is a violation of the shipping agreement. the declared value coverage does not cover cash or cash equivalents. If you have more questions regarding acceptance standards it is recommended that you visit a FedEx Express Ship Station ( where your local packages are sorted) and ask to speak to a “Senior Customer Service Associate” this person is a senior FedEx agent and can walk you through the finer points of more difficult to understand shipping scenarios. reply Danjoe4 15 hours agoparentThen FedEx is more than welcome to refuse shipping those packages, blacklist the sender, or sue them. On what grounds exactly does LE get involved. reply rtpg 15 hours agorootparentI do not believe the civil forfeiture flow as is, is correct. And beyond that, having LE even know about the money... I don't know how that works. Having said all that, sending cash through the mail just feels like a really obvious money laundering vector. You might claim that there's no distinction between that and, say, handing over a bunch of cash directly to a person, but in the world of money laundering each extra layer makes the operation safer! I don't think that from this it follows that we should be opening envelopes all over, but there's a universe where the seller of jewelry is very aware that they are taken illicit cash, and in a a more just universe there's some sort of warrant. I do not know how to square the privacy question with this, but I do like the idea of money laundering not being trivially doable. reply big-green-man 15 hours agorootparentI know how to square the privacy question with this, and you do too. Money laundering is trivial regardless. reply rtpg 14 hours agorootparentTo be clear, what I meant by \"this\" here was something like... imagine that law enforcement has pretty good \"proof\" that there are these transactions going on for money laundering purposes. What universe of facts gives law enforcement the right to seize a package en route? Is every package in FedEx equivalent to a diplomatic pouch? Can LE do it if they have testimony to the effect of \"money is in this box\"? Do they require more proof? Do they need to just grab people when it gets picked up by the guy? This cash thing is messy enough, but the drug sniffing dogs at the FedEx distribution center is obviously _something_. Even if the dog was consistently finding drugs in packages (and not being an excuse to open a package), is that OK? Is that not? What if LE is X-Ray'ing packages for \"safety\" reasons, do they get carte blanche to search the package there? You might be surprised how I'd land on most of these, I think privacy is pretty important and blanket searches are pretty BS! I kinda think drug sniffing dogs are bad! Just holistically speaking, you'd probably find that \"drug sniffing dogs should not be allowed at airports and FedEx shipping centers\" would be extremely unpopular and also not an easy point to argue as a consequence of some fundamental constitutional rights. And then the dogs are there, so now the cops have a skeleton key. Context matters I guess. reply big-green-man 13 hours agorootparentSo, at least in the US, the 4th amendment says that we are protected from search and seizure unless there is reasonable suspicion by way of probable cause that we have committed a crime, and then, the things to be searched and seized must be clearly identified beforehand. That sounds like a pretty reasonable standard to me. That would mean, essentially, that they could not do anything at all with your packages unless they already have a reason to suspect you of a crime, and that even then, they have to have a reason to believe that a particular package is involved in said crime and even say beforehand what they expect to find in it. Now, on to the specific scenario at hand. You might argue that that is too stringent, that no crime can ever be proven under that framework, and you may say it shouldn't preclude x rays and drug dogs and what not, I might even agree with you. But that as well as any other reasonable concept of justly handling suspicion precludes randomly opening peoples packages and keeping money by construing the simple presence of money as evidence that a crime maybe was committed and they get to keep it whether there was or wasn't a crime there. Even by the most lax framework of how to handle suspicion and searching property that is outrageous. reply rtpg 13 hours agorootparentIn this specific case, a drug sniffing dog was used to open the box. This isn't abstract, but a concrete thing that has happened, going down one of your hypotheticals. To be clear, I'm against what has happened in this case! But I think you'll find plenty of judges who will sign off on the idea that sending $43k through FedEx in cash to buy jewelry is plenty suspicious. Way more than a broken tail light. You might say \"how did they know it was for a jewelry purchase\", but now you're arguing that looking at the destination of the package is a search. Given how courts have treated probably cause in general, you're looking at an uphill argument. The nefarious thing here of course is that its seized so now the sender theoretically needs to come forward and prove the contrary, somehow. So much for presumption of innocence! There is an abstract argument to be made based on what the constitution says, but if everyone in power agrees that something means what it means (despite that not agreeing with... well, the actual meaning of the words), you kind of have to argue in that framework. And while civil forefeiture as a whole feels like a pretty big and juicy target for some argument, this very focused case doesn't fall apart that easily IMO. If you are buying into reasonable suspicion as a means for law enforcement to do things, and you have the dogs, I don't know how you avoid that leading to \"the money in the envelope here is seizable\". This case is way less sympathetic than the usual \"someone gets pulled over with cash in their car and it gets seized\". reply big-green-man 3 hours agorootparentA search warrant has to specify exactly what is expected to be found and exactly where. If the police get a warrant to search your place because they believe you're manufacturing LSD and they find a dead body, that body cannot be used as evidence in prosecution. So a drug sniffing dog alert being justification for a search, presumably they'd expect to find drugs upon opening the package. I think the same thing would apply here, they thought they found drugs, they didn't find drugs, so they can't do anything, let alone seize the property. reply komali2 15 hours agorootparentprev> Having said all that, sending cash through the mail just feels like a really obvious money laundering vector. This is a classic America debate - just because criminals do it doesn't mean the State should punish everyone else that does it. America is full of weirdos that want to do weird things and be left alone to do it without State interference. Since 2001 I feel like the \"if you have nothing to hide...\" argument has been given WAY too much credence. Feels like the American zeitgeist is turning against characters like Hunter S. or George Carlin and I feel like we used to celebrate this sort of gonzo, leave-me-the-fuck-alone ideology instead. reply rtpg 14 hours agorootparentFlattening what I said to \"if you have nothing to hide\" is really dismissive. I believe you have the right to privacy! I believe that searches should have warrants associated to them! The fact that a \"drug sniffing dog\" was how this package was opened feels like enough to just throw this out! I do think there is a universe where this happened through a warrant, and that the warrant wasn't given out glibly, and where the seizure probably makes a hell of a lot of sense. Context-free discussions on this are annoying because at one point the _extremely crucial distinction_ of judicial oversight through a warrant just gets completely lost despite it being _the load-bearing component_ to \"not without a warrant\"! reply komali2 14 hours agorootparentRight but we're having discourse right now and discourse contributes to the zeitgeist. Whether intentional or otherwise I interpret your comment on the side of blaming the victim - \"well... it WAS suspicious what they were doing.\" That language is being used to justify all sorts of unethical behavior by the police, often flagrantly unconstitutional, usually at minimum illegal, and almost always the times it's not obviously illegal, it should be (the laws should be changed). I don't know if it's from lack of regular interaction from the police but I find a lot of people online are under the mistaken impression that the constitution or law is guarding the rights of people in the USA. Cops get away with violating the constitution and breaking the law multiple times every day - sometimes in ways the supreme court has allowed, such as by lying to you, or tricking you into thinking you have to voluntarily give up your rights. Combine that with a completely overwhelmed court system that leads to something like 90% of people taking plea deals, and the absurd concept of \"mandated minimums\" and sentencing requirements that judges blindly follow, and you've got a legal system that's nothing like what people represent online.

Here, they are claiming it because a dog \"alerted\" on the package, so they then claim it's related to criminal activity. regardless of whether they find actual drugs in it. This part: \"Even though Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department dogs alerted handlers to the smell of drugs in the box, no contraband could be found once it was opened.\" The first part is why they were involved and allowed to seize it. The second is mostly irrelevant, legally (whether it should be or not). You don't have to prove it contained drugs to prove it was proceeds of a crime or otherwise part of criminal activity. This part is actually right, whether it gets used in an insane fashion or not. This is civil and not criminal, so the standard is not \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\". They file a suit against the money itself. It ends up with a funny case title like \"United States v. An Article Consisting of 50,000 Cardboard Boxes More or Less, Each Containing One Pair of Clacker Balls,\" or \"United States v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins\" (both real, but federal seizures. If a state seizes it, it's like State of Indiana v., and often less funny) Even if the person is not charged with a crime, if they successfully argue the money itself is criminal proceeds or was involved in criminal activity, they can confiscate it. So, it's not sending cash that enables them to seize it. It's whether the money is used in criminal activity. The thing that enables them to be involved is that the dog alerted to it. Now, for as much bullshit as exists in dog alerts, in this case, fedex often goes through about 100k packages an hour in this site, and they have seized 100 of them in the past year.

Surely the dog (and handler) aren't just standing there all year waiting to hit on a package.. reply DannyBee 14 hours agorootparentDoubtful - for the simple reason that fedex has cameras everywhere, and unlike the police and bodycam footage, they have no dog in this fight, so they aren't going to mysteriously lose the footage. So my guess - they set aside the very small percent of very funny smelling or leaking or ... packages (since lots of packages never see human hands, it would be a very small percent anyway) and then the police dogs sniff them. If i remember, i'll see if i can find some earlier docketed cases and see if they describe whether they have police there all the time or not. I honestly would not be shocked. I live near a mcmaster carr warehouse that is about a million square feet (one of their larger ones), and they have local k-9 police out front 24/7 just sitting in their car near the entrance to the facility (AFAICT - they have been there every time i have ever done will-call, and when i asked the guy, he said they were there 24/7) It would not surprise me that fedex's indy hub (which is 2.4 million square feet, and more important than this mcmaster carr warehouse) had local police k-9 units around 24/7. Last but definitely not least, the indy hub is, IIRC, at the indianapolis airport. In that case, there would definitely be k-9 units and local police just hanging around. reply internet101010 13 hours agorootparentNot to be that guy but all packages are touched by human hands.

And SCOTUS these days also tends to equate cash as a form of political speech.

    "commentBody": "Intel lost the Sony Playstation business to AMD (reuters.com)260 points by arcanus 22 hours agohidepastfavorite171 comments Danieru 20 hours agoNo one appears to have mentioned the important meta game going on: Intel bidding as a credible alternative supplier. For Intel, by bidding they get to undercut AMD's profits. For Sony, they get a credible alternative which they can pretend would be a viable choice. Thus forcing a slightly better deal from AMD. We saw similar articles related to the Switch 2. That time it was AMD acting as spoiler to Nvidia. Nvidia reportedly got the contract. That time too we got news articles lamenting this loss for AMD. As a gamedev I have a different perspective: Sony and Nintendo would be fools to give up backwards compatibility just for savings on chips. Switching vendors does not just invalidate old games compatibility, it also requires retooling for their internal libraries. Console games, outside small or open source engines, use proprietary graphics api. Those apis are tied to the hardware. With this coming generation from Nintendo, and the \"current gen\" from Sony and Xbox they've been able to mostly reuse much of their software investment. I'd case more but this is obviously nda, other devs should be able to confirm. Thus I don't think AMD for switch2 or Intel for ps6 was ever a credible path. Their bids existed to keep the existing vendor from getting overly greedy and ruining the parade for everyone. This is important, famously the original Xbox got hamstrung in the market by Nvidia's greed and refusal to lower prices as costs went down. reply senkora 19 hours agoparent+1. An important non-obvious detail for AMD is that they (at least in the past, I assume for this as well) have kept the instruction timings similar from generation to generation of consoles. Different x86 micro-architectures benefit from writing the machine code in slightly different ways. Games are highly optimized to the specific micro-architecture of the console, so keeping that stable helps game developers optimize for the console. If you suddenly changed the micro-architecture (if switching to Intel), then old games could suddenly become janky and slow even though both systems are x86. (This would only matter if you were pushing performance to the edge, which is why it rarely matters for general software development, but console game dev pushes to the edge) So it isn't just the graphics APIs that would change going from AMD to Intel, but the CPU performance as well. reply deaddodo 19 hours agorootparent> Different x86 micro-architectures benefit from writing the machine code in slightly different ways. Games are highly optimized to the specific micro-architecture of the console, so keeping that stable helps game developers optimize for the console. While that can be true, very few gamedev companies these days optimize to that degree. They almost all use off-the-shelf middleware and game engines that are built to support all of the platforms. The companies that do go through that effort tend to have very notable releases. Nobody is hand-tuning Assembler code these days to fit into tight instruction windows. At least, not outside of some very specific logic fragments. Instead they're all writing generic interrupt-based logic. Which is fine, as that's what the newer CPUs expect and optimize for internally. In addition, the difference in the Zen generation gap is as different as switching to Intel. We're talking fairly different cache coherency, memory hierarchies, CCX methodologies, micro-op and instruction timings, iGPU configurations, etc. That all being said, AMD was going to beat Intel regardless because of established business relationships and their current internal struggles (both business-wise and R&D) making it fairly difficult for them to provide an equivalent alternative. reply soganess 15 hours agorootparentAsking this as an open ended (if leading) question: I assume enough people are doing it otherwise PS5 Pro makes no sense... Right? They (AMD/Sony) shoehorned the RDNA 3/3.5 GPU architecture onto an older Zen 2 core, with a different process node, because... they felt like making a frankenAPU? Especially since the APUs are usually monolithic (vs chiplet) in design and share a memory controller. Surely it would have been easier/cheaper to put in 8 zen 4c/5c cores and call it a day. I'm pretty sure I'm just missing something obvious... reply wmf 14 hours agorootparentFor PlayStation APUs, it's likely that AMD presents a menu of options and Sony chooses which components they want. For PS5 Pro, the CPU is unchanged from PS5 because Sony doesn't feel the need for anything faster. A newer CPU would take more area. But Sony really wanted better raytracing and AI so they chose RDNA 3.9 or whatever for the GPU. I suspect the cores are all mostly synthesized so they can support any process and Infinity Fabric is compatible enough that you can mix and match new and old cores. reply pjmlp 1 hour agorootparentprevPS5 Pro makes no sense, yes. Most studios aren't even able to push current PS 5 to its limit, given current development schedules and budgets. PS 5 Pro is for the same target audience as PS 4 Pro, hardcode console fans that will buy whatever the console vendor puts out, and Sony needs to improve their margins. reply MichaelZuo 17 hours agorootparentprevHow would you explain cross PS5/PC releases being much more efficient on the PS5? e.g. Horizon Forbidden West needing a much better GPU on PC to run at the same level of fidelity as the PS5. If not for special tuning specific to the PS5’s differences. (I can imagine Windows bloat and other junk requiring an additional 10% to 20%, but not 30% to 50%.) reply jitl 17 hours agorootparentThe comment above is elaborating on x86 micro-architecture, the differences between how the CPU handles x86 instructions specifically. The overall system architecture is different between PC, which has discrete memory systems for the CPU and GPU, and a very long pathway between GPU memory and system/CPU memory, versus today's consoles which have unified memory for CPU+GPU, and optimized pathways for loading from persistent storage too. Consolesuse their own graphics APIs, but you would have any vendor you contract with for graphics support your native graphics API and everything would be \"fine\". PS5 games use GNM/GNMX Playstation proprietary graphics APIs. Usually PC ports of console native games re-implement the rendering engine using the PC graphics APIs like DirectX or Vulkan.

Denuvo and other heavy anti-piracy tools are also sometimes used for releases on PCs which can seriously impact performance. reply yangff 16 hours agorootparentprevHorizon Forbidden West was ported from PS to PC. Decima is an engine from Sony’s first-party studio, so it's understandable that their development process would lean more towards PS's internal architecture rather than the more common GPUs on the market. Of course, even general-purpose engines can perform better on PS5, AMD, or NV. But, for these engines, they have less information about how customers will use the engines, so there's less infomation can be used to optimize. On the other side, customers using these engines often don’t have enough experience optimizing sufficiently for each platform. None of this is absolute, but I think this logic is reasonable. For game developers using these engines, if they take optimization seriously, they typically make adjustments to lighting, LOD, loading, and model details or shaders on console platforms to achieve a similar visual effect while meeting the targeted performance goals. This is why you usually get better performance on a console at the same price point compared to a PC, aside from the subsidies provided by Sony. reply tacticus 13 hours agorootparentprev> Horizon Forbidden West needing a much better GPU on PC to run at the same level of fidelity as the PS5. not being expected to run with variable refresh rate\\interleaving and accepting 30\\60 fps in best case situations? reply deaddodo 16 hours agorootparentprev> They almost all use off-the-shelf middleware and game engines that are built to support all of the platforms.

What? The Jaguar-based CPU in the PS4 has both a much lower clock and substantially lower IPC than the Zen 2 based one in the PS5. The timings are not remotely the same and the micro-architectures are quite different. Jaguar was an evolution of the Bobcat core which was AMD's answer to the Intel Atom at the time (i.e. low cost and low-power, though it was at least an out-of-order core unlike contemporary Atoms). Going from GCN to RDNA on the GPU side is also a pretty significant architectural change, though definitely much less than the going from AMD to Intel would be. reply senkora 18 hours agorootparentI did some more research and I was wrong. My source was an AMD tech talk from years ago where they mentioned keeping instruction timings the same for backwards compatibility reasons. I believe they were talking about this for the XBox One X: https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/microsoft/scorpio_engine#Overvi... (and a similar chip for the PS4 Pro) So basically, they upgraded and lightly enhanced the Jaguar architecture, shrunk the process (28nm -> 16nm), but otherwise kept it the same. AMD Zen was released around this time and was far superior but they decided to stick with Jaguar in order to make sure that instruction timings were kept the same. I guess that they didn't want two hardware revisions of the same console generation running on different micro-architectures, but they were okay switching the micro-architecture for the next console generation. reply lxgr 16 hours agorootparentprevGiven the size of such a contract, wouldn't it be reasonable for Sony to just request equal or better instruction latency for everything relevant from the old CPU? reply jheriko 19 hours agorootparentprevyou clearly haven't played a modern game :P cpu timings taken care around by developers is 10-15 years out of date. most of them these days dont even know what a dot product is, how to find the distance to a point or a straight line in-between two... and the people they rely on to do this for them make horrendous meals of it. but yeah, sure, cpu instruction timings matter. reply DaoVeles 18 hours agorootparentI was about to say.

When the X1/Ps4 came in, it was completely abandoned, turns out x86 compilers combined with OoO execution just made that kind of tinkering not only nearly pointless but sometime actually hurt performance. Nowadays,I suspect it is almost entirely in the hands of the compilers, the API's and the base OS to figure out the gritty details. reply xgkickt 15 hours agorootparentThere are still manual optimizations that can be done (non-temporal writes where appropriate for example), but nothing like the painstaking removal of Load-Hit-Stores and cache control of the 360/PS3 era. reply Meganet 6 hours agorootparentprevThe new chip will be relevant faster.

But would they really? Staying on x86-64 would take care of CPU compatibility (unless there's some exotic AMD-only instruction set extension heavily used by PS4/5 games), and a GPU emulation stack seems at least somewhat plausible. Sony has pulled this off multiple times before with seemingly completely incompatible architectures: The PS2 came with the PS1 CPU (repurposed as an IO controller, but fully available for previous-gen games) and emulated the GPU on its own. The PS3 did the reverse in its second iteration (i.e. it included the PS2's GPU and emulated the CPU). The PS Vita's SoC had the PSP MIPS CPU included on-die, which in turn is similar enough to the PS1's to allow running those games too. reply DSMan195276 12 hours agorootparentFor GPU emulation, I'm not super knowledgeable but I would think the shaders are a big issue, older systems don't have that problem. Console games come with precompiled shaders and you won't be able to reuse those between AMD vs. Nvidia. Certainly you can get around it, emulators for modern Console do just that, but it's not without it's issues which might be considered unacceptable. That's still fixable if you're willing to ship newly compiled shaders and such, but that's a lot more work if you're talking about needing some kind of per-game fix to be downloaded. This is how the XBox 360 \"Backwards-compatibility\" works, and this approach means it only works with a subset of XBox 360 games, not all of them. It's much better than nothing, but it's not a hardware-level fix that makes the original game binaries \"just work\". For packaging the old GPU with the new system, I think that's not really realistic anymore since prices for them simply don't drop enough and the system design would be a mess (the chips are huge and you'd need cooling for both chips. I guess if only one is running at a time then it's not as bad, but...). Separately, if you're swapping from Nvidia to AMD then you're talking about trying to convince one of them to make a batch of old chips for you while you use their competitor's chip as the the main one, they might not be willing to do it. reply lxgr 4 hours agorootparentWould it not be possible to recompile all shaders at startup (or \"install\", i.e. first launch) time and then cache them (if runtime recompilation is even too slow in the first place)? reply jm4 19 hours agoparentprevThe whole article seems unfair to Intel.

This is a red herring. The hardware is x86-64, and all the game engines are made on x86-64, and all the games are compiled on, you guess it, x86-64. That's why they stopped using PowerPC, or Motorola, or other non-x86 architectures. To simplify backwards compatibility, and actually get comparable value to a decent performing system. So when they tell you there is a cost overhead associated with switching vendors, that is BS. However long it takes to port your desktop driver package is how long it would take to get all of this working on different hardware.

So, AMD is clearly not the only choice. reply mdasen 20 hours agorootparentThe problem with choosing Nvidia is that they can't make an x86 processor with an integrated GPU. If you're looking to maintain backward compatibility with the Playstation 5, you're probably going to want to stick with an x86 chip. AMD has the rights to make x86 chips and it has the graphics chips to integrate. Nvidia has graphics chips, but it doesn't have the CPUs. Yes, Nvidia can make ARM CPUs, but they haven't been putting out amazing custom cores. AMD can simply repackage some Zen X cores with RDNA X GPU and with a little work have something Sony can use. Nvidia would need to either grab off-the-shelf ARM Cortex cores (like most of their ARM CPUs use) or Sony would need to bet that Nvidia could and would give them leading-edge performance on custom designed cores. But would Nvidia come in at a price that Sony would pay? Probably not. AMD's costs are probably a lot lower since they're going to be doing all that CPU work anyway for the rest of their business. For Nintendo, the calculus is a bit different. Nintendo is fine with off-the-shelf cores that are less powerful than smartphones and they're already on ARM so there's no backward incompatibility there. But for Sony whose business is different, it'd be a huge gamble. reply coder543 20 hours agorootparentI think changing from AMD GPUs to Nvidia GPUs by itself has a good chance of breaking backwards compatibility with how low level and custom Sony's GPU API apparently is, so the CPU core architecture would just be a secondary concern. I was not saying Sony should switch to Nvidia, just pointing out that it is objectively incorrect to say that AMD is the only option for consoles when the most popular console today does not rely on AMD. I also fully believe Intel could scale up an integrated Battlemage to meet Sony's needs, but is it worth the break in compatibility? Is it worth the added risk when Intel's 13th and 14th gen CPUs have had such publicly documented stability issues? I believe the answer to both questions is \"probably not.\" reply kmeisthax 18 hours agorootparentprevEmulating x86 would be an option - though given Sony's history, I doubt they'd consider it seriously. For context... - PS1 BC on PS2 was mostly hardware but they (AFAIK?) had to write some code to translate PS1 GPU commands to the PS2 GS. That's why you could forcibly enable bilinear filtering on PS1 games. Later on they got rid of the PS1 CPU / \"IO processor\" and replaced it with a PPC chip (\"Deckard\") running a MIPS emulator. - PS1 BC on PS3 was entirely software; though the Deckard PS2s make this not entirely unprecedented. Sony had already written POPS for PS1 downloads on PS2 BBN[0] and PSP's PS1 Classics, so they knew how to emulate a PS1. - PS2 BC on PS3 was a nightmare. Originally it was all hardware[1], but then they dropped the EE+GS combo chip and went to GPU emulation, then they dropped the PS2 CPU entirely and all backwards compatibility with it. Then they actually wrote a PS2 emulator anyway, which is part of the firmware, but only allowed to be used with PS2 Classics and not as BC. I guess they consider the purchase price of the games on the shop to also pay for the emulator? - No BC was attempted on PS4 at all, AFAIK. PS3 is a weird basketcase of an architecture, but even PS1 or PS2 aren't BC supported. At some point Sony gave up on software emulation and decided it's only worth it for retro re-releases where they can carefully control what games run on the emulator and, more importantly, charge you for each re-release. At least the PS4 versions will still play on a PS5... and PS6... right?

To be fair, IMO that was only 80-90% of a money grab; \"you can now run old physical PS2 games, but only these 30% of our catalog\" being a weird selling point was probably also a consideration. > Sony had already written POPS for PS1 downloads on PS2 BBN[0] and PSP's PS1 Classics, so they knew how to emulate a PS1. POPS on the PSP runs large parts of the code directly on the R4000 without translation/interpretation, right? I'd call this one closer to what they did for PS1 games on the (early/non-Deckard) PS2s. reply MadnessASAP 17 hours agorootparentprev> No BC was attempted on PS4 at all, AFAIK. PS3 is a weird basketcase of an architecture, but even PS1 or PS2 aren't BC supported. To Be Faiiiirrrrrr, that whole generation was a basket case. Nintendo with the motion controls. Microsoft with a console that internally was more PC then \"traditional\" console (and HD-DVD). Sony with the Cell processor and OtherOS™.

Prior generations of consoles were true-blue, capital-E \"embedded\". Whatever CPU they could get, graphics hardware that was custom built for that particular machine, and all sorts of weird coprocessors and quirks. For example, in the last generation, we had... - The PlayStation 2, sporting a CPU with an almost[0] MIPS-compatible core with \"vertex units\", one of which is exposed to software as a custom MIPS coprocessor, a completely custom GPU architecture, a separate I/O processor that's also a PS1, custom sound mixing hardware, etc. - The GameCube, sporting a PPC 750 with custom cache management and vector instructions[1], which you might know as the PowerPC G3 that you had in your iMac. The GPU is \"ATI technology\", but that's because ATI bought out the other company Nintendo contracted to make it, ArtX. And it also has custom audio hardware that runs on another chip with it's own memory. - The Xbox, sporting... an Intel Celeron and an Nvidia GPU. Oh, wait, that's \"just a PC\". Original Xbox is actually a good way to draw some red lines here, because while it is in some respects \"just a PC\", it's built a lot more like consoles are. All games run in Ring 0, and are very tightly coupled to the individual quirks of the system software. The \"Nvidia GPU\" is an NV2A, a custom design that Nvidia built specifically for the Xbox. Which itself has custom audio mixing and security hardware you would never find in a PC. In contrast, while Xbox 360 and PS3 both were stuck with PPC[2], they also both had real operating system software that commercial games were expected to coexist with. On Xbox 360, there's a hypervisor that enforces strict code signing; on PS3 games additionally run in user mode. The existence of these OSes meant that system software could be updated in nontrivial ways, and the system software could do some amount of multitasking, like playing music alongside a game without degrading performance or crashing it. Y'know, like you can on a PC. Contrast this again to the Nintendo Wii, which stuck with the PPC 750 and ArtX GPU, adding on a security processor designed by BroadOn[3] to do very rudimentary DRM. About the only thing Nintendo could sanely update without bricking systems was the Wii Menu, which is why we were able to get the little clock at the bottom of the screen. They couldn't, say, run disc games off the SD card or update the HOME Menu to have a music player or friends list or whatever, because the former runs in a security processor that exposes the SD card as a block device and the latter is a library Nintendo embedded into every game binary rather than a separate process with dedicated CPU time budgets. And then the generation after that, Xbox One and PS4 both moved to AMD semicustom designs that had x86 CPUs and Radeon GPUs behind familiar APIs. They're so PC like that the first thing demoed on a hacked PS4 was running Steam and Portal. The Wii U was still kind of \"console-like\", but even that had an OS running on the actual application processor (albeit one of those weird designs with fixed process partitions like something written for a mainframe). And that got replaced with the Switch which has a proper microkernel operating system running on an Nvidia Tegra SoC that might have even wound up in an Android phone at some point! Ok, that's \"phone-like\", not \"PC-like\", but the differences in systems design philosophy between the two is far smaller than the huge gulf between either of those and oldschool console / embedded systems.

They'll be forced to switch to ARM for price/performance reasons, with all x86 vendors moving upmarket to try and maintain revenues. reply alexjplant 20 hours agorootparentprev> Nvidia has graphics chips, but it doesn't have the CPUs. Yes, Nvidia can make ARM CPUs, but they haven't been putting out amazing custom cores. Ignorant question - do they have to? The last time I was up on gaming hardware it seemed as though most workloads were GPU-bound and that having a higher-end GPU was more important than having a blazing fast CPU. GPUs have also grown much more flexible rendering pipelines as game engines have gotten much more sophisticated and, presumably, parallelized. Would it not make sense for Nvidia to crank out a cost-optimized design comprising their last-gen GPU architecture with 12 ARM cores on an affordable node size? The reason I ask is because I've been reading a lot about 90s console architectures recently. My understanding is that back then the CPU and specialized co-processors had to do a lot of heavy lifting on geometry calculations before telling the display hardware what to draw. In contrast I think most contemporary GPU designs take care of all of the vertex calculations themselves and therefore free the CPU up a lot in this regard. If you have an entity-based game engine and are able to split that object graph into well-defined clusters you can probably parallelize the simulation and scale horizontally decently well. Given these trends I'd think a bunch of cheaper cores could work as well for cheaper than higher-end ones. reply toast0 19 hours agorootparentI think a PS6 needs to play PS5 games, or Sony will have a hard time selling them until the PS6 catalog is big; and they'll have a hard time getting 3rd party developers if they're going to have a hard time with console sales. I don't think you're going to play existing PS5 games on an ARM CPU unless it's an \"amazing\" core. Apple does pretty good at running x86 code on their CPUs, but they added special modes to make it work, and I don't know how timing sensitive PS5 games are --- when there's only a handful of hardware variants, you can easily end up with tricky timing requirements. reply bigstrat2003 18 hours agorootparentI mean, the PS4 didn't play PS3 games and that didn't hurt it any. Backwards compatibility is nice but it isn't the only factor. reply bigfishrunning 17 hours agorootparentThe first year of PS4 was pretty dry because of the lack of BC; It really helped that the competition was the Xbox One, which was less appealing for a lot of reasons reply nottorp 10 hours agorootparentOne data point: there was no chip shortage at the PS4 launch, but I still waited more than a year to get one because there was little to play on it. While with the PS5 I got one as soon as I could (that still took more than a year since launch, but for chip shortage reasons) because I knew I could simply replace the PS4 with it under the TV and carry on. reply MBCook 16 hours agorootparentprevAt this point people have loved the PS5 and Xbox Series for having full backwards compatibility. The Xbox goes even further through software. People liked the Wii’s backwards compatibility and the Wii U (for those who had it). And Nintendo’s long chain of BC from the GB to the 3DS (though eventually dropping GB/GBC) was legendary. The Switch was such a leap over the 3DS and WiiU Nintendo got away with it. It’s had such a long life having no BC could be a huge hit if the Switch 2 didn’t have it. I think all three intended to try and keep it going forward at this point. reply philistine 16 hours agorootparentprevWe're not in 2012 anymore.

It depends on the content but there are many such games for consoles. Your claim that it's \"slight\" is one that only gets repeated by people who haven't seen the difference. reply t-3 6 hours agorootparentHonestly, I can't even tell the difference between 30 and 60. Maybe I'm not playing the right games or something but I never notice framerate at all unless it's less than 10-20 or so. reply smolder 47 minutes agorootparentI would guess it's partly the games you play not having a lot of fast motion and maybe partly that you're not really looking for it. reply MBCook 16 hours agorootparentprevYes. You say that, but you can absolutely notice. Motion is smoother, the picture is clearer (higher temporal resolution), and input latency is half what it is at 60. Does every game need it? Absolutely not. But high-speed action games and driving games can definitely benefit. Maybe others. There’s a reason the PC world has been going nuts with frame rates for years. We have 120 fps on consoles today on a few games. They either have to significantly cut back (detail, down to 1080p, etc) or are simpler to begin with (Ori, Prince of Persia). But it’s a great experience. reply wmf 18 hours agorootparentprevI don't think my TV can display 120 fps and I'm not buying a new one. But they promise 4K 60 (with upscaling) on the PS5 Pro, so they have to have something beyond that for PS6. reply MBCook 16 hours agorootparentThey have 120 today, it’s just not used much. Even if people stick to 4K 60, which I suspect they will, the additional power means higher detail and more enemies on screen and better ray tracing.

Or PS4 Pro and PS5 at 4k or even 1440p. reply kcb 15 hours agorootparentprevNvidia has very little desire to make a high-end razor thin margin chip that consoles traditionally demand.

But yes AMD isn't the only choice, IMHO in difference to what many people seem to think for the price segment most consoles tend to target Intel is a viable choice, too. But then we are missing relevant insider information to properly judge that. reply dathinab 9 hours agoparentprev> Intel has ARC, which presumably could be put in a custom \"APU\"; however, their track record with that is not stellar. I wouldn't exactly agree with that. ARC GPUs aren't really bad, sure when they where new there was for quite some time quite some driver issues but they have been mostly ironed out and where more in the \"expected issues with first non iGPU\" territory then \"intel being very bad at their job\" territory. Also GPUs in consoles (ignoring switch) are at the lower mid-class area today and that it's unlikely to change with future consoles, so that is a segment intel should be able to compete with. I mean console GPUs are more like big iGPS then dedicated GPUs. The main issue would be that weather it's intel, nvidea or amd their drivers have subtle but sometimes quite important differences in performance characteristics meaning that sometimes optimizations for one are de-optimizations for the other and similar interoperability issues. And they seem more likely with Intel as there is just much less history between the larger game engines and ARC GPUs. So IMHO Intel would have to offer a smaller price to be viable to compensate for more issues with backward compatibility, but if they where in a much better financial situation atm. I believe they would have had a high chance of getting it by subventioning it a bit so that they get a foothold on the marked and can compete without drawback next generation. reply anemic 11 hours agoparentprevMaybe the deal went south because Intel wanted it to be called Playstation 6 with Intel Integrated Graphics.

Not only did they not seem to understand the possibilities in front of them, their chips were not well positioned at all to win. They were too hot and too power-hungry because Intel didn’t care much about efficiency at the time. They were taking the “shrink a big chip” path. Apple, using ARM from Samsung then their own , ended up taking the “grow a little chip” path.

So the NetBurst debacle had already happened. But that was desktops. I wonder if they really realized how much a problem that was in mobile. I also think I remember a discussion of that quote from a few weeks ago where someone said the real problem for Intel in the iPhone wasn’t heat but power draw. I don’t think they ever really got the religion. Apple’s M1 sort of seems like a repeat of this whole thing. Intel still didn’t get it at that point. Still too hot. Still not efficient enough. The switch from NetBurst to Core seems more like a direction switch because they hit a wall, not a recognition of what the problem actually was. A change from ultra-fast single core to fast multi-core. reply mjevans 10 hours agorootparentThe NetBurst line also had a _terribly_ deep pipeline. I can't remember the number of stages offhand but it was _massive_ for the era in an attempt to keep growing the single core single state machine performance (more mhz).

At the time all desktop computers for games were x86 based IBM clone things. I don't know why AMD ended up with the PS4 and the xbox as opposed to Intel getting either, but x86 was probably inevitable. I wonder if these days something architecturally similar to the mac arm systems would be a reasonable alternative. reply MBCook 16 hours agorootparentYou’re right they didn’t want to target weird things like the PS3 anymore, that was a huge pain. But you have to remember the other side: there were no other options than x86. ARM wasn’t powerful enough for one of the high-end consoles at the time. Trying to have such a chip designed would be a lot more expensive than just choosing a premade design and tweaking at a little. It worked for Nintendo but they had different goals. I’m not sure ARM could’ve been used it for the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One. The previous supplier, IBM PowerPC, had basically given up. Apple switched off them for the same reason. It wasn’t getting much faster and IBM only really seemed interested in server chips. I think it’s reasonable to assume they wouldn’t have tried very hard to win a chance to make a faster console chip. If you don’t want to design your own, that’s all the major players. x86-64 is all that’s left. Which is not to say that was a bad option. Developers are extremely familiar with it, there’s a metric ton of tools available, it makes game porting to and from PCs easier, it was the highest performance option, and there are two big suppliers that you can play against each other. So even if you went with Intel and something happened you could switch to AMD. When IBM decided they didn’t care about the market, you just had to leave the PowerPC. Why AMD over Intel? They were probably hungrier since they were in second place. They had a competitive GPU business, which Intel didn’t. Single supplier + they could do everything on one chip. And if AMD makes both parts they can help optimize the hell out of it. Microsoft got screwed by nVidia on the XBox. I don’t think they’d want to do that again. Sony would absolutely know that happened and be wary. Honestly it’s not clear to me that nVidia cared too much. But maybe I’m just reading it wrong. Nintendo went with them because they had and all in one system on a chip they were willing to dump for cheap that thanks to its mobile heritage developers were already familiar with. Also since AMD was the little guy (compared to Intel) they could really use the sales and the revenue. It would be a bigger percentage of their total income than Intel, meaning it was more important to win that contract. So in the end I think it makes a lot of sense that PlayStation and Xbox ended up in AMD land. reply philistine 16 hours agorootparentprev> [..] something architecturally similar to the mac arm systems would be a reasonable alternative.

    "originBody": "Computer Science > Machine Learning arXiv:2402.12875 (cs) [Submitted on 20 Feb 2024 (v1), last revised 23 May 2024 (this version, v3)] Title:Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems Authors:Zhiyuan Li, Hong Liu, Denny Zhou, Tengyu Ma View PDF HTML (experimental) Abstract:Instructing the model to generate a sequence of intermediate steps, a.k.a., a chain of thought (CoT), is a highly effective method to improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on arithmetics and symbolic reasoning tasks. However, the mechanism behind CoT remains unclear. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the power of CoT for decoder-only transformers through the lens of expressiveness. Conceptually, CoT empowers the model with the ability to perform inherently serial computation, which is otherwise lacking in transformers, especially when depth is low. Given input length $n$, previous works have shown that constant-depth transformers with finite precision $\\mathsf{poly}(n)$ embedding size can only solve problems in $\\mathsf{TC}^0$ without CoT. We first show an even tighter expressiveness upper bound for constant-depth transformers with constant-bit precision, which can only solve problems in $\\mathsf{AC}^0$, a proper subset of $ \\mathsf{TC}^0$. However, with $T$ steps of CoT, constant-depth transformers using constant-bit precision and $O(\\log n)$ embedding size can solve any problem solvable by boolean circuits of size $T$. Empirically, enabling CoT dramatically improves the accuracy for tasks that are hard for parallel computation, including the composition of permutation groups, iterated squaring, and circuit value problems, especially for low-depth transformers.

However, this is a long way from any practical application of transformers: for one thing, most problems we care about are not stated as formal languages, and we already have an exceptionally more efficient way to implement Boolean circuits. reply shawntan 16 hours agoparentIf a \"problem we care about\" is not stated as a formal language, does it mean it does not exist in the hierarchy of formal languages? Or is it just as yet unclassified? reply tsimionescu 11 hours agorootparentIt means that there are two problems: one, to formalize the problem as stated while capturing all relevant details, and two, solving the resulting formal problem. Until you solve problem one, you can't use formal methods to say anything about the problem (it's not even clear a priori that a problem is even solvable). Unfortunately, the task of a formalizing an informal problem is itself an informal problem that we don't know how to formalize, so we can't say much about it. So overall, we can't say much about how hard the general problem \"given a problem statement from a human, solve that problem\" is, whether any particular system (including a human!) can solve it and how long that might take with what resources. reply viraptor 5 hours agorootparent> task of a formalizing an informal problem is itself an informal problem I couldn't find details about this - do you know of a paper or some resource which digs into that idea? reply tsimionescu 5 hours agorootparentNo, but it's pretty obvious, isn't it? If you have an informal problem statement, say \"I want this button to be bigger\", formalizing it can't be a formal process. reply naasking 2 hours agorootparent> \"I want this button to be bigger\", formalizing it can't be a formal process. while (!is_button_big_enough()) { button.scaleUp(1.1); } This is one trivial way to do it, and seems like it would be formalizable. is_button_big_enough is simply an input to whatever process is responsible for judging such a thing, whether that be a design specification or perhaps input from a person. reply tsimionescu 1 hour agorootparentYou've translated my informal problem statement into a quasi-formal process, using your inherent natural language processing skills, and your knowledge of general human concepts like size. But you haven't explained the formal process you followed to go from my problem statement to this pseudocode. And your pseudocode template only works for one particular kind of informal problem statement. If I instead have the problem \"how much money do I need to buy this house and this chair?\", or \"does this byte fit in my mouth?\", your general form will not work. And what's more, you haven't actually produced a formally solvable problem definition, that we could analyze for complexity and computability, because you rely on two completely unspecified functions. Where is the formal defintion of a button? Is it a physical push button or a UI control or a clothing button? What does it mean that it is bigger or smaller? When do we know it's big enough, is that computable? And how do we scale it up? Do we increase its volume? Its surface area? One of its sides? Or maybe the radius? And how do we go about doing that? All of these, and many more, need to be explicitly defined in order to apply any kind of formal analysis to this problem. And there is no formal way to do so in a way that matches the intent of whoever posed the problem. reply viraptor 4 hours agorootparentprevIt's... \"knee-jerk obvious\". But is it actually true? People seem to be interested in the concept in formal logic arguments for example https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346658578_How_to_Fo... (which uses formal process for part of formalization), so maybe it's not as simple as it seems initially. I mean, if we're already talking about formal problems, it could use a stronger proof ;) reply tsimionescu 56 minutes agorootparentAt best, this is a formal process for manipulating certain kinds of statements. But the general problem, \"take a human's statement of a problem and translate it into a formal statement of a problem that, if solved, will address what the human was asking for\" is far harder and more nebulous. Ultimately, it's exactly the problem that LLMs have been invented for, so it has been studied in that sense (and there is a broad literature in AI for NLP, algorithm finding, expert systems, etc). But no one would claim that they are even close to having a formal specification of this problem that they could analyze the complexity of. reply moi2388 4 hours agorootparentprevWhy not? Bigger is a measure of size and ought to be easy enough to formalise. Apply a transformation to B which increases its area and leaves the proportion of its sides equal. Why would this statement not be formalisable? reply tsimionescu 40 minutes agorootparentI'm not saying that the statement \"I want this button to be bigger\" can't be formalized. I'm saying that there is no formal process you can follow to get from this problem to a formal problem that is equivalent. There isn't even a formal process you can use to check if a formal definition is equivalent to this problem. Consider that if someone asked you solve this problem for them with just this statement, either of the following could be a sketch of a more formal statement of what they actually want: 1. In a given web page, the css class used for a particularelement should be changed to make the button's height larger by 10%, without changing any otherelement on the page, or any other dimension. 2. For a particular piece of garment that you are given, the top most button must be replaced with a different button that appears to have the same color and finish to a human eye, and that has the same 3D shape up to human observational precision, but that has a radius large enough to not slip through the opposing hole under certain forces that are commonly encountered, but not so large that it doesn't fit in the hole when pushed with certain forces that are comfortable for humans. I think you would agree that (a) someone who intended you to solve either of these problems might reasonably describe them with the statement I suggested, and (b), that it would be very hard to devise a formal mathematical process to go from that statement to exactly one of these statements. reply Zhyl 4 hours agorootparentprevBut here's the thing, it's not that the statement isn't formalisable, it's the method that you used to formalise it isn't formalisable. reply qwertytyyuu 4 hours agorootparentprevYeah you could make it one pixel bigger but if someone asked you that, is that what they actually want? reply esjeon 5 hours agorootparentprevAh, you are informally inquiring about a formal description concerning the informal nature of formalization of informal questions. Joke aside, this is about the nature of the formalization process itself. If the process of formalizing informal problems were fully formalized, it would be possible to algorithmically compute the solution and even optimize it mathematically. However, since this is obviously impossible (e.g. vague human language), it suggests that the formalization process can't be fully formalized. reply wslh 6 hours agorootparentprevMy 2 cents: Since LLMs (Large Language Models) operate as at least a subset of Turing machines (which recognize recursively enumerable languages), the chain of thought (CoT) approach could be equivalent to or even more expressive than that subset. In fact, CoT could perfectly be a Turing machine. If we leave CoT aside for a moment, it's worth exploring the work discussed in the paper \"Neural Networks and the Chomsky Hierarchy\"[1], which analyzes how neural networks (including LLMs) map onto different levels of the Chomsky hierarchy, with a particular focus on their ability to recognize formal languages across varying complexity. [1] https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2207.02098v1 reply flir 4 hours agorootparent> In fact, CoT could perfectly be a Turing machine. Are we going to need an infinite number of LLMs, arranged on a tape? reply julienreszka 7 hours agoparentprev> most problems we care about are not stated as formal languages then a way would be to translate them to formal language reply larodi 10 hours agoprevI'm waiting for peoples of AI to discover syllogism and inference in its original PROLOG sense, which this CoT abomination basically tries to achieve. Interestingly, if all logical content is translated to rules, and then only rules are fed into the LLM training set, what would the result be, and can the probabilistic magic be made into actually following reason without all the dice. reply pkoird 38 minutes agoparentI've said this before and I'll say it again: Any sufficiently advanced LLM is indistinguishable from Prolog. reply trescenzi 7 hours agoparentprevRight we’ve now gotten to the stage of this AI cycle where we start using the new tool to solve problems old tools could solve. Saying a transformer can solve any Formally decidable problem if given enough tape isn’t saying much. It’s a cool proof, don’t mean to deny that, but it doesn’t mean much practically as we already have more efficient tools that can do the same. reply marcosdumay 5 hours agorootparentWhat I don't get is... didn't people prove that in the 90s for any multi-layer neural network? Didn't people prove transformers are equivalent on the transformers paper? reply sunir 5 hours agoparentprevI was thinking about the graphrag paper and prolog. I’d like to extract predicates. The source material will be inconsistent and contradictory and incomplete. Using the clustering (community) model, an llm can summarize the opinions as a set of predicates which don’t have to agree and some general weight of how much people agree or disagree with them. The predicates won’t be suitable for symbolic logic because the language will be loose. However an embedding model may be able to connect different symbols together. Then you could attempt multiple runs through the database of predicates because there will be different opinions. Then one could attempt to reason using these loosely stitched predicates. I don’t know how good the outcome would be. I imagine this would be better in an interactive decision making tool where a human is evaluating the suggestions for the next step. This could be better for planning than problem solving. reply detourdog 7 hours agoparentprevI’m surprised that understanding how to be thought unfolds is being considered not relevant to the answer. I have done a lot of problem solving in groups and alone. How thoughts develop seems fundamental to understand the solutions. The story regarding the banning of terms that can be used with a reasoning system is a big red flag to me. This sort of knee jerk reaction displays immature management and an immature technology product. reply sigmoid10 12 hours agoprev>Remarkably, constant depth is sufficient. How would that be remarkable, when it is exactly what he Universal Approximation Theorem already states? Since transformers also use fully connected layers, none of this should really come as a surprise. But from glancing at the paper, they don't even mention it. reply nexustext 10 hours agoparentIt's 'remarkable' because (a) academic careers are as much about hype as science, (b) arxiv doesn't have peer review process to quash this, (c) people take arxiv seriously. reply logicchains 5 hours agoparentprev>How would that be remarkable, when it is exactly what he Universal Approximation Theorem already states Only with infinite precision, which is highly unrealistic.

But recurrent neural networks can do solve any computational problem given enough precision. reply roboboffin 5 hours agorootparentDoes that mean when we reduce the precision of a NN, for example using bfloat16 instead of float32, we reduce the set of computational problems that can be solved. How would that compare with a biological neural network with presumably near-infinite precision ? reply wodenokoto 8 hours agorootparentprevFirst day of introductions to NN we were asked to create all the logic gates using artificial neurons, and then told \"If you have all gates, you can do all computations\". I got to admit, I'm sorta sticking to that at face value, because I don't know enough computer science to a) discern if that is true and b) know what \"f: X -> Y only for closed domains\" means. reply tossandthrow 8 hours agorootparentI think the easiest way to think about this is in terms of natural numbers, ie. 1, 2, 3, 4. When you only have a fixed width, ie. a static feed forward network, you have an upper limit to the data you can represent and compute on. Eg. if the highest number you can represent is 1.000, then you will need a new NN if you want to do computations on 1.001. ... or use an inductive structure, like a recurrent neural network has. reply logicchains 5 hours agoparentprevOnly NNs of infinite size or precision.

If one had the right program. reply falcor84 7 hours agoparentIt's not clear me what you're saying; isn't the whole deal here that by performing RL on the CoT (given sufficient size and compute) it would converge to the right program? reply HarHarVeryFunny 7 hours agorootparentI was really saying two things: 1) The theoretical notion that a fixed depth transformer + COT can solve arbitrary problems involving sequential computation is rather like similar theoretical notions of a Turing machine as universal computer, or of an ANN with a hidden layer able to represent arbitrary functions .. it may be true, but at the same time not useful 2) The Turing machine, just as the LLM+COT, is only as useful as the program it is running. If the LLM-COT is incapable of runtime learning and just trying to mimic some reasoning heuristics, then that is going to limit it's function, even if theoretically such an \"architecture\" could do more if only it were running a universal AGI program Using RL to encourage the LLM to predict continuations according to some set of reasoning heuristics is what it is. It's not going to make the model follow any specific reasoning logic, but is presumably hoped to generate a variety of continuations that the COT \"search\" will be able to utilize to arrive at a better response than it otherwise would have done. More of an incremental improvement (as reflected in the benchmark scores it achieves) than \"converging to the right program\". reply __loam 3 hours agorootparentprevSometimes reading hackernews makes me want to slam my head on the table repeatedly. Given sufficient size and compute is one of the most load bearing phrases I've ever seen. reply falcor84 2 hours agorootparentBut it is load bearing. I mean, I personally can't stop being amazed at how with each year that passes, things that were unimaginable with all the world's technology a decade ago are becoming straightforward to run on a reasonably priced laptop. And at this stage, I wouldn't bet even $100 against any particular computational problem being solved in some FAANG datacenter by the end of the decade. reply __loam 26 minutes agorootparentThere's unimaginable and there's physically and mathematically impossible. reply nopinsight 17 hours agoprevIn the words of an author: \"What is the performance limit when scaling LLM inference?

That is, does this prove that a single LLM can solve any problem, or that for any problem, we can find an LLM that solves it? reply jstanley 8 hours agorootparentDoesn't the latter imply the former? If it's possible to find an LLM for any given problem, then find an LLM for the problem \"find an LLM for the problem and then evaluate it\" and then evaluate it, and then you have an LLM that can solve any problem. It's the \"Universal Turing Machine\" for LLMs. I wonder what's the LLM equivalent of the halting problem? reply progval 8 hours agorootparent> It's the \"Universal Turing Machine\" for LLMs. A closer analogy is the Hutter Search (http://hutter1.net/ai/pfastprg.pdf), as it is also an algorithm that can solve any problem. And it is probably too inefficient to use in practice, like the Hutter Search. reply detourdog 7 hours agorootparentprevIn the late ‘80s they were called expert systems.

In practice it says nothing about what can be realistically achieved, though. reply nopinsight 12 hours agorootparentprevA key difference is that the way LMMs (Large Multimodal Models) generate output is far from random. These models can imitate/blend existing information or imitate/probably blend known reasoning methods in the training data. The latter is a key distinguishing feature of the new OpenAI o1 models. Thus, the signal-to-noise ratio of their output is generally way better than infinite monkeys. Arguably, humans rely on similar modes of \"thinking\" most of the time as well. reply CamperBob2 16 hours agorootparentprevYeah. Monkeys. Monkeys that write useful C and Python code that needs a bit less revision every time there's a model update. Can we just give the \"stochastic parrot\" and \"monkeys with typewriters\" schtick a rest? It made for novel commentary three or four years ago, but at this point, these posts themselves read like the work of parrots. They are no longer interesting, insightful, or (for that matter) true. reply visarga 15 hours agorootparentIf you think about it, humans necessarily use abstractions, from the edge detectors in retina to concepts like democracy. But do we really understand? All abstractions leak, and nobody knows the whole stack. For all the poorly grasped abstractions we are using, we are also just parroting. How many times are we doing things because \"that is how they are done\" never wondering why? Take ML itself, people are saying it's little more than alchemy (stir the pile). Are we just parroting approaches that have worked in practice without real understanding? Is it possible to have centralized understanding, even in principle, or is all understanding distributed among us? My conclusion is that we have a patchwork of partial understanding, stitched together functionally by abstractions. When I go to the doctor, I don't study medicine first, I trust the doctor. Trust takes the place of genuine understanding. So humans, like AI, use distributed and functional understanding, we don't have genuine understanding as meant by philosophers like Searle in the Chinese Room. No single neuron in the brain understands anything, but together they do. Similarly, no single human understands genuinely, but society together manages to function. There is no homunculus, no centralized understander anywhere. We humans are also stochastic parrots of abstractions we don't really grok to the full extent. reply throwaway290 13 hours agorootparent> My conclusion Are you saying you understood something?

Wake me up when a LLM figures out stable fusion or room temperature superconductors. reply krackers 16 hours agorootparentI think you're misrepresenting the study. It builds upon previous work that examines the computation power of the transformer architecture from a circuit-complexity perspective. Previous work showed that the class of problems that a \"naive\" Transformer architecture could compute was within TC0 [1, 2] and as a consequence it was fundamentally impossible for transformers to solve certain classes of mathematical problems. This study actually provides a more realistic bound of AC0 (by analyzing the finite-precision case) which rules out even more problems, including such 'simple' ones as modular parity. We also had previous work that hinted that part of the reason why chain-of-thought works from a theoretical perspective is that it literally allows the model to perform types of computations it could not under the more limited setting (in the same way jumping from FSMs to pushdown automata allows you to solve new types of problems) [3].

Assuming finite precision will give a more restrictive result, and assuming arbitrary precision can give you Turing completeness.

The prior work they referenced actually did account for finite precision cases and why they didn't think it was useful to prove the result with those premises. In this work they simply argued from their own perspective why finite precision made more sense. The whole sub-field is kinda messy and I get quoted differing results all the time.

A LLM alone is like a human locked away in a cell, with no access to test ideas.

No, the major assumptions are (a) that ChatGPT can, and (b) that we can reduce the resource requirements by many orders of magnitude. The former assumption is highly-dubious, and the latter is plainly false. Transformers are capable of representing any algorithm, if they're allowed to be large enough and run large enough.

Anonymous Keeping The Book Inside Them External Links Footnotes Similar Links Bibliography Along with asking about doing podcasts, people sometimes ask me whether I am going to write a book or turn Gwern.net into a book. To their surprise, I have no such intention. Writing a book can be harmful; for many writers, the opportunity cost⁠ & risk mean that writing a book is about the last thing they should do (unless they feel a book bursting out of them, much like a chestburster⁠). But how can I not want to write a book? And I get it: writing a book is sacred and unquestionable, the ultimate achievement for Western intellectuals—better than being arrested in a protest (because you don’t have to get sweaty), better than a PhD (because not so devalued), and better even than going to Harvard (because that mostly means you got lucky in admissions). It’s something I’ve definitely aspired to since I became a bookworm: imagining joining the pantheon of authors shelved in my local library, to be able to hold my hardcover book in my hands (perhaps even one with… gilt-edged pages?), and carp about how ‘the publisher chose the cover’. Bad Reasons For Books I will be Chateaubriand⁠ or nothing! Victor Hugo⁠ (age 14) Yet, that’s the problem: I am in love with the idea of having published a book, but not with publishing a specific book. Like ⁠⁠Douglas Adams⁠, I want to have published a book and have the identity of ‘author’⁠⁠1⁠, but not so much be writing a book—in the same way one might want to have ‘learned to read Mandarin’ or ‘become a bodybuilder’, but not to actually sweat through memorizing (and then forgetting) endless arbitrary characters or hours in the gym (followed by gluttony as cruel as the starvation). One can dabble in such things as a hobby and perhaps learn Chinese to the level of a kindergartener or do one’s health good without much sacrifice, but to gain those accomplishments to the level that would excite the envy & admiration of one’s friends & acquaintances is quite another thing. Costs of Books There were shelves on shelves of books on every conceivable subject…⁠The [late] owner⁠ had read them all, and many of them were full in their margins with cross-references in pencil. There ⁠pigeon-holed⁠ desks and cabinets with literally thousands of compartments..These volumes were apparently coming in at the rate of ten or so per week…For years, apparently, he had been endeavoring to keep up with everything that was being written—a Sisyphean task. Over all there were brown ⁠Holland sheets⁠, a thin coating of dust, the moths dancing in the pale September sun. There was a faint aroma of mustiness, proceeding from thousands of 17th & 18th-century books in a room that had been locked up since the owner’s death. I never saw a sight that more impressed on me the vanity of human life and learning. ⁠Sir Charles Oman⁠, On The Writing Of History 1939 It is easy for someone like a book agent or editor to suggest “hey, you should publish a book!”, since they aren’t the one writing it, and (like a venture capitalist) they have plenty on their plate if you fail. But what book, exactly, would I publish? “Gwern.net”? Leaving aside all the fun hypertext features, what would such a book be? It would have to be some sort of anthology, I suppose; but what a mongrel of an anthology it would be, if I look over my past few essays: a review⁠ of a children’s movie about unicorns, then the moral philosophy of self-consistent time travel⁠, then there’s the detailed technical tutorial⁠ about generating fonts with 2023 generative AI models… (The anthology would not be ordered chronologically, safe to say.) I don’t feel enthused about it; but to make a book I would not be ashamed of, I would have to spend many hours revising, rewriting, stripping out hypertext features and deciding what should stay, reformatting for some arcane publisher workflow like EPUB (or worse). This is true whether it’s a big professional publication or a small boutique style, like the ⁠LessWrong anthologies⁠—which are nice indeed, but I recall ⁠Oliver Habryka ballparking the effort⁠ at hundreds of man-hours. (For already-written LW posts!) And while I was in the middle of that, if I wanted to write something else, well, now I would get to feel extra-guilty about procrastinating on The Book™. I definitely won’t have time or energy to follow up on weird anomalies or interesting new rabbit-holes, and even if my output appears unaffected by The Book™, I am in reality eating my intellectual seed-corn and gradually falling out of date, as I neglect the ordinary work of reading & discussion that may flower years later. (Authors who write books have a distinct tendency to ⁠‘go stale’⁠.) I finish all this, and then what? Now it has to spend months working its way through the pipeline, still a distraction, and then—mirabile dictu!—it is done. Uh oh—that’s just the start, isn’t it? Now I have to go out and shill for pre-orders (as we are endlessly assured by apologetic authors that pre-orders are about the only sales number that matters these days and oh god if you ever liked my writing please pre-order and don’t wait until afterwards just think of it as a donation if you have to but pre-order now). If you opt for a low-key launch, skipping the pre-publication publicity campaign, well, you’re still going to have to publicize it once it’s out (free copy to the first person to retweet this!), and deal with reviews (soliciting them, specifically—you should be so lucky anyone actually wrote a review, good or bad, unsolicited) etc. And of course, the double-edged blade of the physical immutability of books as artifacts begins to cut both ways—now that your thoughts are committed to a book, you can never take them back or change them or tweak them. You are now in some respects frozen and reduced to a caricature, to a much greater degree watching your caricature self go around and about (⁠“Borges and I”⁠). Francis Fukuyama⁠, for example, became famous for ⁠⁠his ‘end of history’ essay⁠/book⁠; the result was to be mostly insulted & totally misunderstood (despite being correct⁠ about the failure of alternative ideologies & rise of identity politics as a substitute), and his better work (eg. Fukuyama2014⁠ or The Origins of Political Order⁠) overshadowed. So, a book is a lot of work for a writer, even if it is mostly already-written writing, which crowds out new writing or exploration, and which tends to freeze them in place. But it gets worse. A book commits you to a single task, one which will devour your time for years to come, cutting you off from readers and from opportunity; in the time that you are laboring over the book, which usually you can’t talk much about with readers or enjoy the feedback, you may be driving yourself into depression⁠. Case Studies PhD attrition rates are well-known, and much of it happens after qualifications, while writing the thesis; those who pay attention to biographies of writers will recall many more instances attested, if only in those odd lacuna to which biographers dismiss with a line entire years in which nothing seems to happen but a discarded manuscript. To these, I’ll add two case-studies that I often think about. Wait But Why? The long-form essayist/blogger Tim Urban of ⁠“Wait But Why”⁠ (WBW) made a name for himself in the mid-2010s by writing long enthusiastic essays, leavened with crude but effective comics, about various rabbit-hole topics like cryonics⁠, the rise of deep learning, willpower/procrastination etc; at his peak he became a ⁠⁠favored mouthpiece of Elon Musk⁠. He was often compared to ⁠Scott Alexander⁠ (then blogging at ⁠Slate Star Codex⁠); Scott Alexander has gone from strength to strength and is more widely read than ever (at Astral Codex Ten). WBW… not so much. The reader will have one of two reactions: “who’s that?” and “oh yeah, whatever happened to him?” The answer is simple: on 2016-06-18, disgusted by the 2016 US Presidential election and American political trends (especially the Great Awokening), as he explains in his post-mortem, he ⁠⁠decided to begin writing what would be a book⁠ about politics, ⁠⁠What’s Our Problem?: A Self-Help Book for Societies⁠ (2023). This was a mistake. Re-emerging over half a decade later (or 2,440 days) to break his silence, he explains at length how it was a mistake: the scope kept sprawling, he kept thinking he was almost done only to redo more, and sunk cost fallacy⁠ kept him from killing it, while he kept procrastinating and trying to do it all, to the extent that: People in my life were worried about me. They tried encouraging me, shaming me, setting deadlines for me, reminding me that one post really shouldn’t take multiple years. Nothing seemed to help. Wait But Why annual post publication rate, 2014–102024-08-22. Year n 2014 15 2015 11 2016 13 2017 1 2018 1 2020 4 2021 1 2023 2 2024 2 Eventually, his girlfriend, then fiancee, then wife, got pregnant. The thought of having a kid while still writing the book terrified him into finishing it off before the pregnancy did. Was the book any good? I couldn’t tell you. I’ve never read it or seen anyone mention it; when I brought it up in a chat, only one person had read it (and they didn’t like it⁠⁠2⁠). I suspect many more people read his post about writing the book than will ever read the book. And one can see the impact looking at ⁠⁠his archives⁠. You do not need advanced statistics to see a change ~2016–2017 in the posting rate. (And this is neglecting that the later WBW posts are often short; counting words & illustrations would probably show a larger loss.) Another way to put the opportunity cost is to note that if WBW had kept up its lowest pre-book annual rate (2015’s 11 posts), then instead of a total of 11 posts to show for 2017–72024 (ie. less than an average year), it would have 55 more (66 total) posts.⁠⁠3⁠ Anonymous In another case, the author has not written a post-mortem, but I think the same thing happened. Around roughly the same time as WBW, there was another popular Internet blogger and writer, who gave well-received talks; he too decided to write a book to sum it all up and popularize his views, and went silent. About 2–3 years later, I went to dinner with him; I tried to avoid bringing up the book at all, and felt I could sense his constant strain and anxiety that I would ask about it, which made conversation a little difficult. This depression was also clearly visible in their minimal online activity. I wondered if they would ever publish the book, or if the moment had already passed. And then 4 years after that, somewhat to my surprise, the book finally came out—and it was good! It was positively reviewed and I still see it mentioned (which is more than >99% of books can say), and people still ask occasionally “whatever happened to him?” (If you google his name, “what happened to X” is the first suggested search query.) So, the reward was real but modest. What was the cost? Unfortunately, he has not returned to his previous activities; so in his case, the opportunity cost appears to have been… everything. Everything he would’ve written if he hadn’t been writing the book. As far as I can tell, several years later, he has not begun writing another book nor taken up any major non-writing activities; he just exists—burned out by the trauma of writing the book. And you can’t fix burnout by doing the same kind of thing, I think, ⁠⁠only totally different things⁠. This is regrettable. As a third case, one could mention Scott Alexander again—at the same time as WBW he was writing, and finishing (on 2017-05-17), his online fantasy novel Unsong⁠, which ⁠I enjoyed⁠. He has since been editing and polishing it up for publication, according to occasional mentions on SSC and later on ACX up to the present. After 7 years of ‘editing’ and negotiations for publication, during which “various things went wrong and I procrastinated”, a fan volunteered to ⁠help get it self-published on Amazon⁠. It’s nice that a book now exists, technically, but it feels like the mountain gave birth to a mouse, and one wonders if Scott Alexander would’ve been even more prolific 2017–72024 had he not had Unsong hanging from his neck…? And a fourth case would be The Last Psychiatrist: he stopped blogging in May 2014, a book having been mentioned, which arrived only in December 2020, almost 7 years later. Reviews were mixed, but one thing is clear—as of August 2024, he has not returned to any known public writing. Also worth mentioning Wildbow’s Worm⁠, supposedly undergoing intense editing—admittedly, quite necessary in Worm’s case—since 201311ya for ebook & print publication. Last I knew, it was still being edited, with no sign of Worm publication imminent; although meanwhile Wildbow has written at least 3 other web serials, of vast length & at similar update speed, so it is unclear if the ‘editing’ has done him any harm. Keeping The Book Inside Them Now of course, there is a second kind of author: authors who write books with little discernible impact on their newsletter or blog. They sit down for an hour (statistically, in the morning⁠), pound out their quota, and turn to the next task (sometimes a dayjob, sometimes a previous book later in ‘the pipeline’, sometimes just leisure), like an ⁠Anthony Trollope⁠. The book does not weigh on their minds, and they are confident that they will have it out, as usual, in 12 months. More power to them—but I also think that most would-be book authors already know if they are one of that latter kind of writers, or if they are the former kind I’ve been discussing. If they are the former kind, then they should seriously doubt any plan to write a book: why do they think they will finish? Or that it will be worthwhile? Is there a clear professional reason that the writing has to be a book? (Unless they are named “J. K. Rowling”, they can usually rule out “sales” as an adequate professional reason.) More importantly, what will the effect on them be? And what is the opportunity cost of writing a book: if they spend the next 5 years devoting all their energies to a book, what will be excluded? Would they happily throw everything they wrote in the previous 5 years into a fireplace in exchange for a finished manuscript of the book they are fantasizing about? Would they willing to wager everything they might ever write on the book going well, rather than becoming an albatross and burning them out? If I had decided in 2019 to write up “a book about AI” in the wake of my GPT-2 experiments⁠, say, and only published it in 2024, and sacrificed writing like “The Scaling Hypothesis”⁠ (visionary in June 2020, hopelessly obsolete in August 2024), would I be better off than I am now?⁠⁠4⁠ I suspect that if many writers took seriously writing a book as a real project, rather than an aspirational cultural ideal of ‘being an author’ along the lines of ‘being a PhD’ or ‘creating a video game’, they would realize that it is a serious risk which can backfire. Everyone may have a book inside them, but some should keep it inside them. And we should not put book-writing up on a pedestal, but acknowledge it is often a bad idea and that good writers should not be guilt-tripped into writing a book—you shall not crucify my kind on a cross of gilt! And for now, should a book come out of me despite my best efforts, I will take off and nuke it from orbit. (It’s the only way to be sure.) External Links “so you want to be a writer?”, Charles Bukowski⁠ Discussion: HN⁠, Reddit⁠, Twitter⁠ ⁠⁠Tanner Greer⁠ describes this mentality in characterizing Washington DC elites: In Washington people never read books—they just write them…Washington intellectuals are masters of small mountains. Some of their peaks are more difficult to summit than others. Many smaller slopes are nonetheless jagged and foreboding; climbing these are a mark of true intellectual achievement. But whether the way is smoothly paved or roughly made, the destinations are the same: small heights, little occupied. Those who reach these heights can rest secure. Out of humanity’s many billions there are only a handful of individuals who know their chosen domain as well as they do. They have mastered their mountain: they know its every crag, they have walked its every gully. But it is a small mountain. At its summit their field of view is limited to the narrow range of their own expertise. The social function of such a book is entirely unrelated to its erudition, elegance, or analytical clarity. It is only partially related to the actual ideas or policy recommendations inside it. In this world of small mountains, books and reports are a sort of proof, a sign of achievement that can be seen by climbers of other peaks. An author has mastered her mountain. The wonk thirsts for authority: once she has written a book, other wonks will give it to her. Scott Alexander reviewed it but in a paywalled post⁠, so I don’t know if he liked it or not. This is a good place to note the “equal-odds rule”: that for creative outputs under normal conditions, each output has a surprisingly equal chance of being a hit (without a clear quantity-quality tradeoff); so each of those 55 foregone WBW posts could have been his biggest hit yet. But they were all sacrificed for a single project, and one without particularly high odds of success. This is not a completely hypothetical example. Consider NYT AI journalist Cade Metz’s book The Genius Makers⁠, written mostly 2017–32020, and published 2021-03-16. It was obsolete on publication, and its main interest now is “how could Metz have missed the DL scaling revolution so completely, even while interviewing so many of the principals as it was happening?” (The short answer seems to be ⁠⁠a curious lack of curiosity & pursuit of a “Narrative”⁠ meant he was committed to the narrative of the book and couldn’t throw it out & rewrite from scratch as necessary to regain relevancy.)

Now, as we all know, the aliens that burst out of people in the Aliens franchise are called 'chestbursters'. \"Facehuggers\", by comparison, are hatched from alien eggs. So in this metaphor, since we're told that novels are facehuggers, the writers must be the eggs. And by process of elimination, we can deduce that the innocent starship crewmembers being attacked by facehuggers (novels) are innocent readers. The metaphor actually contradicts the author's main thesis, since every egg (writer) does in fact contain a facehugger (novel). But contrariwise, all the human characters (the rest of us) would be much better off if those novels just stayed inside the writers and didn't insist on being written or read.

His day job was Mechanical Engineering at the local university. He eventually quit once he had his formula worked out. He writes crime novels. Doesn't even like them, but if you want to sell, you either write smut (big gamble) or crime novels (less crowded). Anything you actually want to write about, you have to shoehorn into the crime novel. You also have to keep your protagonists whether you like them or not, or else every book will be your first one. He also found that he had to write local novels that take place around the local tourist sights. He couldn't write about his actual hometown of course, but there is a touristy spot an hour's drive from him, so that's where the detective had to be based for every single adventure. The touristy area must also be a city. That way you have half a million inhabitants, and the same amount of tourists whose relatives are looking for gifts. He was basically playing bookstore SEO. Unsurprisingly, being an ME, he had a product lifecycle. He was working on several books at once in a pipelined fashion. One was being drafted, the next one was being written, the third one was in early proof reading, the fourth one was being finalized. That way he had a good balance between creative and menial work at all times. He also explained how he was careful to use few proofreaders in the early stages, because apparently, his work is a dire read before any corrections. He has a process where he rotates through his early stage proofreaders, and mostly gives them later stage work that is more readable. Being a successful author is no more romantic than being a successful programmer. Or painter. Or mathematician. Any romanticism is at odds with professionalism, e.g. what works.

There's a pattern, there's a method. There's always some novelty of course but it's a production line nevertheless. (I'm talking about real successful academics with real status in the community, not fakes). It also reminds me of the MrBeast document from the other day. Once you hit the formula, you keep grinding it. Consistent high performers almost all do it, no matter the field. Whether it's songs, books, YouTube videos, science papers, blog posts, paintings, consultants, etc. Of course science papers are a team effort but so are novels and music and paintings. Hans Zimmer didn't single handedly compose his recent film scores, he has lots of people working for him on the project. Master painters used assistants. Stephen King isn't typing every character himself. Amd then there are one hit wonders who are at the right place at the right time, saying what needed to be said in that moment, and then sink back into obscurity or become a parody/tribute of their own self as they try to milk that one insight from their 15 minutes of fame.

But I found that even junior PhD students can have a romantic illusion that real scientists just spend their time musing and thinking and sometimes they have a flash of insight which they then enthusiastically share with the others. But the more mundane reality is that papers are projects with their own life cycle. You have to be on time, you have to cater to where \"the discourse\" is right now, the metagame. But to be fast, you need a process, a formula. It's sales. Everything can be approached from a sales and marketing mentality and it tends to bring success to a scary degree. Some apply similar tools in their romantic lives too, where optimizing your dating profile is just the start. I tend to think this is not the real path to something fulfilling, but pursuing this question veers into religious territory. reply TheOtherHobbes 7 hours agoparentprevThis is called write-to-market, and it's a well-known thing in self publishing - even though many wannabe fiction writers choose to ignore it, because they'd rather believe their book will have publishers swooning and readers gushing. (Spoilers: odds of that are very, very close to zero.) In fact all publishing is write-to-market now. Most traditionally published books are picked to chase trends.

Now it seems the entire world is waking up to these formulaic data-driven products that have been pushed by media conglomerates for a decade. This is especially apparent in the gaming world, where big productions seemingly flop out of nowhere (cough Concord cough) while indie studios keep innovating. It's so easy to blame this phenomenon on rose-tinted glasses and older people like us thinking all old things are better than modern, but when the world wasn't decided by \"data scientists\" and corporate committees, there was more variety, more volatility. Lower lows but higher highs as well. I've been thinking about this a lot the other day while watching snippets of the movie \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\", wondering where pure, plain fun movies that are not pushing an agenda or pandering to some audience have gone. And now, in the current era of the remake, which still has to reach the film industry, it is gonna get worse. When they'll find they are unable to invent the new multi-billion franchise, why not go and remake and \"modernise\" an older one? It's basically free money. reply techjamie 5 hours agorootparentI would say that a reasonable person could have foreseen Concord failing. Perhaps not necessarily as hard as it did, but there were a number of red flags before it released. The character designs were bland and bad, which is worse than just being bad. They drummed up a whole bunch of controversy, and the marketing outside of that controversy was basically non-existent. Almost nobody had heard of the product until it already had failed. Even when it was in beta for free, they only garnered about a couple of thousand players at any given time. Then you add on that they already missed the train for hero shooters by about eight years and their modern competition is all free to play and has already sucked up the entire market for the most part. I saw an analysis by a former game producer that thought that perhaps they had a work environment that stifled criticism and commentary from developers and I think that that might have been an accurate assessment; The entire product was released in a way that myself and a number of other people that I've seen online simply can't believe that nobody was throwing their hands up and saying that this was a bad idea before release. reply sph 4 hours agorootparent> I would say that a reasonable person could have foreseen Concord failing. > Then you add on that they already missed the train for hero shooters by about eight years There's an analysis video I saw on Youtube which touches upon this fact: data-driven production suffer from two major problems: when they register a signal (i.e. people like hero shooters), it's already too late. It is impossible to catch a growing trend, just one that has already reached its peak. The second problem is that the data is misleading in the first place. Using social media sentiment, for example, is pure nonsense because social media personas are not real people. They don't buy toilet paper, they don't talk (or Google) about 99% of their boring existence, and the signal is manipulated by bots and malicious agents. It is absolutely crazy that companies still haven't learned that you cannot hire a bunch of data scientists and predict the next major hit.

Through all the metrics and quantification and SEO-like data analysis-based incentives and judgments we are being \"snapped to grid\". The risk averseness is growing. There's only a narrow path and people must tick many boxes or get disqualified. Just as movie producers make the nth superhero movie and everything is a sequel of old IP, science is similarly turned into a formulaic churn. Just think about how Peter Higgs said he couldn't fit the mold of today's academia and the pressure of producing a stream of consistent (and hence typically consistently mediocre - like the consistent taste of a BigMac) output. The other day I watched this interview with a pioneer of artifical neural networks Warren McCulloch (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wawMjJUCMVw). I wonder if today we're letting such personalities thrive in academia. He was originally headed to the Christian ministry and learned a lot of theology then got drawn rather to math, and his pondering of abstractions, understanding, humans and theology moved him to study neurology and to use math to model logic expressed as neural networks. Nowadays, you must specialize early and grind for tests, no \"forgiveness\" if you go off-track, you must be single-mindedly focus on optimizing your path towards tenure for it to be realistic. Can't even get a PhD position without having published several of your original research papers beforehand. While hiring committees say they reward well-roundedness and try to avoid a monoculture, what that becomes in practice is checking if your parents sent you to one of these trendy types of extracurriculars or foreign \"volunteer\" programs, and whether you later were engaged with some shortlist of trendy buzzword issues.

How much \"novel IP\" was produced before, in the majority of human history and before? My impression is that inventing unique \"3D\" characters became common in the modern era. In deep time, people told stories with their cast of characters from their mythology, legends and sages. Folk tales are often written about trope, archetypal characters that are flat and predictable by modern standards. The expectation that new stories must be set in a freshly created \"universe\" with fully new characters is quite new. We may be returning to that old mode of storytelling where we repeat more. Just as people still play Shakespeare with new actors each time, why can't we retell a 20th century film with today's actors and technology? And why can't we make sequels about already beloved and known characters? Seems quite natural in fact. We now have a new canon for this era, and it consists of superman, and Darth Vader etc. The one (big) difference of course is that in the old times there was no concept of copyright and trademarks so people were free to recombine characters as they wished. reply taormina 5 hours agorootparentprevCheck out how Snow White has been going.

A few authors get lucky writing what they like, but most of them find a niche and relentlessly optimize for it. Romance sounded like the most optimizable, because it's a bunch of microgenres, and within a microgenre the readers want to read the exact same thing over and over. Some authors were making good money writing a book a month and self-publishing. At that point, I'd rather be an accountant. reply beezlebroxxxxxx 9 hours agorootparentIt's partly a transition in the industry towards less risk taking. You see it in the movie industry as well. Certain authors are the equivalent of blockbuster movie releases. Publishers pay them huge amounts and market the ever living daylights out of them. Sally Rooney is a recent example, or authors like Salman Rushdie or Zadie Smith, where their books releases are \"events\". Many publishers are moving away from the long tail model that used to let \"midlist\" authors still eke out a living or at least publish. The consolidation in the industry has also made it difficult for authors to shop their books around to different publishers with their own \"brands\". The other \"safe\" bet for publishers has been genre books, like romance or crime, with clear templates and the ability to churn out books while relying on the authors name more than anything else, like Grisham. In romance, for example, there is a big emphasis on \"family\" series, where each book focuses on a different member of a family or group. An example is an author like Kleypas. The books are essentially just variations on a set of tropes, almost algorithmic, but the way they fit together and mutually reference one another keeps people invested. In general though, very few authors make a living writing. The midlist era that thrived in the last 19th and 20th century is sadly going the way of the dodo. reply _tom_ 7 hours agorootparentThe midlist has moved into self publishing. Many more books are published on amazon than by trad publishers. Many of them don't sell, but the numbers (guess) aren't probably that different from fad publishing in terms of success. Many authors that succeed at self publishing move to traditional publishers. (Hugh Howe, E L James) Others (Tamara Taylor) like to control and much higher royalties and stay self published. reply TheOtherHobbes 7 hours agorootparentSocial media is full of trad-pubbed authors (some with NYT best-sellers) complaining they have to keep their day jobs. Self-pubbed author groups have far more authors earning far more money. There's a good number of six figure authors and not a few seven figure authors. They're almost all writing to market - tight-niche, mid-quality writing that gives readers a predictable genre experience they want to repeat. Successful self-pub is equivalent to a bootstrapped micro start-up, and many of the same ideas apply. It's not trivially easy, especially the marketing. But it's certainly easier than trying to pitch from a cold start to the agent/publisher circus. reply brudgers 7 hours agoparentprevWriting is like any other form of creative expression: most people pursuing it need a day job too.

That said, I’ve had success with a narrative podcast, which is heavily influenced by his genius—his wit and comedic writing style shine through.

Look at most compilations of newspaper columns too. reply saalweachter 5 hours agorootparentYou actually see something similar today with web serials. An author starts a story, writes a few chapters, and then presents it to the Internet. They acquire a following, and keep putting up chapters. But even if they start with a solid outline and a world building bible and a binder full of character secrets, the story rarely follows a smooth plot arc -- they have new ideas as they write, and some things don't work the way they'd hoped, and maybe they are not sure how to move from point A to B and spend a few weeks putting up chapters where both they and their characters go in circles for a bit. And then it's finished, the next logical step is to republish it as a book. They could treat the web serial as a first draft, and rewrite it now that they have the whole thing figured out. Throw away some of the meandering, save a few disjointed chapters for short story anthologies, fix some of the character drift that isn't development, drop the plot lines you never finished, and add a bit more foreshadowing to the early chapters for things they didn't figure out until later.

Mind you, that's often useful. The intros and definitions are needed. But it's not producing anything that is especially interesting on its own. reply DanielBMarkham 7 hours agoprevI completely agree with the author and yet I have taken up the profession of writing books. There are, as we know, two different kinds of books: fiction and non-fiction. There's actually only two flavors of books as well: polemic and exploratory. With a polemic, you're expected to have your own internal theme song and the produced work will conform to it. With exploratory books, you're on an adventure with the reader and the only bullshitting you add is the minimum amount necessary to make the exploration fun for both of you. Polemics have become quite popular lately, and I suspect anybody taking a set of blogs or essays and \"sticking them together into a book\" would only have this avenue available. I took a lot of essays and material I'd collected over the years and wrote some non-fiction books on programming. They were exploratory: the theme emerged as I condensed the work together. (My guess is that exploratory fiction and non-fiction is very tough to do and sell; people like a book that they already know the gist of and are familiar with the author much more than they feel like spending many hours on a lark) After I finished a few non-fiction books on coding and performative teams, I was done. It was fun, I learned stuff, I think it's critically important stuff, nobody cares, and I'm okay with that. Because it wasn't a polemic, I felt no need to rant or self-promote. There was no movement I wanted to lead. Time to move on to something else. Books suck. Books change the way you think. All writing does that. Books especially change you because they draw you into some sort of self-created cosmology that you've now adopted. I write because I'm a writer. I've always been a writer. I simply got honest about it as I grew older. I don't think you choose whether to write or not. I think you choose the fashion in which your writing interacts with your subconscious. A book is just a deployment bundle. It's not the point. reply KingOfCoders 14 hours agoprevIf you want to write a book, go for it!

If I calculate my hourly rate to $200 and take the hours it took to write and market the book, I lost a lot of money. But would I have worked instead of writing the book? My book is $30 and I get 80% selling through Leanpub. So I got quite some money, and a trickle of money every week since it peaked. Can you earn money with a book through a publisher (if you're not already a famous name)? Not so sure. Probably better for your branding than your wallet. So as I've said, it depends. reply cubefox 7 hours agorootparentYeah, \"Amazing CTO\" does sound like something people would pay money for.

I can relate so much to this article and everything said here. I published a book last year and it has been a long journey. It took me one year and a half to write it. But then when you think it's done, it's just a second challenge coming up. I wanted to write a book that was as straight-to-the-point as possible. The publisher I signed with didn't really understand my approach and wanted me to turn it into a random book (\"less rough\") where you would get the usual long and useless introductions that I hate. Took me a while to realise that if I signed with a publisher it was just to get this \"I'm an author\" recognition this article talks about. I realised I didn't even buy \"regular\" programming books and most of my library are self published books. I didn't want to publish a book I would have not read. Ended up cancelling my contract and publishing it myself. I talk a bit about it in this article: https://www.einenlum.com/articles/my-book-from-php-to-python... I sold like 50 of them but got great feedback. To anyone wondering if it's worth it financially, definitely NOT. Is it still worth it for other reasons? I would say I don't regret it but you first have to realise you'll go into a rabbit hole and experience the levels of stress the author of the article talks about. reply ghaff 4 hours agoparentThe advantage of a publisher like Apress or O'Reilly is a lot of people still attach probably excessive value to the publisher pedigree. The downside, as you say, is that they control length, format, pricing, deadlines, etc. I went through the publisher route once through two editions and, on net, I'm glad I did but I've also self-published in no small part because I'd rather write some more bite-size books on narrow topics and I want to be able to do whatever I want with the material on the schedule I choose. reply Einenlum 37 minutes agorootparentI agree. Being published by a big name gives you some credibility right away. The issue I personally had with the publisher I signed with (one that you mentioned) is the quality of their products. And I don't mean this specific publisher: it's the whole industry that is mostly broken. I'm not even talking about the content here, only the presentation. Most publishers can't provide good syntax highlighting for their programming books: mine didn't provide any (we're in 2024 and it's supposedly their domain of expertise so I'm baffled), and their ePub books are generally almost unreadable. I didn't want to make my readers pay $35 or $40 for a book that doesn't provide the basics of what you could expect from a programming book. In my case, the challenge was even bigger cause my book is about two programming languages and I needed syntax highlighting for both and a different theme for each. I don't think I've seen this anywhere yet in the \"professional\" programming book industry. reply andai 5 hours agoparentprevWithout additional context, my guess is that you could have sold more if you had gotten more exposure. If the quality is good and there is a market for it, then it's only potential readers not knowing about it that prevents them from buying it. reply Einenlum 50 minutes agorootparentI should have mentioned this part indeed. Finding a publisher and following their process is already a hard path. But if you decide to self-publish (which I did) then a whole new story begins. Being a good author is not what matters at this point. You'll need good communication skills and a strategy to get some visibility. You'll need to market your \"product\" and feel at ease with this. A self-published book can be amazingly written, but without a very good strategy it's a book no one will read, sadly (especially if your audience is very niche, like mine). It's the part I feel the least comfortable with, so I have to accept the very limited reach. reply cortezdecoy 4 hours agoprevGwern's site feels like the \"old web\" in all the best ways to me.

The book does not weigh on their minds, and they are confident that they will have it out, as usual, in 12 months.

Having done both of these things to some degree, I wonder where the impression is coming from that they're super hard. Certainly a certain kind of bodybuilding body is absurdly difficult to achieve and I simply don't recommend it to anyone - and every single person I know that's achieved it has body dysmporphia and is driven by it. Not worth. But achieving something \"like\" a bodybuilder's body is, imo, achievable for most people with the same amount of effort as most of the things people dream about - learning a language, learning to code, having an active blog, reading a book a month, etc. A few hours effort a week consistently and you'll likely have great results after a year, and the journey never ends from there! Mandarin as well is a more than achievable goal that can be achieved with a great degree of skill with a few years of consistent effort. I think this article is right though - a book will kill other goals and activities if you don't maintain a balance. I have many different thoughts about this that one day I'll organize, hah, into a blog post. But my thinking is basically along these lines: 1. The 40 hour workweek is the wrong way to approach maximizing human productivity 2. Humans are inconsistently productive 3. Guardrails are necessary to achieve productivity 4. Consistency is probably the most important guardrail 5. The hardest part of doing a thing isn't doing it, it's scheduling it accurately, and sticking to the schedule If a person maintains a fun blog incidentally alongside their work, blitzing out an article here and there as the whim strikes them, they might appear quite productive. However in an office setting, a corporation would find their productivity schedule infuriating - when will the thing be done? Idk, when I feel like it? When the mood strikes me? Leave me alone, I'm reading hacker news until the mood strikes me. Hence the inconsistently productive. I'm not making a naturalist argument though - I want to be more productive than \"when the mood strikes me,\" and I don't mean for just capitalist endeavors, I mean for all the various activist activities I want to do as well. However I think the modern trap is thinking that the way to be productive is to set hours for activities - 40 hours for work, 9-5. Lots of work done then, right? Instead I think it's better to combine scheduling time with an understanding of human motivation as something flexible and malleable. Most workout advocates will advise things like going to the gym every day 8am, and achieving this by making putting on your gym shorts the first thing you do when you get out of bed, engaging a Habit process, and I think this is effective. But for me what's been more effective is, the night before, determining what time I'm going to bed, and then setting my alarm 8 hours after that, and then noticing - oh wait, I have a meeting 20 minutes after I wake up, ok, in that case, I put my gym shorts next to my computer chair, and immediately after the meeting put them on and then go to the gym, because 2 hours after that I have another call. Or, it's 2am and I'm drunk, there's no way I'm going to do anything but puke my guts out if I try to go on a run in 8 hours, I'll schedule a nighttime run instead - or fuck it, it's the weekend, I'll relax instead and acknowledge it's just not happening tomorrow, but that's ok because I have another go scheduled on Monday morning. There's another side to that which is accurate scheduling. Writing a book takes a long time and I think if it was slotted into a life correctly it would take years to write the book, when most want it done within a year or at most 2. But to achieve that they'd need to spend all their free time on it which would kill their blog hobby or whatever else. If I accurately measure out all the things I want to do in life - blogging, language study, reading, working out, riding my motorcycle, making videos showing off how beautiful taiwan is, fighting car capitalism, continuing to develop myself as an engineer, making enough money to retire - boy do I get depressed... I can do maybe 4 of those things before a week's time is spent already. It's hard to schedule things across the months, year, years, and not feel sad imo. Also total sidenote but I think most non fiction books are way too long anyway and would work better as blogs and blog posts, and I think the market dynamics of bookselling pushes this tendency - excluding fields like academia where people are writing to include as much supporting material as possible and with the expectation of being quoted and cited extensively in future works by themselves or other authors, which with the merging of popular culture and academia is causing issues. See: \"Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity\" as an example. A really incredible new view of history and anthropology that's imo inaccessible to most readers because it's also at least partially written for academia. reply achenet 5 hours agoparent [–] I found Dawn of Everything to be very accessible, personally. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "Quote Origin: I Had Exactly Four Seconds To Hot Up the Disintegrator, and Google Had Told Me It Wasn’t Enough Posted byquoteresearch September 16, 2024September 17, 2024 Raymond Chandler? Barry N. Malzberg? Vlad Savov? Apocryphal? A science fictional device of unknown purpose Question for Quote Investigator: Apparently, sometime during the 1950s a popular writer of detective fiction crafted a short passage parodying science fiction. Within the passage the word “Google” appeared long before the company Google existed. The passage displayed remarkable prescience. The word “Google” referred to an entity that provided information. Would you please explore this topic and provide a citation? Reply from Quote Investigator: The writer Raymond Chandler is best known as the creator of the hardboiled detective character Philip Marlowe. In 1953 Chandler sent a letter to a friend which included a jargon-filled passage parodying science fiction writing. Boldface added to excerpts by QI:1 Did you ever read what they call Science Fiction. It’s a scream. It is written like this: “I checked out with K 19 on Aldabaran III, and stepped out through the crummalite hatch on my 22 Model Sirus Hardtop. I cocked the timejector in secondary and waded through the bright blue manda grass. My breath froze into pink pretzels.” The final sentence of Chandler’s passage included the word “Google”:2 “The sudden brightness swung me around and the Fourth Moon had already risen. I had exactly four seconds to hot up the disintegrator and Google had told me it wasn’t enough. He was right.” They pay brisk money for this crap? Chandler used the pronoun “he” when referring back to “Google”; hence, the character “Google” may have been a male human, a male alien, or a personified computing device. Chandler played cricket when he was young, and he may have been influenced by the term “google” which is applied to balls which break or swerve. Alternatively, Chandler may have been influenced by the comic strip character Barney Google or by the term “Googol” which refers to the enormous number 10100 which can be written as 1 followed by one hundred zeroes. Below are additional selected citations in chronological order. In 1990 the science fiction anthology “Universe 1” included a story by Barry N. Malzberg which began with a reprint of Chandler’s letter. Malzberg’s goal was to construct an entertaining story which included every phrase of Chandler’s mocking prose.3 Here is an excerpt from Malzberg’s tale:4 I waded through the bright blue manda grass toward the beckoning Bryll, feeling the pull of the mud as I tried to clamber away, retain balance. This more than anything else they enjoy, taking our dignity, making us cartoons, yanking from us the solemnity of our distress and placing us on a flat and colorful map where we deal with pale, exploded forms who may or may not be representative of the Brylls themselves. We do not know if it is submission or some parody of conquest. My breath froze into pink pretzels as I squeaked. Sergey Brin and Larry Page were the original creators of a search engine called Backrub which was renamed Google in 1997. It is natural to wonder whether they might have somehow encountered the passage written by Chandler, but there is no evidence supporting that possibility. Instead, the book “In the Plex” by journalist Steven Levy presented the following explanation for the name choice:5 In September 1997, Page and Brin renamed BackRub to something they hoped would be suitable for a business . . . Page’s dorm roommate suggested they call it “googol.” . . . “The name reflected the scale of what we were doing,” Brin explained a few years later. “It actually became a better choice of name later on, because now we have billions of pages and images and groups and documents, and hundreds of millions of searches a day.” Page misspelled the word, which was just as well since the Internet address for the correct spelling was already taken. “Google” was available. “It was easy to type and memorable,” says Page. In 2006 “The Wit & Wisdom of Great Writers” compiled by Nick Holt included an entry which reprinted part of the Chandler’s science fiction passage while crediting Chandler.6 In 2015 “The Verge” website posted an article titled “Google was a 1953 Raymond Chandler joke” by journalist Vlad Savov. The piece reprinted the passage and included this comment:7 Chandler indulges in a brilliantly entertaining, paragraph-long parody of sci-fi writing, which hits every trope and cliché of the genre. Oh, and he namedrops Google some 45 years before Larry and Sergey registered the domain. In conclusion, Raymond Chandler did use the term “Google” in a 1953 letter to a friend. It appeared within a comical science-fiction pastiche filled with jargon; however, the precise meaning of “Google” was unclear. “Google” was the source of information, and Chandler used the pronoun “he” when referring back to “Google”.

Thanks to Rich Lowenthal who told QI about the use of the term google in cricket. Also, thanks to John Baker for his feedback. Image Notes: A science fictional device of unknown purpose.

    "commentBody": "\"Four Seconds to Hot Up the Disintegrator, Google Had Told Me It Wasn't Enough\" (quoteinvestigator.com)205 points by sohkamyung 5 hours agohidepastfavorite79 comments jerf 4 hours agoFor those who have not dipped into the so-called Golden or Silver Age science fiction, Chandler's pastiche is quite accurate. There was a lot of what TV Tropes (warning: TV Tropes) refers to as \"Call A Rabbit a 'Smerp'\": https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallARabbitASmee... Even the mere act of walking out to one's \"car\", opening the door, getting in, and zooming away could be an act of adventure. It would still be quite purple [1], though. A well-known trope of the time. For some reason TV Tropes hadn't covered it yet, though, so I guess we should cut the authors some slack on that front. I would consider \"My breath froze into pink pretzels.\" effectively unredeemable, though. Malzberg's rehabilitation attempt on that fails, in my opinion, and by the time someone wrote around it I think the surrounding prose would already have passed the Purple Event Horizon itself. [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_prose reply setgree 3 hours agoparentThe second chapter of Anne McCaffrey's 'Dragonflight', written in 1968, opens with: \"F'lar, on bronze Mnementh's great neck, appeared first in the skies above the chief Hold of Fax, so-called Lord of the High Reaches.\" reply Suppafly 1 hour agorootparentMaybe because I read a lot of scifi and fantasy, despite not having read any Anne McCaffrey, but that doesn't seem particularly hard to parse or understand. reply permo-w 31 minutes agorootparentit has four, going on five, esoteric proper nouns in one sentence. it's not hard to parse, but it isn't something I love reading either. I'm reminded of the Illuminatus Trilogy, which at times is barely more than proper nouns arranged into sentences at random. like Finnegan's Wake but with more flower power reply tialaramex 1 hour agorootparentprevMcCaffrey is on that TV Tropes list, I have only read a few of her novels and she does jump out for obvious examples of this trope. It's tricky to write an opening sentence though. We all recognise \"Call me Ishmael\" and probably \"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\" is obvious to lots of people but for example, \"I am always drawn back to places where I have lived, the houses and their neighbourhoods\" doesn't exactly promise Breakfast at Tiffany's does it? By the second chapter I think you've earned a lot of leeway, either the reader is engaged and will soldier on despite your six new nouns and what might be a new word or possibly a new meaning for a word they know already - or they have probably set the book down some time ago and will never see this sentence anyway. reply ryangs 1 hour agorootparentprevI think proper nouns get a bit more of a pass in terms of purple prose. reply setgree 1 hour agorootparentI also enjoy the non-standard punctuation, e.g. F'lax -- how would you pronounce that? reply FactolSarin 54 minutes agorootparentThe apostrophe here most likely represents a glottal stop (as in Hawai'i). reply pavlov 52 minutes agorootparentprevIn Finnish, the apostrophe marks a syllable break between instances of the same vowel, and sounds like a very short pause. Maybe they use Finnish spelling rules on this planet. Example word: vaa'an — genetive of \"vaaka\" = \"scale\" reply mock-possum 32 minutes agorootparentprevOoh this is fun trivia - originally dragons had a hard time with human names, so it became a tradition for dragon riders (particularly males) to adopt the dragon’s pronunciation as an honorific. So “Simon” becomes “S’mon.” You say it with a bit of a slur - suhMON or fuhLAX - where the first syllable is not only unemphasized but uttered as quickly as possible then slurred into the next. F’lar really is just “fuhLAR” reply permo-w 37 minutes agoparentprev\"My breath froze into pink pretzels.\" was the only bit of the excerpt I found interesting. I suppose pretzel is a bit of a kitschy choice for the centre of a metaphor, but the overall effect of it was to raise some interesting questions: is there a breathable atmosphere for humans that could precipitate pink ice breath? is our protagonist even human? is there a shop nearby selling Judaism-adjacent baked goods? reply bentcorner 2 hours agoparentprev> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_prose Enlightening article - this is the exact complaint I have with the world-building Bungie does, and now I have a word to describe it. Halo is somewhat grounded, with Humans feeling familiar but the Covenant are both literally and literally (!) purple. Destiny is (IMO) so full of pink pretzels that it's undecipherable to newcomers. reply Jerrrrrrry 3 hours agoparentprev\"My breath froze into pink pretzels.\" The temperature in the synthetic atmosphere wasn't precisely enough to prevent the character's exothermic respiration from condensing, inconveniently. reply jerf 3 hours agorootparentIt's the word \"pretzel\", honestly. I can cover breath freezing pink by the standards of the era, no problem. Took a shot to the lungs & helmet and left to die on the ice planet. I doubt that would \"really\" produce frozen pink breath but what we would now consider \"hard\" sci-fi that would care about that sort of thing generally didn't travel with this sort of purple prose so that's not really an issue. But pretzels? Why is your breath freezing in pretzels? Even pretzel \"rods\", let alone twists? reply derefr 2 hours agorootparentAs a sci-fi writer who likes a spot of silly world-building myself, this line doesn't seem particularly absurd to me, but it does paint me a mental image of something the author very likely didn't intend to communicate: Picture a world whose surface is covered in an ocean of hyper-oxygenated dense fluid (like the kind used in liquid-breathing experiments.) (The fluid isn't cold! The \"freezing\" isn't a description of the temperature, but of motion ceasing.) Now imagine this fluid with the appearance of a gel ant farm, with eaten-through trails in it — but rather than these trails being hollow, they're full of a cotton-candy-like pink \"fluff\". Why? Through some kind of chemical reaction, exhalation of the now-CO2-saturated-and-warmed fluid into the medium, causes the formation and rapid expansion of a (pink!) aerogel, where the \"gel\" is \"something from the fluid, plus water from your breath\" and the \"aero\" is \"nitrogen and CO2\". This aerogel is neutrally or even positively buoyant relative to the dense medium — so it doesn't fall or pour out of your mouth, but rather worms its way out, curving around your face in a random, pretzel-like extrusion pattern, fighting its way out, pushing against the working fluid. I would imagine that, to continue to breathe safely in this strange medium, you would have to 1. always breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth; and 2. ensure that the reaction product of your exhalation doesn't linger to stick to your face as it forms. So the optimal way to survive, would be to constantly, briskly walk backward, with this exhalation product extruding away from you like a rocket engine's exhaust (or perhaps more like spaetzle) as you walk. I imagine you would frequently walk through trails of (your own or others') exhalation product. Which might feel somewhat like walking through gathered up hunks of spiderweb. I also imagine that this reaction would probably be happening to some degree in your throat and lungs as well, rapidly giving you something like silicosis. Depending on how much tension you want in the plot, you could either just embrace this as \"putting a timer on\" getting off this planet; or you could posit that the character would be able to pry just the filter from their rebreather, using it to ensure that the reaction never occurs inside of them (but further increasing the strain of breathing in this medium.) reply kwhitefoot 1 hour agorootparentSounds like something Peter Watts might have invented. I like it, sort of; almost plausible, barely survivable, and deeply unpleasant. reply mgsouth 2 hours agorootparentprevDon't forget the the, uh, pink widows? _Rosencrantz_ (\"they're pinkish and make you dead, like him and Gildunstern\"). Venemous ambush predators, low density (mostly made of this aeogel with hydrogen bladders). About an inch across and 8 inches long, like pink hovering snakes. They float, hiding in the exhalation contrails, waiting for prey to blunder into them. reply Jerrrrrrry 3 hours agorootparentprevThe atmosphere isn't homogenized perfectly, leading to turbulent condensation. Micheal Crichton's Sphere mentions this (actual) fact in regards to certain gases, such as Helium, being needed in high pressure environments to counter act oxygen poisoning and nitrogen narcosis, but due to differing thermal properties, can lead to hot/cold spots, thermal turbulence, etc. reply Vecr 54 minutes agorootparentI never understood why the spaceplane had an atmosphere with helium in it, though. Either Crichton messed up or got confused about the mixing issues there (as well as the massive logistics problems, the plane was huge). reply shadowgovt 2 hours agoparentprevFortunately, science fiction left behind those inclinations.

One of my favorite Chandler quotes, I've posted this a lot of places over the years. That said, the last time I looked into it sources all agreed that the comic strip Barney Google was a very well-known pop-culture reference when Chandler wrote this, and will surely have been the first thing he or anyone he talked to would think of when hearing \"Google\". (TFA mentions this as if it was one of several possibilities, but the others seem very shaky.) So it seems pretty clear he meant it, and expected the reader to take it, as a silly last name. reply Suppafly 1 hour agoparent>So it seems pretty clear he meant it, and expected the reader to take it, as a silly last name. A lot of these 'mysteries' that get brought up over and over online tend to have very easy to figure out answers, but people would rather be confused for some reason. reply detourdog 30 minutes agorootparentThey are words out of their context and humans love to make meaning. Think how surreal things will get now that time has sped up from Chandler’s time. As mysteries they are powerful. So far there was only 1 commenter that knew of Barney Google. The knowledge spreads the mystery dies. I knew nothing of the passage before this thread and when I was reading through the comments. I thought this was recent sci-fi that was being posted at a site called tv tropes. The Google reference was obviously a future form factor for Google services. reply interestica 5 hours agoprev> Chandler played cricket when he was young, and he may have been influenced by the term “google” which is applied to balls which break or swerve.

I cocked the timejector in secondary and waded through the bright blue manda grass. My breath froze into pink pretzels. I flicked on the heat bars and the Brylls ran swiftly on five legs using their other two to send out crylon vibrations. The pressure was almost unbearable, but I caught the range on my wrist computer through the transparent cysicites. I pressed the trigger. The thin violet glow was icecold against the rust-colored mountains. The Brylls shrank to half an inch long and I worked fast stepping on them with the poltex. But it wasn’t enough. The sudden brightness swung me around and the Fourth Moon had already risen. I had exactly four seconds to hot up the disintegrator and Google had told me it wasn’t enough. He was right.\" I like how Chandler writing sci-fi sounds exactly like Chandler writing one of his gumshoe stories. It's terse and tense and cynical. The protagonist drives a vehicle into some kind of ambush, and everything's incredibly snappy (including the scenery). Not at all like the actual sci-fi author who turned the parody into a complete story, and felt compelled to discuss something in the middle of the action, and ruined the pace. I don't think \"Google\" here is a machine or all-knowing entity, sounds more like it's just some guy.

Via https://archive.ph/qmwKj “ GIBSON When science fiction finally got literary naturalism, it got it via the noir detective novel, which is an often decadent offspring of nineteenth-century naturalism. Noir is one of the places that the investigative, analytic, literary impulse went in America. The Goncourt brothers set out to investigate sex and money and power, and many years later, in America, you wind up with Chandler doing something very similar, though highly stylized and with a very different agenda. I always had a feeling that Chandler’s puritanism got in the way, and I was never quite as taken with the language as true Chandler fans seem to be. I distrusted Marlow as a narrator. He wasn’t someone I wanted to meet, and I didn’t find him sympathetic—in large part because Chandler, whom I didn’t trust either, evidently did find him sympathetic. But I trusted Dashiell Hammett. It felt to me that Hammett was Chandler’s ancestor, even though they were really contemporaries. Chandler civilized it, but Hammett invented it. With Hammett I felt that the author was open to the world in a way Chandler never seems to me to be.” Assuming, of course, that The Gibson hasn’t been hacked. reply Suppafly 1 hour agoparentprev>sounds more like it's just some guy That should be apparent to anyone that can read, I think people just like to pretend to be dense for some reason. reply angryantant 4 hours agoparentprevnext [8 more] [flagged] ThrowawayR2 3 hours agorootparentThe moderators have said that machine generated submissions and comments are not welcome on HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33945628 reply card_zero 3 hours agorootparentThere was an old text generator program from the 80s called \"Travesty\": https://www.macintoshrepository.org/50200-travesty That's basically all ChatGPT is being used for here, so I think it's OK.

I'm sure the encyclopedia editors would have liked to get it right. But it's an interesting anecdote. A googol is an uncommon item of vernacular usage, and basically trivia for most people. I remember hearing \"a googolplex\" on elementary school playgrounds, as an example of a number so large you couldn't conceive of it. \"You're stupid times infinity\", \"No, you're stupid times infinity to the googolplex power\", and so on.

    "originBody": "The centrality of stupidity in mathematics September 17, 2024 The Importance of Stupidity in Scientific Research – published in 2008 in the Journal of Cell Science – is one of those wonderful essays that turns your understanding of “being smart” on its head. There are enough implications for education here that it’s worth reading the entire thing. [W]e don’t do a good enough job of teaching our students how to be productively stupid – that is, if we don’t feel stupid it means we’re not really trying. —Martin Schwartz [Hat tip to @KevinDKohl for the share on twitter. The original article can be found here.] The idea of confronting one’s own stupidity and living with it productively – even joyfully! – feels even more central to me in mathematics than in science. The article touches on learning science, but it’s really about research. Stupidity is part of confronting the new, and being a capable science student means you might not have to face it that much when you’re merely absorbing the knowledge that previous scientists have already uncovered. Math seems different to me. Everyone who learns math is familiar with the experience of being stuck on some new idea or problem, banging their head against it, and then, when they finally understand the answer (or having someone tell them), feeling stupid. There’s something fundamental in the nature of mathematics that makes it easy once you get it, and impossible before. To wit: there’s an old joke where a professor is lecturing and remarks, “It’s obvious why this equation holds, of course.” A brave student raises her hand and says what everyone is thinking: “Could you please explain it? It doesn’t seem obvious.” The professor looks at the equation. “Isn’t it obvious?” He starts mumbling to himself. He starts to write on the white board, then stops. Finally he just stands there, looking at the board. Ten minutes pass. The students shift awkwardly and the seconds tick by. Suddenly the professor exclaims, “Aha! It is obvious!” I’ve had numerous experiences in mathematics that left me feeling stupid. The one that made it clearest, I think, was taking real analysis in college. There’s a technical business with epsilons and deltas: one arbitrarily small value has to be smaller than another, thus proving that a function is continuous in a more rigorous way than high school calculus ever bothers to consider. It was arcane and baffling when I took the course. Six months later, it felt so simple that I couldn’t understand what my problem had been. Why had I been so stupid before, that this obvious mathematical idea had eluded me? My personal theory about this (and this is untested, as far as I know) is that mathematics is somewhat unique in the way new learning develops in the mind. Piaget studied mathematical leaps in understanding in young children, and noticed that there are almost switches that flip at certain ages: before they’ve flipped, an idea is essentially impossible to understand; after, they’re obvious. A classic example from Piaget is conservation of volume. (It’s worth checking out the video below if you’re not familiar with this one.) A child confirms two quantities of liquid are the same, sees one poured into a taller, thinner glass, and then says that the taller one has more water in it, despite seeing it proved that the two have the same amount of liquid. Is the boy stupid? No. None of us were, and we all went through this phase. At some age, none of us could see that the amount of liquid stays constant. But once you see it, it’s impossible not to see it. And it’s almost impossible to imagine how it wouldn’t be obvious to anyone. I suspect that mathematical understanding requires similar mental leaps, no matter how long you study it. It’s almost as if we construct new highways in our mind. As long as the construction goes on, no cars drive on it, and our mind hits the same confusion again and again. Then one day, the new road opens, and we “get it.” Once the cars can drive from one side of our mind to the other, the new idea feels obvious. And more, you are so changed by the new perspective that you can’t even understand your own prior lack of understanding. I don’t know any other field of study that so regularly gives you this experience. And if you track topics in mathematics, you can see this happening again and again: with base 10, fractions, algebra, calculus… it’s all hard, until it suddenly feels easy. These jumps in comprehension can be thrilling, and they’re one reason math is so fun. But they do create a challenge for the student. The evidence that you learned something hard is that you feel like you’re stupid. That stupidity is essential to the process, not of pushing at the boundaries of what is known, but simply of getting your mind to take in tools and ideas more abstract than it was ever meant to learn. Students need to know that this feeling is the norm when it comes to learning math. The centrality of stupidity can be especially challenging for the teacher. Being in the position of understanding means that we are distanced from someone who doesn’t understand. It takes an act of remembering that borders on wholesale invention to get a sense of how someone couldn’t see what seems so obvious once you see it. What’s happening in their mind? If you couldn’t understand your own inability from a few weeks ago, how do you understand theirs? I’ve come to believe that one of the best ways to address the centrality of stupidity is to take on two opposing efforts at once: you need to assure students that they are not stupid, while at the same time communicating that feeling like they are stupid is totally natural. The message isn’t that they shouldn’t be feeling stupid – that denies their honest feeling to learning the subject. The message is that of course they’re feeling stupid… that’s how everyone has to feel in order to learn math! It’s all just another reason math is deviously difficult, and spectacularly wonderful to learn. Is there any other study that changes you so deeply, and so often?",

It's just that I've gotten used to it. When I started my PhD program, a group of us were given a little talk by the department secretary. She told the story of how she went to audition for Jeopardy!, a trivia game show. She saw a whole bunch of other people at the audition get really nervous and choke up; her take on it was that they were used to being the most knowledgable in the room -- they were used to sitting in front of the TV screen with their friends or family and knowing every fact, and when they were suddenly confronted with a situation where everyone was as knowledgable as they were, they were suddenly very intimidated. She, on the other hand, was completely relaxed -- she spent her days working with Nobel prize winners and loads of other people for whom she had no doubt were smarter than her. Being confronted with loads of people smarter than her was a daily experience. She told this story to us to say, a lot of you will experience the same thing: You were used to being the smartest person in your High School, you were even used to being the smartest person in your classes at the prestigious university you attended. Now you'll encounter a situation where everyone is like you: the best and most driven people in your classes. You'll feel stupid and inferior for a bit, and that's normal. Don't let it bother you. Eventually you'll notice while that most of these other people have areas where they're better than you, they have areas where you're better. And there will still be the occasional person who seems better than you at everything: that's OK too. You're not the best at everything, and you don't have to be. reply mkleczek 3 minutes agoparent> You're not the best at everything, and you don't have to be.

No one would reasonably argue that what she said wasn't true on some spiritual or personal level, but it feels like a nothing-burger when people are clearly in a competitive environment, a competitive program, a competitive job, etc. reply dgacmu 16 minutes agorootparentIt might feel that way, but I think it's really worth asking : is it? If I put humility aside for a moment, I'm awfully good in my field, and academia is hyper competitive, and yet I know people who are better at everything that I do -- and just like the secretary in that example, I know some people who I think could do everything that I can better than I do. But that really is okay, the world has room for all of us and more, and is much better off for having several of us applying our skills and abilities.

It wasn't ever completely true, but I think if I went for a PhD it would (obviously) have finally been true. To be clear, I'm not saying I was always smarter than people around me, I just felt like I never had to work as hard as I suspected even through my Masters program. reply Noumenon72 1 hour agorootparentPerhaps we should replace this messaging with \"You may find that you won't have to work hard to get through X, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't.\" Educators don't have the time or ability to set up an incentive scheme that makes you \"have to\" work your hardest, but it gets more rewarding at each level. reply Loughla 34 minutes agorootparentBingo. You can breeze through all levels of education with a combination of personality and picking the right courses. Your faculty tend to be overworked and underpaid for the work they do. You are one of hundreds. They do not exist to make sure you're actually learning anything, just that you can spit back the course content appropriately. But once you get over the barrier to entry for most white-collar jobs (bachelor degree), what's the point? If you're not getting anything out of the education, you're only borrowing trouble from yourself in the future. My bachelor's was relatively easy. My masters was MASSIVELY difficult.

Calling it stupid is a cheeky glass-half-empty framing. But one of the big problems with math education is that we force students to struggle to a far greater degree than other subjects, under a belief that personal struggle, the “trying”, is the only way to truly get it. This is a pervasive cultural belief that extends to work and money too. And we force it from the beginning when kids are very young, without taking the time to develop their curiosity, and without setting up the system to gracefully nudge people who for whatever reason don’t see why they should try so hard. Personally I suspect there are lots of things that could help motivate many more students than we do using our current system of demanding kids “try” to grok abstract rules using Greek letters. A combination of more visual storytelling, math history, and physical less abstract problems, along with a grading and progression system that ensures kids get it before moving to topics that depend on having got it might help a lot of people; too often kids are pushed to progress without ensuring they’re ready, and once that happens, “trying” is a fairly unreasonable expectation. Think about how you learned your first language. Your mom taught it to you by rote repetition. She didn’t expect you to come to any of it on your own, and you weren’t expected to struggle with grammar or understand the rules or judged for getting them wrong, you were just gently corrected when wrong and celebrated when right. I don’t know if first language learning is a good way to learn math, but it is obvious that we have alternatives to today’s system and that today’s system isn’t serving everyone who’s capable of doing math. reply ColinWright 2 hours agoparentI don't know your background, but speaking as someone who has done a PhD in Pure Math, and working with a lot of people who have done PhDs in Pure Math, I disagree with you. It's very much a case of feeling stupid, and being able to embrace that and live with it. The \"being curious\" thing is independent of the \"feeling stupid\" thing. It definitely exists, but it's absolutely not the same thing. Looking at the rest of your comment, maybe we have a lot in common, but I definitely disagree with a lot of what you've written here, so no doubt our experiences are wildly different. Perhaps over a coffee[0] we could talk constructively about education, math, struggles to understand, and work ethics, but suffice to say here that even if we do have substantial common ground, I think we might have very different points of view. [0] Other beverages are available. reply dahart 1 hour agorootparentOf course you disagree with me ;) You’re talking about the minority of people who’ve had incredible amounts of math success (yes despite sometimes legitimately feeling very stupid). I’m not talking about my own experience, FWIW, I’m talking about the majority of people who never get anywhere close to a PhD in math, because they were left behind by our math education system. Obviously I don’t know exactly what you disagree with since you didn’t elaborate, but we have bumped into each other in mathy threads fairly often, right? If we get the chance some time, it would be super fun to discuss math & education over coffee! reply ColinWright 34 minutes agorootparentI suspect part of the friction here is the difference between teaching math to people who will not go on to study it at an advanced level, versus teaching it to people who will. In that case, what is being taught is actually different, it's the similar in some senses to the difference between teaching someone to operate a machine, versus teaching them how to maintain, fix, and possibly improve said machine. I've said for a long time that if only we could identify early the students who will not go on to study mathematics at an advanced level then we could better benefit them by having a substantially different curriculum taught in a completely different style. But even then, the willingness to be confused by something, and resilience in the face of being made to feel stupid not by the teacher[0] but by the current (temporary!) lack of understanding, is really, really powerful. [0] Teachers who unnecessarily make students feel stupid should be prevented from ever, ever going near students again.

I disagree. In fact, I found that often the better and more didactically streamlined the exposition is in a book, the less deeply I end up learning the material. It is precisely the personal struggle, having to make my own sketches and derivations, starting out with a misconception because of bad phrasing in the book and having to explore that misconception until I find what I misunderstood etc. makes the knowledge stick much better because it now feels my own, like an intimate friend. Spoonfeeding may get people quicker to the point of solving the standardized quiz at the end of the chapter but that's not the same as learning and understanding. Another instance of metric-chasing in action. It's a bit like how I learned MS Office or Photoshop by trial and error as a kid, or programming by mucking around trying to make a website do what I want. And you bet it was a struggle. Struggle but with reward at the end. Compare that with a handholding tutorial where you do learn how to do whatever the tutorial makers had in mind, but it won't generalize as much. Sounds totally dry. I loved computers, but hated school lessons that tried to teach us MS Office in the handholding spoonfeeding way. It's the death of the subject.

Yes, some guidance can be available, but the pedagogical hand-holding that is undergrad is simply not possible.

One of the central problems of our time in research and academics, I think, is an incentive to focus on areas that are well-established because we know they are likely to produce results that we have confidence in (according to whatever inferential criteria we use). The idea of it being ok to not know something a priori, to have lack of confidence in it, seems sort of discouraged in the current climate, because it's too risky. reply what-the-grump 4 hours agorootparentDancing around the elephant in the room, the problem is financial risk, e.g. this isn't really about research this is a business, and business must minimize risk to be profitable? reply kragen 1 hour agoparentprevkids struggle with grammar, pronunciation, pragmatics, vocabulary, etc. they do so naturally, and maybe you've forgotten your own struggles, but they're very real i think we can do better than we are doing at math education, much better, but there is no way to learn math, or anything else, without diligent effort. it won't happen by passive absorption. you can listen to people speaking spanish all day every day for years without learning more than a few words of spanish if you don't make any effort curiosity is one possible motivation for making that effort, but the immediate result of the effort is, at first, failure. that's true of language, it's true of playing the guitar, it's true of programming, it's true of throwing clay on a potter's wheel. that failure feels like being clumsy, weak, or stupid, depending on the form it takes and that's what the article is talking about. trying to do things that are beyond your mental ability makes you aware of, and frustrated with, that mental ability. that's not curiosity, it's feeling stupid. it's also how you increase your mental ability! reply wwarner 4 hours agoparentprevThere are two authors here, since the post contains an inset about dealing with your own ignorance by another professor.

He is talking about research where nobody knows the right answer. reply dahart 4 hours agorootparentMartin absolutely was talking about education; research is education. Granted, not early education, but I’m not making any claims about what he said, I simply used his quote as a segue to make an observation about the connections between research thinking and today’s math curriculum. Research is a continuous spectrum. We are expecting kids in elementary, secondary, and early college to have a research mentality and research level motivation in order to succeed in math classes, unlike some other subjects. (Classes which, btw, were all research topics at some point in time and took tens, hundreds, even thousands of years to develop.) The mentality and motivation are important if you want to end up doing any of the actual graduate, post-graduate, or career research where nobody knows the right answer. The kids who are pruned out by our math system never make it there, and many don’t even make it to functional math literacy, even though many/most are perfectly capable, and that’s unfortunate and doesn’t reflect well on our education system. I’m suggesting we can do better. reply Gupie 4 hours agorootparentI don't disagree with what you have just said except I understand education to refer to the transfer of knowledge while research is the discovery of new knowledge. reply dahart 1 hour agorootparentResearch is wholly about the transfer of knowledge, both before and after any associated experimentation. Sometimes there is discovery in between, but not always; survey papers and meta analyses are research, a very important part of research. Experiments that don’t research previous work and don’t communicate the results aren’t research and usually don’t result in the discovery of new knowledge. Can’t know it’s new unless you research what’s already known. reply JoeAltmaier 4 hours agorootparentprevCuriously the root of that word is 'to search again', meaning more like 'reviewing sources in the library' and less like 'doing experiments in the lab'. reply kragen 1 hour agorootparentre- in this case is probably an intensive prefix rather than indicating repetition. this is an uncommon re- in english, but does occur, for example in 'refried beans', a calque from spanish where intensive re- is still a productive prefix so it probably means 'search really hard' rather than 'search again' reply glitchc 3 hours agorootparentprevResearch is discovery with a healthy dose of self-education. reply dahart 3 hours agorootparentI’m lucky enough to have had opportunity and encouragement to do research most of my career, and work closely with other researchers for decades. The first job of a researcher is to understand what others have done, before attempting discovery. Failure to do that critical step means it’s not considered research. The second job is to build on the work of others. And the third job is to communicate those results to others. Discovery is the seeking of knowledge, which is education. Framing it as self-education is feeding a narrative of research as being an individual sport, but in reality research is entirely a collaborative team sport with incremental dependent results. reply taeric 4 hours agoparentprevI think the framing as \"stupidity\" is to highlight that you don't always chase creative questions. Quite often, you should chase the obvious or understood points. The problem, I think, comes from the weaponization of \"stupid\" against people. The XKCD of the lucky 1000 plays a good role here. If you are constantly deriding others for stupid takes, then anyone that derides one of your stupid takes will hit hard. And that seems to be getting worse. reply thomastjeffery 4 hours agoparentprev> He’s really talking about curiosity. Calling it stupid is a cheeky glass-half-empty framing. I disagree. How can you be curious without something you don't understand? The point, as I see it, is that if you find yourself in a position of complete understanding, then you must also have a complete lack of curiosity. If you think you are in that position, then the way to revive your curiosity is to deconstruct your position of expertise, i.e., recognize your position of stupidity. --- Curiosity is step 2. Stupidity is step 1. Learning moves us from step 2 to step 3. The important thing to recognize is that step 3 is actually a new instance of step 1. Expertise is the base case of this recursive tree traversal: it's how you stop the learning process. reply dahart 48 minutes agorootparent> How can you be curious without something you don't understand? Good question. You might have discovered my point: curiosity comes with stupidity, implicitly by definition, right? I think that’s what you’re saying too. Maybe you don’t disagree after all? You can’t have curiosity without stupidity, as you rightly point out. Ignorance is probably a better word than stupidity. Using “stupid” is imprecise and was used here for a bit of surprise and humor. You can have stupidity (ignorance) without curiosity. When that happens, perhaps the expected result is no progress developing new understanding nor lessening of ignorance. Given that curiosity implies ignorance, and that ignorance alone is not sufficient for learning, what justification is there for claiming curiosity and ignorance are separate steps or separate things when it comes to education or research? I’m suggesting they are two sides of the same coin, they must both exist before learning happens, and neither one can come before the other. Calling it curiosity instead of ignorance or stupidity is perhaps a kinder framing, especially for people who might not immediately get the self deprecating humor of “stupidity”. reply thomastjeffery 39 minutes agorootparentMy disagreement was semantic. Wasn't yours? My overall point is that the end of education is expertise, which itself is a form of ignorance. We generally consider stupidity and expertise to be antonyms, but they often exist as two opposing perspectives of the same experience. reply enriquto 6 hours agoprev> if we don’t feel stupid it means we’re not really trying Sounds a bit like Kernighan's lever: \"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.

No amount of assuring them that it is the gateway to enlightenment or however you put it will save you. reply maroonblazer 6 hours agoparentI've become convinced that, in the end, no one really teaches you anything, you end up teaching yourself. That phrasing is a bit hyperbolic. It's more accurate to say a good teacher only gets you 50%, 60%, maybe 70% of the way there, and it's up to you to get you to 100%. To be able to truly learn any given concept means being capable of answering a practically infinite number of different questions about that topic. The process of teaching is essentially trying to uncover which questions the student can't answer. The challenge, of course, is that the student doesn't know what questions they can't answer, because the questions haven't occurred to them. That is, until they start testing themselves, to see if they really do understand the concept. Problem sets in textbooks are the canonical way of addressing this teaching challenge, but there are only so many pages in a textbook, and there are other concepts that need to be taught, so the scope of the problem sets are necessarily finite. How many times have you nailed all the problems in a book, only to discover that there was some aspect of the topic you didn't understand, despite getting all the right answers? reply rramadass 5 hours agorootparentThe following two quotes from Martial Arts have been quite helpful to me in motivating my study efforts; The Master shows the Gate, but it is the Student who has to walk through it.

There is also a great inspirational story in the Mahabharata of \"Ekalavya\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekalavya) who became an exceptional archer through self-training. Eklavya inspires a life-long learning philosophy and his presence seems to be a celebration for the masses. In this EklavyaParv, the motto is 'You Create Yourself\" and the legend of Eklavya is a testimony that is forwarded by many thinkers as well. The discipleship that Eklavya represents is the best for a student and enables one to be the creator of one's own destiny. Adapting to current times, \"The Master\" can be a \"Good Book\" and you can have \"Many Masters\" but the effort and learning has to happen within the Student.

I don't think a student needs to always answer a question \"on the spot\". Being able to find an answer in a reasonable amount of time and explain an answer would be in my opinion more valuable.

They read through a 100 pages of law textbooks and at no part do they feel dumbfounded by a paragraph or get stuck on a page for an hour. It's hard to learn it for sure, but you can read and read and read it. Reading math, on the other hand, is a staccato, a constant stop and go (and flip the pages back). One evening I might only progress 5 pages in the math textbooks because I stop after half a page to draw some sketches, some diagrams. Then I stand up and walk up and down the corridor for 10 minutes thinking things through and whether my current understanding makes sense and adds up to explain what I just read.

It does not mean expert judgement, nor expertise forged in experience.. no it means being an expert at giving accounts of one's knowledge in connection with other explicit accounts of knowledge. Very little of anything worth knowing, in practice, can be given this account or a reliable one at least (physics sure,.. teaching?). Say, after decades of teaching, an exceptional teacher is not going to be able to (in general) report their methods in terms of the explicit accounts of methods as established in books. These are highly varied anyway, and full of rival theories. Indeed, a person who could give such a count is most likely to be a poor teacher by comparison: since all their labour has been in the creation of these accounts, not in teaching (or far less). You cannot do both. You cannot both acquire a vast depth of expertise that grounds good judgement (risk/reward, problems that arise in practice, context-sensitive question, intuitions for failure/sucess, etc.) -- and develop baroque accounts of that knowledge (its origins, remembering which papers you read, remembering all your projects, all the theories developed by academics, their history, and so on). If knowledge is only, as academics say, just their own sort of accounting -- then one would feel stupid all the time. Since almost nothing can be thus accounted for.. and yet the world is replete with highly practiced experts in a very large number of domains. reply directevolve 2 hours agoparentMy view is that the when academics call other academics “experts,” it’s just noting who works professionally on a topic. Usually those people will be able to give a reasonable account of their field. But a lot of the game is reviewing the specific subject matter before a presentation.

The whole time I was thinking that it's clearly a miscommunication, they are just assessing the kid's understanding of the word \"more\". If he thought it meant the tallest one, then all his answers would be correct. But at the end, there is a question about sharing a graham cracker, which I am 100% sure a child of that age understands. They want at least the same amount of graham cracker as the other person. The kid also gets that one wrong, at the cost of his own bottom line. That really sold it. reply wvbdmp 2 hours agoparentI think this video, and most such experiments involving children, suffer from a central issue: children are extremely sensitive to what they think adults want to hear. The kid watched the woman manipulate the things. He probably figured it would be rude not to acknowledge her changes. They should figure out a way to have another kid as the experimenter and disguise the obvious test/interview situation somehow. Especially the cracker thing feels sooo odd. I can’t believe he would let a peer get away with it, but who’s he to argue with an adult, much less a stranger? Also children are brought up with super obvious problems like “what object fits into which hole?”. I feel like some of these tests measure less the child’s understanding of the given problem per se and more whether they have previously been introduced to trick questions/illusions. And even controlling for all that, you’re totally right. Even adults get confused by mass, weight, volume, apparent size etc. sometimes. The kid doesn’t even intellectually know those concepts. His only input here is by sight, but his answer may be different if he got to hold both objects and feel their weight. reply persnickety 4 hours agoparentprevThe crackers question changes from amount to fairness. It's possible that the kid uses a different rule to evaluate it. Like \"a small person needs small portions\" or some variation. I'd be convinced that the kid doesn't get it if they swapped crackers and then it stopped being fair. reply alphazard 3 hours agorootparent> It's possible that the kid uses a different rule to evaluate it. Like \"a small person needs small portions\" or some variation. Fair enough. It's definitely missing the opposing case where 1 graham cracker each is split on only one side and therefore the situation goes from fair to unfair, even though it's the same amount of graham cracker. > I'd be convinced that the kid doesn't get it if they swapped crackers and then it stopped being fair. I wouldn't count on that. I think the kid (and most adults) would claim it's fair if they thought they could get away with it. The deep intuition for \"fair\" that I expect from children would be derived from past experience negotiating with peers, not from any kind of moral theory. reply directevolve 2 hours agorootparentprevThe kid has the same portion of cracker before and after she splits it, though. reply thomasahle 3 hours agoprevThe best feeling of my PhD was whenever two intuitions (or what I thought were facts) were predicting different outcomes.

I understand where the author is coming from, but these are just useless statements. Stupidity and knowing that you don't know stuff are not the same thing. The former involves an inability to understand or learn, whereas the latter involves an acknowledgment of our current state of ignorance and that we can do better. I don't believe one can be successful in science by constantly feeling stupid and getting used to it. You have to be comfortable with not knowing stuff, but with the drive and self-confidence that you can discover new things and expand your knowledge, which is of course not easy either. reply kzz102 4 hours agoprevI want to distinguish two sources of \"feeling of stupidity\". One come from the challenge of grasping a difficult concept. The other is the smack on the head when you fail to see a simple but brilliant insight. In my view, you should not feel stupid in either situations, and the teacher should try to ward you against this feeling. For the first type, I argue it's simply the resistance to a new mental model. The article's example of epsilon-delta language is a perfect example. It's a new way of thinking that takes time (and it did historically) to sink in. Competing on how fast you grasp this new concept is stupid. When the new mode of thinking becomes natural, it won't care how long you took to adapt to it. For the second type, it's simply an impossible standard to reliably have eureka moments. Clearly, smarter people will have more of these than the average people, but no one can do this reliably. On the other hand, while it takes more work for us mortals to have these insights than a genius, there are plenty of ways to get there that don't require a super high IQ. Teachers should try to foster these moments because they are huge confidence builders, but try to minimise the impact of someone showing off their brilliance. reply zeptian 2 hours agoparentthe two types are nice ! the author likens your first type to building \"mental\" roads, which form new pathways of cognition, and takes time, and has emotional resistance, and requires conscious effort and practice to carve out. also to relate the roads to other roads correctly, so the mental map of roads is consistent, and can be traversed. the problem is that most students do not grasp ideas fully and develop facility with it. when this happens, the foundations are shaky, and facility is lost. then, they label themselves as incapable which leads to a vicious cycle where, the belief of being stupid leads to more stupidity. the second type is where the roads (ideas) are there, but a route from source to destination is not clear, and the aha moment is when you see the full path in the mental eye. reply wileydragonfly 52 minutes agoprevNice bookend to the other link. “All I want is a 17 sided polygon on my tombstone… here’s a simple guide on how to draw it.” “Best I can do is a star.” reply Dove 4 hours agoprevI had a very similar observation about engineering early in my career. The first project I worked on professionally felt vast compared to anything I'd seen in school. At first I was embarrassed to be new, to have to ask questions, to have to deal with solving problems in areas I didn't fully understand. It took months and months to \"come up to speed\", and I felt that I was drowning in complexity and unqualified for the work I was doing. Ultimately I came to understand that this is the normal state of engineering, especially when innovation is happening. The bulk of the work in engineering (not all of it, but the vast majority, especially in software) is fully understanding the problem space, the tradeoffs between alternative paths, understanding how your solution holds up and fixing bugs. In short, once you've gotten all your questions answered and finally feel fully qualified and no longer ignorant, you've also solved the problem you were working on. Time to move on to the next thing. When I realized that, I realized that feeling dumb was actually normal, and that I should embrace it and expect to spend the majority of my career in that state. Not only did this dissolve my embarrassment, but it made me seek out ways to thrive in uncertainty and chaos -- which skills have been to my advantage for many years. It is uncomfortable to admit you don't know things, or you don't know the best way to proceed, or you don't understand something. The temptation is to downplay that, to pretend you understand, to retreat toward the things you understand well. But poking at the unknown is how you get smarter, and ultimately how you solve problems. It takes courage, especially in a crowd, but it is also what solving problems normally feels like. reply setopt 4 hours agoparentI only feel dumb if I don’t know how to start looking at a problem, in some cases because I don’t understand the description of the problem either.

[0] https://www.manukapur.com/productive-failure/ reply api 6 hours agoprevThis seems analogous to productive laziness in engineering.

The way I currently think about it is that a learning space is a sort of skill tree (poset), and the easy concepts/skills are the ones where we can learn all the prereqs, and then just combine them (join reducible elements), whereas the tricky concepts/skills (the ones which make us feel stupid) are the ones that only have a single prerequisite, so we can't just combine things we already know, but have to do something novel[2] in order to acquire them (join irreducible elements). [0] and both of them were probably confident all along that they'd make it, the former because they had already sketched out a few likely paths in their mind, the latter because they've always managed to muddle through before [1] furthermore, having travelled from A to B multiple times, it's difficult for a teacher to empathise with those who are not following [2] to https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41566945 I'd say maybe that's why traditionally we've waited until people are in their late teens/early twenties, significantly ego-invested in research as a career path, and have an experienced mentor, before we throw them overboard into the lake of obligate stupidity[3]? (there are exceptions: Feynman habitually tested himself by attempting to self-derive [practising research mode] before allowing himself to read expository texts [entering spectator mode].

It’s cool that AI is making that accessible. To an extent the techniques are still woefully primitive too. The standout for me personally is the calculational proof. It’s arguably the biggest advance in how math is done since the equals sign, but despite that it’s still rather uncommon. I suspect it will be another generation or two before it really catches on. Thankfully mechanical checking will drive adoption. reply minkles 6 hours agoparent> It’s cool that AI is making that accessible.

We talk about scaffolding and the importance of pedagogy in math education yet none of that exists at higher levels. In my case it's literally been the blind leading the blind. It's a horrible environment to learn in. I say this as someone who has tackled some really tough material with no issue in the past thanks to having that hierarchy you mentioned.

Their standard term deal sheets are unnecessarily greedy and massively distort the cap table for hardware startups that have to raise a lot of money before a Series A. Their docs are predicated on startups being able to raise a small-valuation Series A right out of the program, which is only true of startups that require low capitalization. For instance, I'm out fundraising for a molecular nanotechnology startup right now. I will not be doing YC because it would be a shite deal for both me and my existing investors. reply xyzzy_plugh 15 hours agorootparentLet me preface this by saying that on the whole I agree with you. However hardware startups that have to raise a lot of money before a Series A are... considerably riskier, no? If you're an established name in hardware or a hardware-adjacent field then you'll typically have less of an issue getting access to capital. You can strike some pretty amazing deals with vendors if the stars align. But otherwise there's a considerable chance that you end up out of your depth, out of runway while pre-production units sit on a loading dock in China. Pretty much everyone prefers investing in startups that require low capitalization at this point. Everyone has been bitten by this point. We've learned. Not to say it isn't possible but I'm not going to unbalance my portfolio towards hardware startups unless that's somehow my play. reply adastra22 9 hours agorootparentRisk can be factored in to the terms of the deal. But there is no situation where it makes sense to offer the very first investors of an idea-stage company full, unlimited and indefinite dilution protection. It used to be common and expected that early investors be given pro rata participation rights, so that they could maintain their ownership stake by participating in future rounds. YC’s new post-money SAFE terms effectively gift them equity in every future unpriced financing round. So if you need to do another convertible note round (which any hardware startup would), they effectively participate without having to give you a cent. This is unheard of and ludicrous. But they get away with it because most software startups immediately raise a priced round on demo day anyway, so it’s a moot point for them. For hardware startups, this can become a poison pill. reply janalsncm 11 hours agorootparentprevI’m glad you took it this direction because it gets to the reason I brought up the other article. It’s not an accident that China dominates in so many technological areas. It is the result of a deliberate plan. The CCP specifically targets areas of investment. The US does this too, but usually in a less direct way (politics mean you have to keep constituencies happy which means farmers keep getting subsidies). The idea that the market is “free” is a myth. So if we want companies to invest in certain high capex industries, we need to de-risk those investments. Change the cost-benefit calculation so that companies will invest in industries we need to grow domestically. CHIPS and Science kind of did this, but we need to keep doing it. reply lkrubner 15 hours agorootparentprev\"hardware startups that have to raise a lot of money before a Series A are... considerably riskier, no?\" Why riskier? They have more of a moat don't they? The large capitalization needed suggests they will face less competition. It's more difficult for competitors to gather the necessary capital to compete against them? What I've written here was the conventional wisdom for most of 200 years. Much of the Industrial Revolution played out when merely concentrating together capital was seen as an engine of growth. Rockefeller did not need to sell innovative gasoline, he only needed to use cash flow to buy up monopoly positions, one small region at a time, until he had the cash flow to buy up monopoly positions nationwide. Economies-of-scale meant that merely concentrating together capital was a path to greater profitability. The last 25 years were an aberration, during which time big companies could be built with small initial investments.

It lags behind for now in other key sectors, including robotics, biopharmaceuticals, chemicals, and AI. But it is making rapid progress. I'm not sure why this is relevant. They're still behind in the primary sectors that Y-Combinator invests in: software. Certainly China is catching up and it would be naive to sleep on them, but it is magnitudes easier to catch up than it is to lead (e.g. it is magnitudes easier to learn calculus than to invent it). It is hard to make serious predictions without understanding how to lead in certain niches and a broad overview of the economy will not tell us too much about specific sectors. There's plenty of niches that Europe leads the US (and China) in too. But the conversation is all pretty complicated. And success in one sector or niche does not seem to be a strong predictor of innovation in others. Similarly success in catching up does not seem to be a strong predictor of ability to lead. This is all related to the Middle Income trap and China has probably come out the other side but it's not clear yet and this is all very fuzzy. FWIW, I want to see more competition on the global scale. Everyone benefits if there is healthy competition. Though this can also lead to war if things get too competitive. But if our main method of \"war\" is \"making shit better and cheaper so everyone buys from us\" then bring it on!

Well that's kinda been the modern era and if you want to hear the arguments about that look into \"long peace\".

Selling to consumers means each one will judge and pay only for the value they see from your product; which means everything hinges on your product's value to many individual users, rather than a small group of stakeholders looking for a very specific set of benefits (ones you can often build for as they ask for it!) One major reason B2C companies charge a subscription fee is because they need to show to investors that the product provides customer lifetime value: not a one-off value-add, and that there is a grow-able user base locked in to the product. reply supportengineer 3 hours agoparentprevIs it really “tech” if the premise of your company is to skirt or break well established laws? reply matrix87 13 hours agoparentprev> Unfortunately most of the game-changing tech isn’t going to be low capex moving forward.

I agree with the assumption, but I believe that the difference is that in the last 10 years you could have some scrappy machines or free-tier machines in any public cloud provider and have an MVP ready to show it only using software. For Military Tech/Deep Tech there's no way to do that since the intensity of capital its so high that even if someone trust you to deliver something and write a 500K check the burn rate will kill your company in 6 months; plus all procurement process for it if you going to sell it to any western government. For instance: I was working in a product to monitor military excercise/disguised build-ups via mixture of aerial images and probing and talking with one innovation branch of a european miitary they told that even if I came up with a finished product I need to pass to several procurement approvals and it could take at least 4 years; and in the meantime I could not even offer that to other places.

People talk about acquihires all the time but I think the bottom line to them is \"most startups fail\". YC isn't a fix for this; it simply accounts for the phenomenon by funding way more startups than other investors. There's a fun \"human capital\" vs. \"signaling\" argument to have here --- shocked, shocked! that YC would manage to re-invent the core controversy of higher education --- but just drastically increasing luck surface area is a pretty powerful idea, or seems that way.

The vast majority of (early stage) deals I've seen started at 2-3x preference. To be clear, I don't have any insider info on YC contracts and I'm not claiming that's where they make the bulk of their profits. But between my short time at a VC firm, the number of founders & early employees I know who have been screwed over by the practice (including myself), and >1X liquidation preference being such a pervasive clause, I suspect it's a rather significant fraction of software tech VC ROI. In practice acquihires help round out the numbers for LP presentations until the unicorns bear the real profitable fruit. reply tptacek 12 hours agorootparentThe YC deal documents are famously public, right?

Nowadays you need to have a really good prototype and if you want to do something really amazing you probably need a lot of computational power in order to expand it and scale it. Also the complexity of software development is greater. In reality Moore's law made computational power more cheaper so actually it shouldn't be really a problem but startups overall burn a lot of money on computational power(hosting, bandwidth etc.) Back on the early days; YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim said in 2006 [0] that perhaps any CS undergrad could've coded any of the internet's early killer apps in a few weeks but the scaling them would be whole another problem, scaling in this context meaning acquiring users. My opinion is that you can still spin an amazing website relatively fast but then you need to improve UX, create your mobile presence(make mobile apps) etc. etc. Whole lot more hassle than it was in the early days when mobile phone internet and mobile apps were irrelevant.

I suppose what we really need—and don’t have—is an accelerator for companies like SpaceX. In a sense, by making entry to lower orbit affordable, you peel back a lot of the risks that startups would have had to mitigate themselves. In that way, it functions as a kind of accelerator, which is the point. But I think more generally, it’s true what he says: where’s our progress in the world of atoms? We probably need to start accelerators focused specifically on that, not just on “let’s pitch this to the limited partners, get those sweet, quick returns,” and create the next air quotes “unicorn” company. I think you need an institutional-scale endeavor committed to that, like what Y Combinator has, as has been said, “lower-hanging fruit” of progressing bit-based startups! reply lumost 5 hours agorootparentI spent some time understanding early stage VC back in 2022/2023.

It feels like a good thing for society if everyone has that attitude of \"do the right thing\". But I also feel that it's important not to be naive: the sad/harsh reality is that there are people and bodies and organisations out there who will exploit others, and will use their gains to further carry on exploiting. Now obviously, \"exploiting\" here is paying huge salaries, shiny offices etc. but I think HN is generally in agreement that Amazon is one of those organisations that regularly oversteps the mark with employee rights/respect. If we accept that, then I have a really hard time shaking the idea that responding to them making employees lives hard by continuing to perform above average is no different to appeasing an alligator. What if employers exploit employees because they know there will always be employees who respond to it like this? It kind of makes sense. If we accept that, then all of a sudden \"I'm doing the right thing of working hard for my own moral compass\" becomes \"I'm helping the bad guys because, because it makes me feel better\". Again, I'm aware that thinking about this in terms of \"exploitation\" and \"suckers\" is a little extreme, but thinking about it in terms of incentives: isn't this person letting their moral compass incentivise a behaviour they object so much to that they're looking to leave? edit: for clarity, I do hugely respect working hard for personal motivation of \"doing the right thing\", and I have taken this approach before. But when I got older, and reflected, I concluded I let my own ego enable things which make the world a worse place, which is a bigger no-no for me personally.

I get it, I also like to WFH if I can instead of commuting, but working from the office is not the same as working with hazardous substances both legally and as a apples to apples take. Working in hazardous environments is outlawed (unless proper care is taken), working from the office is not outlawed. If you want working from the office to be outlawed as a health hazard you'll have to convince the government to do that as part of OHSA and labor laws but good luck getting any workers' sympathy that commuting to work in your cushy air conditioned office is not to your taste from the likes of those doing landscaping or roofing. Otherwise we can stretch the definition endlessly to working with Windows, Agile, Scrum, Teams and Jira is a health hazard and should be also outlawed because I just don't like them, but me not liking something is not enough to make it outlawed. reply kstrauser 4 hours agorootparentYep, those are indeed not the same thing, and that’s why I said they’re not the same thing. The point was that “if you don’t like it, leave” is a terrible reply to any complaint about a working environment.

Why is it a terrible reply? What should you do if you don't like your job? What's your point here? Most people on the planet do jobs they don't like, welcome to reality. Otherwise we'd all be racecar drivers, twitch streamers, musicians and painters and get paid for our hobbies, but that's not how it works for most people. We do a job not because we always like it or like everything about it, we do it to pay for food, shelter and if money allows, to afford hobbies and leisure that make life nice.

That's only what you implied, not what I said. If simply demanding stuff from your current employer would just work then there wouldn't be so many unhappy workers everywhere. But that's not it works in the real world. The only language employers understand is the \"F you, I quit\" part. >I am of the opinion that everyone who can, should have this option regardless of the market situation That's nice but how do you propose that to happen? Did you see any workers rioting on the streets to have remote work as a guaranteed labor right? No? Then you can forget about it. All rights and perk that labor currently has, like the 8h workday, free healthcare, paid vacation days, paid sick leave, have been won only through blood and conflict. It's not like your government is ever gonna hold a referendum and ask workers how many paid vacation days do you want to have and everyone gets to choose.

If you factor in just the time spent driving, suddenly smoking a pack a day is better for your lifespan than being in an office. reply Yizahi 7 hours agorootparentprevHand in the blender can be healed for a few tens of thousands of dollars and a year of rehab probably. Commute to office takes approximately one full month of human life every year, unpaid and uncompensated. So that's actually a very reasonable comparison.

I’ve worked in offices enough decades to have sufficient data: I strongly prefer WFH. “Maybe you’ll like it this time!” is weak sauce. I’m not a delicate flower who couldn’t RTO if situations demanded it. I would not help me do a better job for my company, though, and I don’t want to. This is academic for me.

It's fairly toothless in most jurisdictions since businesses can just say it's unreasonable and not elaborate. reply Vinnl 10 hours agorootparentprevThey force the employer to give a reason, and that reason has to be \"reasonable\", i.e. can be fought in courts if it's \"that's just how we do it here\". reply JW_00000 11 hours agorootparentprevThe idea behind those laws is you cannot be fired for asking this. reply 627467 12 hours agorootparentprevProbably forcing the creation of a paper trail for possible future litigation reply lazide 7 hours agorootparentprevMost cases do have some notable restrictions on that. For instance, requesting sex in exchange for money is illegal in most places. Requesting someone commit a crime on your behalf in exchange for money or other compensation as well (conspiracy, usually). Several other examples too - requesting someone fix their prices, agree to not compete with you in exchange for the same, etc. reply lnsru 12 hours agorootparentprevWhere is this legal right to work from home? It does not exist in Germany as well as in couple northern countries. Is this a thing for Netherlands? reply systemtest 5 hours agorootparentThere is no legal right to work from home in The Netherlands. The only law we have is that an employer should give you a good reason to work from the office. reply d1sxeyes 11 hours agorootparentprevThink so. It's also (sort of) true where I work (Hungary) if you are a parent of a child under the age of 7. It's not so much an automatic right as the right to request alternative work arrangements (home office, flexitime, etc.), and your employer can't just say 'no', they have to demonstrate the reasons that that's not acceptable (whatever arrangement you requested). reply antimemetics 13 hours agorootparentprev> Employees have a legal right to work from home Sorry but that’s a fantasy. I live in Germany and that is 100% not the case here. You might be able to negotiate it if you are an especially valuable employee but normally no chance reply moooo99 12 hours agorootparentI agree on the Germany perspective here. Although I may add, from my experience and what I observed on media, the return to office push post Covid wasn’t nearly as extreme here in Germany as it was in the US. I and my entire department still work mostly from home, with 2-3 days/month onsite. Pre Covid this would have been unimaginable, now there are multiple departments operating this way reply Kirth 10 hours agorootparentprevYes, German work/employment culture is a crab barrel where every quality of life improvement has to be fought for tooth and nail..

Which to me is the sane option. reply nfriedly 5 hours agorootparentprevYes, US perspective. Many employers here are similarly persnickety about being on-site, but there are also some good ones that are open to remote work and a few that are fully remote. It's been 10+ years since I did freelance, but I was fully remote then too, FWIW. reply reacharavindh 10 hours agorootparentprevAs long as we are sharing anecdotes, I can share mine from the Netherlands as well. Employer sanely leaves it to the team to decide how often to work from office. My team decided to work from home but meet at office atleast once in 2 months. There are other teams within the company that works practically 100% at office because they like it, and it makes their job easier. I do know atleast a few other companies where I worked at or have friends working at in the Netherlands with similar WFH setup. reply Vinnl 10 hours agorootparentprevThere are definitely jobs that allow WFH in the Netherlands. And there are loads that allow some hybrid form. reply sulandor 11 hours agorootparentprev> I guess it's better to watch it burn than to allow WFH. i guess there are a lot of companies have not yet found a way to manage wfh for overall satisfaction, which massively burdens morale and hence they face the decision of doing something or watch it burn. reply zb1plus 11 hours agoprevIdk why Amazon employees aren't unionizing over this. A major AWS outage due to striking employees could hit them where it hurts and make Amazon's management realize how stupid they are to consider this policy change. reply indrora 1 hour agoparentFormer AWS here. I mentioned unionization on my personal social media account and was approached by legal that I should “consider my public statements about my job carefully.” It is well known that Amazon hires organizations like the Pinkertons to break up unionization efforts at all levels, even going as far as to bait union supporters into signing fake union interest forms on false pretense and then attrition-fire individuals who signed by giving them no hours, pushing them into ineffective or frustrating conditions, PIPs, etc. reply sleight42 29 minutes agorootparentHow are they not brought up on charges for this? reply valbaca 11 minutes agorootparentThey are: https://amp.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/03/amazon-un... reply janalsncm 11 hours agoparentprevThe actual answer to your question, besides the fact that all of us SDEs consider ourselves exceptional at our jobs, is that there are a lot of people whose immigration status depends on their job. They can’t strike. For that and other reasons, Amazon knows they can do what they want. I would love for labor to get a win, but it’s easy for me to say since I don’t work at Amazon. Someone else should bell the cat. reply relaxing 7 hours agorootparentLet them try to run the operation on a skeleton crew. reply clayhacks 2 hours agoparentprevI just joined Amazon but I’m definitely on board for unionization. Just need to figure out who else is. It seems like the real solution here is a collective unit to bargain with management to say no 5 days is not necessary. And probably get some other benefits too. But given amazons anti-union tactics in the warehouses I can’t imagine they’d be friendly to a corporate union either reply VirusNewbie 9 minutes agoparentprev>Idk why Amazon employees aren't unionizing over this Because the people most likely to unionize are exactly the people Amazon dosn't care that much about.

It's the rest who are the loudest complainers. reply swisniewski 13 hours agoprevHave you had a conversation with your manager? If the policy requires S-Team approval, it could be hard at the SDE 3 level, though it should be much easier at the PE level. If your Director is willing to go to bat, and you have a track record, it’s not unachievable. TBH, the policy is likely not aimed you… Though I will say…back in my AWS days, I did gain a bunch from being able to drop into Mark Brooker’s office and ask questions about distributed systems. I didn’t get always like it… but I learned a lot from it. If you have a solid performance argument in your favor, make it and see what happens. Worse case, they say “no” and you leave anyways. reply devsda 12 hours agoparent> Worse case, they say “no” and you leave anyways. If they say no, for some it puts self-imposed (imaginary) pressure to leave as soon as possible and that can lead to accepting mediocre offers. It's better to try this only if you are someone who can give enough time for job search in case of a rejection and not rush things. reply larubbio 4 hours agoprevI left Amazon back when the 3-day RTO was announced. Their recruiters periodically ping and ask if I'd be interested in returning. So leaving on good terms will give you options to return if you want. I haven't seen a recent who's hiring post, but searching for the most recent one can help you find jobs that are hybrid or remote friendly. Also the startup I went to after I left is fully remote and hiring, my email is in my profile. reply gigatexal 12 hours agoprevHi OP I hope you figure this out. As most folks are saying if you’re a talented Amazon engineer basically you’ll have the “pick of the litter”, companies should be fawning over you. I think you’ll be fine finding new work be it at Microsoft or Google or at a bank like JPMorgan or a startup. Of course be sure they do fully remote before applying or during the process but I think you’ll be fine. You’re a SDE3 at Amazon! Pivoting to an unrelated thing: do you know the PM for Redshift? I don’t want to shit on the team but Redshift compared to BigQuery or Snowflake sucks. It’s missing features both at the SQL level and the developer UX level. For example the amount of hoops one has to go through to create an external table against S3 of parquet files is far more involved and annoying than say defining one against GCS on BigQuery. I’ve tried engaging in conversation with Amazon people on LinkedIn or otherwise to no avail. I just want to know what the roadmap holds and if there will be more efforts to bring it to parity with its main competitors. I figured it was a long shot to ask but considering you’re a DB focused dev I thought I’d try. reply throwawayawsaws 10 hours agoprevI quit when they introduced the 3-days RTO last year. I just called few people that called me for years and landed a new job within a month. It also came with the raise, as I was approaching the cliff. Just pick on of the competitors of the AWS product you're working on. reply keyle 14 hours agoprevTalk to your manager and try to explain that it doesn't work for you, try and approach it like it's not reasonable in your case to demand 5 days a week - they talk about whenever humanly possible in the memo, I didn't read it in details, but you might be able to sway the fact that it won't work for you your way. Do not mention quitting over it though, or you'll definitely go straight into the HR crosshair. If you're done with Amazon, apply to local startups. Likely you won't get the same kind of money, but you might be happier and \"you've got that on your resume\". reply josh2600 14 hours agoprevWe’re hiring for these roles, fully remote.

Doubly so if your db-focus touches on vector search. The timing is a tricky one, though.

Nearly all the founders are non technical and have the same problem, no tech talent to build their product and no funding to to hire one. But you could get a significant percentage of the business if you become a co-founder and you would basically have the pick of the bunch. You probably don't even have to leave amazon if you can smash out a quick prototype over a weekend, then only leave if they get funding and the startup takes off. reply RussianCow 12 hours agoparentThis is terrible advice.

I'm not sure on remote devs, as honestly, biotech isn't really dev heavy (much to it's detriment). I'd look at the larger players in the space for jobs there, as they will likely be working in Canada too and may need help with local law compliance. If you're looking to switch things up, compliance is a very boring but deadly necessary sector of biotech that always needs people.

    "originBody": "rga: ripgrep, but also search in PDFs, E-Books, Office documents, zip, tar.gz, etc. rga is a line-oriented search tool that allows you to look for a regex in a multitude of file types. rga wraps the awesome ripgrep and enables it to search in pdf, docx, sqlite, jpg, movie subtitles (mkv, mp4), etc. For more detail, see this introductory blogpost: https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2019/rga--ripgrep-for-zip-targz-docx-odt-epub-jpg/ rga will recursively descend into archives and match text in every file type it knows. Here is an example directory with different file types: demo/ ├── greeting.mkv ├── hello.odt ├── hello.sqlite3 └── somearchive.zip ├── dir │ ├── greeting.docx │ └── inner.tar.gz │ └── greeting.pdf └── greeting.epub Integration with fzf See the wiki for instructions of integrating rga with fzf. INSTALLATION Linux x64, macOS and Windows binaries are available in GitHub Releases. Linux Arch Linux pacman -S ripgrep-all Nix nix-env -iA nixpkgs.ripgrep-all Debian-based download the rga binary and get the dependencies like this: apt install ripgrep pandoc poppler-utils ffmpeg If ripgrep is not included in your package sources, get it from here. rga will search for all binaries it calls in $PATH and the directory itself is in. Windows Note that installing via chocolatey or scoop is the only supported download method. If you download the binary from releases manually, you will not get the dependencies (for example pdftotext from poppler). If you get an error like VCRUNTIME140.DLL could not be found, you need to install vc_redist.x64.exe. Chocolatey choco install ripgrep-all Scoop scoop install rga Homebrew/Linuxbrew rga can be installed with Homebrew: brew install rga To install the dependencies that are each not strictly necessary but very useful: brew install pandoc poppler ffmpeg MacPorts rga can also be installed on macOS via MacPorts: sudo port install ripgrep-all Compile from source rga should compile with stable Rust (v1.75.0+, check with rustc --version). To build it, run the following (or the equivalent in your OS): ~$ apt install build-essential pandoc poppler-utils ffmpeg ripgrep cargo ~$ cargo install --locked ripgrep_all ~$ rga --version # this should work now Available Adapters rga works with adapters that adapt various file formats. It comes with a few adapters integrated: rga --rga-list-adapters You can also add custom adapters. See the wiki for more information. Adapters: pandoc Uses pandoc to convert binary/unreadable text documents to plain markdown-like text Runs: pandoc --from= --to=plain --wrap=none --markdown-headings=atx Extensions: .epub, .odt, .docx, .fb2, .ipynb, .html, .htm poppler Uses pdftotext (from poppler-utils) to extract plain text from PDF files Runs: pdftotext - - Extensions: .pdf Mime Types: application/pdf postprocpagebreaks Adds the page number to each line for an input file that specifies page breaks as ascii page break character. Mainly to be used internally by the poppler adapter. Extensions: .asciipagebreaks ffmpeg Uses ffmpeg to extract video metadata/chapters, subtitles, lyrics, and other metadata Extensions: .mkv, .mp4, .avi, .mp3, .ogg, .flac, .webm zip Reads a zip file as a stream and recurses down into its contents Extensions: .zip, .jar Mime Types: application/zip decompress Reads compressed file as a stream and runs a different extractor on the contents. Extensions: .als, .bz2, .gz, .tbz, .tbz2, .tgz, .xz, .zst Mime Types: application/gzip, application/x-bzip, application/x-xz, application/zstd tar Reads a tar file as a stream and recurses down into its contents Extensions: .tar sqlite Uses sqlite bindings to convert sqlite databases into a simple plain text format Extensions: .db, .db3, .sqlite, .sqlite3 Mime Types: application/x-sqlite3 The following adapters are disabled by default, and can be enabled using '--rga-adapters=+foo,bar': mail Reads mailbox/mail files and runs extractors on the contents and attachments. Extensions: .mbox, .mbx, .eml Mime Types: application/mbox, message/rfc822 USAGE: rga [RGA OPTIONS] [RG OPTIONS] PATTERN [PATH ...] FLAGS: --rga-accurate Use more accurate but slower matching by mime type By default, rga will match files using file extensions. Some programs, such as sqlite3, don't care about the file extension at all, so users sometimes use any or no extension at all. With this flag, rga will try to detect the mime type of input files using the magic bytes (similar to the `file` utility), and use that to choose the adapter. Detection is only done on the first 8KiB of the file, since we can't always seek on the input (in archives). --rga-no-cache Disable caching of results By default, rga caches the extracted text, if it is small enough, to a database in ${XDG_CACHE_DIR-~/.cache}/ripgrep-all on Linux, ~/Library/Caches/ripgrep-all on macOS, or C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Local\\ripgrep-all on Windows. This way, repeated searches on the same set of files will be much faster. If you pass this flag, all caching will be disabled. -h, --help Prints help information --rga-list-adapters List all known adapters --rga-print-config-schema Print the JSON Schema of the configuration file --rg-help Show help for ripgrep itself --rg-version Show version of ripgrep itself -V, --version Prints version information OPTIONS: --rga-adapters=...

Is it mainly table metadata and properties? Asking because running queries, history, formatting of results etc. can be achieved by configuring psqlrc. reply achristmascarl 6 hours agoparenta big one for me is being able to jump between/search for tables and preview their rows, columns, and indexes quickly; especially when there are many tables/schemas and i don't remember their names another one is a more comfortable editing experience for queries reply jonathanyc 3 hours agorootparentI didn’t learn this until recently but in psql you can use \\e or \\editor to open the current line in $EDITOR. It helps a lot. reply jonathanyc 11 hours agoparentprevNot OP, but I personally put off using a UI for years before finally trying a few and eventually settling on Postico for Mac. I still jump to psql often, but for me it's an accumulation of small quality-of-life improvements: - results are formatted nicely by default; no more doing a first query, getting too many columns so results wrap unreadably, then changing the columns for a second query, and so on - manually editing rows is as easy as with a spreadsheet; of course hopefully you don't have to do this often... - I can change common filters & sorts in the UI with a few clicks instead of having to change SQL; sure, the SQL would only require typing a few characters, but if it's 2 clicks vs. 8 characters, it's still a small win Downsides are: - the GUI has an interface for saving queries, but it refuses to let me save them to a subfolder of my project; it wants to save them all in some global location. This doesn't seem good for sharing queries - if you are doing more complicated sorting or aggregation, it's still easier to just go to psql than to fiddle with the GUI reply wazoox 10 hours agorootparentFor results formatting, line selection, etc simply installing pspg as your psql pager helps a lot. reply achristmascarl 6 hours agorootparentoh wow, if i had known about pspg beforehand i might not have made this, it looks great! reply codesnik 10 hours agorootparentprevwould symlinks in that global location help, maybe? reply jonathanyc 3 hours agorootparentIt’s a good idea! For some reason Postico’s built-in query viewer doesn’t seem to follow them, unfortunately. reply ellisv 5 hours agoprevLooks pretty cool. I could see this being useful for some of my coworkers.

Not sure if that would be a viable option in Rust. reply benterix 6 hours agoprevI'm new to Rust, can someone tell me if that's good Rust code I could learn from? https://github.com/achristmascarl/rainfrog/blob/main/src/app... reply Icathian 5 hours agoparentI only looked at the linked file, so I'm not going to speak to the rest of the code and don't really have a good grasp of the architecture here. This seems mostly ok. The only thing that (imo) wouldn't pass code review is that big honking loop at https://github.com/achristmascarl/rainfrog/blob/main/src/app.... That thing needs to be refactored down to be readable, with individual logic chunks being put into their own functions and tidied up a bit. That's not really Rust-specific, obviously, but all the `match` and `if let` and whatever other Rust stuff looks fine, so it's what I've got. reply achristmascarl 5 hours agoparentprevnope :) reply achristmascarl 5 hours agorootparenton a more serious note, the library i used for the query editor, tui-textarea [0], is very well done, and the other db tui i drew inspiration from, gobang[1], is a great example of a ratatui app. would recommend checking those out [0] https://github.com/rhysd/tui-textarea [1] https://github.com/TaKO8Ki/gobang reply dmd 5 hours agorootparentprev(People downvoting this: that's the author.) reply askvictor 11 hours agoprevLooking forward to trying it, though would be nice if credentials could be specified in a different way than on the command line (whereby they'll get saved into your command line history). reply pcthrowaway 7 hours agoparentGenerally if you put a space before your command it'll bypass the history, though depending on your *nix you might need to set `HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth` in your bashrc or similar if it's not already. reply tbrb 10 hours agoparentprevAgree that it would be nice to specify credentials a different way - however as a workaround: some bash-based shells support prefixing the command with a space as a way of not saving that command into history.

Has something changed in Wayland which makes child windows unworkable? reply cies 5 hours agorootparentWhy dumb? Just a question to me, I gladly elaborate. If I loose a connection I used to get a little popup in the bottom right corner when I try to execute a query, explaining why it's not executing. They now popup in the middle of the screen and are much larger. I remember I had to close them by hand at some point, but maybe I'm wrong because I just reproduced it and they closed themselves quickly. Only this little popups annoy me. The bigger child windows behave the same. (The 2-3 child windows that show on app startup --flash, tip-of-the-day, and another one-- are quite annoying though and according to my colleagues it's not possible to enforce a setting that stop them from showing; but these were already annoying on Xorg) reply ktaube 10 hours agoprev [–] Been seeing lots of cool TUIs built with ratatui. Can anyone offer a comparison between ratatui and Golang https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea? I've been wanting to get into building a TUI but can't decide which library to pick. reply kjuulh 8 hours agoparentI've been using both. Charm/bubbletea toolstack, is very much focused on an ELM style architecture, I.e. message passing and deriving UI from state. You can still do immediate type UI if that is what you prefer, but it won't fit with any of the standard components. Bubbletea is a framework more or less, so even if you know Go, it will require you to learn how to build to its strengths. Ratatui is by default not very opinionated about how to handle state and updates, which requires some development from you, or using a third party library to get an opinionated architecture around it. Ratatui is more of a collection of libraries, out of the box, it expects a certain interface for components, but it is up to you how you want to compose them together. Whether that is immediate-, stateful-, react-, or ELM style. Stateful is the default for all their examples. Charms way of doing terminal UI is very much based around strings, which can sometimes give issues with spacing, as components can be fiddly to be constrained within a certain space. Ratatui creates UI on top of a matrix of bytes, which makes it more difficult to do easy things, but allows you to more easily build complex uis. Generally I prefer Ratatui, as you can really build robust and fast uis on top of it. It does take a bit more work to get started though. I am also biased by Rust tho. reply joshka 8 hours agorootparentRatatui maintainer here. I'd agree with all of the above points. The lack of opinionated approach stems from Ratatui being not a framework, but a library (you call us, we don't call you), and not having any of the event/input handling things included. There's likely room for a framework or two on top of it. reply Rizu 9 hours agoparentprev [–] I second this, could some also add C#'s \"Spectre.Console\" https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console reply viraptor 6 hours agorootparent [–] I found it but great in handling interactivity compared to https://github.com/gui-cs/Terminal.Gui reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

A piece of hardware so good that it survived working correctly 47 years in a hostile environment, driven by a computer with the power of modern car key. Amazing. reply LinuxBender 5 hours agoparentYou can agree with me or not I agree with you entirely. I can not think of a single piece of tech with the complexity of Voyager that has been battle hardened and resilient to last that long, keep doing what it was designed to do without a major on-site overhaul, upgrade or tech refresh. Certainly not any of our current satellites or anything created since Voyager. I think I know why this will never occur again but that's a much bigger topic. reply pbronez 3 hours agorootparent> I think I know why this will never occur again but that's a much bigger topic. I'd read that blog post reply atoav 10 hours agoparentprevAgreed, and to me as a electronics/software engineer it serves as a constant reminder that if you want things to be reliable, sometimes less of the right stuff can indeed be more. reply dTal 8 hours agoparentprev>driven by a computer with the power of modern car key I appreciate the sentiment, but perhaps it is the car key which is impressive here... reply rollcat 8 hours agorootparentNot necessarily. The car key seems inevitable in retrospect. Both Voyagers have had decades of opportunities for something to go irreparably wrong. Let's see if that car key will still be functional in 50 years, and then pass judgement. reply prettyStandard 7 hours agorootparentprevAs I'm on my 3rd car key for a car I've had about 8 years. Nevermind I disassemble the key and clean the button and battery terminals. reply xboxnolifes 2 hours agorootparentprevIf one controls an entire space ship, and the other can unlock a few doors, which is more impressive? reply corint 9 hours agoparentprevIt's incredible. The engineers who designed and built those spacecraft were brilliant. I'll raise a glass to their work! reply billpg 8 hours agoparentprevIt took a rather embarrassing amount of time before I realised you weren't saying \"Voyager Half\". reply yashg 12 hours agoprevA radio signal takes more than 22 hours to reach Voyager 1. And it would take the same to get a response back. Incredible. And imagine the patience needed to send commands and wait for the outcome on the part of the engineering team. You can't afford to send a wrong command and have the luxury of undo. Also, I wonder how many generations of engineers must have worked on the project by now. reply akira2501 11 hours agoparentYou characterize every single piece of equipment on platform so you can do somewhat accurate simulations. The shuttle flew most of the critical phases of their missions on the ground before ever uploading the code into an actual shuttle computer. The simulation system was continuously updated with real world performance information so it's accuracy continually improves. You also have a command processor on the spacecraft side. It will have some of these characterizations present as limits on command authority. Commands sent without override that exceed these limits will be ignored, possibly cancelling the entire sequence of dependent commands. You can demand that these limits be ignored but this obviously requires you to specify it redundantly in the message set. Should anything happen your flight software is generally going to go into a recovery mode. Voyager will try this 4 times after a period of no commands triggers a watchdog. This will switch on different radios while keeping them oriented towards the Earth in a constant effort to reacquire the command signals. Should this process fail a backup flight software mode will then activate which performs basic mission functions on a continuous loop so whatever continues to operate on the spacecraft will transmit it's data automatically back to the Earth at it's highest power setting. Voyager was a continuation of some of the Viking hardware and flight systems. reply ForHackernews 9 hours agorootparent> You characterize every single piece of equipment on platform so you can do somewhat accurate simulations. The shuttle flew most of the critical phases of their missions on the ground before ever uploading the code into an actual shuttle computer. The simulation system was continuously updated with real world performance information so it's accuracy continually improves. This is not true of the Voyager probes: > Newer NASA missions have hardware and software simulators on the ground, where engineers can test new procedures to make sure they do no harm when they uplink commands to the real spacecraft. Due to its age, Voyager doesn't have any ground simulators, and much of the mission's original design documentation remains in paper form and hasn't been digitized. https://www.wired.com/story/nasa-repair-voyager-1-spacecraft... reply akira2501 1 hour agorootparentWhile it's true they don't have a standing ground segment simulator, you'd be very wrong to think they didn't fly the craft in simulation before launch. As opposed to many other modern missions this craft is just flying for distance. It doesn't have to land anywhere or perform any complicated maneuvers. So a standing ground test platform wouldn't be particularly useful. The shuttle, our landers, and probes are obviously a different story. reply rwmj 4 hours agorootparentprev> much of the mission's original design documentation remains in paper form and hasn't been digitized. The cynic in me says this is why the mission has been so successful. Imagine if important documentation had been on some obsolete tape format. reply bigiain 12 hours agoparentprevI suspect most people who've ever been responsible for colo-ed unix-ish servers have learned to do something like: > ufw resetat now +5 minutes When doing \"dangerous\" things like updating firewall rules. I wonder if they have a way to send commands saying something like: Switch to thruster set 1, wriggle the antenna aim away and back to earth, wait 46 hours, if you do not receive \"all clear\" from earth switch back to thruster set 3 and re aim the antenna at earth. reply CogitoCogito 11 hours agorootparentSo obvious! But _no_ I haven't done this even though I have messed up remote servers where this would have helped. A bit embarrassed I didn't think of it myself, but thanks for the tip nonetheless! reply bigiain 11 hours agorootparentI also did not think of it myself, but had it shown to me by a greybeard after complaining about having messed up in exactly that way, and had to pay extortionate prices for \"hands on\" by someone at our colo facility... reply Brian_K_White 6 hours agorootparentprevNo I just always have a serial console and a power switch which are not affected by anything I can do on that box. reply minkles 10 hours agorootparentprevI still fuck them up after 20 years. Fortunately we have ILO / RAS cards in everything. reply quesera 10 hours agoparentprev> A radio signal takes more than 22 hours to reach Voyager 1 Voyager has a 23 watt radio and a 14 foot parabolic dish antenna, pointed directly at Earth which is presently 15 billion miles away. The corresponding earth ground station has a 100 foot dish and transmits at thousands of watts. It's astonishing to me that Voyager knows where Earth is at all. I imagine it uses Sol as a reference? Or maybe the high powered control signal carrier? Amazing stuff. reply Intralexical 10 hours agorootparent> It's astonishing to me that Voyager knows where Earth is at all. Wikipedia says that the high-gain antenna has a beamwidth of 0.5° for X-band, and 2.3° for S-band. You have: tan(0.5deg/2)*2*164astronomicalunit You want: astronomicalunit * 1.4311791 So it's so far that you could almost point it straight at the sun, and have the entire orbit of the Earth in the beam. 23 watts, spread out in a cone the size of a planetary orbit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#Communications reply quesera 4 hours agorootparentWhich correspondingly means that the received signal strength here on Earth is very low. Internet says approximately -160.48 dBm, which is one thousandth of the minimum strength that the most sensitive commercial FM radio receivers can discriminate. Hence the huge receiving dishes, and apparently one 100 foot dish alone does not collect enough energy to reconstruct the signal, so multiple are required at each Deep Space Network receiving station. And due to the rotation of the Earth, we need three DSN stations to maintain constant communication with Voyager. reply HPsquared 3 hours agorootparentI wonder if they could build a very large dish in Earth orbit. Probably cost prohibitive though. Also there's the power and cooling aspect when transporting... Would there be any advantage to a space based station? reply Rinzler89 10 hours agorootparentprev>It's astonishing to me that Voyager knows where Earth is at all It's not that astonishing when you realize astral navigation is what sailors hundreds of years ago did to navigate the seas. Just look at the stars with a sextant and with some basic trigonometry you'll know where you are exactly. The Apollo space crew had to do that by hand and eyes using a sextant too when the astral navigation computer failed. reply quesera 4 hours agorootparentIt would be astonishing if Voyager shipped in 1977 with computer vision capabilities that were capable of that level of object detection and discrimination and accuracy. Plus the detailed star maps for correlation. And all designed and built several years before launch! And in fact I think it's not possible. But orienting on Sol should be achievable. Even at 15 billion miles away, it's still surely the brightest thing in the sky. Presumably the orientation sensor is precisely in line with the parabolic antenna? reply dcl 10 hours agorootparentprevKnowing your longitude is very difficult without a clock... Can't do it with just stars iirc. reply fourgreen 6 hours agorootparentYou can determine your longitude without a clock, but achieving precision with this method is challenging. First, you need to observe the Moon's position relative to fixed stars, which gives you the UTC time. Then, observe the Sun's position relative to the horizon to determine the local time. By comparing the two, you can calculate your longitude. reply monkeyfun 5 hours agorootparentHow are you going to usefully use this information if you wouldn't have an obvious way to know precisely how long it's been between whenever you lost track of the moon and stars and whenever the sun is clearly visible over the horizon? reply quesera 4 hours agorootparentprevThis is true and there's a fascinating history for Earth-bound (little v) voyagers! But Voyager does not have this particular problem. :) reply rbanffy 9 hours agorootparentprevI think you can, with the Moon and where it is in relation to the Sun. reply secondcoming 7 hours agorootparentprevDoes voyager have optical sensors that detect planets? reply _joel 10 hours agorootparentprevhttps://space.stackexchange.com/questions/3093/how-does-the-... :) reply exe34 10 hours agorootparentprevI know trident uses the stars to avoid gps jammers, so presumably voyager can do something similar. reply tannhaeuser 11 hours agoparentprev> Also, I wonder how many generations of engineers must have worked on the project by now. Would've expected the generation raised on punch cards to be ideally suited for this kind of stunt, having learnt the hard way about the turnaround time for a bug (Donald Knuth quote about proving programs correct comes to mind), so I'd expect mission control, operators, and coders to be well in their 70s at least?

Not there's anything wrong with it ... reply bbarnett 12 hours agoparentprevYou can't afford to send a wrong command and have the luxury of undo. Indeed. We used to do this all the time. Cars without OTA updates, games and software shipped on disk or floppy or cd, all very make or break. reply DaoVeles 12 hours agorootparentAn aside but this is why I was blown away by Mario Odyssey on the Switch. While it did get patches to add a few new games modes and bonuses, there was nothing done to fix anything broken with the title because there wasn't anything. If you buy a physical copy from the last few years, there is no additional patch to download. They had all the issues sorted out before release, very rare nowadays. reply gambiting 10 hours agorootparentOh it definitely has bugs and glitches - tonnes of them in fact. It's just that Nintendo chooses not to fix them(not that they should, 90% of them are basically people actively trying to break stuff, although some I can see how you could do it accidentally). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWYmV0bs15w https://www.mariowiki.com/List_of_Super_Mario_Odyssey_glitch... And issues have been fixed in patches too, like the first glitch on that list that would lock your camera so you couldn't turn it - that was fixed in a patch. \"If Mario performs a Cap Throw at Talkatoo and talks to him at the same time, the camera will lock into place.[...] As of the February 21, 2018 update, this glitch is fixed\" But there are situations that will literally crash the game to the OS too: \"In the Bowser's Moon Wedding objective, if Mario falls into the lava just as he is about to capture Bowser, the game immediately crashes.\" reply Rinzler89 10 hours agorootparentprevThat's when QA and SW testing was still a job, before the age of cargo cults like Agile, Scrum and SV's \"move fast and break things\" took over. reply XorNot 9 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair OTA updates aren't \"low risk\" - the trick is that you make your OTA system rock-solid so a failure results in a device you can still OTA too. reply perihelions 11 hours agoprevAlso https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41517272 (\"NASA Pulls Off Delicate Thruster Swap, Keeping Voyager 1 Mission Alive\", 74 comments) reply Crazyontap 9 hours agoprevI've often thought that simpler technology tends to be more robust because it has fewer moving parts. This might be an apples-to-oranges comparison, but I've noticed that writing vanilla PHP or JavaScript code, while harder at first, results in more robust and easier-to-debug applications. On the other hand, using frameworks, ORMs, and other abstractions can make the codebase feel brittle and harder to maintain. reply rbanffy 9 hours agoparentSimplicity at one layer might mean more complexity on others - I prefer vanilla JS when possible (and modern browsers are quite good at that), but the conceptual simplicity of PHP pushes some complexity into the template rendering, and using database APIs directly do couple you to a certain way of storing data. reply lores 8 hours agorootparentAgreed, but I think there's something to be said for allowing light coupling sometimes. Anathema to \"proper\" design, but not uncommonly the overall complexity of a proper design makes maintenance harder, not less. I'd rather change a hardcoded SQL query than three layers of abstraction, myself; centralisation beats having to follow a trail of classes, and you always need a good test suite anyway. reply ajuc 9 hours agoparentprevThis is mostly because when you write from scratch you have to understand the whole control flow. Frameworks encourage learning stuff on \"as-needed\" basis, and you often don't know what you should know. So you do stuff on layer 3 because you can (and you already worked nearby), when it's already handled by layer 1 and reprocessed in layer 5. So you debug to see why you can't see changes and \"fix\" it on layer 7. And it seems to work. Repeat this over 100 changes and you create crazy mess. I've seen code that gets a list from the framework (already can't be null), checks if it's null, checks if it's empty. Makes it null if it's empty, then passes it through several more layers with null and emptiness checks on some of them, and then fails with NPE because there was no null check at n-th layer :) The person writting this code was in the proccess of adding another null check at the NPE line to \"fix the problem\" :) The solution was to remove all the custom code except for the final destination of that list :) I've written similarly bad code in some more complicated scenarios without realizing. reply irjustin 11 hours agoprevI'm so surprised it needs so many puffs per day (40?!) to keep the aircraft oriented at earth in space the vacuum of space where there's so much... vacuum. When I started the article I figured they'd correct for orientation once every 2 weeks or so. reply rob74 11 hours agoparentI guess it's not as much \"orienting it in the right direction and then just keeping it that way\" as it is a constant to-and-fro - the thrusters are probably not precise enough to keep it oriented towards earth, I imagine the range is extremely narrow by now? reply irjustin 11 hours agorootparentThen the 0.035mm would be a benefit! more puffs! I clearly have no idea what I'm talking about. reply akira2501 11 hours agoparentprevThat's a 90 minute cycle time. It's outside the heliosphere now so the Solar winds are no longer a nearly constant force in a single direction. So it experiences more \"turbulence.\" reply stevage 12 hours agoprevMultiple puffs of hydrazine every day to keep the craft stable, for more than 50 years? How big are these tanks? reply floppiplopp 12 hours agoparent100 kg apparently, supposedly providing fuel until 2034. Those are just very small puffs. reply throw310822 12 hours agorootparentAbout 680 thousand puffs so far (40 x 365 x 47). Also, \"When the team initially switched Voyager over to the trajectory correction thrusters six years ago, the tube opening was 0.01 inches (0.25 millimeters) across\". reply Aachen 8 hours agorootparent$ qalc > 100 kg / 680e3 approx. 147.06 mg Each puff would be When Voyager 1 lifted off to space on September 5, 1977, no one expected that the probe would still be operating today. This is kind of an odd statement :) When launched, I remember brief news broadcasts and articles in the local newspaper stating the engineers added abilities that were not approved hoping for a much longer life time. It never stated if they got in trouble. But lasting this long is quite an achievement. reply bArray 8 hours agoprevAre there examples of modern projects with this level of attention to detail and longevity? The team that worked on this have one hell of a legacy. reply rollcat 7 hours agoparentWell \"modern\" and \"longevity\" are kinda at odds with each other, so it may depend on where you choose your arbitrary cut-off point, but I'd say OpenBSD could be one such example. They do sometimes drop support for architectures (RIP VAX), but that usually happens when the last such box in question physically dies. Otherwise they've maintained their bi-yearly release cycle and kept the system small, clean, robust, and secure for what's now decades. http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20160309192510 Also, they are the upstream project for OpenSSH, which is among the most ubiquitous pieces of software on the planet.

The text does not provide any information on how the probe knows that it is off. It needs some kind of reference, no? reply perihelions 7 hours agoparentA star tracker is one of its reference points (of absolute orientation). There's also a sun sensor with a similar function.
