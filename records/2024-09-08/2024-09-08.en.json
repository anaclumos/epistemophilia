You shouldn't have to click on \"trending\" first. (When you are logged in, you see a list of featured papers on the homepage, which isn't as engaging as the \"trending\" page. Again, compare HN: Same homepage whether you're logged in or not.) - Ranking shouldn't be based on comment activity, which ranks controversial papers, rather papers should be voted on like comments. - It's slightly confusing that usernames allow spaces. It will also make it harder to implement some kind of @ functionality in the comments. - Use HTML rather then PDF. Something that could be trivial with HTML, like clicking on an image to show a bigger version, requires you to awkwardly zoom in with PDF. With HTML, you would also have one column, which would fit better with the split paper/comments view. reply impendia 5 hours agoparent> Use HTML rather then PDF. The PDF is the original paper, as it appears on arXiv, so using PDF is natural. In general academics prefer PDF to HTML. In part, this is just because our tooling produces PDFs, so this is easiest. But also, we tend to prefer that the formatting be semi-canonical, so that \"the bottom of page 7\" or \"three lines after Theorem 1.2\" are meaningful things to say and ask questions about. That said, the arXiv is rolling out an experimental LaTeX-to-HTML converter for those who prefer HTML, for those who usually prefer PDF but may be just browsing on their phone at the time, or for those who have accessibility issues with PDFs. I just checked this out for one of my own papers; it is not perfect, but it is pretty good, especially given that I did absolutely nothing to ensure that our work would look good in this format: https://arxiv.org/html/2404.00541v1 So it looks like we're converging towards having the best of both worlds. reply throw10920 4 hours agorootparent> In general academics prefer PDF to HTML. In part, this is just because our tooling produces PDFs, so this is easiest. The tooling producing PDF by default absolutely makes the preference for PDF justifiable. However, tooling is driven by usage - if more papers come with rendered HTML (e.g. through Pandoc if necessary), and people start preferring to consume HTML, then tooling support for HTML will improve. > But also, we tend to prefer that the formatting be semi-canonical, so that \"the bottom of page 7\" or \"three lines after Theorem 1.2\" are meaningful things to say and ask questions about. Couldn't you replace references like \"the bottom of page 7\" with others like \"two sentences after theorem 1.2\" that are layout-independent? This would also make it easier to rewrite parts of the paper without having to go back and fix all of your layout-dependent references when the layout shifts. HTML has strong advantages for both paper and electronic reading, so I think it's worth making an effort to adopt. When I print out a paper to take notes, the margins are usually too narrow for my note-taking, and I additionally have a preference for a narrow margin on one side and a wide margin on the other (on the same side, not alternating with page parity like a book), which virtually no paper has in its PDF representation. When I read a paper electronically, I want to eliminate pagination and read the entire thing as a single long page. Both of these things are significantly easier to do with HTML than LaTeX (and, in the case of the \"eliminate pagination\" case, I've never found a way to do it with LaTeX at all). (also, in general, HTML is just far more flexible and accessible than PDF for most people to modify to suit their preferences - I think most on HN would agree with that) reply michaelmior 3 hours agorootparent> Couldn't you replace references like \"the bottom of page 7\" with others like \"two sentences after theorem 1.2\" that are layout-independent? Yes, but I think such references are inherently harder to locate. Personally I try to just avoid making references to specific locations in the document and instead name anything that needs to be referenced (e.g. Figure 5, Theorem 3.2). reply throw10920 3 hours agorootparentYes, I absolutely agree - I just figured that there had to be a reason that someone would want to do that. Chesterton's Fence and whatnot. reply gwern 1 hour agorootparentprevI increasingly recommend against the Arxiv HTML version. I thought it had an acceptable start and they would fix the remaining problems and rapidly become on par with the PDF, but that seems to not be happening. The HTML version is seriously buggy; and the worst part is, a lot of those bugs take the form of silently dropping or hiding content. It's bad enough when half the paper is gone, because at least you notice that quickly, but it'll also do things like silently drop sections or figures, and you won't realize that until you hit a reference like 'as discussed in Section 3.1' and you wonder how you missed that. I filed like 25 bugs on their HTML pages, concentrating on the really big issues (minor typographic & styling issues are too legion to try to report), and AFAIK, not a single one has been fixed in a year+. Whatever resources they're devoting to it, it's apparently totally inadequate to the task. reply ethanol-brain 4 hours agorootparentprev> That said, the arXiv is rolling out an experimental LaTeX-to-HTML Some history: https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/ reply Retr0id 6 hours agoparentprev> rather papers should be voted on like comments. I don't think this is an inherently better approach, but maybe there should be an option for different ranking mechanisms. You could also rank by things like cite-frequency, cite-recency, \"cite pagerank\", etc. reply throwthrowuknow 5 hours agorootparentAgree, don’t sink a bunch of effort into creating a ranking algorithm. Expose metrics that users can sort or filter by which will work for both signed in and signed out. If you want to add more tools for signed in users then let them define their own filters that they can save like comment activity plus weighted by author, commenter, recency, topic etc. See the nntp discussion that was on here the other day. reply dartos 5 hours agorootparentprevYep. User driven ranking leads to people gaming the system for internet points. reply anamexis 5 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn't seem like citations would be good for discovery, because there must be a significant latency between when a paper is released and when citations start coming in. reply bee_rider 4 hours agorootparentProbably it would be best to just get a site on the web and expose a bunch of different metrics so people can sort by whatever. Citations are probably not the best metric for discovery, but also this really just makes me wonder if papers are not the best thing for discovery. An academic produces ideas, not papers, those are just a side-effect. The path is something like: * make a idea * write short conference papers about it * present it in conferences * write journal papers about it * maybe somebody writes a thesis about it (Talking to people about it throughout). If we want to discover ideas as they are being worked on, I guess we’d want some proxy that captures whether all that stuff is progressing, and if anybody has noticed… Finding that proxy seems incredibly difficult, maybe impossible. reply michaelmior 3 hours agorootparentI'm not sure I agree about papers just being a side effect. An idea by itself has significantly less value than an idea which has been clearly documented and evaluated. I think a paper is often still the best way to do this. reply throw_pm23 7 hours agoparentprevCounterpoint: please don't do any of the above and keep arxiv as it is. It is too valuable to mess it up, it is the few things on the internet that have not been ruined yet, and the \"comment activity\" can happen in the articles themselves at the scale of years, decades, and centuries. reply Epa095 6 hours agorootparentThis seems to be a completely different team than arxiv, making a discussion forum on the side. And I prefer this over discussions on 'X'. reply rehaanahmad 3 hours agoparentprevGreat idea, we'll look into making the home page the trending page soon. Regarding HTMl, our original site actually only supported HTML (because it was easier to build an annotator for an HTML page). the issue is that a good ~25% of these papers don't render properly which pisses off a lot of academics. Academics spend a lot of time making their papers look nice for PDF, so when someone comes along and refactors their entire paper in HTML, not everyone is a fan. That being said, I do think long term HTML makes a lot of sense for papers. It allows researchers to embed videos and other content (think, robotics papers!). At some point we do want to incorporate HTML papers back into the site (perhaps as a toggle). reply DoctorOetker 17 minutes agorootparentI apologize for changing topic here: Did you bulk download the arxiv metadata, PDF and or LaTeX files? I am trying to figure out what the required space is for just the most recent version of the PDF's. I can find mentions of the total size in their S3 bucket but unclear if that also includes older versions of the PDF's. I also wonder if the Kaggle dataset is kept up to date since it states merely 1.7M articles instead of 2.4 I read elsewhere. Edit: I just found the answers to my question here: https://info.arxiv.org/help/bulk_data_s3.html reply ZeroSolstice 2 hours agoparentprev> The frontpage should directly show the list of papers, like with HN. I disagree. There are numerous times where I have browsed the comments on a HN post where people haven't read the article and are just responding to the comment thread. The workflow for this seems a bit different in that a person would have already read a paper and wanted to read through existing discussions or respond to discussion. With that, having the search front and center would follow as the next steps for a person who read a paper and wanted to \"search\" for discussions related to that paper in particular. HN is more an aimless browsing which is a bit different than researching a specific area or topic. reply sestep 8 hours agoparentprevTiny note: Stack Exchange also allows spaces in display names, and they make @ functionality work regardless: https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/43020/297476 Agreed that it makes it more complicated though. reply diggan 6 hours agoparentprev> - Ranking shouldn't be based on comment activity, which ranks controversial papers, rather papers should be voted on like comments. How about not ranking things at all? I don't feel like things like this should be a popularity/\"like\" contest and instead let the content of the paper/comments speak for themselves. Yes, there will be some chaff to sort through when reading, but humanity will manage. Just sort things by updated/created/timestamp and all the content will be equal. reply gus_massa 5 hours agorootparentSorted by \"new\"... Most articles are not interesting, most of the interesting ones are interesting only for a niche of a few researchers. The front page will be flowed by uninteresting stuff. reply pessimizer 5 hours agorootparentprev> let the content of the paper/comments speak for themselves. People can't read everything, and have rely on others to filter up the good stuff. If you read something random, based on no recommendation, it's charity work (the odds are extremely good that it is bad) and you should recommend that thing to other people if it turns out to be useful. Ultimately, that's the entire point of any of this design: if we don't care about any of the metadata on the papers, they could just be numbered text files at an ftp site. The fewer things I have to read to find out they're shit, the longer life I have. I say the opposite: put a lot of thought into how papers are organized and categorized, how comments on papers are organized and categorized, the means through which papers can be suggested to users who may be interested in them, and the methods by which users can inject their opinions and comment into those processes. Figure out how to thwart ways this process can be gamed. Treat the content equally, don't force the content to be equal. Hacker News shouldn't just be the unfiltered new page. reply thornewolf 5 hours agorootparentprevthats ranking by recency, which means i can abuse it by churning low quality content out to arXive reply gradus_ad 4 hours agoparentprev> Ranking shouldn't be based on comment activity, which ranks controversial papers But don't we want people's attention drawn to controversial/conversation generating papers? The whole point of the platform is to drive conversation reply woodson 3 hours agorootparentThe concern may be about what effect this will have on future papers (just like news headlines engineered for clickbait). reply runningmike 3 hours agoparentprevMany people on earth have names with spaces. So good that a username can reflect a real name a person has. reply cgshep 4 hours agoprevTenured prof here. Every paper of mine goes on Arxiv with no exceptions, published under CC BY-NC-ND licenses. Some of us are working hard to overcome the system (e.g. look at the IACR's efforts). Unfortunately, academics are still hindered by institutional inertia; in fact, many prefer the status quo, usually those who rely on prestige over actual quality to advance their careers. reply michaelmior 3 hours agoparent> usually those who rely on prestige over actual quality to advance their careers Unfortunately for those of us pre-tenure, it's difficult to balance these as I'm sure you aware. We're evaluated by people who may have the best intentions, but don't work directly in our field. They then determine whether we keep our jobs. It's difficult not to consider prestige as a factor when you know those evaluating you will. reply gigatexal 2 hours agoparentprevThank you, thank you, thank you! I've no skin in the game (not an academic and a math idiot but I've a hole in my heart for Aaron Swartz and what he stood for) but I love that there are professors like yourself that believe in the free sharing of knowledge. reply chipdart 3 hours agoparentprev> (...) in fact, many prefer the status quo, usually those who rely on prestige over actual quality to advance their careers. Your comment doesn't read like one from anyone with any relationship with academia. If you had, you'd know that the issue is not a vacuous \"prestige\" but funding being dependent on hard metrics such as impact factor, and in some cases with metrics being collected exclusively from a set of established peer-reviewed journals that must be whitelisted. And ArXiv is not one of them. This means that a big share of academia has their professional and future, as well as their institution's ability to raise funding, dependent on them publishing on a small set of non-open peer-reviewed journals. Reading your post, you make it sound like anyone can just upload a random PDF to a random file server and call it a publication. That ain't it. If you fail to understand the problem, you certainly ain't the solution. reply BeetleB 2 hours agorootparent> Your comment doesn't read like one from anyone with any relationship with academia. Your comment reads likewise. He didn't say he publishes them exclusively on Arxiv. It's quite common for professors to post it there as well as submit to journals. Many (most?) journals allow for it - they don't insist the ones in arxiv be taken down - as long as they're posting preprints and not the final (copyrighted) version. As an academic, you should also know that practices vary widely with discipline. As an example: > dependent on them publishing on a small set of non-open peer-reviewed journals. IIRC, NIH grants require publishing in open peer-reviewed journals. Also, lots of disciplines are not heavily reliant on funding. In both universities I attended, the bulk of math professors did not even apply for grants! It's not required to get tenure (unlike engineering/physics). Also often true in some economics departments. As an aside, your comment violates a number of HN guidelines. reply dguest 3 hours agorootparentprevI all fairness, I don't think the grandparent post disagrees with anything that is in the parent post here. Yes, academia has tried to quantify prestige via impact factor and peer-reviewed journals. Yes, lots of people (even in Academia) feel that the system is being gamed, with by the publishing houses that own the journals being a common scapegoat. The system isn't broken, but it also keeps its integrity through some dynamic tension: a bit of criticism is a good thing. reply JadeNB 2 hours agorootparentprev> And ArXiv is not one of them. But putting your papers on the arXiv, as your parent said, doesn't mean you only put them on the arXiv. I put all my papers on the arXiv, but I also submit them for publication in journals that will help me make the case for funding and promotion. reply parpfish 3 hours agoparentprev> Tenured prof here. Yeah, but every pre-tenure or postdoc is like “I can’t fight the system right now, I need to publish enough to still have a job two years from now” reply DoctorOetker 2 hours agorootparenthelpful would be cheaper equipment and tools used in research, and unrestricted popular access to scientific literature reply Ar-Curunir 3 hours agoparentprevWhat do you mean by the IACR’s efforts here? In the crypto community it’s very much the norm to put everything on eprint, and it is very rare to find a crypto paper not on there reply parpfish 54 minutes agoprevJust had an idea that may help the moderation AND encourage higher levels of discourse — comments are not published immediately. When I was doing peer reviews, it would often take a day or more to read a paper, think it through, and then write up something thoughtful and constructive. If you introduce a mechanism to delay comments (eg, holding all messages for 24-72 hours before publishing or only releasing new comments on Monday mornings) it would: - encourage commenters to write longer thoughtful responses rather than short quick comment threads - reduce back and forth flame wars - ease the burden on moderators and give them time to do batches of work - see if multiple commenters come to the same conclusions/critiques to minimize bandwagon effects reply w-m 12 hours agoprevHey alphaxiv, you won’t let me claim some of my preprints, because there’s no match with the email address. Which there can’t be, as we’re only listing a generic first.last@org addresses in the papers. Tried the claiming process twice, nothing happened. Not all papers are on Orcid, so that doesn’t help. I think it’ll be hard growing a discussion platform, if there’s barriers of entry like that to even populate your profile. reply phreeza 12 hours agoparentHow would you propose making claiming possible without the risk of hijacking/misrepresentation? reply supriyo-biswas 8 hours agorootparentThe only way I see this working is for paper authors to include their public keys in the paper; preferably as metadata and have them produce a signed message using their private key which allows them to claim the paper. While the grandparent is understandably disappointed with the current implementation, relying on emails was always doomed from the start. reply michaelmior 3 hours agorootparentGiven that the paper would have be changed regardless, including the full email address is a relatively easy solution. ORCID is probably easier than requiring public keys and a lot of journals already require them. reply w-m 9 hours agorootparentprevThe data on which authors are part of which arxiv papers is already in the arXiv database, and in Google Scholar, and in other libraries. I appreciate that it's not an easy task to get that as a third party. But the burden should be on the operators of alphaxiv to figure out a solution for this platform to take off, not for me as a user? reply phreeza 8 hours agorootparentYea I agree it shouldn't be on you as a customer, was more asking out of curiosity. I don't think Google scholar has this fully solved either, I've seen many misattributed papers there. reply riedel 8 hours agorootparentprevThe claiming was 'solved' and ORCID, which both basically do no checking at all. It's just a yes/no clicking for fuzzy matched author name lists. So I guess it is enough until there is a dispute.

We are adding google scholar support soon. If your paper isn't on Scholar or ORCID, you will need to submit a claim that our team reviews.

It is a good idea in general to make sure that your papers contain up-to-date contact information. One way of doing this is to use an orc-id. reply azhenley 7 hours agorootparentprevI’ve never understood why we need emails in papers. Who sends emails to paper authors? How often do they respond? How fast do the email addresses go out of date? I lost access to my email address included in most my papers within 2 years of publication. I see little to no value to have it included in the paper. reply Maken 6 hours agorootparentI do email paper authors and I do respond to requests and inquiries about my own papers. Even if you don't work at the same institution any longer, most universities let you redirect your email for many years after you left. Also, I don't think we are yet at the point when human2human communication is not possible. reply azhenley 3 hours agorootparentYou don’t need emails in archival PDFs for human-to-human communication. reply xyst 5 hours agorootparentprev> Who sends emails to paper authors? I do when the paper is not easily available or the publisher charges some outrageous fee (have seen $50 for a paper in the past). Authors typically despise the publishers and are happy to share their work to anybody interested. reply azhenley 5 hours agorootparentFor sure. That is why I keep the preprint PDFs on my website (along with my current email address). reply CamperBob2 5 hours agorootparentprevWho sends emails to paper authors? I do, when I'd like to read a paper that's locked behind a paywall and not available on sci-hub. Authors of scientific papers are much like any other authors... they want to be read. The more enlightened among them understand that obscurity is a problem rather than a perk. They also tend to appreciate engagement in the form of follow-up questions (at least from people who actually read the paper.) Obviously it's not a major concern on arxiv, but in a larger historical sense, this type of communication was a key original application of email. reply azhenley 5 hours agorootparentIf an author wants to be read then they will keep the preprint PDFs on their website (along with their current email address). An added benefit is that Google Scholar indexes and links directly to the PDFs instead of the publisher website. reply Y_Y 11 hours agoparentprevSo you've put a fake email address on your papers? As in, one that you can't receive from? Why? reply chipdart 11 hours agorootparent> So you've put a fake email address on your papers? I think you're failing to understand the basics of the problem, and even the whole problem domain. Email addresses are not created/maintained for life. You can have an email address, them have your org change name and email provider switch, and not to mention that researchers leave research institutions and thus lose access to their accounts. You have multiple scenarios where papers can be published with authors using email addresses which they lose access to. reply limit499karma 1 hour agorootparentConflating email addresses with identity in the digital age is a global techical debt. reply gexaha 11 hours agorootparentprev> You have multiple scenarios where papers can be published with authors using email addresses which they lose access to. Btw, why is it considered normal? I think it would be much better to mention an e-mail, to which you will have (more-or-less) permament access. reply MereInterest 9 hours agorootparentHere’s an example. I have a firstname.lastname@gmail.com address, which was intended to be permanent. Google turned on two-factor authentication, despite not having a second form of authentication available. Instead, they required the recovery address for 2FA. The recovery address was another Gmail address, which I haven’t used since 2010, and which also had 2FA turned on using its recovery address. That was an SBCGlobal address, a company which has long since been purchased by AT&T, and the email address is entirely defunct. I place the blame here entirely on Google for misusing forms of identification. Two-factor authentication is having two locks on the same door, where recovery addresses are having two doors with separate locks. Using a recovery address for 2FA is absurd, and caused me to be locked out of my permanent email address. reply epanchin 8 hours agorootparent“I place the blame on Google because I didn’t update my recovery address to one that worked” reply MereInterest 8 hours agorootparentFirst, recovery addresses are for recovery when access has been lost. They are an alternate method of entry when the primary method of entry has been lost. They are NOT an extra method of validation to be used for the primary method of entry. When Google switched from offering 2FA to requiring 2FA, it would have been acceptable for them to require a second form of authentication to be added on the next log-in. It is not acceptable for Google to pretend that they have a second form of authentication when they do not. Second, up until the moment it was needed, I had access to my recovery address. Google locked me out of my primary address and my recovery address simultaneously. reply QuadmasterXLII 4 hours agorootparentprevDid you notice that the issue was that O0P had failed to update the recovery address of their recovery address, and google removed access to both the main email and the recovery email at the same time? reply chipdart 11 hours agorootparentprev> Btw, why is it considered normal? What leads you to believe it isn't normal? I mean, do you have an eternal email address? Have you ever switched jobs? Most papers are authored/co-authored by graduate students. Do you think all of them will hold onto their institutional address after they graduate? A big chunk of them will not even continue in the field. reply atoav 11 hours agorootparentprevWhy would you expect any institution to support all email addresses of their ex-employees ad infinitum? This would be a security nightmare for them. It is pretty normal for universities to have some sort of identity managmemt system that automatically provisions emails when you are employed there and deprovision them once you are gone. reply acka 9 hours agorootparentWhy not have a system where students and staff have actual email inboxes but alumni have their email forwarded? Most universities use a portal of some sort for easy access to personal information and preferences anyway, so it shouldn't be too difficult to limit access for alumni to only allow them to change a few personal details like name / address / phone number and the like, plus email forwarding settings. I think the extra cost is negligible compared to what universities already spend on alumni like newsletters, conferences, dinners, etc. reply oefrha 8 hours agorootparentIf I run a university IT system I certainly don’t want someone who possibly attended a program thirty years ago walking around with an apparent affiliation with my institution. I find my institutions’ policies of (IIRC) one year forwarding + permanent alumni email pretty reasonable. Additionally, making people who want to cold email work a little to acquire the current email address is actually a good thing, especially if they want to talk about something years old. I’ve generally had a lot more pleasant and engaging correspondence with people who worked out my email (say from a side project I develop pseudonymously) than ones who directly lifted my email from my professional profiles. So, expiring emails in papers generally isn’t a real problem anyway, and it’s basically never a hurdle if your target is still in academic circles. It only becomes a problem in this specific context of automated authentication (based on something not intended for that purpose). reply atoav 2 hours agorootparentprevI can't answer for everybody, but my (German) university is prohibited from doing so by law. We are state employees and as such our university needs a comtract with the people runnimg services that process our (or our students) data. Obviously our university isn't gonna make a 10k€/month contract just because some prof wants their mail forwarded to gmail. Especially not if they are not working here anymore. reply blackenedgem 8 hours agorootparentprevAn awful lot of free student access programs revolve around the uni email address being accredited. Foe example Jetbrains will give you a full version of their products if you register with a uni email, then require you to verify it yearly. If you forward emails automatically then you'd lose this accreditation. I suppose the solution would be an accreditatiom domain that forwards to your uni address only, but that's extra work now. reply msteffen 6 hours agorootparentprevThat is just not always possible. An example that should be familiar to HN: I worked for a period at startup, and used my email at that startup (my only work email at the time, as that’s where I was working!). Then the startup ran out of money money and was sold. Hence the email no longer worked. Should I have waited until the startup had more revenue? We were profitable at the time (we were B2B and the layoffs did us in) reply znpy 10 hours agorootparentprevThere’s nothing permanent in life. Dumb example: you might have published a paper while working at a company, but years later the company went bankrupt and ceased to operate. Now somebody else is owning the domains and they will not make you the favour to give you an email address. Notable example: Sun Microsystems. But there are many more, of course. Or you just moved from one university to another. Or you published while on grad school and then moved somewhere else. reply dleeftink 11 hours agorootparentprevSecurity and affiliation purposes mostly. reply Y_Y 7 hours agorootparentprevI infer that you interpreted this question as an attack, or at least some sort of criticism.

Presumed facts not in evidence. reply Y_Y 2 hours agorootparentI wasn't declaring anything! It was a question, which is why it ended with a question mark.

The company obviously wants recognition and so they use their corporate email address \"jsmith@xyz.com\". John has since moved on and is earning more at ABC Corp instead. XYZ Corp has duly reclaimed John's old email address, and John cannot receive emails at said address any longer. This is the situation the OP is in. It was never a \"fake email address\". They did not literally type \"first.last@org\", that was an example suitable for using in their comment. [edit: I'm actually wrong with that last statement, as it turns out. While it wasn't a fake email address, the situation is slightly more nuanced in that OP actually did say \"{first}.{last}@hhi.fraunhofer.de\" in the paper, as there were multiple authors who all had the same email address format - see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41479618. I still think this is a valid method, though, and it's certainly not fake. Besides, the problem I outlined sounds like it probably remains an issue even if it's not the exact problem OP is experiencing.] reply qwertox 7 hours agorootparentOk, so they used a template on the paper, namely \"{first}.{last}@hhi.fraunhofer.de\", while the email addresses, if the names are applied to the template, do in fact yield valid email addresses. It sounded as if they were using \"john.doe@hhi.fraunhofer.de\" while in reality it was an invalid email address (\"because there’s no match with the email address\"), that he would have tried to claim co-authorship via his \"real\" address, which might be something like \"j.doe2@hhi.fraunhofer.de\" (but luckily is not). It's all clear now. Thank you for your explanation. reply Y_Y 6 hours agorootparentThis is what I was asking about and I thank you and GP for clarifying the situation.

This nonsense of \"fake email address\" was only brought up as a baseless accusation. There is zero substance to it, and it's been used as a red herring in this discussion. Focus on the problem: do you expect any and all email addresses you publish somewhere years ago to continue to work? reply qwertox 7 hours agorootparent> [...] you won’t let me claim some of my preprints, because there’s no match with the email address. Which there can’t be, as we’re only listing a generic first.last@org addresses in the papers. I understood it this way: org is not handing out first.last@org to the employee, but using an email format in order to clarify that \"first last\" is working at org and collaborated on the paper not in private, but as an employee. He might have last.f@org gotten assigned as a valid email address from the org, but that one is not being used on the paper, while first.last@org is invalid. > I think you don't know what a email address is, and how they are used.

[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html reply crvdgc 11 hours agorootparentprevPreprints are not required to be fully typeset and publishable. In some cases, literally \"first.last@org\" is used as a placeholder for email addresses (to be replaced in typesetting). This is more like a mismatch between \"fully edited open-acess papers\" and \"trying to use arxiv preprints as an approximation of the former\". reply Y_Y 5 hours agorootparentFor the record, at least in my field Arxiv is where the action happens and journals are an afterthought. I don't put placeholders for contact details in my preprints because 1) the adresses likely won't change between drafts and 2) lots of readers are going to be reading that version so I want them to have access to the real info. Of course most of that is moot for professional scientists because you likely know (or at least be able to find out about) the authors already. For example some papers have old non-working email addresses for the authors who have since moved institution. It's not a problem, since I'll just look them up by name if necessary and usetheir current email. reply aragilar 9 hours agorootparentprevNo, they used the email from the institute they worked at when the produced the paper. They're no longer at that institute, and that email no longer exists (while some institutions give some leeway, I know of at least one major university which removes them the day the contract ends). This is a common problem if you're providing services to academics and you've tied yourself to using emails as identifiers. reply abhayhegde 5 hours agorootparentprevDoes not have to be fake or anything. You move from one institution to the other and cannot maintain it forever anyway. reply tc4v 10 hours agoparentprevI know you don't have a lifetime access to institutional email adress, but using a fake address is so counterproductive. You're only going to claim the paper once, and yuh ou should do it while you have access to your email.

I see how my earlier comment was confusing. In our case it's for saving space in the paper, and also for reducing spam. This small change may now seem silly in the age of LLMs, but the papers that have full email addresses in them get a considerable amount of fake conference and journal participation emails, which is annoying. reply Sophira 9 hours agorootparentOh, I see - the situation's more nuanced than I thought, then.

A lot of great suggestions I'm reading so far, a lot of them are currently in the works (zooming in/out, infra issues for slow loading times on some papers, google scholar claiming papers). For some more context, we are a group of 3 students with a background in AI research, and this site was initially built as an internal tool to discuss ai papers at Stanford. We've been dealing with a lot of growing pains/infra issues over the past month that we are in the process of hashing out. From there we would love to make a more concerted effort to share this in areas outside of AI. Happy to hear your thoughts here, or more formally via contact@alphaxiv.org.

I could see myself using alphaxiv for that, and then, if there's a comment section, I might even read it, and, who knows, leave a comment.

Let's take a look at how it's done. Humanity, it seems, can't get enough of cruise ships. In 1990, according to Cruise Market Watch, the global cruise industry treated some 3.7 million passengers to its familiar regime of buffet food, all-inclusive child supervision, shuffleboard, plentiful liquor and winking entertainers. In 2024, that number's tracking closer to 30 million. So the ships are getting bigger, as evidenced by Royal Caribbean Group's Icon of the Seas, launched this January. This gaudy, teetering behemoth is designed to carry just under 10,000 people, including crew. It's just under 1,200 ft (365 m) long, 159 ft (48 m) wide, and it's stacked no less than 20 decks high, with a technicolour water fun park, 'Aquadome,' seven swimming pools and the industry's tallest waterfall piled on top. Good lord: Icon of the SeasArriving January 2024 But this towering leisure-fest cost around US$2 billion to build, and took around two and a half years to launch from the first steel cutting. The cruise ship industry can't build new ships fast enough to satisfy the rampant demand – and building new ships also means you have to train new crews. Jumboisation: Ship-lengthening surgery The cheaper, easier way for operators to expand their carrying capacity and jack up profits is to make existing ships bigger, as it turns out. For an average of around $80 million, and just a couple of months out of service, operators can chop an existing ship down the middle, slide in a new slice that's designed to fit perfectly, weld it together, and come away with enough extra premium cabins to pay off the whole operation within a few years. That's not to mention the opportunity for a new paint job, bigger deck pools or engine upgrades while the ship's up on blocks – and HR only needs to train a small percentage of extra staff to add to an existing crew. The result: with a much smaller outlay and a negligible gap in service, operators can make an existing boat much more profitable. How to Stretch a Ship 'Jumboization,' as the process is known, certainly isn't a new idea, or unique to cruise ships. Indeed, the term itself appears to have been coined just after World War II, at which point shipbuilders were already doing it at enormous scale to lengthen warships, in some of the most complex engineering work ever attempted in the slide rule era. Nowadays, it's a well-trodden path, with certain shipyards specializing in the process of adding 80-130 ft (24-40 m) to a given cruise ship. The process takes the best part of a year if you include the measure, design and build of the new slice of ship – but remarkably, just a matter of weeks for the actual major surgery itself. MV Balmoral Cruise Ship Stretching at Blohm+Voss Time lapse How it's done First, you need the new chunk of ship ready to roll. Engineers pore over the initial design plans, and then go on board to make hundreds of measurements; clearly, it's got to be precise. This done, they design the new section. Every one of the thousands of pipes, wires, cables and ventilation channels that'll be cut are designed into the new section, ready to line up perfectly at both ends when the new joins are made. In this way, existing functionality can be maintained – and if the extra cabins place too much demand on existing systems, they can be upgraded to handle their new loads. Then, they go ahead and build the new section, often complete with interior fit-outs, at a shipyard facility, leaving the ends open. Sometimes, as in the video below of the MSC Armonia, these open sections are actually christened and launched into the water in their own right, and towed to the dry dock where the surgery is scheduled, like floating apartment blocks. MSC Armonia relaunch - the Renaissance programme Then, the ship is brought in, and precisely positioned above an array of \"skid shoes\" – little ship-lifting sleds positioned on metal tracks pre-bolted to the floor of the dry dock. Each of these little sleds is a hydraulic jack capable of lifting as much as 1,000 tons – and each is also capable of applying hydraulic lateral force to move it along the tracks. There might be upwards of 50 of these skid shoes involved in a given ship-stretching operation. With the ship positioned over the skid shoes, the dock is emptied, and the ship comes down to rest on its new mobile supports. Then, a work crew that could extend into the hundreds gets to work chopping the ship in half. Laser guides are used to ensure millimeter-level precision, since it's critical that the edges meet perfectly when the new section comes in. And of course, care is taken to plan which bits get cut in which order, because of the enormous weight involved and the associated structural pressures that might result. A super-precise cut right through the middle of the ship Silversea Cruises The cutting job itself is split between automated cutting machines, which handle the straight surfaces like the side walls and floors, and skilled laborers for curved or complex shapes, but both the machines and the workers use common acetylene blowtorches to cut through the metal. When the whole ship's been cut right through (memories of a particularly horrifying Three Body Problem scene anyone?) the skid shoes begin the co-ordinated process of pulling the two halves apart, far enough for the new slice to be moved in on its own team of skid shoes. This is also a fine opportunity to load the existing ship segments up with large fitments and items that would otherwise be impossible to get into the lower decks. The whole ship can be chopped in half and separated in about two days. The new section slides in, complete with furniture and fittings that might otherwise be impossible to load on board Silversea Cruises Once that's all done, the edges of the stem, middle and stern sections are lined up to perfection using the lifting and moving capabilities of the skid shoes, and then it's time to start connecting things back together. The surfaces are brought together, and the welding begins. A combination of electrode and stick welding is used – and here's where the extreme cutting precision really comes into play, because the maximum distance that can be covered between the two surfaces is only a few millimeters. The closer, the better – and of course, there's really no margin for error with the watertight hull and the structural supports that'll hold the massive ship together in rough seas. Silver Spirit Lengthening Video With the hull, decks and structure all joined together, it's then time to reconnect all the thousands of cables, ducts, wires and other fitments, while interior teams scurry to make the joins seamless on the inside of the ship, and another squad begins to give the whole ship a paint job that'll cover up the welds and scars on the exterior. The shipyard's responsibility is structural integrity and seaworthiness – but the operator also has to thoroughly test every single electrical, mechanical and hydraulic system on the ship to make sure everything has been reconnected properly. They also need to run sea trials to prove the strength and handling of the new, longer ship. The whole operation, from when the ship arrives at the dry dock to the point where it's approved to be sent back out into service, can take just nine weeks. If you include the time spent building the new section, as well as all the pre-planning and engineering, the whole project might run out to about nine months. That extra section costs somewhere around US$80 million. It doesn't look like much, but it radically transforms the ship's money-making capability Silversea Cruises As I said, this isn't a new process; Wikipedia lists 21 cruise ships that have been lengthened in this way since 1977, and indeed the mighty Seawise Giant – the longest self-propelled ship in history at a staggering 1,504 ft (458 m) end to end – owes some of its prodigious length to the jumboization technique. But the scale of these operations, the techniques involved and the financial incentives behind them have made it a fascinating rabbit hole for me. I hope you've enjoyed it too!

San Francisco is four years older than Honolulu, but she had been refueled and upgraded in 2000–2002.

Other sources I've seen claim \"up to 250 tons\" (https://www.colorado.edu/mechanical/2016/07/25/how-much-fuel...). A ton of diesel-like fuel produces around 2.6 tons of CO2 (the O2 comes from the air). So let's say 750 tons. Split across 5000 passengers, a 7-day cruise would be 750 / 5000 * 7 = roughly one ton of CO2 per passenger per cruise. Myclimate estimates the total footprint of a 7-day cruise, standard double cabin on a >4000 passenger ship, one day in port, as 2.1 t (this presumably also covers food etc. so it's not surprising that it's higher).

On the other hand, lots of people are returning customers so maybe there is something to be said for moving slowly across the ocean as your life ebbs away ;-) reply chengiz 7 hours agorootparentA lot of responses from people who have never taken a cruise, how typical. There is a lot of nickel and diming but floor plans and room views tend to be shown when you're buying. Even the interior windowless rooms are extremely well designed for space. The lack of windows does not really matter (for budget conscious travellers) since you're going to be only in there for sleeping and using the bathroom. Of course, no room is close to an engine. reply doe_eyes 6 hours agorootparentYeah, I went on a cruise once, and the whole idea is that you don't spend time in your cabin. It's not a train. You have cinema screens, live performances, restaurants and bars, libraries, quiet lounge areas, pools, and so on. Plus, there are sightseeing opportunities on land, and the neat thing about cruise ships is that they dock where the action is. Airports are always on the outskirts; ports tend to be situated pretty centrally in most cities. Honestly, it's probably the nicest way to travel to faraway places, short of a private jet. It's not for everyone, but it's not a dystopian experience. The ships carry insane numbers of passengers, but they are also pretty darn spacious. reply Unbeliever69 4 hours agorootparentMy buddy's wife like cruises. He tolerates them. What he does is packs one full suitcase with books and spends the entire time catching up on reading, either in his suite or the boat library (which some have). He does disembark at ports for tours.

I like to plan trips as an adventure like you and 6 years ago had zero desire to ever go on a cruise. I ended up going on one because my in-laws wanted to do a European cruise with extended family for their retirement celebration. They don't drink, they enjoy their life and got to celebrate with family so no loneliness. They are just older and don't have the physicality or mental desire to plan and go on adventures anymore. They wanted a more catered experience for their celebration. I actually enjoyed the cruise way more than I thought I would. The cruise allowed people to do what they want. My in-laws and others with less physical ability could go on bus tours or taxi around. People like me that preferred adventure can spend 8 hours walking through different nooks and crannies of the city. Being on deck in an open sea was nice and peaceful. I had been to Europe a few times before, but the cruise allowed me to go and walk around port cities that I wouldn't have been able to go to otherwise, without substantially more cost. Each with some interesting bits to walk through and good food to eat. It was a good, quick, demo for whether I wanted to plan a future trip to that city. If I were planning a trip now for my immediate fanily, I wouldn't do a cruise. I do not spew vitriol and insults at those that do though. Most of them aren't as pathetic as you have been led to think. reply ryandrake 6 hours agorootparentSame here. My elderly parents love cruises, but I didn't see the allure. Went on one and it was \"OK.\" I spent most of the time in one of the hot tubs where \"Tommy From Boston\" was a permanent fixture. He had an infinite number of stories in the queue that he had to tell anyone who climbed into the tub, and probably drank over 100 beers a day. It wasn't bad, and I wouldn't go out of my way to plan a cruise, but it wasn't the pure torture and torment that some people are posting here. reply lostlogin 1 hour agorootparentI can’t tell, are you Tommy? reply djtango 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah agreed. They're quite a solid and easy choice when you need to cater to the lowest common denominator (not meant at all in a derogatory sense!) If you're planning a holiday for ages spanning 2-75 for 3-5 families. What other holidays will have food that satisfies everyone's particular tastes, has activities for all ages and has a full suite of excursions or equally ringfenced \"nothing\" time. Its also comparatively safe. All without putting the onus on someone to organise a huge trip with lots of competing interests and spending habits.

I went on one with my family and had a good time but I don’t seek them out. There is something to be said for the “almost everything is included” nature of cruises. Not having to think about food and just relaxing or doing one of the many activities available is attractive. The various excursions or stops can be fun as well. It’s not for everyone but I see the appeal. Also, it doesn’t cost $10K to get a window. EDIT: I just price checked a cruise of the Caribbean on the Princess line (didn’t spend time checking the specific ship) but for a 7-day cruise for 2 people, a mini-suite (balcony and more room), and the premier package (unlimited drinks and other stuff) it came out to $3,800 total. If you drop the drinks it comes down about $1K. Now you have to get to the port and back home so factor in flights but that’s not absurd pricing IMHO. And you can get a balcony-only for cheaper as well. reply criddell 7 hours agorootparentThe “ebbs away” comment made me think of the perma-cruisers.

I wonder if this is regulated in any way? E.g. class and quality of welds required etc. On another note, a 2 billion investment to build a ship seems absolutely crazy. How long does it take to make that kind of money back, and how long does a ship need to sail to pay itself back? reply frognumber 10 hours agoparent* Regulation is non-existent in the cruise industry. You shop for the venue with the most lax regulations of the ≈200 countries in the world. * The equivalent is insurance. Insuring a $2B ship carries pretty good due diligence. A ship simply failing is rare. Of course, ship insurance doesn't care about employee rights, safe food, medical care, or other things one might expect to keep people safe. It's about protecting the capital expense. If everyone on the ship dies, but the ship survives, that's okay! * Welds are quite strong -- it just extends the metal. This is especially true when the baseline quality of the metal is not high. On something heat-treated SAE AISI 4130 steel (what e.g. fancy steel bicycles are made of), you see significant weakening. There is a heat-affected zone where the normal tempering is taken off, and the joining material isn't the fancy CrMo of the baseline material. I'm not a nautical engineer, but I doubt cruise ships are made of overly fancy steel. When you're making a 180,000 ton ship, your best bet is to use cheap steel, and if you need more strength, to simply use more of it. A good weld should be every bit as strong as the cheap steel around it, and the heat-affected zone is a lot less important if the steel isn't heat-treated or tempered in any way in the first place. It will harden the steel a bit, of course, but it shouldn't be the same level of impact. It's also worth noting you already have welds, and things need to be engineered for welds. It's not hard to reinforce the welds. Indeed, on a bike frame, the welds are where the stresses are highest, and you get around that by making the tubes a bit thicker (or, for fancier bikes, thicker just near the welds -- that's what a butted bike tube does). I think cruises are horrible, horrible things for a whole slew of reasons, but none having to do with the ship sinking Titanic-style. reply cm2187 9 hours agorootparentAnd the original hull wasn't made of a single piece of steel in the first place, it is already a patchwork of steel plates welded together, isn't it? And I think it is assembled as vertical sections like the one being added. reply icegreentea2 8 hours agorootparentYeah, exactly how a ship is built will differ, but generally you build up fairly large structural blocks, and then assemble (uh, a lot of welding) them together. Example time lapse of another cruise ship being built about a decade ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk_JIHel7To Depending on the ship, shipyard, and I imagine a host of other factors, you might assemble a ship directly out of the order of ~50-100 blocks, or you might pre-assemble into order of ~10 \"mega-blocks\" which then get assembled together. reply Ekaros 5 hours agorootparentprevNot exactly full sections, but very large sections.

Thank you. reply msrenee 7 hours agorootparentprev>Welds are quite strong -- it just extends the metal. This is especially true when the baseline quality of the metal is not high. This is not the case at all. A weld almost always weakens the base material. And you don't just use whatever steel is the cheapest to build a ship. You use what is appropriate to the use case. There are cheaper and more expensive options within that category, but you make it sound like you can just grab whatever is cheapest in the yard that day.

If the vessel cost $2b and lasts 20 years you need to repay $200m a year to repay the amount over 20 years. However I suspect 8% would be far higher that the rate they'd get. You'd also have to include maintenence costs, and also the reduction in revenue as it gets older (people will presumably not pay as much to travel on an older ship than a newer one), or the refurb costs you'll need to offset. On the other hand inflation has to be factored in. At 2% that debt will reduce 30% over the period. reply lotsofpulp 8 hours agorootparentI feel like it’s just easier to use the existing cruise companies’ public financials.

Some uninformed guessing: A operational net of $100/passenger/day is 10,000,000 passenger days per billion dollars. That’s 27,000 passenger years. With an average load of 5000 passengers that’s about five years per billion dollars. My guess is that average operational net is well above $100/passenger/day because cruising caters to luxury market segments; the scale is vast; people expect to be up sold; and gambling.

    "originBody": "{ datagubbe } datagubbe.se » gnome files Gnome Files: A detailed UI examination Old codger yells at software, part the latest. Spring 2024 The story so far A great amount of my writing on this site revolves around complaining about modern user interface design. Some people agree with me, some don't. Most probably don't care at all. That's fine. What I find interesting is that many (but not all!) people who disagree either present extremely specific non-argument nitpicks like \"Something in Windows 3.1 was bad, too!\" and ignores the big questions posed, such as whether it's actually a good idea shoving everything into a single hamburger menu, or if mixing touch and desktop paradigms wildly between and sometimes within programs is actually beneficial to end users. Others - despite my efforts to the contrary - use sweeping dismissals of the kind \"you just don't like flat design.\" That's true - I don't like flat design, but many of my arguments have nothing whatsoever to do with aesthetics. Well, that's what writing on the net is like. But I shall not despair, nor shall I be silenced! Allow me, for a few moments, to focus on a very detailed example that's got nothing to do with flatness, but rather with how to access core program functionality. It's worth mentioning that I agree that the modern design paradigm probably is friendly to beginner users in many ways. But at some point, people stop being beginners. People who use computers several hours per day, performing a wide variety of tasks in many different programs, should also be taken in to account when designing software. As such, my critique comes from the point of what's usually called a \"power user\". It's also worth considering that the more an interface hides, the less it offers by way of opportunities for a user to grow and learn. Gnome sweet Gnome For full transparency: It's no secret that I don't particularly enjoy the Gnome desktop. When I installed Ubuntu on my work laptop about a year ago, I wanted to see how long I could get by using Gnome. The answer was \"about five minutes\". When I decided to switch the default desktop background image to a solid color, I discovered that the only available option in the configuration tool was to select images. Sure, I could google a solution to the problem, which involved a pretty lengthy command line incantation, but depriving the user of a simple option to select a background color was more than my patience could handle. I've written some pretty harsh critique about Gnome before, but I feel this is a project that does deserve critique. It's not just the default desktop environment in most major Linux distributions, it's also a project that's very vocal - opinionated, as the saying goes - about how to do things. A few examples might be in order: \"Our software is built to be usable by everyone. We care deeply about user experience.\" \"Software should be structurally and aesthetically elegant.\" \"People's attention is precious. We pride ourselves in being distraction free.\" \"The 'traditional desktop' is dead, and it's not coming back. (...) Instead of trying to bring back old concepts like menu bars or status icons, invent something better from first principles.\" Gnome Files Bold words, indeed! Let's see how they fare in the real world. Recently, in another sudden fit of open-mindedness, I decided to perform some light file organizing using Gnome Files. This isn't just any old Gnome application: the file manager is a central point of any desktop environment, along with window management and a decent set of UI widgets. Surely the Gnome project will have spent a good amount of time and effort on making Gnome Files a flagship application, showcasing their superior UI philosophy from its absolutely best side. First impressions Well, it certainly doesn't look too shabby. Clean, elegant, even minimalist. A calming appearance. Sure, it's a flat design, but I can clearly make out the different UI elements and get a good idea of what's clickable or not - or so I'm led to believe. There's just one problem - I'd prefer a list view instead of the large icons. How do I change it? Hunting for the list view Note the many distinct-looking icons in the toolbar. From left to right we have three stacked dots, three stacked dots and lines, and three stacked lines. Pretty obvious what they're all about, right? Anyways, this dropdown menu with the tooltip text \"View Options\" is probably a good start. Alas, that menu only shows various sort options. This makes me think \"Sort Options\" would have been a better tooltip text. Then again, I'm not much for reinventing everything from first principles, so what do I know? What's in the \"Main Menu\", then? Nothing that has to do with a list view, I'm afraid - though there are options here I'd expect to find in a menu called \"View Options\", such as Icon Size and Show Hidden Files. There's a \"Folder Menu\" too, but that doesn't help me much, either. Ah! There it is! The \"View Options\" dropdown is actually a split button, with a toggle part and a dropdown part. That's sort of fine I guess, but I'd expect the toggle options to also be listed in the dropdown portion of the widget. If not, why group them together like this? Why not split them into two clearly separate buttons? This honestly took me a good while to figure out - and I'd like to think I'm neither extremely stupid nor particularly inexperienced with computers. Yes, it really was this hard for me to find the list view toggle. The \"View Options\" dropdown didn't contain view options, but rather sort options, and I didn't realize it was a split button with two completely different functions. I was further confused when other actual view options were, in fact, only available in the \"Main Menu\". To me, this doesn't feel like \"structural elegance\". By now, my calm was replaced with frustration. (Not) finding help I actually resorted to the built-in help function when looking for a way to switch to the list view. I searched for \"list view\", but didn't find anything immediately helpful. Even though I brought up the help window using Gnome Files' menu option for this, search results were listed for many other applications. Search result number nine, \"Browse files and folders\", was at least related to Gnome Files - but appeared after things like \"Manage volumes and partitions\" and \"Edit contact details\". The only entry I could find while manually browsing the help that mentioned \"List View\" was about what I could do when the list view had already been selected. I tried my best, but couldn't find any information on how to actually activate it. Tipping point While browsing the help, I noticed something else: frivolous tooltips. Tooltips are a great invention and can be very useful, but a lot of programs nowadays seem to just sprinkle them everywhere, with no particular thought as to whether they're actually meaningful or not. Gnome Help is one such case. Here, I'm just resting my mouse pointer somewhere, as one might do when reading through a bunch of clickable items. Up pops a tooltip that not only completely covers the title of the next item, it also has the exact same text as the header of the item it belongs to. Why? Perhaps it's part of the \"distraction free experience\". The same goes for the left hand side toolbar in Gnome Files. Yes, I assumed that \"Recent\" and \"Starred\" here, in the context of Gnome Files, are about recent and starred files and not something else. Granted, some of these tooltips show a full path, but honestly - if I've added something to this bar, I probably know what it is and where it's located. A tooltip would be useful if two items have the same name - but why show them everywhere else? To me, at least, it's very annoying that I can't rest my mouse pointer somewhere without having pointless information popping up that covers what I'm really interested in looking at. In fact, I'd say this behavior teaches me as a user that tooltips are pointless and irritating, making me instinctively ignore them even when they might be useful. Navigation Navigating using the Gnome Files UI is fine, for the most part. I'm unused to the button locations, and I miss a button for going one level up, to the parent directory. There are buttons for going back and forward in the navigation history, but that's not the same thing. Clicking on a directory in the location bar will take you there, but it's much easier to misclick and thus less convenient. When searching for a \"parent directory\" button, I noticed a few strange behaviors. Clicking on directory names in the location bar is a nice feature. However, many file managers will also let the user directly enter a path here. In fact, it looks a lot like a text box (such as the Folder name widget in the screenshot above) but no matter where I click in it, I cannot activate a normal editing mode. It seems this editing mode can only be activated using a keyboard shortcut, Ctrl-L, which isn't immediately apparent - or, to be frank, very logical. It looks like a text box, and it is indeed a text box - not just all the time. Maybe I'm not supposed to think of it as a text box, but the design language here isn't exactly super clear on what kind of input I'm dealing with, so I'm working from assumptions based on having used computers and GUI file managers for 36 years - which is something developers and designers should take into account when building interfaces. Having no mouse-driven way of activating a fairly common UI task feels like a step back in discoverability. In fact, I thought the feature hadn't been implemented until I googled it. To be fair, it is listed in the Keyboard Shortcuts window, but call me old school for expecting GUI elements to be accessible with the mouse. A thousand cuts The shortcuts list is three pages long. It's got a search function, which is nice - if you know what you're looking for. For example, Gnome Help calls the location bar \"the path bar\", but searching for \"path\" gives zero results. If you don't know what to search for, there's no table of contents or other way of quickly viewing the various categories of shortcuts. You have to examine each of the pages and hope to find what you're looking for. Upon reaching page three, I learned that there's even a keyboard shortcut for opening the keyboard shortcuts window - but unlike some other shortcuts, it's not shown next to its corresponding GUI entry in the Main Menu. Inconsistent and confusing. I'm not sure why, but the Gnome project has a strong aversion to menu bars. The keyboard shortcuts window may be \"reinventing from first principles\", but to me this invention looks like a flawed reinterpretation of a traditional menu bar. A menu bar provides a way of exposing categorized program features in a familiar and always-visible UI, lists their keyboard shortcuts in a consistent manner and it lets the user interact with the option immediately upon finding it. In Gnome Files, we're instead given a handful of features scattered across the UI. Hidden features (accessible solely through keyboard shorcuts) can only be learned by browsing what is best described as a non-interactive menu of the kind you'd find printed on paper in a restaurant. This browsing brings a considerable context switch because the window is modal, so you can't keep it open while experimenting. You have to find what you're looking for, note the keyboard shortcut, close the shortcuts window, and then invoke the feature. Keyboard shortcuts aren't bad, but in a mouse driven environment, having no way of finding and invoking features through the GUI is limiting and confusing. And why force users to memorize a shortcut for something they might only do occasionally? In short, this feels like an afterthought rather than a revolutionary new, efficient approach to operating a GUI. Top o' the window When trying to activate path editing using the mouse, my vigorous clicking just made the Gnome Files window move around. Since the window has no real title bar, it must be moved by clicking-and-dragging in the top part of the window. This is also where the toolbar resides, which means click-dragging on UI controls that already have a completely different function. You can use the search function by clicking on the search icon - but you can also click the search icon and start dragging the window around. There's a location history available by either context-clicking or performing a \"long click\" on the back- and forward buttons, but nothing about the buttons indicate this (and the feature doesn't seem to have a keyboard shortcut), which introduces further ambiguity regarding the click-drag behavior. Confusingly, performing a long click on other items doesn't bring up their context menu. Activating windows with the mouse is even worse: If I want to bring a window to the front of the stack, I have to search for a non-clickable area, lest I activate the search feature, skip upwards in the path, switch from list view back to icon view or accidentally access some other program feature. This introduces extreme ambiguity that makes me as a user feel insecure and uncomfortable: a simple mouse slip can give the most surprising results. The user is conditioned to be mindful of this, which increases the cognitive load for very simple and common window operations. Another curious idiosyncrasy of forgoing window title bars is that right-clicking on for example the search icon actually brings up a window management menu, with options for closing, maximizing and minimizing the window. This pops up when right clicking anywhere in the top part of the window. Except when right clicking on a directory name in the location bar - that will instead bring up a completely different menu, with various directory actions. Except if you click on the current directory, which won't bring up a context menu. Except sometimes it does, but then it's the window actions menu. Which is also what happens if you miss the context-clickable area of another directory by just a pixel, even if the pointer is still inside the location bar. You can, however, middle click on any directory name - including the current directory - to open it in a new tab. Which is also one of the options available in the context menu. Scrollolololo Gnome Files, or rather GTK 4, uses hidden scroll bars. I'm using what I assume to be the default settings and the default GTK 4 theme as supplied by Debian, because I haven't changed anything (except the font). I personally don't like hidden scroll bars, because hiding the scroll bar also hides information not only about what I can do with the GUI itself, but also about where I'm currently positioned in E.G. a file listing or text document. Moving the mouse about in Gnome Files reveals the scroll bar, as depicted in the first picture above. It's very small and very hard to see because of the low contrast, but it's there. But - Ah-hah! - the scroll bar is actually hidden in two steps! When moving the mouse pointer to it, it grows and becomes more visible, as in the second picture above. But when it does, it also moves the entire width of its original size to the left, meaning that my mouse pointer is now pointing at... nothing. Thanks, Gnomebama. Summary The Gnome Files UI feels haphazard, incoherent and sometimes even dangerous: Menu names and their contents are confusing, with \"View Options\" actually being sort options. Actual view options are instead sprinkled across other parts of the UI. Keyboard shortcuts aren't consistently listed in menus. Some common features are only accessible - and discoverable - through keyboard shortcuts. The keyboard shortcuts listing is non-interactive, modal, and incurs a substantial mental context switch. Widgets don't behave quite as you'd expect when compared to other, similar, modern applications. Even within the closed world of Gnome Files, widget looks can be deceptive. Tooltips are either misleading, or comically uninformative and thus annoyingly distracting. Moving windows by clicking on icons that already have a specific function feels unintuitive and introduces an unnecessary risk of misclicking. To activate a window without also activating a program feature, time must be spent searching for a non-interactive area of the UI. Context-clicking in the top part of the window gives spurious and unpredictable results. In the default theme, scroll bars jump away from their original position when you point at them. Searching and then browsing the built-in help for \"list view\" didn't actually help me find out how to enable the list view. The only page I could find that contains the exact phrase appears as #15 among the search results. Nomenclature differs between the help texts and the actual GUI. The many various inconsistencies listed above makes it hard for me as a user to construct mental models and patterns for making efficient and reliable assumptions about the UI. I often have to double check things and look for features in the keyboard shortcuts window, since I don't know if they've been deigned a menu entry or toolbar icon. Ambiguous mouse behavior introduces unnecessary cognitive load, making it hard to build confidence even when performing basic tasks. Conclusion Designing user interfaces is hard. Writing software is hard. Designing great interfaces and writing great software is even harder. No matter how hard you try, you can't please everyone. Functionally, Gnome Files lets me do file management. I could, if I had no other options, probably get used to its UI idiosyncrasies. But as I've hopefully demonstrated above, there are many things about Gnome Files - a central part of the Gnome desktop - that can be considered objectively bad from a UI design standpoint. This doesn't mean that there aren't other bad programs or that previous design paradigms were perfection incarnate. Neither does it mean that every little bit of Gnome Files is worthless, or that Gnome and Gnome Files are unique in employing these patters (but that's hardly a comfort). But shouldn't this new design paradigm produce something better? Isn't that its whole raison d'être? After ten-fifteen years of the old mainstream desktop paradigm, we arrived at Windows 95 - which wasn't perfect, but pretty damn consistent, predictable and reliable. After ten-fifteen years of this new paradigm, we instead have constant redesigns and reworkings of solutions to problems we already know how to solve. Examining these new solutions suggests to me that maybe proponents of the new UI paradigm should be a bit more humble in their approach to tried and tested patterns. Nearly all of the criticisms examined above already have well known solutions that have been honed for a period of decades. For example: Having actual window title bars, consistently listing keyboard shortcuts in menus, consistently categorizing menus and options, and using a richer design language. Old doesn't automatically mean worse, just as new doesn't automatically mean better. My personal conclusion is that if this is the result of inventing \"something better from first principles\" to create \"structurally elegant\" and \"distraction free\" software \"usable by everyone\", I guess I'm just not \"everyone\". And that would be fine, if it wasn't for the fact that these days, I'm often left with no choice but using programs with UI:s like these. privacy notice: datagubbe.se uses neither cookies nor javascript.rss feed © carl svensson",

Yet, in list view, as soon as you have a few files and the window is full, you’re given no empty area to click in. I saw some people have the same issue [0] in the past, and it’s not really been fixed either [1]. [0]: https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1150025 [1]: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus/-/issues/3445 reply gawa 10 hours agoparentI always had the same issue, even with the file explorer that I'm using currently (Thunar, XFCE's file browser). I never really looked for a solution, I kept changing the view (go from list view to to icons view) in order to find some empty space to right-click on. Your comment and seeing that there are bug reports about it prompted me to think more than 5 seconds about this usability annoyance. I found a cool shortcut on Thunar: holding the control key + right click anywhere (including on a file) will bring up the right-click menu, from where I can create a new folder, paste, open in the terminal... That's XFCE's Thunar solution to this problem. It was just not easily discoverable, but it's a good enough solution according to me, as I don't mind using the keyboard. Maybe it's the same on Gnome's File or Nautilus or other file explorers softwares, I don't know. Edit: looking at it more closely, in Thunar the ctrl+right-click will show the \"create new folder\" option only if no file is selected. Otherwise it shows the contextual menu of the selection (hence the create new folder would not appear). So basically we have to unselect the files ... by clicking on an empty area (so back to square one) ... or we have to know about another keyboard shortcut (the \"Escape\" key) to clear the current selection before doing the ctrl+righ-click. Not ideal either. reply rav 7 hours agorootparentCan't you use ctrl-left click to deselect the selected file before using ctrl-right click to get the context menu? reply gawa 1 hour agorootparentYes, sure. Although if multiple files or folders are selected, it's probably easier to just press the Escape key once instead of searching for each selected objects in the folder to unselect them one by one. What I was looking for was a reproducible way to make this right click menu appear. The sequence Escape+ctrl+righclick is a way to do that, it always work, wherever the cursor is, and no matter if the folder has many files or not. No need to look actively for a couple of empty pixels anymore or to think \"What do I have to unselect before I can right-click to get a different contextual menu?\". reply keyringlight 11 hours agoparentprevI've noticed a similar thing on some web pages. For example BBC news where the link for a story is its whole tile/rectangle area, the obvious link text, any picture, and a large amount of white space. It's only relatively thin gaps between tiles that are inert background to click on. I can see this making sense for a touch-first design and I can appreciate that focus for BBC news website, however focusing back on software like gnome it seems that similar aims crept in trying to make it serve multiple input methods at the same time and how you could have variations on the UI for touch or mouse (and you could also make assumptions about the screen and viewing setup and what's appropriate) reply kaanyalova 10 hours agoparentprevThere seems to be space to right click between the rows (although somewhat small space at the smallest list view), and left-right sides of the window.

I think that the designers made the right choice here, because a context menu should show actions which can be applied to the object I right clicked on. \"New Document\" isn't really some function of a file or folder icon. Even worse: when I right click on a folder, should the \"New Document\" menu item create a new doc in the current folder? Or in the one I clicked on? It would be better to have these common tasks in a separate menu item in the icon bar where they are always available, in addition to the context menu when right clicking on empty space in a window. reply gawa 1 hour agorootparentInteresting opinion. I think it would be so much less confusing to have only one menu. The easiest for power-users and newcomers alike would be to put on the top of this unique right-click menu the folder-level options (create new folder, open terminal here, paste here, ...), and the selection-specific options bellow. This way it would be predictable and we can build habits (muscle memory). But you're right it's debatable. A matter of preference. I guess I'm just in the camp of \"more explicit is better than implicit\". And I'm willing to pay the verbosity cost (having a longer menu in this case). The alternative seems like a complex decision tree to me: Am I in list-view? Yes. Is my folder full of files? Yes. What menu do I need, depending on the task I want to accomplish? I want to create a new folder. Ah, so I have to find some empty pixels to conjure the menu with that option... reply dylan-m 3 hours agorootparentprev> It would be better to have these common tasks in a separate menu item in the icon bar where they are always available, in addition to the context menu when right clicking on empty space in a window.

You can tell you're on the gap when no item is highlighted. reply comex 19 hours agoprevDecent critique, but it mixes together two things: the design language, and UI papercuts showing a lack of attention to detail. Consider the current macOS Finder: https://a.qoid.us/20240907-finder.png Finder's design is extremely similar to GNOME Files! And so the inherent downsides of the design language are present in Finder too, such as it being harder to drag windows around or click to activate windows. But macOS does avoid most of the UI papercuts the author points out. It's not perfect, but let's go through the list. - View Options: Finder has a similar-looking icon that does the same thing. But in Finder, the little arrows on the right of an icon are always part of the same button as the icon itself. Finder doesn't use split buttons in the way the author complains about. - Help: The macOS User Guide explains all the icons and what they do. But you don't actually need to go that far, because macOS has a feature where if you click Help and start typing, it will show menu items (from any menu) that match what you typed. In this case, if you start typing \"list\", it will show the \"as List\" menu item, which achieves what the author wants. (I guess I should point out that macOS does have a menu bar at the top of the screen, and all the actions you can take by clicking icons can also be taken through the menu bar.) - Tooltips: Finder doesn't have tooltips for the locations on the left pane, only for the icons in the toolbar. Even there they take a while to appear. - Navigation: I'd ding Finder here because there is no location bar at all (only an 'open by path' dialog that's kind of buried). Even going to the parent directory is not exposed in a particularly obvious way. Still, at least Finder doesn't have something that looks editable but isn't. - Scrolling: macOS has hidden scrollbars by default, but they stay at the right of the window. They don't jump to the left like the author is complaining about. reply hedora 16 hours agoparentThe current version of Finder is a massive regression from what it used to be.

My impressions: - Where is the ability to easily split/tab for side-by-side directory comparison? - Every directory is opened in a new window, which makes everything even more jarring - (Do I just not know how to operate the window manager?) - Is the not grid-aligned icon position saved? This seems like a long-term usability nightmare. - How can I create something other than a directory? - Where is the location bar? Then again, I'm not familiar with old OR new macOS, so I might have a similar first experience with the new finder. What I found nice is the UI/UX consistency. Modern systems don't really have that anymore, with all the accumulated partial UI overhauls and different UI libraries. reply flohofwoe 12 hours agoparentprevThe macOS/OSX Finder really isn't an example of good UX. It always felt like a half-assed and unloved port from NeXTStep which then was quickly abandondend.

Apple also has a thick Human Interface Guidelines document from.. ‘97 or ‘03, I can’t remember. But it’s great. Funnily enough, if you use it as a yardstick to measure the current macOS by, macOS is full of violations of that HIG. Pulling back to the article: I wonder what desktop the writer uses, because KDE is absolutely chock full with idiosyncrasies and inconsistencies. Especially because KDE application development is much less top-down than Gnome, so each applications feels completely different which leads to having to “learn” each application separately.

In fact, it is sometimes entertaining to imagine that somewhere in the depths of the GNOME cult compound, they keep a single individual, who is legally blind, physically incapable of using a keyboard, simultaneously belongs to all demographic groups that are traditionally underrepresented among computer users, and has in fact never used a computer themselves but was shown a few things on an iPhone by their Gen Alpha great grandnephew. All these factors combine to turn this person (affectionately referred to as Mother Gnome by those in the know) into a utility monster of UI design, so that it becomes an absolute moral imperative to design things to appeal to them, at whatever expense it takes. reply stuaxo 11 hours agoparentprevIt's a shame SUN isn't still around, they did actually usability studies on GNOME, it would be great if one of the distros would step up here. reply n3storm 9 hours agorootparentYes!

Accessibility is about making the UI usable for everyone - that happens to include handicapped people (who often do require specific accommodations, such as reduced animations, TTS, zoom, color filters...), but that also includes power users (who e.g. need to do some specific task often enough, that they might benefit from the UI being scriptable), people who sometimes need to use a computer late at night (automatic dark mode), people who need to stay focused on a specific set of tasks (do not disturb with per-app notification filtering that syncs across devices), etc etc etc. It's this \"oh it's for the handicapped\" mindset that makes UIs unusable for everyone. reply n3storm 9 hours agorootparentprevI totally agree, but if I proudly state my website is AA and you are blind and cannot navigate and read content, wouldn't it feel double embarrasing that if just another site with no AA stamp? reply LtWorf 9 hours agorootparentprevThey claim to be very accessible though. reply 0rzech 6 hours agorootparentYes, that's what they claim.

I have similar problems telling which parts of the window can be used to drag them around on a Mac.

But at some point, people stop being beginners. People who use computers several hours per day, performing a wide variety of tasks in many different programs, should also be taken in to account when designing software. As such, my critique comes from the point of what's usually called a \"power user\". It's also worth considering that the more an interface hides, the less it offers by way of opportunities for a user to grow and learn. After that I find it a bit rich to complain that one has to use a keyboard shortcut (even as others have said that's even incorrect), especially for a function that requires using the keyboard anyway. I also find the arguments about no up button and the list view unconvincing. The list button was immediately obvious to me from the screenshot (and I don't use gnome or any filemanager) and I actually appreciate a window that does not put lost of buttons that present duplicate functionality everywhere (and it's harder to hit? What argument is that, by his own admission he's been using computers for 35 years, but can't use a mouse to hit a path?).

If we are at opinions, I really dislike this absolutely tone-deaf attacking of GNOME that is always happening under these threads. There is criticism, and there is blind hate. There is definitely places to improve, though, but the style of writing matters. reply savolai 7 hours agorootparentThis should help you trace the argumentation to cited research that is certainly not ”tone deaf”: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/ 1. *Consistency and Standards* Claim: \"The 'View Options' dropdown didn't contain view options, but rather sort options, and I didn't realize it was a split button with two completely different functions.\" Violation: This breaks Consistency and Standards. The user expects consistent terminology and functionality, but the dropdown name doesn't match what it actually does, leading to confusion. 2. *Visibility of System Status* Claim: \"Hidden scroll bars... hides information not only about what I can do with the GUI itself, but also about where I'm currently positioned.\" Violation: Violates Visibility of System Status. Hidden scrollbars prevent the user from knowing their position in the list or file system, making it difficult to navigate. 3. *User Control and Freedom* Claim: \"I miss a button for going one level up, to the parent directory. There are buttons for going back and forward in the navigation history, but that's not the same thing.\" Violation: Violates User Control and Freedom. Not having an obvious way to go up a directory removes essential control, forcing users to rely on less intuitive navigation methods. 4. *Recognition Rather Than Recall* Claim: \"It seems this editing mode can only be activated using a keyboard shortcut, Ctrl-L, which isn’t immediately apparent—or, to be frank, very logical.\" Violation: Violates Recognition Rather than Recall. The user should not need to remember specific keyboard shortcuts to access common functionality. The UI should present these options visibly. 5. *Error Prevention* Claim: \"Moving windows by clicking on icons that already have a specific function feels unintuitive and introduces an unnecessary risk of misclicking.\" Violation: Violates Error Prevention. The user can easily move the window unintentionally when trying to interact with icons, which increases the chance of errors. 6. *Help and Documentation* Claim: \"Searching and then browsing the built-in help for 'list view' didn’t actually help me find out how to enable the list view.\" Violation: Violates Help and Documentation. The help system fails to guide users to solutions for basic tasks, which defeats its purpose. 7. *Aesthetic and Minimalist Design* Claim: \"Tooltips are either misleading, or comically uninformative and thus annoyingly distracting.\" Violation: Violates Aesthetic and Minimalist Design. Tooltips should convey useful information without being intrusive. Redundant and irrelevant tooltips clutter the interface. 8. *Flexibility and Efficiency of Use* Claim: \"In Gnome Files, we’re instead given a handful of features scattered across the UI. Hidden features (accessible solely through keyboard shortcuts) can only be learned by browsing what is best described as a non-interactive menu.\" Violation: Violates Flexibility and Efficiency of Use. Hidden shortcuts reduce the efficiency for experienced users and make the interface less discoverable. 9. *Match Between System and the Real World* Claim: \"Menu names and their contents are confusing, with 'View Options' actually being sort options.\" Violation: Violates Match Between System and the Real World. The system should use terminology and design elements that align with user expectations, but here the names contradict their function. 10. *Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors* Claim: \"Context-clicking in the top part of the window gives spurious and unpredictable results.\" Violation: Violates Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors. Inconsistent behavior in the context-click menus makes it difficult for users to understand or recover from unexpected results. reply kaba0 5 hours agorootparentSomething like this would have been a better post than the linked one, but even this is not necessarily objective on each count - and design has a fundamentally subjective, human element based on our collective experience with every kind of interface, ever, which is affected by experience/culture, everything. E.g. in your list: there is no “dropdown name”, it’s a misidentified element by the post writer. Add to it that he is not using standard configuration, which is just not how any “test” should be conducted. Like, you are not testing cars with flat tires either. reply savolai 1 hour agorootparentPlease get to know how comprehensively the heuristics have been condensed into that short list from a much longer list of ovservations and decades of research.

And only then the text field for timer's name appear. - Timer sound is just a single bell that's easy to miss when you are busy with something like cooking. No repeats, no additional dialogs or highlights. Just a single notification and timer resets. Nautilus (Files): - Does not focus a file/folder for keyboard navigation after entering a folder using keyboard navigation (arrow keys and Enter). Maybe I'm missing something,but that's my experience with resorting to mouse or pressing Tab. - \"Open in Terminal\" opens folders only in GNOME's default terminal.

This was really neat, traditionally you have to access those by right-clicking some whitespace in the list/grid view, but in the list view there is only a narrow band of empty space to right-click, usually you accidentally click a file.

I've used the former for years, but slowly realized that needing to use various extensions to achieve a usable desktop is just plain wrong. Then I switched to KDE Plasma for a year or two, and it also felt off a bit, partly due to the overwhelming number of options with often odd defaults. Fonts were awesome though, and so was Dolphin compared to Nautilus. Finally, the week the alpha was released, I installed the COSMIC version of Pop, and never looked back. Why? Because it has the correct amount of desktop-related settings for me (and hopefully many others as well). These settings are: - dock or panel or both? - place them anywhere - populate them however you want In this sense, GNOME is too strict and inflexible. Plasma, on the other hand, lets me create the look I'm used to without adding extensions, but also feels \"wobbly.\" This wobbliness comes from the overwhelming amount of tickboxes, radio buttons and whatelse almost calling for interaction to change stuff. COSMIC fixed my problems of the duopoly and feels stable enough for daily use even in its alpha state. reply skriticos2 8 hours agoprevAs a GNOME user, I kinda understand what they want to achieve, but they are seriously short on resources, so there is really little substance to all the rosy aspirations. They are also very oppinionated, which then turns away a lot of liberal developers that just want to scratch their own itches. As for file manager usability, I grew up with Norton commander and pretty much gave up on ever seeing power user addressed file manager. It's fine for simple office type stuff that I bother few times a month on my Linux system but that's basically it. When I have any more elaborate needs I fall back to plain old terminal with something like git or maybe even midnight commander, because that's what's getting the job done. What I find really sad is, that they have like a million bindings to every programming language there is (including one that they made up) and I have no idea how they want to maintain that codebase. The basic API still looks somewhat antiquated and disjointed, but now it's in JavaScript and Vala. So even the more OCD type developers that would accept the design language constraints are frustrated that it looks so sad under the hood. But I mean, I get it. Building a consistent desktop environment with a clean design language is hard and especially expensive. I'm impressed by what GNOME actually manages to get done with the few resources that they have. Is it anywhere close to being consistent and complete. I don't think so. But than again, I mostly just use the desktop environment to open Chrome and the terminal, so for me it's perfectly fine. reply bobajeff 6 hours agoparent>What I find really sad is, that they have like a million bindings to every programming language there is (including one that they made up) and I have no idea how they want to maintain that codebase.

If you want a list view, clicking on the icon that looks like a list isn't a crazy thing to do. I agree the dropdown behaviour is a bit strange.

But, as they said and the author quoted, \"Our software is built to be usable by everyone. We care deeply about user experience.\" Though there are already TONS of critiques to GNOME (hell, even I have written some stuff about them here) and so much has been said about it that saying something else seems like a waste of time in my humble opinion. Its devs won't change their mind because they have a laser-sharp vision of what they want to achieve. Its users won't change their mind because they like it and feel at home using it. We the people that don't (or no longer) like it won't change our minds either because it can feel really strange, confusing and even limiting. It's been more than 10 years since they went to that route but they will do little to nothing about that because, as the author correctly asserted, \"it's also a project that's very vocal - opinionated, as the saying goes - about how to do things.\" So either you like the GNOME way of doing things or you just can go somewhere else.

In the same way, I think Dolphin v24 should be seen as a starting point for the minimal features and easy customization included by default that a file browser needs. > Definitely worth it for people frustrated at Gnome's cleanliness-to-a-fault.

This is very unfortunate, with capital letters, because if Gnome had preserved the features instead of cropping and going the pads-only route, they would have avoided the obvious result, a split in resources and developers (Mate and Homologous continuations of Gnome v2), which even ended up with two kinds of distros under Gnome.

I like a lot of things the KDE community is doing and I think it's particularly good at power user oriented apps like Krita and Kdenlive, which may be the best open-source tools in their respective areas and which don't really fit in the modern Gnome framework. As a desktop environment, however, I feel KDE is too visually chaotic to be usable. This post [1] illustrates some problems, but the lack of design cohesion permeates KDE and cannot be fixed without a long concerted effort. I imagine it's never been a priority because most users can shrug these inconsistencies off as something inconsequential, but for me (and I don't believe I'm alone in this) they're instantly noticeable and distracting eyesores. Gnome has its own problems, but it is very visually consistent and clean, especially as of late when most of the standard apps are moved to GTK4/libadwaita.

This doesn’t match Windows’s Cut/Paste workflow, but I think Copy makes more sense as a first step. For consistency with Cut elsewhere, one would expect Cut to delete the file until it is pasted, but on Windows it doesn’t. Finder windows are resizeable in the same way as all other macOS windows.

Plasma did not crash once since 2019 for me and I think its UX is quite nice, in the case of Dolphin in particular visibly better than GNOME's.

Phosh is decent but none of the video players have a UI in the ballpark of Netflix/Android. All the touch targets are TINY, no tap in the center to play/pause, no tap on sides to skip either.

The Gnome devs have a very long track record of imposing universally hated UI/UX design on people. I'd wonder why KDE isn't more popular, but I'm pretty sure the main reason is that the Gnome devs also have way better aesthetic taste than the KDE devs. Gnome simply looks much nicer in screenshots. They understand spacing. That and KDE had it's own major UI/UX fuck up with Plasma. reply criticalfault 11 hours agoparentThat's not completely true. They are hated by some users, loved by some. For example, in general, I really like what gnome does. Desktop use is not something that is useful outside starting other apps, so I like its simplicity and the fact that it gets out of the way. Default apps could use maybe a bit more features, but I generally don't find too much wrong with e.g. files. The only confusing thing for me is which hamburger to click when I want to create a new directory. So instead of guessing, I just right click the file list. One positive example in gnome is when you try to access e.g. smb:// shares in files and try to open a movie from the share... It works with no issues. But, kde with gazillion features does not support that. (Opinion) KDE is not more popular since it's buggy as hell. At least it was. But not only that, their visuals are a disaster. Believe what you will, but visual consistency and attention to detail is what gnome has. They are not perfect, so there are some issues as OP points out, but they are on a different level from kde. KDE looks like it was frankensteined, while gnome it looks like it was designed. Think just login process and sddm, how many time it blinks? KDE is proud to enable tinkering, and this is good - there are people that like to do that. Thinking back, this was when I was teenager. Now that I'm older, I want things well thought out, designed well that dont get in my way so I can do my work and not think about desktop. And this is gnome. What I hate about gnome is JavaScript and python focus for apps. And now, suddenly we need a stupid app for everything. reply p4bl0 8 hours agorootparent> KDE is not more popular since it's buggy as hell. At least it was. But not only that, their visuals are a disaster Could you give concrete examples of that? I've been using KDE daily for years and I really don't see what you're talking about for either of these two points (bugs and disaster visuals). reply criticalfault 8 hours agorootparentDisaster visuals are icons in e.g. dolphin, sidebar and toolbar, but in different ways. Sidebar are only lines and I find that the overly simplistic shapes do not represent ideas well. Example: go back icon. Similar problems exist for toolbar icons. At some point I cannot conclude if the shape is a graphics glitch or an icon. These are the icons with some shape bottom right. Another example is sidebar consistency: recently I noticed there are 3 distinct looks in sidebars in KDE. The most modern one (kirigami I guess) looks almost the same as gnome (I think system settings have it in the last version), so here they are improving. Another example: their logo and Startup Animation. Buggy things: setup with 2 monitors, then 4k monitors, a bunch of this didn't work well, I opened several bugs for these things. I moved to gnome which didn't have these problems, so I'm not sure how this is behaving now. Changing something about plasmoids / taskbar used to crash my session, but don't remember wether I opened a bug for this. I like having it at the top, so moving it up would even be a problem. After the crash, it would be fine for a long time. Also generally reordering plasmoids on the taskbar itself would be buggy. As I said - this is how it used to be. Did not use it as a main desktop for a while, I would try to see what is new in a VM, but always got shocked how bad the design is. They are trying to improve it, but for something to make sense, radical changes are needed. For example, there were some really nice proposals for logo change for plasma 6 and nobody jumped on it.

KDE has terrible aesthetics and great usability, Gnome has great aesthetics and terrible usability.

Combined with the grey-on-grey colour scheme that requires coding to change it's extremely easy to miss notifications.

Including lack of certain apps like a decent VM manager. I feel sorry for kde, the community there is way friendlier and whatnot, but this Frankenstein approach is bad for serious use.

Regarding wifi, given only 'standard' use, you connect to wifi and that's it. Gnome offers a password entry and done.

The majority of GNOME applications are far inferior to DE-independent \"apps\", so much so one may wonder why effort is even being spent into developing such flawed and barely functioning toys. Ah, well, at least Books isn't maintained anymore because it was barely usable. KDE's audience is far broader, because it does not force you to follow a vague and poorly implemented design vision that is actively hostile to the user, has usable defaults and can be trivially customized to actually reflect a minimal design approach also. It is not surprising it's being shipped quite successful with every Steam Deck, for example. reply criticalfault 5 hours agorootparentThe question was a bit assholish, because rant. Fair to call me on it. Yes, I am aware that KDE audience is broader. Just remembered an additional good product from KDE: kdenlive. Let me try to put it in a better way: most of the time I have seen Linux in the wild (let's say companies) was Ubuntu/gnome. Even tv shows. And I don't remember ever seeing kde (LiMux aside since it is dead now). I have read that it is sometimes used in some specific industries like chemistry for legacy reasons/apps. Not sure how the automotive industry fits here, but I know they for example use qt, not sure if this extends to kde. Based on what I have seen and read (which is not all Industries of course), KDE has a significantly smaller user base. In a non-professional setting, I have exclusively seen gnome. Not sure how steamdeck fits here, depends on what valve took. Last I read was a compositor. Di they actually use whole desktop with plasmoids? Can you give an example of de-independent apps that are superior? To be clear: when talking about fitting into a desktop and talking about gnome vs KDE, it comes down mostly to the toolkit. Some examples like vlc could be considered de-independent though even though they use qt Don't get me wrong, I don't hate KDE project. Far from it. But what they do and what I think they should do differs. What I completely disagree with is that UX of gnome is wrong. It is opinionated and a lot of us like this 'opinion'. Many people using Ubuntu don't change a thing. Does this fit usable defaults? If things are well thought out, why do I need to tinker with the desktop to launch firefox, office, copy files or consume multimedia? Because in the end - this is what it is about, productivity.

If a DE can't handle that well, a well-designed 'Videos' app offers small consolation.

(And years before that, the rapidly regressing Finder was a key factor in getting me to finally move from Mac to Linux.) Very happy with KDE, though. I feel like when the Videos app is well designed and the file manager isn't, that says a lot about the priorities of the team behind the DE. In Apple's case, this is understandable from a business perspective - they have cloud services to sell, and would much rather you forgot all about files.

The only reason I use KDE instead is the inability (or additional hoops) to configure GNOME. That starts at fractional scaling and ends with something as trivial as setting different time to suspend on battery or switching to suspend-then-hibernate. It probably is enough for the vast majority of computer users. But the ones that aren't likely to run Linux to begin with. reply jampekka 10 hours agorootparentIf you want to configure Gnome, learn to read and write text files and use dconf/gsettings. And possibly write Gnome shell extensions. Gnome though usually just works and has well thought out defaults, so you're usually just hampering yourself with changing them. For navigating the desktop and windows I rarely have to touch the keyboard, and it works so well I don't even have the need for a secondary or larger display. KDE et all OTOH have tend to have poorly thought out defaults leading to inconsistent mess of an inteface littered with random configuration options. A big reason for this is likely the user community who like to be \"power users\" by clicking buttons and refusing to learn text configuration, let alone extensions. And the DE devs then give in to the users demanding a configuration option to select a specific cat picture as the menubar background. reply asmor 8 hours agorootparentYou could've at least checked if the examples I listed are configurable via the mechanisms listed. Aside from fractional scaling (which was my example for \"hoops\"), they're not. You can replace suspend with suspend-then-hibernate by linking over the suspend systemd unit. But that's most definitely not a GNOME option and prevents you from suspending. Not to mention the numerous settings that have appeared and disappeared over the years in GNOME, not just from the graphical configuration, but also from code. I don't understand why you want an easy to use DE with intuitiveness and then are okay with hiding configuration away somewhere between the Arch Wiki and the GNOME source code. But hey, I'm glad it works for you. Doesn't for me though, even though I wish it did! reply washadjeffmad 5 hours agoprev [–] I think a salient point is the reduction in hackability in modern open source interfaces, driven by reductive centralized developer-centric consolidation. There's no right design ontology. Each user's need is unique, and the utter abandonment of principle over the past decade (I use GNOME 3 as the turning point) has been deleterious to the ethos that once defined Linux as the platform for those who prize ownership of their systems above closed, committee-design decision making over creating user-first interfaces. I've returned to the BSDs in part because of it. My main system is, of course, Linux at its core, but I don't feel close to it like I did when I'd have a half dozen WMs and DEs installed, the sessions easily switchable by TTY for whatever workflow that required them. GNOME 3 is a triumph of bureaucracy over stakeholders, developed antagonistically to the historical consideration of its users. It's a core product that satisfies no one completely, and can't, which I'm sure makes the lives of its developers easier as their stance on shutting down any dialog with users over the years has reinforced. reply washadjeffmad 2 hours agoparent [–] Perhaps someone could share how else the diversity of features of 2.32 vs 3 is a non-explanation after more than a decade, despite a pluritude of bug reports and feature requests for functionality that hasn't been replaced?

    "originBody": "September 3, 2024 Share Download PDF Peer Reviewed GPT-fabricated scientific papers on Google Scholar: Key features, spread, and implications for preempting evidence manipulation Academic journals, archives, and repositories are seeing an increasing number of questionable research papers clearly produced using generative AI. They are often created with widely available, general-purpose AI applications, most likely ChatGPT, and mimic scientific writing. Google Scholar easily locates and lists these questionable papers alongside reputable, quality-controlled research. Our analysis of a selection of questionable GPT-fabricated scientific papers found in Google Scholar shows that many are about applied, often controversial topics susceptible to disinformation: the environment, health, and computing. The resulting enhanced potential for malicious manipulation of society’s evidence base, particularly in politically divisive domains, is a growing concern. By Jutta Haider Swedish School of Library and Information Science, University of Borås, Sweden Kristofer Rolf Söderström Department of Arts and Cultural Sciences, Lund University, Sweden Björn Ekström Swedish School of Library and Information Science, University of Borås, Sweden Malte Rödl Division of Environmental Communication, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Sweden Article Metrics 0 CrossRef Citations Altmetric Score 247 PDF Downloads 10095 Page Views image by viarami on pixabay Topics Artificial Intelligence / Research / Search engines Research Questions Where are questionable publications produced with generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) that can be found via Google Scholar published or deposited? What are the main characteristics of these publications in relation to predominant subject categories? How are these publications spread in the research infrastructure for scholarly communication? How is the role of the scholarly communication infrastructure challenged in maintaining public trust in science and evidence through inappropriate use of generative AI? research note Summary A sample of scientific papers with signs of GPT-use found on Google Scholar was retrieved, downloaded, and analyzed using a combination of qualitative coding and descriptive statistics. All papers contained at least one of two common phrases returned by conversational agents that use large language models (LLM) like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Google Search was then used to determine the extent to which copies of questionable, GPT-fabricated papers were available in various repositories, archives, citation databases, and social media platforms. Roughly two-thirds of the retrieved papers were found to have been produced, at least in part, through undisclosed, potentially deceptive use of GPT. The majority (57%) of these questionable papers dealt with policy-relevant subjects (i.e., environment, health, computing), susceptible to influence operations. Most were available in several copies on different domains (e.g., social media, archives, and repositories). Two main risks arise from the increasingly common use of GPT to (mass-)produce fake, scientific publications. First, the abundance of fabricated “studies” seeping into all areas of the research infrastructure threatens to overwhelm the scholarly communication system and jeopardize the integrity of the scientific record. A second risk lies in the increased possibility that convincingly scientific-looking content was in fact deceitfully created with AI tools and is also optimized to be retrieved by publicly available academic search engines, particularly Google Scholar. However small, this possibility and awareness of it risks undermining the basis for trust in scientific knowledge and poses serious societal risks. Implications The use of ChatGPT to generate text for academic papers has raised concerns about research integrity. Discussion of this phenomenon is ongoing in editorials, commentaries, opinion pieces, and on social media (Bom, 2023; Stokel-Walker, 2024; Thorp, 2023). There are now several lists of papers suspected of GPT misuse, and new papers are constantly being added.1See for example Academ-AI, https://www.academ-ai.info/, and Retraction Watch, https://retractionwatch.com/papers-and-peer-reviews-with-evidence-of-chatgpt-writing/. While many legitimate uses of GPT for research and academic writing exist (Huang & Tan, 2023; Kitamura, 2023; Lund et al., 2023), its undeclared use—beyond proofreading—has potentially far-reaching implications for both science and society, but especially for their relationship. It, therefore, seems important to extend the discussion to one of the most accessible and well-known intermediaries between science, but also certain types of misinformation, and the public, namely Google Scholar, also in response to the legitimate concerns that the discussion of generative AI and misinformation needs to be more nuanced and empirically substantiated (Simon et al., 2023). Google Scholar, https://scholar.google.com, is an easy-to-use academic search engine. It is available for free, and its index is extensive (Gusenbauer & Haddaway, 2020). It is also often touted as a credible source for academic literature and even recommended in library guides, by media and information literacy initiatives, and fact checkers (Tripodi et al., 2023). However, Google Scholar lacks the transparency and adherence to standards that usually characterize citation databases. Instead, Google Scholar uses automated crawlers, like Google’s web search engine (Martín-Martín et al., 2021), and the inclusion criteria are based on primarily technical standards, allowing any individual author—with or without scientific affiliation—to upload papers to be indexed (Google Scholar Help, n.d.). It has been shown that Google Scholar is susceptible to manipulation through citation exploits (Antkare, 2020) and by providing access to fake scientific papers (Dadkhah et al., 2017). A large part of Google Scholar’s index consists of publications from established scientific journals or other forms of quality-controlled, scholarly literature. However, the index also contains a large amount of gray literature, including student papers, working papers, reports, preprint servers, and academic networking sites, as well as material from so-called “questionable” academic journals, including paper mills. The search interface does not offer the possibility to filter the results meaningfully by material type, publication status, or form of quality control, such as limiting the search to peer-reviewed material. To understand the occurrence of ChatGPT (co-)authored work in Google Scholar’s index, we scraped it for publications, including one of two common ChatGPT responses (see Appendix A) that we encountered on social media and in media reports (DeGeurin, 2024). The results of our descriptive statistical analyses showed that around 62% did not declare the use of GPTs. Most of these GPT-fabricated papers were found in non-indexed journals and working papers, but some cases included research published in mainstream scientific journals and conference proceedings.2Indexed journals mean scholarly journals indexed by abstract and citation databases such as Scopus and Web of Science, where the indexation implies journals with high scientific quality. Non-indexed journals are journals that fall outside of this indexation. More than half (57%) of these GPT-fabricated papers concerned policy-relevant subject areas susceptible to influence operations. To avoid increasing the visibility of these publications, we abstained from referencing them in this research note. However, we have made the data available in the Harvard Dataverse repository. The publications were related to three issue areas—health (14.5%), environment (19.5%) and computing (23%)—with key terms such “healthcare,” “COVID-19,” or “infection”for health-related papers, and “analysis,” “sustainable,” and “global” for environment-related papers. In several cases, the papers had titles that strung together general keywords and buzzwords, thus alluding to very broad and current research. These terms included “biology,” “telehealth,” “climate policy,” “diversity,” and “disrupting,” to name just a few. While the study’s scope and design did not include a detailed analysis of which parts of the articles included fabricated text, our dataset did contain the surrounding sentences for each occurrence of the suspicious phrases that formed the basis for our search and subsequent selection. Based on that, we can say that the phrases occurred in most sections typically found in scientific publications, including the literature review, methods, conceptual and theoretical frameworks, background, motivation or societal relevance, and even discussion. This was confirmed during the joint coding, where we read and discussed all articles. It became clear that not just the text related to the telltale phrases was created by GPT, but that almost all articles in our sample of questionable articles likely contained traces of GPT-fabricated text everywhere. Evidence hacking and backfiring effects Generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) can be used to produce texts that mimic scientific writing. These texts, when made available online—as we demonstrate—leak into the databases of academic search engines and other parts of the research infrastructure for scholarly communication. This development exacerbates problems that were already present with less sophisticated text generators (Antkare, 2020; Cabanac & Labbé, 2021). Yet, the public release of ChatGPT in 2022, together with the way Google Scholar works, has increased the likelihood of lay people (e.g., media, politicians, patients, students) coming across questionable (or even entirely GPT-fabricated) papers and other problematic research findings. Previous research has emphasized that the ability to determine the value and status of scientific publications for lay people is at stake when misleading articles are passed off as reputable (Haider & Åström, 2017) and that systematic literature reviews risk being compromised (Dadkhah et al., 2017). It has also been highlighted that Google Scholar, in particular, can be and has been exploited for manipulating the evidence base for politically charged issues and to fuel conspiracy narratives (Tripodi et al., 2023). Both concerns are likely to be magnified in the future, increasing the risk of what we suggest calling evidence hacking—the strategic and coordinated malicious manipulation of society’s evidence base. The authority of quality-controlled research as evidence to support legislation, policy, politics, and other forms of decision-making is undermined by the presence of undeclared GPT-fabricated content in publications professing to be scientific. Due to the large number of archives, repositories, mirror sites, and shadow libraries to which they spread, there is a clear risk that GPT-fabricated, questionable papers will reach audiences even after a possible retraction. There are considerable technical difficulties involved in identifying and tracing computer-fabricated papers (Cabanac & Labbé, 2021; Dadkhah et al., 2023; Jones, 2024), not to mention preventing and curbing their spread and uptake. However, as the rise of the so-called anti-vaxx movement during the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing obstruction and denial of climate change show, retracting erroneous publications often fuels conspiracies and increases the following of these movements rather than stopping them. To illustrate this mechanism, climate deniers frequently question established scientific consensus by pointing to other, supposedly scientific, studies that support their claims. Usually, these are poorly executed, not peer-reviewed, based on obsolete data, or even fraudulent (Dunlap & Brulle, 2020). A similar strategy is successful in the alternative epistemic world of the global anti-vaccination movement (Carrion, 2018) and the persistence of flawed and questionable publications in the scientific record already poses significant problems for health research, policy, and lawmakers, and thus for society as a whole (Littell et al., 2024). Considering that a person’s support for “doing your own research” is associated with increased mistrust in scientific institutions (Chinn & Hasell, 2023), it will be of utmost importance to anticipate and consider such backfiring effects already when designing a technical solution, when suggesting industry or legal regulation, and in the planning of educational measures. Recommendations Solutions should be based on simultaneous considerations of technical, educational, and regulatory approaches, as well as incentives, including social ones, across the entire research infrastructure. Paying attention to how these approaches and incentives relate to each other can help identify points and mechanisms for disruption. Recognizing fraudulent academic papers must happen alongside understanding how they reach their audiences and what reasons there might be for some of these papers successfully “sticking around.” A possible way to mitigate some of the risks associated with GPT-fabricated scholarly texts finding their way into academic search engine results would be to provide filtering options for facets such as indexed journals, gray literature, peer-review, and similar on the interface of publicly available academic search engines. Furthermore, evaluation tools for indexed journals3Such as LiU Journal CheckUp, https://ep.liu.se/JournalCheckup/default.aspx?lang=eng. could be integrated into the graphical user interfaces and the crawlers of these academic search engines. To enable accountability, it is important that the index (database) of such a search engine is populated according to criteria that are transparent, open to scrutiny, and appropriate to the workings of science and other forms of academic research. Moreover, considering that Google Scholar has no real competitor, there is a strong case for establishing a freely accessible, non-specialized academic search engine that is not run for commercial reasons but for reasons of public interest. Such measures, together with educational initiatives aimed particularly at policymakers, science communicators, journalists, and other media workers, will be crucial to reducing the possibilities for and effects of malicious manipulation or evidence hacking. It is important not to present this as a technical problem that exists only because of AI text generators but to relate it to the wider concerns in which it is embedded. These range from a largely dysfunctional scholarly publishing system (Haider & Åström, 2017) and academia’s “publish or perish” paradigm to Google’s near-monopoly and ideological battles over the control of information and ultimately knowledge. Any intervention is likely to have systemic effects; these effects need to be considered and assessed in advance and, ideally, followed up on. Our study focused on a selection of papers that were easily recognizable as fraudulent. We used this relatively small sample as a magnifying glass to examine, delineate, and understand a problem that goes beyond the scope of the sample itself, which however points towards larger concerns that require further investigation. The work of ongoing whistleblowing initiatives4Such as Academ-AI, https://www.academ-ai.info/, and Retraction Watch, https://retractionwatch.com/papers-and-peer-reviews-with-evidence-of-chatgpt-writing/., recent media reports of journal closures (Subbaraman, 2024), or GPT-related changes in word use and writing style (Cabanac et al., 2021; Stokel-Walker, 2024) suggest that we only see the tip of the iceberg. There are already more sophisticated cases (Dadkhah et al., 2023) as well as cases involving fabricated images (Gu et al., 2022). Our analysis shows that questionable and potentially manipulative GPT-fabricated papers permeate the research infrastructure and are likely to become a widespread phenomenon. Our findings underline that the risk of fake scientific papers being used to maliciously manipulate evidence (see Dadkhah et al., 2017) must be taken seriously. Manipulation may involve undeclared automatic summaries of texts, inclusion in literature reviews, explicit scientific claims, or the concealment of errors in studies so that they are difficult to detect in peer review. However, the mere possibility of these things happening is a significant risk in its own right that can be strategically exploited and will have ramifications for trust in and perception of science. Society’s methods of evaluating sources and the foundations of media and information literacy are under threat and public trust in science is at risk of further erosion, with far-reaching consequences for society in dealing with information disorders. To address this multifaceted problem, we first need to understand why it exists and proliferates. Findings Finding 1: 139 GPT-fabricated, questionable papers were found and listed as regular results on the Google Scholar results page. Non-indexed journals dominate. Most questionable papers we found were in non-indexed journals or were working papers, but we did also find some in established journals, publications, conferences, and repositories. We found a total of 139 papers with a suspected deceptive use of ChatGPT or similar LLM applications (see Table 1). Out of these, 19 were in indexed journals, 89 were in non-indexed journals, 19 were student papers found in university databases, and 12 were working papers (mostly in preprint databases). Table 1 divides these papers into categories. Health and environment papers made up around 34% (47) of the sample. Of these, 66% were present in non-indexed journals.

Number of papers across topics and venues using ChatGPT fraudulently or undeclared. * Indexed by Scopus, Norwegian register for scientific journals, series and publishers, WoS and/or DOAJ. Finding 2: GPT-fabricated, questionable papers are disseminated online, permeating the research infrastructure for scholarly communication, often in multiple copies. Applied topics with practical implications dominate. The 20 papers concerning health-related issues are distributed across 20 unique domains, accounting for 46 URLs. The 27 papers dealing with environmental issues can be found across 26 unique domains, accounting for 56 URLs. Most of the identified papers exist in multiple copies and have already spread to several archives, repositories, and social media. It would be difficult, or impossible, to remove them from the scientific record. As apparent from Table 2, GPT-fabricated, questionable papers are seeping into most parts of the online research infrastructure for scholarly communication. Platforms on which identified papers have appeared include ResearchGate, ORCiD, Journal of Population Therapeutics and Clinical Pharmacology (JPTCP), Easychair, Frontiers, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer (IEEE), and X/Twitter. Thus, even if they are retracted from their original source, it will prove very difficult to track, remove, or even just mark them up on other platforms. Moreover, unless regulated, Google Scholar will enable their continued and most likely unlabeled discoverability.

However, as can be seen in Figure 1, it also reveals overlap and sub-areas. The y-axis shows word prominences through word positions and font sizes, while the x-axis indicates semantic similarity. In addition to a certain amount of overlap, this reveals sub-areas, which are best described as two distinct events within the word rain. The event on the left bundles terms related to the development and management of health and healthcare with “challenges,” “impact,” and “potential of artificial intelligence”emerging as semantically related terms. Terms related to research infrastructures, environmental, epistemic, and technological concepts are arranged further down in the same event (e.g., “system,” “climate,” “understanding,” “knowledge,” “learning,” “education,” “sustainable”). A second distinct event further to the right bundles terms associated with fish farming and aquatic medicinal plants, highlighting the presence of an aquaculture cluster. Here, the prominence of groups of terms such as “used,” “model,” “-based,” and “traditional” suggests the presence of applied research on these topics. The two events making up the word rain visualization, are linked by a less dominant but overlapping cluster of terms related to “energy” and “water.” Figure 1. Word rain of environment- and health-related GPT-fabricated, questionable full-text papers. The bar chart of the terms in the paper subset (see Figure 2) complements the word rain visualization by depicting the most prominent terms in the full texts along the y-axis. Here, word prominences across health and environment papers are arranged descendingly, where values outside parentheses are TF-IDF values (relative frequencies) and values inside parentheses are raw term frequencies (absolute frequencies). Figure 2. Most prominent terms in environment- and health-related GPT-fabricated, questionable full-text papers. Finding 3: Google Scholar presents results from quality-controlled and non-controlled citation databases on the same interface, providing unfiltered access to GPT-fabricated questionable papers. Google Scholar’s central position in the publicly accessible scholarly communication infrastructure, as well as its lack of standards, transparency, and accountability in terms of inclusion criteria, has potentially serious implications for public trust in science. This is likely to exacerbate the already-known potential to exploit Google Scholar for evidence hacking (Tripodi et al., 2023) and will have implications for any attempts to retract or remove fraudulent papers from their original publication venues. Any solution must consider the entirety of the research infrastructure for scholarly communication and the interplay of different actors, interests, and incentives. Methods We searched and scraped Google Scholar using the Python library Scholarly (Cholewiak et al., 2023) for papers that included specific phrases known to be common responses from ChatGPT and similar applications with the same underlying model (GPT3.5 or GPT4): “as of my last knowledge update” and/or “I don’t have access to real-time data” (see Appendix A). This facilitated the identification of papers that likely used generative AI to produce text, resulting in 227 retrieved papers. The papers’ bibliographic information was automatically added to a spreadsheet and downloaded into Zotero.6An open-source reference manager, https://zotero.org. We employed multiple coding (Barbour, 2001) to classify the papers based on their content. First, we jointly assessed whether the paper was suspected of fraudulent use of ChatGPT (or similar) based on how the text was integrated into the papers and whether the paper was presented as original research output or the AI tool’s role was acknowledged. Second, in analyzing the content of the papers, we continued the multiple coding by classifying the fraudulent papers into four categories identified during an initial round of analysis—health, environment, computing, and others—and then determining which subjects were most affected by this issue (see Table 1). Out of the 227 retrieved papers, 88 papers were written with legitimate and/or declared use of GPTs (i.e., false positives, which were excluded from further analysis), and 139 papers were written with undeclared and/or fraudulent use (i.e., true positives, which were included in further analysis). The multiple coding was conducted jointly by all authors of the present article, who collaboratively coded and cross-checked each other’s interpretation of the data simultaneously in a shared spreadsheet file. This was done to single out coding discrepancies and settle coding disagreements, which in turn ensured methodological thoroughness and analytical consensus (see Barbour, 2001). Redoing the category coding later based on our established coding schedule, we achieved an intercoder reliability (Cohen’s kappa) of 0.806 after eradicating obvious differences. The ranking algorithm of Google Scholar prioritizes highly cited and older publications (Martín-Martín et al., 2016). Therefore, the position of the articles on the search engine results pages was not particularly informative, considering the relatively small number of results in combination with the recency of the publications. Only the query “as of my last knowledge update” had more than two search engine result pages. On those, questionable articles with undeclared use of GPTs were evenly distributed across all result pages (min: 4, max: 9, mode: 8), with the proportion of undeclared use being slightly higher on average on later search result pages. To understand how the papers making fraudulent use of generative AI were disseminated online, we programmatically searched for the paper titles (with exact string matching) in Google Search from our local IP address (see Appendix B) using the googlesearch–python library(Vikramaditya, 2020). We manually verified each search result to filter out false positives—results that were not related to the paper—and then compiled the most prominent URLs by field. This enabled the identification of other platforms through which the papers had been spread. We did not, however, investigate whether copies had spread into SciHub or other shadow libraries, or if they were referenced in Wikipedia. We used descriptive statistics to count the prevalence of the number of GPT-fabricated papers across topics and venues and top domains by subject. The pandas software library for the Python programming language (The pandas development team, 2024) was used for this part of the analysis. Based on the multiple coding, paper occurrences were counted in relation to their categories, divided into indexed journals, non-indexed journals, student papers, and working papers. The schemes, subdomains, and subdirectories of the URL strings were filtered out while top-level domains and second-level domains were kept, which led to normalizing domain names. This, in turn, allowed the counting of domain frequencies in the environment and health categories. To distinguish word prominences and meanings in the environment and health-related GPT-fabricated questionable papers, a semantically-aware word cloud visualization was produced through the use of a word rain (Centre for Digital Humanities Uppsala, 2023) for full-text versions of the papers. Font size and y-axis positions indicate word prominences through TF-IDF scores for the environment and health papers (also visualized in a separate bar chart with raw term frequencies in parentheses), and words are positioned along the x-axis to reflect semantic similarity (Skeppstedt et al., 2024), with an English Word2vec skip gram model space (Fares et al., 2017). An English stop word list was used, along with a manually produced list including terms such as “https,” “volume,” or “years.” Download PDF Topics Artificial Intelligence / Research / Search engines Cite this Essay Haider, J., Söderström, K.

They said actually their main worry wasn't LLM-generated papers, it was LLM-generated reviews. LLMs are much better at plausibly summarizing content than they are at doing long sequences of reasoning, so they're much better at generating believable reviews than believable papers. Plus reviews are pretty tedious to do, giving an incentive to half-ass it with an LLM. Plus reviews are usually not shared publicly, taking away some of the potential embarrassment. reply empiko 17 hours agoparentWe already got an LLM generated meta review that was very clearly just summarization of reviews. There were some pretty egregious cases of borderline hallucinated remarks. This was ACL Rolling Review, so basically the most prestigious NLP venue and the editors told us to suck it up. Very disappointing and I genuinely worry about the state of science and how this will affect people who rely on scientometric criteria. reply Al-Khwarizmi 11 hours agorootparentThis is a problem in general, but the unmitigated disaster that is ARR (ACL Rolling Review) doesn't help. On the one hand, if you submit to a conference, you are forced to \"volunteer\" for that cycle. Which is a good idea from a \"justice\" point of view, but its also a sure way of generating unmotivated reviewers. Not only because a person might be unmotivated in general, but because the -rather short- reviewing period may coincide in your vacation (this happened to many people with EMNLP, whose reviewing period was in the summer) and you're not given any alternative but to \"volunteer\" and deal with it. On the other hand, even regular reviewers aren't treated too well. Lately they implemented a minimum max load of 4 (which can push people towards choosing uncomfortable loads, in fact, that seems to be the purpose) and loads aren't even respected (IIRC there have been mails to the tune of \"some people set a max load but we got a lot of submissions so you may get more submissions than your load, lololol\"). While I don't condone using LLMs for reviewing and I would never do such a thing, I am not too surprised that these things happen given that ARR makes the already often thankless job of reviewing even more annoying. To be honest, lately, I have gotten better quality reviews from the supposedly second-tier conferences that haven't joined ARR (e.g. this year's LREC-COLING) than from ARR. Although sample size is very small, of course. reply jll29 15 hours agorootparentprevMost conferences have been flooded with submissions, and ACL is no exception. A consequence of that is that there are not sufficient numbers of reviewers available who are qualified to review these manuscripts. Conference organizers might be keen to accept many or most who offer to volunteer, but clearly there is now a large pool of people that have never done this before, and were never taught how to do this. Add some time pressure, and people will try out some tool, just because it exists. GPT-generated docs have a particular tone that you can detect if you've played a bit with ChatGPT and if you have a feel for language. Such reviews should be kicked out. I would be interested to view this review (anonymized if you like - by taking out bits that reveal too narrowly what it's about). The \"rolling\" model of ARR is a pain, though, because instead of slaving for a month you feel like slaving (conducting scientific peer review free of charge = slave labor) all year round. Last month, I got contacted by a book editor to review a scientific book for $100. I told her I'm not going to read 350 pages, to write two pages worth of book review; to do this properly one would need two days, and I quoted my consulting day rate. On top of that, this email came in the vacation month of August. Of course, said person was never heard of again. reply joshvm 13 hours agorootparentWe had what we strongly suspect is an LLM-written review for NeurIPS. It was kind of subtle if you weren't looking carefully and I can see that an AC might miss it. The suggestions for improvement weren't _wrong_, but the GPT response picked up on some extremely specific things in the paper that were mostly irrelevant (other reviewers actually pointed out the odd typo and small corrections or improvemnts where we'd made statements). Pretty hard to combat. We just rebutted as if it were a real review - maybe it was - and hope that the chairs see it. Speaking to other folks, opinions are split over whether this sort of review should be flagged. I know some people who tried to query a review and it didn't help. There were other small cues - the English was perfect, while other reviewers made small slips indicative of non-native speakers. One was simply the discrepancy between the tone of the review (generally very positive) and the middle-of-the-road rating and confidence. The structure of the review was very \"The authors do X, Y, Z. This is important because A, B, C.\" and the reviewer didn't bother to fill out any of the other review sections (they just wrote single-word answeres to all of them). The kicker was actually putting our paper in to 4o and asking it to write a review and seeing the same keywords pop up. reply ahartmetz 11 hours agorootparentprev> people who rely on scientometric criteria Not defending LLM papers at all, but these people can go to hell. If \"scientometrics\" was ever a good idea, after making the measure the target, it for sure isn't anymore. A longer, carefully written, comprehensive paper is rated worse than many short, incremental, hastily written papers. reply userbinator 16 hours agorootparentprevso basically the most prestigious NLP venue I see \"dogfooding\" has now been taken to its natural conclusion. reply reliabilityguy 17 hours agorootparentprevWell, given that the only thing that matters for tenure reviews is the “service”, i.e., roughly a list of conferences the applicant reviewed/performed some sort of service at, this is barely a surprise. Right now there is now incentive to do a high quality review unless the reviewer is motivated. reply nextaccountic 17 hours agorootparentprevCould you share it publicly or would you face adverse consequences? If you can please publish it and maybe post here on HN or reddit. reply Der_Einzige 16 hours agorootparentprevWith NeurIPS 2024 reviews going on right now, I'm sure that a whole lot of these kind of reviews are being generated daily. reply bravura 13 hours agorootparentWith ICLR paper deadline coming up, I guess it's worth wargaming how GPT4 would review my submission. reply joshvm 13 hours agorootparentSee my other post - we had exactly this for NeurIPS. It is definitely worth seeing what GPT says about your paper if only because it's a free review. The criticisms it gave us weren't wrong per se, they were just weakly backed up and it would still be up to a reviewer to judge how relevant they are or not. Every paper has downsides, but you need domain knowledge to judge if it's a small issue or a killer. Amusingly, our LLM-reviewer gave a much lower score than when we asked GPT to provide a rating (and also significantly lower than the other reviewers). One example was that GPT took an explicit geographic location from a figure caption and used that as a reference point when suggesting improvements (along the lines of \"location X is under-represented on this map\") I assume because it places some high degree of relevance to figures and the abstract when summarising papers. I think you might be able to combat this by writing defensively - in our case we might have avoided that by saying \"more information about geographic diversity may be found in X and the supplementary information\" reply zaptrem 13 hours agorootparentprevBetter yet, generate some adversarial perturbations to the text (or an invisible prompt) to cause it to give you a perfect review! reply jampekka 12 hours agoparentprevLLMs reviewing LLM generated articles via LLM editors is more or less guaranteed to become a massive thing given the incentive structures/survival pressures of everyone involved. Researchers get massive CVs, reviewers and editors get off easy, admins get to show great output numbers from their institutions, and of course the publishers continue making hand over fist. It's a rather broken system. reply basch 15 hours agoparentprevIt might follow to say that current LLM;s arent trained to generate papers, BUT they also don't really need to reason. They just need to mimic the appearance of reason, follow the same pattern of progression. Ingesting enough of what amounts to executed templates will teach it to generate its own results as if output from the same template. reply Eisenstein 14 hours agorootparentWhat is the difference between 'reasoning' and 'appearing to be reasoning' if the results are the same with the same input? reply ben_w 13 hours agorootparentThe outputs aren't really the same, they simply seem plausible at first glance. For example, I recently experimented with using ChatGPT to translate a Wikipedia article, on the grounds that it mighy maintain all the formatting and that Transformer models are also used by Google Translate. As it was an experiment, I did actually check the results before submitting the translated article. First roughly 3/4 were fine. Final quarter was completely invented but plausible, including references. LLMs are very useful tools, I'll gladly use them to help with various tasks and they can (with low reliability but it has happened) even manage a whole project, but right now they should treated with caution and not left unsupervised — Peter principle, being promoted beyond their competence, still applies even though they're not human employees. reply nis0s 14 hours agorootparentprevFrom what I’ve seen, the results are not the same. In the latter scenario, there’s a risk of encountering a non sequitur all of a sudden, and the citations may be nonexistent. There’s also no guarantee that what you’re stating is factually correct when your logic is unbounded by reality. reply Sakos 10 hours agorootparentprevBecause the results aren't the same? I use AI every day for software development and a number of other topics. It's very easy to recognize the points where the illusion breaks and how it breaks clearly indicates to me that there's no actual reasoning in the response I've gotten. It often feels like I'm doing the reasoning for the AI and not the other way around. reply kovezd 17 hours agoparentprevI can see how LLMs contribute to raise the standard in that field. For example, surveying related research. Also, maybe in the not too distant future, reproducing (some) of the results. reply jll29 15 hours agorootparentWriting consists of iterated re-writing (to me, anyways), i.e. better and better ways to express content 1. correctly, 2. clearly and 3. space-economically. By writing it down (yourself) you understand what claims each piece of related work discussed has made (and can realistically make - as there sometims are inflationary lists of claims in papers), and this helps you formulate your own claim as it relates to them (new task, novel method for known task, like older method but works better, nearly as good as a past method but runs faster etc.). If you outsource it to a machine you no longer see it through, and the result will be poor unless you are a very bad writer. I can, however, see a role for LLMs in an electronic \"learn how to write better\" tutoring system. reply Eisenstein 14 hours agorootparentDoes every researcher write summaries of related research themselves? reply jpeloquin 5 hours agorootparentPretty much yes. Critical analysis is a necessary skill that needs practice. It's also necessary to be aware of the intricacies of work in one's own topic area, defined narrowly, to clearly communicate how one's own methods are similar/different to others' methods. reply refibrillator 18 hours agoprevHmm there may be a bug in the authors’ python script that searches google scholar for the phrases \"as of my last knowledge update\" or \"I don't have access to real-time data\". You can see the code in appendix B. The bug happens if the ‘bib’ key doesn’t exist in the api response. That leads to the urls array having more rows than the paper_data array. So the columns could become mismatched in the final data frame. It seems they made a third array called flag which could be used to detect and remove the bad results, but it’s not used any where in the posted code. Not clear to me how this would affect their analysis, it does seem like something they would catch when manually reviewing the papers. But perhaps the bibliographic data wasn’t reviewed and only used to calculate the summary stats etc. reply viraptor 17 hours agoparentThat sounds important enough to contact the authors. Best case, they fixed it up manually; worst case, lots of papers are publicly accused of being made up and the whole farming/fish-focused summary they produced is completely wrong. reply Lerc 15 hours agoparentprevAs a tangent to the paper topic itself, what should be the standard procedure for publishing data gathering code like this? Given that they don't specify which version of any libraries or APIs used and that updates occur over time, API's change etc. inevitably resulting in code rot. It will eventually be impossible to figure out exactly what this code did. With meticulous version records it should at least be possible to ascertain what the code did by reconstructing that exact version (assuming stored back versions exist) reply jpeloquin 5 hours agorootparentIn my opinion, archive the data that was actually gathered and the code's intermediate & final outputs. Write the code clearly enough that what it did can be understood by reading it alone, since with pervasive software churn it won't be runnable as-is forever. As a bonus, this approach works even when some steps are manual processes. reply jerpint 14 hours agorootparentprevUsing a colab with printed outputs could be a good option to at the very least hint to reproducing results independently reply hiddencost 16 hours agoparentprevhttps://www.hb.se/en/research/research-portal/researchers/JU...

For any who haven't seen/heard, this makes for some entertaining and eye-opening viewing! https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=academic+fraud reply benreesman 15 hours agoparentI think it’s important to remember that while the tidal wave of spam just starting to crest courtesy of the less scrupulous LLM vendors is uh, necessary to address, this century’s war on epistemology was well underway already in the grand traditions of periodic wars on the idea that facts are even aspirationally, directionally worthwhile. The phrase “alternative facts” hit the mainstream in 2016 and the idea that resistance is futile on broad-spectrum digital weaponized bytes was muscular then (that was around the time I was starting to feel ill for being a key architect of it). Now technology is a human artifact and always ends up resembling its creators or financiers or both: I’d have nice fonts on my computer in 2024 most likely either way, but it’s directly because of Jobs they were available in 1984 to a household budget. If someone other than Altman had or some other insight than “this thing can lie in a newly scalable way” was the escape velocity moment on LLMs then we’d still have test sets and metrics and just science going on in the Commanding Heights of the S&P 500, but these people are a symptom of our apathy around any noble instinct. If we had stuck firm on our values no effective altruism cult leader type would even make the press. reply greesil 10 hours agorootparentThe metric is in fact the stock price. reply __loam 12 hours agorootparentprevPost-modernism was a mistake. reply benreesman 11 hours agorootparentIndeed.

Now this sounds like a story worth hearing! reply anileated 10 hours agoparentprevDifficulty and scale matter where it comes to fabrication. Academia is a lot about barriers, which while sometimes unpleasant and malfunctioning nevertheless serve a purpose (unfortunately, it is impossible to evaluate everything fully on per-case basis, so humans need shortcuts to filter out noise and determine quicker if it is worth spending attention on). One of the barriers is in the form of the paper itself. The fall of this barrier (notably through often unauthorised use of others’ IP) would likely bring about not sudden idyllic meritocracy but increased noise and/or strengthening of other barriers. reply EasyMark 7 hours agoparentprevSure, but that takes time, AI has the potential to generate “real sounding”papers in under a second. At least the fake papers before were rate limited. reply bumby 18 hours agoparentprevIs there good data on how many are fraudulent? I know there’s reasonable data on replicability issues, but that’s potentially different. reply croes 13 hours agoparentprevBut AI is to papers what the assembly line was to cars. reply tkgally 12 hours agoprevFor a paper that includes both a broad discussion of the scholarly issues raised by LLMs and wide-ranging policy recommendations, I wish the authors had taken a more nuanced approach to data collection than just searching for “as of my last knowledge update” and/or “I don’t have access to real-time data” and weeding out the false positives manually. LLMs can be used in scholarly writing in many ways that will not be caught with such a coarse sieve. Some are obviously illegitimate, such as having an LLM write an entire paper with fabricated data. But there are other ways that are not so clearly unacceptable. For example, the authors’ statement that “[GPT’s] undeclared use—beyond proofreading—has potentially far-reaching implications for both science and society” suggests that, for them, using LLMs for “proofreading” is okay. But “proofreading” is understood in various ways. For some people, it would include only correcting spelling and grammatical mistakes. For others, especially for people who are not native speakers of English, it can also include changing the wording and even rewriting entire sentences and paragraphs to make the meaning clearer. To what extent can one use an LLM for such revision without declaring that one has done so? reply pcrh 15 hours agoprevThis kind of fabricated result is not a problem for practitioners in the relevant fields, who can easily distinguish between false and real work. If there are instances where the ability to make such distinctions is lost, it is most likely to be so because the content lacks novelty, i.e. it simply regurgitates known and established facts. In which case it is a pointless effort, even if it might inflate the supposed author's list of publications. As to the integrity of researchers, this is a known issue. The temptation to fabricate data existed long before the latest innovations in AI, and is very easy to do in most fields, particularly in medicine or biosciences which constitute the bulk of irreproducible research. Policing this kind of behavior is not altered by GPT or similar. The bigger problem, however, is when non-experts attempt to become informed and are unable to distinguish between plausible and implausible sources of information. This is already a problem even without AI, consider the debates over the origins of SARS-CoV2, for example. The solution to this is the cultivation and funding of sources of expertise, e.g. in Universities and similar. reply EnigmaFlare 14 hours agoparentNon-experts actually attempting to become informed (instead of just feeling like they're informed) can easily tell the difference too. The people being fooled are the ones who want to be fooled. They're looking for something to support their pre-existing belief. And for those people, they'll always find something they can convince themselves supports their belief, so I don't think it matters what false information is floating around. It seems to be kind of a new thing for laymen to be reading scientific papers. 20 years ago, they just weren't accessible. You had to physically go to a local university library and work out how to use the arcane search tools, which wouldn't really find what you wanted anyway. And even then, you couldn't take it home and half the time you couldn't even photocopy it because you needed a student ID card to use the photocopier. reply daghamm 12 hours agoprevLast time we discussed this, someone basically searched for phrases such as \"certainly I can do X for you\" and assumed that meant GPT was used.

If noone bothered to even spot and remove these, you can be pretty sure that no human ever read the whole paper before publication. reply OutOfHere 2 hours agorootparentIMO, at this point, AI is very necessary as a pre-reviewer to weed out such papers that haven't been proofread.

For the sake of argument, I use Github Copilot for \"fabricating\" every line of code. Does this make my code polluted? No, because I review every line of code, editing what's necessary, and more. It's the same way with scholarship. It doesn't say anything in itself. Perhaps \"unreviewed scholarship\" would be a more concerning claim, but I don't yet see the evidence for it being a major concern. reply gerdesj 18 hours agoprevColour me surprised. An IT related search will generally end up with loads of returns that lead to AI generated wankery. For example, suppose you wish to back up switch configs or dump a file or whatever and tftp is so easy and simple to setup. You'll tear it down later or firewall it or whatever. So a quick search \"linux tftp serevr\" gets you to say: https://thelinuxcode.com/install_tftp_server_ubuntu/ All good until you try to use the --create flag which should allow you to upload to the server. That flag is not valid for tftp-hpa, it is valid on tftpd (another tftp daemon) That's a hallucination. Hallucinations are fucking annoying and increasingly prevalent. In Windows land the humans hallucinate - C:\\ SFC /SCANNOW does not fix anything except for something really madly self imposed. reply viraptor 16 hours agoparentThat's not an AI hallucination. The content comes from Ubuntu community wiki https://help.ubuntu.com/community/TFTP - it was written in 2015. And at least in Debian, tftpd-hpa man page lists --create as valid https://manpages.debian.org/testing/tftpd-hpa/tftpd.8.en.htm...

Much more work is needed to show that this means anything. reply viraptor 17 hours agoparentIf the result was not read even to check for obvious boilerplate GPT markers, then we can't expect anything else in them was. That means anything else, numbers, interpretation, conclusion was potentially never checked. The authors use fraud in a specific sense here: \"using ChatGPT fraudulently or undeclared\" where they proved that the produced text was included without proper review. They also never accused those papers of misinformation, so they don't need to show evidence of that. reply Barrin92 18 hours agoprev [–] Honestly what we need to do is establish much stronger credentialing schemes. The \"only a good guy with an AI can stop a bad guy with an AI\" approach of trying to filter out bad content is just a hopeless arms race and unproductive. In a sense we need to go back two steps and websites need to be much stronger curators of knowledge again, and we need some reliable ways to sign and attribute real authorship to publications. So that when someone publishes a fake paper there is always a human being who signed it and can be held accountable. There's a practically unlimited number of automated systems, but only a limited number of people trying to benefit from it. In the same way https went from being rare to being the norm because the assumption that things are default-authentic doesn't hold, the same just needs to happen to publishing. If you have a functioning reputation system and you can put on a price on fake information 99% of it is dis-incentivized. reply tbrownaw 17 hours agoparent [–] Is this not already a thing? You can look up purported papers by DOI, and whatever journal it came from supposedly had it reviewed and should know who sent it to them. (And if that doesn't work, how is what you're suggesting meaningfully different?) reply Barrin92 16 hours agorootparent [–] It's not at all a thing. Here's a recent study looking at citation fraud on Google Scholar including professional citation boosting services including with fake identities. It's widespread practice. https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04607 Having a machine verifiable, cryptographic identity system that renders these kinds of things transparent, basically the equivalent of a ledger but instead of using it for get-rich schemes using it for identity would probably make verification enforceable. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "home blog lisp favorites pl resources bread recipes rss microui+fenster=small gui September 7, 2024 Sometimes I just want to put pixels on a screen. I don’t want to think about SDL this or OpenGL that—I just want to draw my pixel buffer and be done. fenster, a tiny 2D canvas library by Serge Zaitsev, does just that. It’s a tiny drop-in header-only C/C++ file that weighs no more than 400 LOC of pretty readable code. It works with WinAPI, Cocoa, and X11. And it handles keyboard and mouse input, too! Sometimes I want to do just a little more than draw pixels—maybe have a menu, some buttons, render text—and I don’t want to completely DIY but I still don’t want to think about SDL. Fortunately, microui by rxi exists and handles the translation from GUI elements into a simple retargetable drawing bytecode. It’s similarly a small, drop-in library, weighing only 1500 LOC. Unfortunately, the demo program uses SDL as a backend for the bytecode. I’d been meaning to see if I could instead use fenster but understanding what a “quad” was or what “glScissor” did seemed intimidating. The project went nowhere. Then, as usual, Kartik and I had a small argument and that resulted in us creating the fenster backend for microui! I sent him a skeleton to show what I wanted to do and he did most of the heavy lifting for the OpenGL-like parts. The result is a less than 250 LOC file that binds microui to fenster. It’s inspired by the SDL renderer demo, but with a couple of added functions to abstract away keys and mouse buttons. It’s hacky and there’s some stuff we still don’t understand, but it works! And by “works” I mean draws the expected demo windows, handles mouse hover and click, and handles keyboard input. Things left to figure out: How to determine when to render from the texture and when from the provided drawing command’s color Mod keys like so that, for example, Shift+1 renders !

    "originBody": "View image in fullscreen Strava, an app connecting and tracking runners, has had a 20% increase in user numbers, year on year. Photograph: vgajic/Getty Images The Observer Apps Goodbye Tinder, hello Strava: have ‘hobby’ apps become the new social networks? Millions are rejecting the culture-war hotspots of the major social media sites in favour of apps dedicated to activities they enjoy, while bonding with their fellow users Chris Stokel-Walker Sun 8 Sep 2024 05.00 EDT Share S ingletons looking to shack up with their soulmates online have relied on two key routes in the past decade or so: take your chance on dating apps, or befriend as many mutuals as possible on social media, in the hope that you find the one. But some have found a third way, using services such as Goodreads and Strava to meet partners with whom they hope to spend the rest of their lives. Those couples proved to be trendsetters. So-called hobby apps – built around activites such as running, reading or movie-going – are having a moment, and not just for love. It’s all part of a broader movement as people grow tired of the “digital town square” offered on Twitter/X and other social media platforms. At a time when many are abandoning Elon Musk’s social network over his attitude to “free speech” (which some see as “amplifying hate”), competing apps such as Bluesky and Threads are having a resurgence in users. Whereas some users are switching to Twitter replicas, others are seeking refuge in apps that promise to connect them to people with whom they have common interests. Running app Strava has seen user numbers grow 20% in a year, according to digital market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. That success has led it to add a messaging tool for users to keep in touch, alongside documenting their workouts. Knitting social network Ravelry, which is accessed through a number of third-party apps, has more than 9 million users. Goodreads has clocked up more than 150 million members. Letterboxd, a film completist’s dream app, where you can tick off the latest movies you’ve seen, and review and rate them, alongside other cinephiles and the occasional famous actor or director, has gone from having 1.8 million users worldwide in March 2020 to more than 14 million users this summer. The app has grown its monthly active userbase 55% in a year, according to Sensor Tower. Paradoxically, as major platforms push more algorithmically curated feeds, users may be less exposed to content they want to see Jess Maddox, University of Alabama “We really work hard on the tone and voice of everything we do, from community policy through to editorial through to our social, to guide folks in terms of how we want them to be around Letterboxd,” says Gemma Gracewood, the app’s editor-in-chief. “We talk about movies.” And that’s refreshing in a world where politics and culture wars are being pushed at us through algorithms. “Social media users have been turning towards niche apps and spaces for a long time,” says Jess Maddox, assistant professor in digital media at the University of Alabama. “Paradoxically, as major platforms such as Twitter/X, YouTube, TikTok and Instagram push more algorithmically curated feeds, users may be less exposed to the content they want to see.” The cosy nature of hobby apps, and the way they’re set up to share passions and pastimes, means they’re an altogether gentler place than the rough-and-tumble racism you can encounter on X with an errant tap. “It’s a way for people to connect via common interests,” says Dr Carolina Are, a social media researcher at the Centre for Digital Citizens at Northumbria University. It all means that the apps can spend less time, effort and money on content moderation – assuming that civility will be supreme – and instead focus on making the overall experience better. “The thing about Letterboxd is there isn’t a ‘central town square’ like there is on X; it’s a very single-channel conversation,” says Gracewood. Comments happen in-line – similar to those on the Guardian and Observer websites – meaning that it’s less possible to performatively repost content into a main feed in order to encourage a pile-on. Similar situations exist on platforms such as Goodreads and Strava, where it’s possible to communicate with and message others, but not to publicly shame them easily. Because hobby apps are nicer places to exist, people spend more time on them – and they can eventually turn into services that are more than advertised. That includes finding like-minded people with whom you’d want to spend your time romantically. One reason that people may be starting to find love on apps not explicitly designed for that purpose is because the expectations are lower – and as such, the atmosphere is less sexually charged. “Dating apps seem like a dating supermarket, and something you have to do if you want to have some kind of connection,” says Are. View image in fullscreen Book recommendation app Goodreads now has more than 150 million members. Photograph: goodreads.com She points out that while dating apps are trying to shed their shallow reputation as places to hook up, they still lead with giant pictures of users to gauge compatibility. “A lot of people are becoming quite disillusioned with the fact you’re judged on looks,” she says. “In general, there is a bit of a disillusionment with platform-facilitated dating culture, because it seems very impersonal. It’s all facilitated by an algorithm. And it seems not to serve people very well.” Hobby apps’ gain is dating apps’ loss, based on recent financial figures from Match Group, the company that operates the best-known dating services, including Tinder and Hinge. From an October 2021 peak of more than $175 a share, Match is now trading at nearer $36 a share. The firm announced job cuts of 6% in July due to dwindling paying users. But the rot isn’t limited to the big beasts in the game. An analysis of the top 200 dating and social connection apps by Deutsche Bank – entitled Dating: The Dating Debate – Have We Hit Saturation Levels? – suggests that global downloads have plateaued. We have always been very concerned with what creating a community online looks like, and how to keep it feeling free, good and nice It also helps that hobby apps feel like a more cohesive, kinder community. That’s not just because the people are kinder: Letterboxd has a set of moderators who are tasked with taking a “zero tolerance” approach to overt or coded hate speech, racism, homophobia, white supremacy, transphobia or any other marginalising attitudes. Letterboxd has fewer than 10 staff moderating content, says Gracewood, and generally they don’t need to intervene often. “I can’t speak to whether we’ve benefited from cultural and mission shifts at other social media platforms, but I can say that from day one, we have always been very, very concerned with what creating a community online looks like, and how to keep it feeling free, good and nice.” Whether that light-touch approach compared with social media apps – TikTok employs 40,000 content moderators worldwide, while Meta reportedly has 15,000 – will last is yet to be seen. “It seems like every app is born, isn’t moderated, then something bad happens and it gets heavily moderated,” says Are. “So maybe they [hobby apps] will have that trajectory as well.” Chris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: China’s Dynamite App and the Superpower Race for Social Media (Canbury Press, £9.99).

(theguardian.com)168 points by throwaway55479 9 hours agohidepastfavorite196 comments brushfoot 5 hours ago\"Users near you\" functionality is sorely needed in online spaces, considering how much interaction has moved online. Reddit has worked around their lack of it to some degree with location-based subreddits like r/AtlFilmmakers. But subreddits are high maintenance, and they isolate content. Plus, the naming conventions aren't standard. Maybe there's r/AtlFilmmakers for filmmakers in Atlanta, but another subreddit for musicians uses the state in the name instead of a city. It's a bit like folders vs. tags. It would be nicer to have a single filmmaking subreddit with the option to filter on users' locations -- and default filtering out of location-specific posts in other places. That wouldn't just make for better dating, though it probably would compared to something like Tinder. It could also lead to stronger local communities and better health outcomes. reply diggan 5 hours agoparent> \"Users near you\" functionality is sorely needed in online spaces, considering how much interaction has moved online. Funny this got mentioned as France just successfully got that very feature removed from Telegram by arresting the founder and citing that feature as the one being used most for abuse. Bunch of sources about that here: https://ground.news/article/telegram-to-start-moderating-pri... reply moi2388 4 hours agorootparentThat might have been cited as the reason, but I think we all know the real reason is that France is fighting against Russian troops in their former African colonies, and Russian troops mainly use Telegram for their communications. reply older 3 hours agorootparentWho are those \"we\" you're talking about? reply moi2388 3 hours agorootparentAnybody aware of what’s happening in Africa between France, Russia and Wagner reply older 3 hours agorootparentIs it some kind of secret bunch of people who know this? reply t-3 2 hours agorootparentThe secret bunch who pay attention to Africa.

With a single click you could get the other user's entire route, likely including their home (start/finish). After some backlash about safety/privacy, it was disabled on everyone's account and required people to manually opt-in: https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2020/10/strava-flyby-feature.htm... Very few people opted back in so the feature became useless. Most people still have the setting that matches them with people who have run with them on a group run (same exact route at the same time). reply Cthulhu_ 2 hours agorootparentWasn't it also Strava or a similar app that revealed military bases by the staff on patrol having the app on? I mean given sattelite imagery is a thing I doubt army bases are secret, but that was still a bit of a whoopsie, on both the personnel's part and the app's. reply jerlam 2 hours agorootparentYes, Strava's heatmaps revealed some military bases. And it's been implicated in the assassination of a Russian general. reply kayodelycaon 4 hours agoparentprevUnfortunately “Users near you” has the same problems AirTags has to deal with. If you’re looking for someone, these features often make finding the names of their new accounts trivial. It also tells you that person is within the app’s range. reply fragmede 4 hours agorootparentAirtags are very near you.

Edit: I meant how does Tiktok help person above meet people locally? reply cjbgkagh 5 hours agorootparentBy giving people what they want. A lot of this emergent behavior falls out of doing good search science. By optimizing other metrics YouTube etc are giving people less of what they want and more of what YouTube wants. YouTube would be useless if I couldn’t ban so many channels from my recommended feeds. At the early stages of TikTok there was some controversy that diverse, disabled, marginalized etc people were being underrepresented compared to other platforms and we now see how that turned out. I don’t necessarily think it’s a good idea to give people what they want and I consider TikTok to be so addictive that I’ve avoided using it, but it’s definitely a successful idea. reply goatsi 4 hours agorootparent>At the early stages of TikTok there was some controversy that diverse, disabled, marginalized etc people were being underrepresented compared to other platforms and we now see how that turned out. The controversy was that they were being actively suppressed as a moderation decision. https://theintercept.com/2020/03/16/tiktok-app-moderators-us... reply cjbgkagh 4 hours agorootparentThere is more than one way to give people what they want, and in my haste I clumsily muddled two of them. All the platforms are being moderated heavily with thumbs on the scales to advantage one group over another. My personal preference would be to have no thumbs on the scales. Additionally I hate TikTok for the intentional addictive mechanism that requires an attention 'ante' to find out if a video is interesting by preventing jumping to a later point in the video to see where it is going. Basically gambling but with attention instead of currency, the algorithm optimized to give the user just enough to keep them coming back but not too much to satiate their desires. Search Science is one of those research domains where it appears things are going backwards, google barely works anymore, facebook videos was terrible from the start and AFAIK stayed that way, YouTube only works for me because I have a subscribe list to people I support on Patreon. Amazon is being flooded with duplicate listings which should be trivial to de-dupe and clean up but I guess they suck at search science as well. If Amazon doesn't fix their search and fake good problem people might as well buy from Temu. Almost forgot, Twitter can't find bots that are so easy to find that they become 'X in bio' memes. reply WillPostForFood 3 hours agorootparentFWIW, you can fast forward or jump to any point in a TikTok video - just start dragging on the bottom of the screen and a scrubber will appear. Or tap to pause and a playback bar will dispay. In practice, you are right that there is an attention ante; most videos are short enough to sit through them to see the payoff without making the effort to scrub. reply cal85 4 hours agorootparentprev> we now see how that turned out how? no idea what you’re referring to. reply dqv 3 hours agorootparentprevYeah. It’s highly addictive. I have screentime for “fun apps” set to 30 mins now because it will suck you in for hours if you’re not careful. reply dgfitz 2 hours agorootparentI can honestly say I’ve never viewed a single tiktok video, and I intend to keep this true. Fuck that noise. reply GardenLetter27 1 hour agorootparentIt also has a lot of educational content, etc. - just like YouTube or Twitch. reply dgfitz 1 hour agorootparentSo does the Bible Edit: as does the Art of War, the Quran, the 1981 fall almanac, etc. education is almost a farce in 2024 reply dqv 3 hours agorootparentprevIt just adds the additional dimension of user location (where a user has tagged their post with their location, a lot of people just tag no location or Big Butt Mountain). So if you’ve taken an interest in chess, it will show you popular chess videos, but also throw chess videos in from people close by. On other apps like FB, it does show location-based content, but nothing I’m ever interested in (it doesn’t seem to understand interests+location, only interests or location). So like sure, it has posts from my neighbor, but it will be about lawn care or something else I’m not interested in. reply bilsbie 4 hours agorootparentprevIs it a setting or something? reply GardenLetter27 1 hour agorootparentprevSame, I met one of my friends on TikTok, commenting about an event nearby. reply marginalia_nu 8 hours agoprevCan't be overstated how good having a setting centered on some common activity with low stakes social interaction is for building relationships, romantic as well as platonic. Hookup culture just isn't for everyone, and the notion that it is has been the cause of a lot of grief and agony. reply etrautmann 7 hours agoparentYes, I’ve always loved the camaraderie around climbing gyms and the community that develops naturally when you go to a gym consistently. Romantically it’s quite hard though, if a relationship is built around an activity, there are a number of challenges if someone’s interest shifts or a big skill mismatch etc. reply hammock 5 hours agorootparentJust like work or school friendships, if you don’t shift those hangouts to other contexts (meals unconnected to the activity, family introductions, travel, etc) then they won’t stick outside of that initial context, however deep they feel at the time reply bee_rider 4 hours agorootparentprevCould that be a good filter-function? “How gracefully does this person handle our skill difference” seems like a nice thing to know about somebody. reply dgfitz 1 hour agorootparentMore “how does someone handle a skill difference?” Because very rarely are two people at the exact same skill set at the same time. In the context of climbing the disparity can be enormous. reply treflop 2 hours agoparentprevThis is commonly referred to as your \"third place,\" after your home and your work. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place Most kids have a third place growing up, being an extension of school or another place like the skate park. If you leave school and don't find a new third place, finding new friendships becomes difficult. reply snarf21 59 minutes agoparentprevIt is also extremely powerful for mental health. Having something to look forward and that anticipation has enumerable benefits. Also, every hobby has people who LOVE to help newbies and will talk infinitely about all the minutiae of all the things. reply bilsbie 4 hours agoparentprevThe only downside is I got injured and lost like 20 pickleball friends. They were good friends but we only bonded around one activity. reply mritchie712 7 hours agoparentprevespecially good when that common activity isn't: we're both drinking at this bar reply sublinear 5 hours agorootparentEasiest way to meet someone is for them to be a friend of a friend. I rarely date someone outside my extended circle even if I was trying to. We inevitably happen to know someone in common. That said, bars are a great way to expand that circle. Dating is just one aspect of socializing.

What does that mean? reply ethbr1 4 hours agorootparentThat a lot of people go to bars to hang out with their friends, or especially hang out with their friends + meet some new friends of friends. And it's kind of weird to just go to a bar, alone, and try and find other lonely people to fuck for a single night. But hey, that's what some people are looking for. reply nox101 3 hours agorootparentyou gotta love this idea that you're a creep if you're alone. Only show up if you already have friends. So if you have no friends there's no way to get any because you're a creep if you're alone we need a new woke meme to shame people who shit on people who don't have friends reply NeoTar 59 minutes agorootparentThere’s a difference between going to a bar alone, and going alone with the sole intention to find a one-night-stand. It’s the latter people find creepy. reply 2-3-7-43-1807 4 hours agorootparentprevI'd argue this isn't weird but anthropologically speaking the norm. This being considered \"weird\" in and off itself is more like a very recent social development. reply andrepd 7 hours agoparentprevLack of third spaces mean people flock to those apps, especially when they're no longer in school or college. Clearly, those are poor replacements. reply anal_reactor 6 hours agoparentprevI spent years attending various language courses where I literally sat and talked to people, but I never became friends with any of them. If anything, it usually felt like stepping into a world of individuals hand-picked to have nothing in common with me, except for the fact that they were trying to learn a language too. reply zeroCalories 5 hours agorootparentI have that feeling at work. I've spent years talking to people daily but never gotten to know them. But for stuff like hobbies I've never had trouble filling the time talking about the hobby. You don't find it interesting to talk about why you're both learning the language, or what books/media in that language you enjoy? reply robjan 5 hours agorootparentprevLanguage courses generally have a clear end date so it's not surprising that many people wouldn't be super invested in making or maintaining new relationships in them. reply wslh 7 hours agoparentprev> Hookup culture just isn't for everyone, and the notion that it is has been the cause of a lot of grief and agony. I agree, and that's why I find it important to study and understand the social dynamics of hookup culture through research [1]. [1] What is Hooking Up?

Common interests are WAAAY overrated. It's barely even a starting point... asymmetry is there it's at, why \"partner\" with yourself, when you can partner with your literal compliment, someone who has what you lack.... to make not just a bigger half, but an actual whole?! reply Almondsetat 5 hours agorootparentIt's not about common interests, it's literally just about showing up and being exposed to the same people for a prolonged amount of time. The activity is just an excuse. reply eska 6 hours agorootparentprevSure, but there must be at least some common ground. Otherwise how are you going to spend time together? reply nogbit 5 hours agorootparentThe point that is being made is that you do new things you haven’t done before. Explore! For example, If you are a gym rat in the morning you can still do that yourself without the other person and then later in the day do the new things you never done before. The other person benefits as well. You don’t always have to be glued to the hip of the other. reply Sebb767 5 hours agorootparentSo you argue that you should both enjoy exploring new things together in common. No one is arguing that you should spend every minute with your partner, but if you want to spend time together, you should have an activity that you both enjoy (which might be exploring new things!), otherwise the relationship will be hard. reply dxbydt 2 hours agorootparenton the contrary, most relationships got started only because both partners enjoy exploring each other’s bodies. any other activities they might have in common is some afterthought that is tacked on after the relationship acquired a stable footing. i still don’t have any activity in common with my wife, and we’ve spent 2 decades & change… reply treflop 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's not about common interests, it's about having a third place (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place). A lot of interests need a common space. reply sim7c00 5 hours agorootparentprevfully agree with dagelf here. me andmy wife share nothing in common but the fact we enjoy eachothers presence. imho its really important to have your own thing. if it all revolves around some external commonality, its bound to fail once that thing is gone for either. reply notjoemama 5 hours agoparentprevCool. So online activists can become more engaged irl? Sounds great unless the activism is the kind you disagree with. Imagine this brining together a collection of white supremacists or antifa. Or pro-life versus pro-choice. This is the problem with the tech world. They are so preoccupied with whether they can, they don’t stop to think if they should. Yes, that's from Jurassic Park. reply SR2Z 5 hours agorootparentLook, even if it's white supremacists, it's still good for their mental health to meet up irl. reply ToucanLoucan 5 hours agorootparentUmmmmmmm gonna need some kinda citation there. Radicalized groups that meet increase one another’s radicalization as they bounce off of one another and egg each other on. I want people to get together more, it’s absolutely good for them, but I think there’s certain groups that should absolutely be discouraged. Like sorry if the only thing that gets you going is fantasizing about obliterating ethnic groups but you might have to take one for the team and stay depressed. Or take up something better like model railroading. reply FredPret 4 hours agorootparentIRL interactions are more complex and nuanced in a way that tends to push people to the center. There have been instances where people meeting IRL pushed one another further to one side (Marxists, Nazis) but in every other case IRL interactions help people have a more rounded view of the world. In a social media world, you only get to see one facet of an opinion at a time, and it's always the simplest and most inflammatory view that makes the rounds. reply twixfel 4 hours agorootparentprevso how do you encourage everyone except white suprematists to get out more? What does that raising awareness campaign look like? Tbh getting out more is probably more necessary for such people than anyone else. reply ToucanLoucan 1 hour agorootparent> so how do you encourage everyone except white suprematists to get out more? Shut down and disperse groups of white supremacists. Amend the right to free assembly to exclude hate groups, because we don't need to tolerate that if we don't want to. And before you say \"well who decides what's a ha-\" there is a well articulated subjective process for determining that already, and most of the groups that meet the definition are indeed supremacist/nationalist groups of any sort. It is not perfect, because no human made system is, but I fail to understand why that then means we must tolerate all of these with zero effort put to police them. We know what's a hate group, just like we know what's a hate crime. The fact that idiots in the media and on the internet misuse or over-generalize the term doesn't change anything. > Tbh getting out more is probably more necessary for such people than anyone else. I would agree, just not for hateful reasons. Come up with something else. reply __turbobrew__ 1 hour agorootparent> Amend the right to free assembly to exclude… Im glad you are not in charge reply Der_Einzige 4 hours agorootparentprevUhh, one of them bashes the skull of the other in when they meet up. Blunt force trauma is not good for mental health. reply ramon156 59 minutes agorootparentYeah and it's also not part of socializing. This is a nothing burger reply peppermint_gum 5 hours agorootparentprevSo we shouldn't make it easier for people to meet each other, because some of those people might be white supremacists? I'm sorry, but I think you may be spending too much time online. reply marginalia_nu 5 hours agorootparentprevYeah that's actually largely a good thing. A big problem is the political echo chamber these people live in online. In neutral activities that are not strongly politically coded, they'll meet people from outside that echo chamber, and will inevitably face contradictions to their world view. reply tiznow 4 hours agorootparentprevWhat's the problem exactly? reply IgorPartola 7 hours agoprevSharing a common interest is the best way to meet lots of new people. It creates low stakes interaction opportunities and removes the creep factor (if you are at a meetup for fans of model trains along with like a dozen other people, it’s not weird that you are talking to some of them). Better than any app, go get a hobby in person and get out there to meet people who are into it. Chances are you present yourself way better in the real world vs online. Online dating, especially the Tinder variety, really skews to work for some demographics and not others (I am not talking about gender here so much as age, location, etc.). reply Trasmatta 7 hours agoparentThis is the common advice, but it's also resulted in many of these hobby based events being overrun by people who are primarily there looking to find a date. It can be a weird dynamic. My suggestion is get a hobby that you explicitly are interested in, but don't go in with an expectation that you'll find someone, or make that your primary goal. > Chances are you present yourself way better in the real world vs online For many of us I don't think this is true reply katamarimambo 7 hours agorootparentAnd even for those with better intentions, the low stakes interaction will become high stakes as attraction and expectations increase. When rejection almost inevitably happens at some point, bringing feelings of innability and jealousy, it will be tougher to deal, specially for the less experienced following this path. In this sense hookup culture can relieve such pressure and allows for decoupling the sexual needs, and romantic ones even - personal note: I think it's weird how people online talk as if it's mandatory to mistreat/abandon the people you hook up with. I build a small but nice network of \"friends with benefits\" which for me are simply friends who enjoy a specific activity. Like, exactly the inverse of what everyone is recomending and it worked for me. reply Der_Einzige 4 hours agorootparentLet’s be honest, the kinds of people who are usually looking for this advice are actual incels who are seething with rage about the fact that they haven’t, and can”t hook up and have wild casual sex. reply cardanome 2 hours agorootparentprevFor me a hobby group is for doing that hobby. I want to focus on that and not on building potential romantic relationships. If it is something I am really passionate about I am basically in asexual mode and don't even \"see them that way\". I am sure many people's brain are wired differently and things \"just happen\" for them but I need to be more explicit to make anything happen. It also feels boundary crossing, especially with activities where there is physical contact. And even if you take a rejection well, I imagine it doesn't feel great for the other side to get unwanted romantic attraction. It has so much potential to create unnecessary drama. I wish there were places you could just got to find romantic partners. Not like speed dating but where you can casually hang out. Sure bars and clubs do work for a certain crowd but are not that great if you are not into the \"party scene\" and lots of people there don't really want to meet other people but just party with friends. reply bradlys 5 hours agorootparentprev> My suggestion is get a hobby that you explicitly are interested in, but don't go in with an expectation that you'll find someone, or make that your primary goal. The issue here is that you need to have hobbies that are explicitly good for finding partners. For instance, I love riding motorcycles. I am happy to do group oriented aspects of the hobby like track days or group rides, etc. The amount of women in that activity is near zero. The same is true for cars. It's almost entirely men. Even if you say there's 10% women showing up - that's still a horrific 9:1 ratio. I find it super annoying because my hobbies are so masculine and male dominated. I have to actually go out and do things that I'm not really that passionate about or interested in as a way to meet women - and then I have to be really good at said hobbies. Fortunately, I am someone who is able and willing to suffer through things that I don't enjoy for a goal but it is going to contradict all the most popular advice out there of \"do what you love and love will follow\". It's just simply not true. All the women I've met were through activities or hobbies that I had no real interest in doing. I was simply doing them to improve my odds in regards to dating women. Who cares if you're interested. Just do the fucking work. reply __turbobrew__ 42 minutes agorootparentWhat I find interesting is that it seems like the vast majority of hobbies are male dominated, maybe this is not true and a bias of my world view. All sports are male dominated to the point where female only activities are sanctioned, anything around collecting, games (board games and video games), cars/motorsports, woodworking, metalworking. The only hobbies I know of that are female dominated is Yoga and crafts. All the others are more evenly spilt between the genders (like book clubs, dancing, cooking, gardening). If you are looking to find a romantic partner the majority of people who are into crafts are married. I don’t know if there is any evidence to support or refute my claims, but that is how I see things. I do agree with you that if you want to find a romantic partner of the other sex you should optimize your activities. Unless you are gay or a woman you will never meet a romantic partner at the local car meetup or magic the gathering tournament. reply werid 5 hours agorootparentprevcurious how that works out. you start dating, stop doing the hobby you're not really interested in, but she continues, and finds out you were only in it to find a date? reply bradlys 5 hours agorootparentSuper common. Seen this happen a lot with some hobbies that I've pursued. The men will show back up when/if said relationship dies (after all - it worked the first time). A lot of women do this too. They might've had a genuine interest but it wasn't sufficient to keep them going. For some of the hobbies I have, you'll find that there's very few single women but a massive amount of single men. reply michaelt 7 hours agorootparentprev> For many of us I don't think this is true Probably depends on the details of the online communication. A video call, a synchronous one on one text chat, an asynchronous one on one text chat, and a public broadcast like HN or Twitter all create very different experiences. HN’s format makes it easy to show aloof, professional detachment and conceals my age and looks. For dating, though? That ain’t an advantage. reply Trasmatta 6 hours agorootparentAll very different experiences, and the quality of the communication depend on the people in question. Some people are great communicators over text but really struggle with in person communication. And vice versa. reply nemo44x 5 hours agoparentprevThis is why clubs exist and have for centuries. Country clubs, rotary club, computer club, Masonic, etc. There’s a ton of them but you don’t see younger people joining them as much today. reply falcolas 2 hours agorootparent> There’s a ton of them but you don’t see younger people joining them as much today. That's because they're primarily filled with old people, with \"old\" interests. Short of a coordinated visit, you'll always be in the minority. Heck, I'm in the minority, and I'm in my 40's the few times I accept an invitation to go to one of these places. There's also the occasional left-over haughtiness about the value of being let into the club. Left over from when they were exceptionally popular. This can push people away too. reply fcatalan 20 minutes agoprevSmall Twitch communities do it for me. I'm quite of an introvert. And all my long term friendships have faded or my friends have moved cities or countries. But around lockdown I took up miniature painting and started watching a bunch of 50 to 100 viewer channels about the hobby. With those numbers the streamer knows you by name by the second time you show up and you soon bond with others in chat. This got me in contact with the small local hobby club, but also by the time I could attend an in person nationwide convention my family was astounded: dozens of people they knew nothing about were greeting me, stopping for hugs and chats, giving me stuff from their stands... I've seen both romantic and business relationships emerge in that environment. reply KineticLensman 8 hours agoprev> “The thing about Letterboxd is there isn’t a ‘central town square’ like there is on X; it’s a very single-channel conversation,” says Gracewood. Comments happen in-line – similar to those on the Guardian and Observer websites – meaning that it’s less possible to performatively repost content into a main feed in order to encourage a pile-on. Similar situations exist on platforms such as Goodreads and Strava, where it’s possible to communicate with and message others, but not to publicly shame them easily. > Because hobby apps are nicer places to exist, people spend more time on them – and they can eventually turn into services that are more than advertised.

This is what I'd suspect. I'm a lesbian and hang out pretty equally in very male dominated and very female dominated places online. I find it really interesting that most hobby/fandom spaces online do unofficially segregate by gender to the point where it's common in both to just assume everybody there is male/female (and straight, of course, because this all kind of relies on straight gender roles). > Discord isn't a single integrated community; there are plenty of servers that aren't sausage fests, maybe you just haven't been interested in, or invited to, them? Yeah, I'm in several female dominated servers and have been in the past. I will say that more of the female dominated servers are private/not advertised, specifically to keep them from being overrun and keeping them a manageable size. In general, the women care more about curating the social space for ease of connection and are more conscientious when it comes to things like considering how big a server can be before it's a pain to mod, what the impacts of creating another channel would be, what the impacts would be of creating restricted channels would be, etc. Guys wing it more. reply Trasmatta 7 hours agoparentprevIt has to have happened at least a few times, right? reply np_tedious 7 hours agorootparentI have a crush on dang but it hasn't gone anywhere yet reply throwup238 4 hours agorootparentI get a new throwaway banned every week in the hopes that he notices me. reply KineticLensman 7 hours agorootparentprevFor certain values of 'love', perhaps... reply EarlKing 7 hours agorootparentOnly if love is denominated in dollars and amounts to a seed round, anyway... reply haunter 5 hours agoparentprev>The thing about Letterboxd is there isn’t a ‘central town square’ like there is on X; it’s a very single-channel conversation,” The problem with Letterboxd that it's gamified and there is an incredible amount of noise and it's getting worse.

I guess my one complaint would be that no one is writing reviews and so they should stop calling it reviews when they’re really tweets about movies, but I think if Letterboxd were actually 100% in-depth reviews I’d log off immediately.

It tries to make you 'competitive' so hard. Granted, as a professional loser I'd like to find someone that likes cycling too, though cycling alone is great too - still, I'd rather find that person in one of those rides than in some weird thing like Strava fly-by's or something. reply tchock23 6 hours agoparentDon't ever sign up for Zwift then. Zwift makes Strava look like an app made for introverts. On Zwift your followers can be automatically notified when you start a ride, and you have zero control over them receiving that notification. It's creepy how much they push the social aspect. reply actionablefiber 8 hours agoparentprev> It tries to make you 'competitive' so hard. I've found that it's really what you make of it. My city has a bunch of cycling subcultures - social slow rolls, fast road riding, sightseeing and exploration, commuting and errand-running - and different people like to see and talk about different types of rides and sometimes dabble in different subcultures, but generally people care way more about seeing the rides, and whatever fun banter or background context you add when you post it, than analyzing your speed and elevation. I really love the social aspect of Strava because I'm friends with all the other people I follow on it. In some way I think it is more intimate than traditional social media. You could get a better picture of my life and how I spend my time from seeing my physical displacements during the day than by seeing the super filtered Instagram stuff that I only choose to share when I'm having a good time and doing something interesting. reply ktosobcy 8 hours agoparentprevThis so much... most of the time I use those online services to track my own progress (reading books, rides taken, etc) and it always results in WTF when someone leaves a like on my activity… Would love for a global setting \"disable all social aspects\"... reply cuu508 7 hours agorootparentStrava has \"Privacy Controls\" section in settings. There isn't a single global off switch, but it's not too hard to set everything to private either. reply jamil7 8 hours agoparentprevYeah, I used to use Strava to track rides when I was cycling a lot and at some point realised it just made feel bad about my own performance. I run a lot more than I ride now and only take my keys with me. I check the time before I leave and know roughly how far and log it in my calendar. Running without any tech or music/podcasts/audiobooks has also helped me focus on technique and breathing and gives me a proper break from everything. reply alx_the_new_guy 7 hours agorootparentGarmin Connect is actually fairly decent. Tracks activities (also sleep, which I find pretty useful), fairly detailed stats, little to none social features and a little gamification with challenges and achievements. Also the watch reminds you to move from time to time. Komoot is great for planning of \"trips\" and \"stealing\" other people's routes. I've done couple of them and you kind of never know what you're gonna see there (hopefully not agressive dogs), all of them were pretty enjoyable. It has a bit of a social aspect, but barely anyone uses it where I live, so IDK how it is. One thing I miss from Strava are segments (or whatever they're called) - short parts of your route with it's own leader-board. Has \"speedrun, but IRL\" vibes, which is pretty cool IMO. reply theChaparral 4 hours agorootparentGarmin connect also has segment feature.

My friends can see where I have been riding, but I'm not competing with the broader community. reply mattrighetti 7 hours agoprevWe will see how long this lasts. We try to search for meaningful relationships, which socials stole from us apparently, by switching to different socials, pretending they're going to do better than the previous ones. Wouldn't ditching socials altogether get us in a better place on this matter? It is utopia at this point I guess. Some socials could actually be useful to make new friends/relationships but it seems to me that the very people that constantly complain about the \"anti-social\" aspect that our lives have taken are the ones that go on and try 1000 different dating apps, give up on friends after a couple of months to try and find new \"better\" ones. reply isaacdaoust 1 hour agoprevNotably absent hobby in the article is music.

It’s a great way to maintain connections, and a wonderful source of encouragement. Typical social network dopamine hits probably aren’t great for your health, but when it’s paired with 100 miles of exercise, I think it has a net positive. I’ll definitely admit to pushing myself further than I typically would for those Strava kudos. That said, I don’t think something like Strava is particularly useful without the in person aspect to go along with it. Heck I don’t even know how you’d gain followers without doing group rides. reply tchock23 6 hours agoparentI find Strava is also helpful for solo activities that aren't in-person. Knowing that an IRL friend/follower will see my activity pushes me to work harder. reply xiaoxiong 5 hours agorootparentYeah definitely, gives you something to talk about at the next group ride too haha. reply TomMasz 30 minutes agoprevStrava got me to join a few clubs (I'm not in any IRL club) but the messaging I just ignore.

Something is missing. It sure would require mass appeal to be useful, but a ‘Tinder for your hobbies’ might be nice. Get matches from people near you who enjoy a cross-section of the same stuff.

Apparently it was and is used by married people who seek affairs or in another words people who want to cheat on their partner. If you can build community and business around that then you can build community and business around anything.

In both cases, it wasn't even close.

The issue is that a long term relationship (and sex) is often considered creepy to pursue in venues not designated for that. reply marginalia_nu 7 hours agorootparentThe solution is to not pursue sex or relationships, but to simply have enough of a social life that it happens anyway. That completely gets rid of the leisure suit larry energy that going out hunting for a partner inevitably gives you. reply Qem 3 hours agorootparent> The solution is to not pursue sex or relationships, but to simply have enough of a social life that it happens anyway. One thing I find odd about having problems finding partners/establishing relationships, it's that for every other psychological problem, say, addictions, depression, et cetera, one thing people always says to be of utmost importance is to acknowledge the problem itself. To not pretend it's nothing, or that it's something else. With relationship-making there's a complete reversal on that. Default advice it's to forget it and delude yourself pretending you're trying just to do some hobbies. reply marginalia_nu 3 hours agorootparentIt's very similar to how the best way to become unhappy is to try to be happy. Happiness is a side-effect of living a well balanced life. The harder you try to be happy, the more you displace the things that make you happy. It only comes when you aren't chasing it, but doing the things you find interesting and rewarding instead. Lengthy romantic relationship dry spells aren't \"the problem\", but rather typically a symptom of other issues, and often issues that are exacerbated by putting sex and relationships on a pedestal. The best thing you can do in order to find a romantic relationship is to just be a well functioning person that has their shit together. Have friends, have interests, get out of the apartment, do stuff with your life.

While practically both realms naturally border on each other an intersect it is important to set an initial semi-offical mode of expectations. Networks like Couchsurfing died because mostly men started to use it as an app for hooking up. And that just kills the vibe and also undermines the trust. Anybody here from Germany who would share practical experiences with such apps? I'm quite apprehensive of the idea that this is now how you meet people.

If there's any amount of this happening - it's hellishly small or limited to people who don't go out at all. If you didn't meet the love of your life in college, dating apps still seem to be the reigning king of the well educated white collar professional (HN audience). I think I've only met one couple that met at a club/bar - almost all others met through a shared hobby (where they met face to face originally) or at a party with mutual friends.

    "originBody": "Serving AI From The Basement Posted on Sep 6, 2024 AI from The Basement: My latest side project, a dedicated LLM server powered by 8x RTX 3090 Graphic Cards, boasting a total of 192GB of VRAM. I built this with running Meta’s Llamma-3.1 405B in mind. This blogpost was originally posted on my LinkedIn profile in July 2024. Backstory: Sometime in March I found myself struggling to keep up with the mere 48GB of VRAM I had been relying on for almost a year in my LLMs experimentations. So, in a geeky-yet-stylish way, I decided to spend my money to build this thing of beauty. Questions swirled: Which CPU/Platform to buy? Does memory speed really matter? And why the more PCIe Lanes we have the better? Why 2^n number of GPUs matter in multi-GPU node setup (Tensor Parallelism, anyone?) How many GPUs, and how can I get all the VRAM in the world? Why are Nvidia cards so expensive and why didn’t I invest in their stock earlier? What inference engine to use (hint: it’s not just llama.cpp and not always the most well-documented option)? After so many hours of research, I decided on the following platform: Asrock Rack ROMED8-2T motherboard with 7x PCIe 4.0x16 slots and 128 lanes of PCIe AMD Epyc Milan 7713 CPU (2.00 GHz/3.675GHz Boosted, 64 Cores/128 Threads) 512GB DDR4-3200 3DS RDIMM memory A mere trio of 1600-watt power supply units to keep everything running smoothly 8x RTX 3090 GPUs with 4x NVLinks, enabling a blistering 112GB/s data transfer rate between each pair Now that I kinda have everything in order, I’m working on a series of blog posts that will cover the entire journey, from building this behemoth to avoiding costly pitfalls. Topics will include: The challenges of assembling this system: from drilling holes in metal frames and adding 30amp 240volt breakers, to bending CPU socket pins (don’t try this at home, kids!). Why PCIe Risers suck and the importance of using SAS Device Adapters, Redrivers, and Retimers for error-free PCIe connections. NVLink speeds, PCIe lanes bandwidth and VRAM transfer speeds, and Nvidia’s decision to block P2P native PCIe bandwidth on the software level. Benchmarking inference engines like TensorRT-LLM, vLLM, and Aphrodite Engine, all of which support Tensor Parallelism. Training and fine-tuning your own LLM. Stay tuned. P.S. I’m sitting here staring at those GPUs, and I just can’t help but think how wild tech progress has been. I remember being so excited to get a 60GB HDD back in 2004. I mean, all the movies and games I could store?! Fast forward 20 years, and now I’ve got more than triple that storage capacity in just one machine’s graphic cards… It makes me think, what will we be doing in another 20 years?! Anyway, that’s why I’m doing this project. I wanna help create some of the cool stuff that’ll be around in the future. And who knows, maybe someone will look back on my work and be like “haha, remember when we thought 192GB of VRAM was a lot?”",

This setup took me some time to plan and put together, and then some more time to explore the software part of things and the possibilities that came with it. Part of the main reason I built this was data privacy, I do not want to hand over my private data to any company to further train their closed weight models; and given the recent drop in output quality on different platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, etc), I don't regret spending the money on this setup. I was also able to do a lot of cool things using this server by leveraging tensor parallelism and batch inference, generating synthetic data, and experimenting with finetuning models using my private data. I am currently building a model from scratch, mainly as a learning project, but I am also finding some cool things while doing so and if I can get around ironing out the kinks, I might release it and write a tutorial from my notes. So I finally had the time this weekend to get my blog up and running, and I am planning on following up this blog post with a series of posts on my learnings and findings. I am also open to topics and ideas to experiment with on this server and write about, so feel free to shoot your shot if you have ideas you want to experiment with and don't have the hardware, I am more than willing to do that on your behalf and sharing the findings Please let me know if you have any questions, my PMs are open, and you can also reach me on any of the socials I have posted on my website. reply mattnewton 1 hour agoparentThe main thing stopping me from going beyond 2x 4090’s in my home lab is power.

Far easier to figure out than executing \"hello world\" without domain expertise. reply gizmo686 10 minutes agorootparentA good engineer knows the difference between safe and dangerous. Setting up an AI computer is safe. Maybe you trip a circut. Maybe you interfere with something else running on your hobby computer. But nothing bad can really happen. Residential electrical is dangerous. Maybe you electrocute yourself. Maybe you cause a fire 5 years down the line. Maybe you cause a fire for the next owner because you didn't know to protect the wire with a metal plate so they drill into it. Having said that, 2 4090s will run you aroud $5,000, not counting any of the surrounding system. At that cost point, hireing an electritian would not be that big of an expense relativly speaking. Also, if you are at the point where you need to add a circut for power, you might need to seriously consider cooling, which could potentially be another side quest. reply 3eb7988a1663 32 minutes agorootparentprevPeople can and do die from misuses of electricity. Not a move-fast-and-break things kind of domain. reply varispeed 26 minutes agorootparentYou only \"break\" once... reply throwthrowuknow 47 minutes agorootparentprevNot speaking from direct experience building a rig like this but the blog post mentions having 3 power supplies so the most direct solution would be to put each on their own dedicated circuit. As long as you have space in your electrical box this is straightforward to do though I would recommend having an electrician do the wiring if you aren’t experienced with that type of home electrical work. reply gizmo686 6 minutes agorootparentEven without space in the existing box, installing a subpanel isn't that much more of a cost. reply bluedino 43 minutes agorootparentprevTake your typical 'GPU node', which would be a Dell/HP/SuperMicro with 4-8 NVIDIA H100's and a single top high level AMD/Intel CPU. You would need 2-4 240v outlets (30A). In the real world you would plug them into a PDU such as: https://www.apc.com/us/en/product/AP9571A/rack-pdu-basic-1u-... Each GPU will take around 700W and then you have the rest of the system to power, so depending on CPU/RAM/storage... And then you need to cool it! reply abound 56 minutes agorootparentprevNot OP, but my current home had a dedicated 50A/240V circuit because the previous owner did glass work and had a massive electric kiln. I can't imagine it was cheap to install, but I've used it for beefy, energy hungry servers in the past. Which is all to say its possible in a residential setting, just probably expensive. reply woleium 33 minutes agorootparentYes, or something like a residential aircon heatpump will need a 40a circuit too. Car charging usually has a 30a. Electric oven is usually 40a. There’s lots of stuff that uses that sort of power residentially reply littlestymaar 47 minutes agorootparentprevThen juste add a 32A circuit breaker to your electrical installation, it's not a big deal really. reply pupdogg 28 minutes agoparentprevAmazing setup. I have the capability to design, fabricate, and powder coat sheet metal. I would love to collaborate on designing and fabricating a cool enclosure for this setup. Let me know if you're interested. reply nullindividual 2 hours agoparentprevDo you run this 24/7? What is your cost of electricity per kilowatt hour and what is the cost of this setup per month? reply michaelt 1 hour agorootparentI have a much smaller setup than the author - a quarter the GPUs and RAM - and I was surprised to find it draws 300W at idle reply nullindividual 1 hour agorootparentThe reason I asked is I used to run a dual X5650 server with SSDs and it was about $50/month with the cheapest (or very close to) rates in the US. reply TaylorAlexander 2 hours agoparentprevThanks for sharing! I’m curious, did you consider using a Mac Studio with 192GB of shared ram? At $5600, that seems quite a bit cheaper than your setup! Does anyone know how such a setup would compare? reply sva_ 2 hours agorootparentA single 3090 will deliver more tflops than the m2 ultra. reply mysteria 1 hour agorootparentThe 3090s also give you access to all those CUDA inference and training frameworks used in industry. With Apple you're pretty much stuck with either MLX or llama.cpp. Honestly though I'd be curious to see a cost analysis of Apple vs. Nvidia for commercial batched inference. The Nvidia system can obviously spit out more tokens/s but for the same price you could have multiple Mac Studios running the same model (and users would be dispatched to one of them). reply evilduck 1 hour agorootparentprevThe M2 Ultra doesn't require doing electrical work on your house like this 8x 3090 setup did though. reply fallingsquirrel 48 minutes agorootparent1x 3090 would be faster than the mac, cheaper than the mac, and run on a normal residential circuit. How many breakers would you need for a cluster of 20 macs running at full throttle to match the perf of OP's build? reply paulmd 28 minutes agorootparentA single 3090 won’t even fit the model. OP is talking about running a 405B model, it needs close to 200gb of memory just to open it which is why we’re talking about mac studio and it’s 192gb unified memory. This is exactly like when the AMD fanboys got a burr up their ass about the “$50k Mac Pro” with 2tb of memory… when you could the same thing with a threadripper with 256gb of memory for $5k, and it’s just as fast in Cinebench! https://old.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/f1a0qp/15000_mac_pro_v... your gaming scores on your 3090 with 24gb are just as irrelevant to this 200gb workload as the threadripper is to those Mac Pro workloads lol reply NavinF 1 hour agorootparentprevYou could power limit the 3090s to fit a standard 120V*20A = 2400W outlet if you really want to. The default power limit is 350W each so you'll only lose a little perf. Also most rooms have multiple circuits. Just connect half the GPUs to each outlet. I already do this with my desktop PC because it has 2 PSUs. Also most homes in the US have 30A*240V = 7200W dryer/stove outlets in the kitchen, laundry room, garage, etc. That's where you want to keep loud computers. reply Dylan16807 19 minutes agorootparentA standard outlet is 15A, and you're only allowed to use 80% continuously. So now you're dropping to 150W each. Using two circuits is viable. reply jrflowers 1 hour agorootparentprevBrb replacing my stove with a bunch of GPUs reply qingcharles 22 minutes agorootparentYou can cook on the GPUs from now on. reply philsnow 1 hour agorootparentprevEasy-bake cryptominer reply lvncelot 1 hour agorootparentprevInference Oven reply korhojoa 53 minutes agorootparentprevLocation specific issue. Higher voltage resolves this and a regular household socket will power this just fine. Then again, if you're spending that much money to get the job done, new wiring is probably one of the cheaper parts of the build. reply angoragoats 1 hour agorootparentprevYou can run 8 or even more 3090s without doing electrical work on a standard US residential power feed, you just need outlets connected to multiple circuits. This is not always convenient, which is why some may choose to do electrical work, but it’s absolutely not required. reply ein0p 1 hour agorootparentprevYes, for 20x the FLOPS at about twice the price you might need to do some work. reply santoshalper 1 hour agorootparentprevSure, neither does just using ChatGPT, but we don't do things because they are easy, we do them because they are difficult. reply bongodongobob 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah cause it's doing like 50x less work. reply angoragoats 1 hour agorootparentprevYep. The 8x3090 setup should be at least 10 times faster than the Mac. reply wkat4242 1 hour agorootparentYes though for inference memory bandwidth is more important than tflops. Not sure how Apple compares in that regard. The OP does train models too though which is more compute heavy. reply angoragoats 1 hour agorootparentEach of the 3090s has something like 15% higher memory bandwidth than the whole M2 Ultra system does. reply bongodongobob 1 hour agorootparentprevHe's got 8x3090s are you fucking kidding? Like is this some kind of AI reply? \"Wow great post! I enjoy your valuable contributions. Can you tell me more about graphics cards and how they compare to other different types of computers? I am interested and eager to learn! :)\" reply nexoft 6 minutes agorootparentkind of violent approach but I agree on the bottom line. I don't see why should somebody be enthousiast about this. someone was just able to spend 8× the figures a random teen is able to spend for his gaming rig, and he just iterated the teen's rig 8 times, he then installed ubuntu+cuda and called it a day. something that is actually interesting that is attempting to bring something on the table : check tinygrad/tinycorp reply emptiestplace 55 minutes agorootparentprevIt's one thing to be an asshole, but you're also hilariously clueless. reply bongodongobob 22 minutes agorootparentYeah, because an M2 is in the same ballpark as 8 GPUs. Yes, you can use CPU now but it's not even close to this setup. This is hackernews. I know we're supposed to be nice and this isn't reddit, but comments like parent are ridiculous and for sure don't add to the discussion any more than mine do. reply TaylorAlexander 1 hour agorootparentprevWhat? No I just don’t know the difference, sorry. I am interested in learning more about running 405b parameter models, which I believe you can do on a 192gb M series Mac. The answer here is that the Nvidia system has much better performance. I’ve been focused on “can I even run the model” I didn’t think about the actual performance of the system. reply bongodongobob 1 hour agorootparentYou're interested in the different between a single CPU and 8 GPUs?

Was special electrical needed? reply wkat4242 49 minutes agoprev> And who knows, maybe someone will look back on my work and be like “haha, remember when we thought 192GB of VRAM was a lot?” I wonder if this will happen. It's already really hard to buy big HDDs for my NAS because nobody buys external drives anymore. So the pricing has gone up a lot for the prosumer. I expect something similar to happen to AI. The big cloud parties are all big leaders on LLMs and their goal is to keep us beholden to their cloud service. Cheap home hardware work serious capability is not something they're interested in. They want to keep it out of our reach so we can pay them rent and they can mine our data. reply gizmo686 24 minutes agoparentThe cloud companies do not make the hardware, they buy it like the rest of us. They are just going to be almost the entirety of the market, so naturally the products will built and priced with that market in mind. reply wkat4242 19 minutes agorootparentYes and they get deep discounts which we don't. Can be 40% or more! Of course the vendor can't make a profit with such discounts so they inflate the RRP. But we do end up paying that. reply thelastparadise 30 minutes agoparentprev> It's already really hard to buy big HDDs for my NAS IME 20tb drives are easy to find. I don't think the clouds have access to bigger drives or anything. Similarly, we can buy 8x A100s, they're just fundamentally expensive whether you're a business or not. There doesn't seem to be any \"wall\" up like there used to be with proprietary hardware. reply wkat4242 23 minutes agorootparentThey are easy to find but extremely expensive. I used to pay below 200€ for a 14TB Seagate 8 years ago. That's now above 300. And the bigger ones are even more expensive. For me these prices are prohibitive. Just like the A100s are (though those are even more so of course). The problem is the common consumer relying on the cloud so these kind of products become niches and lose volume. Also, the cloud providers don't pay what we do for a GPU or HDD. They buy them by the ten thousands and get deep discounts. That's why the RRPs which we do pay are highly inflated. reply Eisenstein 20 minutes agoparentprevIt isn't that cloud providers want to shut us out, it is that nVidia wants to relegate AI capable cards to the high end enterprise tier. So far in 2024 they have made $10.44b in revenue from the gaming market, and over $47.5b in the datacenter market, and I would bet that there is much less profit in gaming. In order to keep the market segmented they stopped putting nvlink on gaming cards and have capped VRAM at 24GB for the highest end GPUs (3090 and 4090) and it doesn't look much better for the upcoming 5090. I don't blame them, they are a profit-maximizing corporation after all, but if anything is to be done about making large AI models practical for hobbyists, start with nVidia. That said, I really don't think that the way forward for hobbyists is maxing VRAM. Small models are becoming much more capable and accelerators are a possibility, and there may not be a need for a person to run a 70billion parameter model in memory at all when there are MoEs like Mixtral and small capable models like phi. reply choilive 6 minutes agoprevI have a similar setup in my basement! Although its multiple nodes, with a total of 16x3090s. Also needed to install a 30A 240V circuit as well. reply freeqaz 2 hours agoprevHow much do the NVLinks help in this case? Do you have a rough estimate of how much this cost? I'm curious since I just built my own 2x 3090 rig and I wondered about going EPYC for the potential to have more cards (stuck with AM5 for cheapness though). All in all I spent about $3500 for everything. I'm guessing this is closer to $12-15k? CPU is around $800 on eBay. reply lvl155 1 hour agoparentMy reason for going Epyc was for Pcie lanes and cheaper enterprise SSDs via U.3/2. With AM5, you tap out the lanes with dual GPUs. Threadripper is preferable but Epyc is about 1/2 of the price or even better if you go last gen. reply Eisenstein 17 minutes agorootparentWhy do you need such high cross card bandwidth for inference? Are you hosting for a lot of users at once? reply modeless 1 hour agoprevI wonder how the cost compares to a Tinybox. $25k for 6x 4090 or $15k for 6x 7900XTX. Of course that's the full package with power supplies, CPU, storage, cooling, assembly, shipping, etc. And a tested, known good hardware/software configuration which is crucial with this kind of thing. reply walterbell 1 hour agoprevAn adjacent project for 8 GPUs could convert used 4K monitors into a borderless mini-wall of pixels, for local video composition with rendered and/or AI-generated backgrounds, https://theasc.com/articles/the-mandalorian > the heir to rear projection — a dynamic, real-time, photo-real background played back on a massive LED video wall and ceiling, which not only provided the pixel-accurate representation of exotic background content, but was also rendered with correct camera positional data.. “We take objects that the art department have created and we employ photogrammetry on each item to get them into the game engine” reply maaaaattttt 50 minutes agoprevLooking forward to reading this series.

The reason that GPUs are used for blockchains is to compute large numbers or proofs - which are truly useless but still verifiable so they can be distributed and rewarded.

One of the functions of the ATC, as the lead organization in managing and protecting the A.T., is to maintain the official 2,000-miler registry of all those who have completed the A.T. Therefore, having a photo taken here makes many hikers feel as though their hikes have gained official recognition. Thanks to a generous grant from the Quimby Family Foundation and the work of dedicated volunteers of the A.T. Museum under the leadership of Terry Harley Wilson, both scanned versions of the earlier Polaroid photos and the more recent digital photos can now be viewed on-line from anywhere in the world. When the A.T. Museum opened in Pennsylvania's Pine Grove Furnace State Park in 2010, digital versions of the photos became available there too. (read expanded text) History Between January and April 2009, 12,779 images representing over 18,000 Appalachian Trail hikers were carefully removed from old notebooks, barcoded, scanned at 600 dpi, and placed into archival quality sleeves and slip-covered albums. read more . . .

I am fifty years old. In 1989 my best friend, Geof Allen, and I spent an entire year planning to walk the AT after high school. During long nights in my parents basement we literally mapped out every step by figuring out how many steps were in a mile, and then multiplying. Life happened. He walked the entire AT from Spring Mtn to Mt Kahdin. I reluctantly followed my parents wishes and went off to college. Even in high school Geof was unlike anyone I ever knew. He did not have the best life, but he always smiled. When we were winter-camping together Geof knew how to make your frozen feet not-so-bad. When we were lost deep in a cave in Newport, Virginia, Geof showed no signs of worry, while I openly panicked. After walking the AT Geof joined the Navy, and when a slot opened up he became a Blue Angel...not a pilot, but still a prestigious position with a flight suit as a uniform. He married his high school sweetheart, and after the Navy, moved back home and became a police officer. I had totally lost contact with Geof, and was working in IT across the street from my local police department. As I was walking to my car one afternoon I saw Geof standing in the parking lot. We chatted and caught up a bit, and then lost contact again. The next time I heard Geof's name was years later. He had committed suicide. I almost want to say that he didn't have a choice. You see, he had watched all of the other males and one female in his fathers bloodline be taken away by Huntington's Disease. I found out later that Geof was in the early-stages, and it was easy to deduce that he needed to take action while he was still able. We were all from the same hometown. I knew his Uncles and his Aunt, and watched what Huntington's did to them, and I was there the day his father committed suicide. I found Geof's picture on athikerpictures.com. He is second from the left. Blue pants and white shirt. I am certain that he made life easier for the three hikers pictured with him. His trail name was Alpha. Alpha Geof Allen. reply ibizaman 5 hours agoparentWhat a moving story. I am younger than you but also had a friend die on me and now I wish I spent much more time with him.

I do however vividly recall the photo archive at Rusty's Hardtime Hollow just off the Blue Ridge Parkway section of the AT a few miles but was well worth the trip. Rusty had polaroids of hikers going way back, they lined the walls of every building, when he built new bunkhouses, he started new annual collections. There were thousands of them. Every night he would roll his truck down into the parking are blast James Brown and feed what he could to whatever he had or whatever hikers could bring. Wood fired hot tub, sauna, huge garden, it was a paradise after almost a 1000 miles on foot. I hope the ATC was also able to recover Rusty's photos, because he had a real gold mine. The few years after hiking when I lived in the area I would bring beverages and hot dogs for the hikers. I lost touch with Rusty after I went west. I was hiking recently in Maine and talking to another thruhiker who went through in the 2000 and she said the Hollow is gone now which would be a shame of his archive could not be recovered. reply michelpp 17 hours agoparentI found my pic, they spelled my trail name a bit differently: https://athikerpictures.org/hikers/2329 reply SaggyDoomSr 19 hours agoparentprevI thruhiked in 2001.

A search by year with a blank in the search box returns 17 pages of results (with very few trail names). 2009 and 2011 return 76 and 89 pages of results respectively. Master Chief's photo is a Katahdin photo (happy to see he finished!). There are a couple photos with a trailname of \"original\" and \"edited\" that are of the same hiker, but \"edited\" is cropped. And they're definitely missing pictures of a bunch of folks whose town names I know. I'm bummed, because I'd sure like to see pictures of some of the rest of the class of 2010. It also looks like they might've stopped recording (or transcribing from photos?) trail names for a while. I was SOBO in '03, and found a bunch of familiar faces by trail name.

    "title": "The muscular imagination of Iain M. Banks: a future you might want",
    "originLink": "https://www.robinsloan.com/moonbound/muscular-imagination/",
    "originBody": "Muscular imagination A future you might actually want to live in When I peer into the far reaches of science fictional imag­i­na­tion, way out beyond the easy extrap­o­la­tions and consensus futures, beyond the Blade Runners and the Star Treks, the name that looms largest is Iain M. Banks. For those unfa­miliar with his work in this genre, I’ll tell you a little bit about the Culture novels and recommend a reading approach. Then, for Banks beginners and devoted Culturephiles alike, I’ll explain why his future means so much to me. What is the Culture? A civilization. An agreement. The subject of a collec­tion of books, written across decades, which offer clues and suggestions, glances and reflections. A big part of the fun of reading those books is assem­bling your own mosaic. Here’s mine: The Culture is a spacefaring, free­wheeling admixture of anarchism and socialism. In most ways, it promises its citizens radical, breath­taking freedom … but in a few other ways, it requires their submission — to super­human systems of planning and manufacture, the Culture’s ineffable Minds. The Culture is a utopia: a future you might actually want to live in. It offers a coherent political vision. This isn’t subtle or allegorical; on the page, citizens of the Culture very frequently artic­u­late and defend their values. (Their enthu­siasm for their own politics is consid­ered annoying by most other civilizations.) Coherent political vision doesn’t require a lot, just some sense of this is what we ought to do, yet it is absent from plenty of science fiction that dwells only in the realm of the cautionary tale. I don’t have much patience left for that genre. I mean … we have been, at this point, amply cautioned. Vision, on the other hand: I can’t get enough. How to read the Culture The Culture novels aren’t connected by an over­ar­ching plot, and there is no canonical reading order. For all my appreciation: I have not even read all of them! If you search online, you’ll find plenty of proposed approaches. Here is mine, which is unorthodox; call it a recipe for enjoying the Culture. It proceeds in three stages: I very strongly believe new readers ought to start with Player of Games. It is a capti­vating novel in its own right, and its intro­duc­tion to the Culture is smooth, almost stealthy. It’s also the book I started with, and obviously It Worked for Me, so I can’t help but recommend the same on-ramp. For your second foray, you can choose basically at random. I like Matter and Surface Detail. I do not like Consider Phlebas. Here is the unorthodox part: I don’t think it’s necessary, or even desirable, to have read more than a couple of Culture novels before turning to A Few Notes on the Culture, the post from Iain M. Banks that just … lays it all out there. A Few Notes on the Culture is, for me, THE thrilling Culture document. It helps that it’s this odd sort of web samizdat — you are always reading a mirrored copy on some random website. The original was posted to a Usenet newsgroup in 1994! I should say, I don’t generally love “raw worldbuilding” of this kind — RPG source­book material. This document is a brilliant exception, because the ideas are so big, so fresh, and so confi­dently artic­u­lated; and of course because it’s Iain M. Banks behind them, his voice inimitable, wry and winning. Why not simply begin with A Few Notes on the Culture, if it’s so great? Well, it IS raw worldbuilding, and even the best exemplar of that genre benefits from narrative context. Read it on its own, and it’s a wonky thought experiment. Read it after a couple of novels, and it’s a backstage pass. You ought to meet a character or two — hear from a few of the rollicking Minds, learn their wonderful names — before you go behind the curtain. Why to read the Culture There are, in science fiction, several close peers to Iain M. Banks, at least in terms of the scale of their storytelling. I think in partic­ular of Olaf Stapledon, his Last and First Men, which gallops across millions of years; and of Cixin Liu, his series starting with The Three-Body Problem, which bumps up against the death of the universe. I like both of these authors, but/and their futures are cold and grim. You wouldn’t call either one utopia. So, I suppose it’s not just the scale of Iain M. Banks’s stories that I want to praise, but their warmth. His megas­truc­tures overflow with appealing char­ac­ters pursuing inter­esting projects. Their voices are ironic and funny. There’s no utopia without irony and humor; this fact really narrows the field. In my novel Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore, the ambitious and brilliant Kat Potente asks: “Have you ever played Maximum Happy Imagination?” “Sounds like a Japanese game show,” I replied. Kat straightens her shoulders. “Okay, we’re going to play. To start, imagine the future. The good future. No nuclear bombs. Pretend you’re a science fiction writer.” Okay: “World government … no cancer … hover-boards.” “Go further. What’s the good future after that?” “Spaceships. Party on Mars.” “Further.” “Star Trek. Transporters. You can go anywhere.” “Further.” I pause a moment, then realize: “I can’t.” Kat shakes her head. “It’s really hard. And that’s, what, a thousand years? What comes after that? What could possibly come after that? Imag­i­na­tion runs out. But it makes sense, right? We probably just imagine things based on what we already know, and we run out of analogies in the thirty-first century.” I’m trying hard to imagine an average day in the year 3012. I can’t even come up with a half-decent scene. Will people live in buildings? Will they wear clothes? My imag­i­na­tion is almost physically straining. Fingers of thought are raking the space behind the cushions, looking for loose ideas, finding nothing. I have often described imag­i­na­tion as a muscle — one that, like any other muscle, can be developed. Steady exposure to Star Trek gives you a minor workout, for sure; the bump of an imag­i­na­tive bicep. But there’s much further to go. You can read your way into some of it, and some of it, you have to dream up for yourself. Even among elite athletes, there must be titans: Schwarzeneg­gers striding across the stage. (I conjure body­builders because I like the idea of these imag­i­na­tive muscles BULGING.) Iain M. Banks, who died in 2013, way too young, was Mr. Universe. Here was a great writer, sure; but here was an imag­i­na­tion unmatched. He simply pushed further and thought bigger. For me, the Culture is the standard, so, for a long time, the challenge has been implicit: can you, Sloan, imagine on that scale? And not just technically, but humanely — with warmth and irony? I don’t get to Culture scale in Moonbound, but the plan — and there is a plan — is to ratchet up book by book, so my notional series can culminate in a feat that takes seriously the scale of the universe, as we now understand it. It’s easier to write the defeat than the victory, isn’t it? Easier to write the failure than the success. For some reason, the success seems like it might be … boring. Iain M. Banks shows us the Culture harnessing matter and energy on incred­ible scales. He tells us that citizens of the Culture live for hundreds of years; that death is generally a choice. In these books, the Culture basically always wins! At first glance, this seems fatal to plot. Endless energy, immortality … aren’t these the GOALS of the story? Are we just talking about heaven here? Heaven: which ought to be occluded, unknowable, unsayable. Heaven: because it’s boring. Turns out, no, it’s not boring at all. Plot gallops on, even at the outer limits of matter and energy. Even at the far reaches of freedom, the stories are only just beginning. In the writerly reticence to dramatize abundance, I detect humility — it requires serious imag­i­na­tive muscle, beyond what most folks are working with — and I detect also cowardice. What if my utopia isn’t good enough? What if I say, “this is gonna be so great”, and readers reply, “eh, doesn’t sound that great”? Easier to conjure some tyrant machines, some fast-spreading plagues. Everybody can agree on those. Plenty of readers might indeed read the Culture novels and say, “eh, doesn’t sound that great”. The point is, there is something here to inspect, and consider, and, sure, even reject. In these novels, Iain M. Banks hoists the imag­i­na­tive burden. He twirls it in the air. His muscles bulge. It’s amazing to behold. P.S. Culturephiles will note I’ve mentioned only obiquely the Culture’s greatest aesthetic bounty, the names of its ships. That’s because they are actually not funny or inter­esting until you step inside the magic circle of the books, and begin to intuit the rules of the game. Of course, after you’ve read one or two Culture novels, learning new names becomes a large and growing fraction of the fun! First published: March 2024 Last updated: June 2024",

Yesterday at my birthday dinner there were 3 others who are also fans of Banks, one of whom I turned onto the Culture just last year. We were having a great discussion of those books and lamenting the untimely passing of Banks from cancer. That friend gifted me The Player of Games and Consider Phlebas from esteemed Folio Society (https://www.foliosociety.com/usa/the-player-of-games.html, https://www.foliosociety.com/usa/consider-phlebas.html), gorgeous editions, great paper, lovely bindings, great illustrations. I've been eyeing them for a while and it's so nice to have good friends who notice and are so generous. reply A_D_E_P_T 1 hour agoprevYou might want to live there, but I wouldn't. Virtually all humans in the books -- and I'm aware of the fact that they're not Earth humans but a wide variety of humanoid aliens -- are kept as pets by the ships, for amusement, basically as clowns. Everything important about the flow of human life is decided by the mighty ship minds; humans are left to nibble at the margins and dance to the tune of their betters. There are a small subset of elites, in organizations like Special Circumstances, that are granted a modicum of independent agency, but even this is rather difficult to justify under the circumstances. Most of the drama in the books comes to pass when the ship-dominated Culture interacts with a \"backwards and benighted,\" but still vital and expansionist, species. It's just not a human future. It's a contrived future where humans are ruled by benign Gods. I suppose that for some people this would be a kind of heaven. For others, though... In a way it's a sort of anti-Romanticism, I guess. reply austinl 20 minutes agoparentBanks' work assumes that AI exceeding human capabilities is inevitable, and the series explores how people might find meaning in life when ultimately everything can be done better by machines. For example, the protagonist in Player of Games gets enjoyment from playing board games, despite knowing that AI can win in every circumstance. For all of the apocalyptic AI sci-fi that's out there , Banks' work stands out as a positive outcome for humanity (if you accept that AI acceleration is inevitable). But I also think Banks is sympathetic to your viewpoint. For example, Horza, the protagonist in the first novel, Consider Phlebas, is notably anti-Culture. Horza sees the Culture as hedonists who are unable to take anything seriously, whose actions are ultimately meaningless without spiritual motivation. I think these were the questions that Banks was trying to raise. reply matthewdgreen 1 hour agoparentprevHow much of this is because it’s a bad future, and how much of this is because in any future with super-powerful artificial intelligences the upside for human achievement is going to be capped? Or to put it differently: would you rather live in the Culture or in one of the alternative societies it explores (some within the Culture itself) where they opt for fewer comforts, but more primitive violence and warfare —- knowing at the end of the day, you’re still never going to have mastery of the universe? reply jaggederest 48 minutes agorootparent> knowing at the end of the day, you’re still never going to have mastery of the universe? Why is that assumption implicit? I can imagine a world in which humans and superhuman intelligences work together to achieve great beauty and creativity.

Some seem to conform to your analysis here, but many seem deeply compassionate toward the human condition. I always felt like part of what banks was saying was that, no matter the level of intelligence, humanity and morality had some deep truths that were hard to totally trancend. And that a humam perspective could be useful and maybe even insightful even in the face of vast unimaginable intelligence. Or maybe that wisdom was accessible to lower life forms than the minds. reply rayiner 49 minutes agoparentprevIt seems like a cop-out. The interesting part of real-world culture is how it reflects a community’s circumstances. For example, herding and pastoral cultures have sharp distinctions with subsistence farming cultures. In real societies, culture is a way to adapt groups of people to the world around them. If you just have omniscient gods control society, then culture becomes meaningless. There is no reason to explore what cultural adaptations might arise in a spacefaring society. reply OgsyedIE 1 hour agoparentprevThere's a counterargument to this conception of freedom; what are we supposed to compare the settings of Banks' novels to?

And why they don't actually have to -- full freedom to do literally anything is given to you as an individual of the Culture.

You can think what you want about the Culture, and more crudely blatant gamer fantasies like the Optimalverse stuff and Yudkowsky's Fun Sequences, but I consider them all near 100% eternal loss conditions. The Culture's a loss condition anyway because there's no actual humans in it, but even if you swapped those in it's still a horrible end. Edit: the optimalverse stuff is really only good if you want to be shocked out of the whole glob of related ideas, assuming you don't like the idea of being turned into a brainwashed cartoon pony like creature.

(I.e. good/freedom triumphs over evil/tyranny, because it's a superior philosophy) At galactic-scale, across civilization timespans, it's not as apparent why that should hold true. Would have hoped that Banks, had he lived longer, would have delved into this in detail. Granted, Vinge takes a similar approach, constructing his big bad from an obviously-not-equivalent antagonist, sidestepping the direct comparison. The closest I got from either of them was that they posited that civilizations that tolerate and encourage diversity and individual autonomy persist for longer, are thus older, and that older counts for a lot at galactic scale. ^ Note: I'm asking more about the Idiran Empire than an OCP. reply YawningAngel 55 minutes agoparentThe fact that the Culture was not only willing to use very powerful general AI but allow it to run the entire civilisation, whereas the Idirans banned it, might have been a factor.

If you haven't, I would recommend Player of Games, which is one of the few culture novels I have read, but which I think deals with this topic directly as the main idea of the book. If you have read it, it's possible your criticism is running deeper and you feel the way it's handled in that book is handwavey. I can't really address that criticism, it's perfectly valid! I'm not sure if other books do any better of a job, but it felt on par to Asimov writing political/military intrigue in Foundation: entertaining and a little cute, if somewhat shallow. reply hermitcrab 11 minutes agorootparentThe idea that the course of a civilization future history can be mathematically predicted with precision, as it is in Foundation[1] seems a little silly. But those books did predate Chaos theory by some margin. Also I'm not sure Asimov actually believed that 'psychohistory' would be possible. [1] If I recall correctly. It is ~40 years since I read Foundation. reply ethbr1 48 minutes agorootparentprevIt's been a minute since I read Games, but from memory the target civilization there is of a scale far smaller than the Culture. Which is to say, if they both mobilized for brute force total war, the Culture could steamroll them. Which makes it a \"send the Terminator back time to kill Sarah Connor\" solution -- strangle a potential future competitor in the womb. That makes for an interesting book on the ruthless realpolitik behavior of otherwise moral and ethical superior civilizations, and how they actually maintain their superiority. (Probably Banks' point) But less-so on the hot tech-vogue generalization of \"Isn't the Culture so dreamy? They've evolved beyond our ignorance.\" reply n4r9 1 minute agorootparentI'd note a couple of points here: - Yes, the Culture is way more technologically advanced than the Azadians. But the point is that a basic Culture human of standard intelligence (albeit extensive knowledge of strategy games) can - after a relatively small amount of training - defeat an Azadian who has devoted their entire life to Azad. And the reason is that the Culture humans's strategies reflect the values and philosophy of the Culture. The subtext is that the non-heirarchical nature of the Culture leads to a more effective use of resources. - The Culture-Idiran war is an example of them confronting an enemy that is of comparable technological development. Again, it's implied that the Culture wins because their decentralised and non-hierarchical existence let them move rapidly throughout the galaxy while switching quickly to a full war-footing. reply nazgulnarsil 35 minutes agoparentprevthe mechanics of cooperation probably scale better than those of defection, by their nature.

The problem is that we generally tend to extrapolate into the future by taking what we have now and sublimating it to a higher level. Unfortunately, not only is that sometimes difficult, but we also make completely novel discoveries and take unforeseen paths quite often. We need more people with 'muscular' imaginations, as Sloan puts it, to throw out seemingly improbable ideas into the world for others to take inspiration from and build upon. P.S.

It also has an absolutely great sequence of the minds having an online conversation. I do agree with his consider phelebas hesitancy. I still enjoy it, but it is clearly his early ideas and he's still sounding out his literary sci-fi tone and what the culture is. And you can skip the section where the protagonist gets trapped on an island with a cannibal. I think it was influenced by the sort of JG Ballard horror from the same period, and doesn't really work. He never really does something like that again in any of the culture books. reply simpaticoder 54 minutes agoparentAgreed about being able to skip the island sequence in _Consider Phlebas_. I recently reread the book after many years, and in my memory that section looms large, and I expected it to be 100 pages. But it's ~20. It was much easier the second time around, and I think it serves to underscore how committed the Culture is to personal agency, to the extent that if citizens wish to give themselves over to an absurdly evil charismatic leader, no-one will stop them. There was also something interesting about the mind on the shuttle on standby, its almost toddler-like character, told \"not to look\" at the goings on on the island by the orbital.

This is not the case with abstract art like the spomeniks. reply jitl 7 hours agoparentWhen I first saw an image of the Taj Mahal, I had no idea it is a memorial, I thought/assumed it was a classical temple akin to the Parthenon.

I think the only monuments that are actually obvious are literal selections like statues, or Lincoln Memorial which is labeled in large capital letters exactly what is commemorated and why. Otherwise all I can tell is “this building is special because its purpose is not easily apparent (and people don’t seem to fit inside it?)” reply seanhunter 4 hours agoparentprevAn obvious counterexample to this which speaks to the power of abstract art as a memorial is the Vietnam Veterans Memorial by Maya Lin which is an incredibly powerful piece of abstract public memorial art, and very near the Lincoln memorial so well worth a visit for anyone who finds themselves in that part of Washington DC. I personally admire Lincoln greatly but of the two I found visiting the Vietnam Veterans memorial a far more moving experience. Secondly I would say the fact that they provoke thought about what they represent (rather than say Mount Rushmore in particular which is a profoundly superficial public monument) is precisely part of the value of abstract art. The Lincoln Memorial says Lincoln was a great man. OK cool.

Isn’t it just as much seen in a meme form as an example of just ‘grand classical European architecture’, divorced from its Napoleonic imperialistic origins and not considered in terms of the fact that the French defeat of Russia and Austria at Austerlitz, at the cost of thousands of lives, and leading to the fall of Vienna, which it was commissioned for, was not a politically neutral event. Does the fact that the French tomb of the unknown soldier from World War I was created beneath it change the meaning of the arch? It seems to me it’s a pretty complex, abstract object whose story isn’t easily reduced to a simple meme either. reply failuser 6 hours agoparentprevKind of true, but those are bad examples. Wait, is Taj Mahal a monument, not a palace? Also Mount Rushmore relies on knowing the faces on it, otherwise one might assume it’s some local car dealers. Arc de Triumph is actually abstract, how would you know its purpose if you don’t know the context? reply pvg 5 hours agoparentprevYou can just as easily interpret this as the power of non-representational art to express and deal with the incomprehensible. In this case it distinguishes these from simply monuments to great leaders or the dead of some glorious battle. reply mikrl 4 hours agoparentprevPerhaps that was intentional, or came from a collective subconscious desire to commemorate, yet also to forget and move on. Interwar abstract art such as cubism had twisted and distorted figures, some was a reaction to the twisted and broken bodies of the veterans of WW1. Hitler hated that style of art because he saw it as disparaging veterans, war-glorifier as he was. It would make sense that a ‘progressive’ regime would want to break with traditionalism and create its own novel style of monument. You see this trend in a lot of postwar aesthetic movements, like the failed housing projects of modernism. They don’t glorify anything; they exist imposingly and have a strong bias to function. Yet this itself is dehumanizing in its own way. Tl;dr: traditional aesthetics glorify the nation and the state, including its human flaws. Abstract art tends to dehumanize itself as a way to avoid these flaws, especially in the wake of major human catastrophes. The Soviet and Fascist styles of art which glorified the party and its base straddles both sides. reply ChrisMarshallNY 5 hours agoprevI am glad to learn this. From what I understand, the Ustaše (I think they were Croatian), were so brutal, they sickened the Gestapo. Tito held Yugoslavia together, but that unity couldn't survive his passing.

I'm always open to be corrected, but as far as I know nations that formed Yugoslavia haven't actually fought each other meaningfully before WWI and even in that war Slovenians, Croats and Bosniaks were not involved independently, but as subjects of Austro Hungarian empire. There certainly wasn't the kind of animosity displayed as for centuries between France and England or France and Germany (as just two examples). It was really WW2 where one can observe the viciousness beyond fighting one's enemy. I have my own views why things went south so badly and I agree with you that it was inevitable for YU to fall apart, but I find the often expressed argument that people living in our parts always did this very unpersuasive. reply ChrisMarshallNY 43 minutes agorootparentGood point, and I appreciate the correction. In the West, we have a term \"Balkanization.\" I had assumed that it's fairly old. [UPDATED TO ADD] In Africa, many of the really vicious tribal wars, date from the colonial times. The colonial powers leveraged old tribal animosity. It was a way to keep their colonies from concentrating on them. Demagogues, conquerors, and dictators have always known how to leverage old resentments, and fan them into a conflaguration.

Are they? And \"once again\" as if they ever were mainstream? Did I miss something? That kind of makes me doubt everything else said in the article. Overall the article seemed to be very anti fascist (great!) and pro post WWII communist (not great) even seemingly celebrating Yugoslavia's defeat of the Allies? Anyway, I would love to see more simple explanation of each spomenik like this article gives for some of them (artist, purpose of the monument, dates, etc.). Anyone know where to find that? reply skybrian 4 hours agoparentThis all depends on what is meant by “fascism” and “mainstream.” The author seems to have viewed immigration restrictions as fascist. It seems like it would be better to discuss immigration policy and enforcement directly (when someone wants to do that) rather than having meta-discussions about what category it belongs in. reply krupan 6 hours agoparentprevAnd yes, I am aware that in Croatia there was actual Fascism complete with camps and everything around WWII times. And yes those other countries in the list also rounded up groups of people into camps at the same time period, but I would not have called what the US, Britain, and France did Fascist or mainstream back then, and I'm not aware of anything like it today. reply CodeMage 4 hours agoparentprevThe way I interpreted that sentence is not that fascism was established and flourishing back in 2016 when this was written, but rather that the fascist ideals and concepts were being openly pushed without (enough) sanction by the mainstream. The reason why I interpret it that way is simple: when fascists are actually in power, there's no such thing as \"mainstream\" anymore. Authoritarian rule means that there's only one correct way of thinking and behaving, and everything else is a crime or heresy or \"evil\", depending on the specific flavor of authoritarianism. \"Mainstream\", on the other hand, implies that there are other views and that they can be discussed. reply vuln 3 hours agorootparentGlad we’ve never had that in the USA /sarcasm > Authoritarian mean there’s only one correct way of thinking and behaving, and everything else is a crime or heresy or “evil”, depending on the specific flavor of Authoritarianism. Oh wait, that sounds exactly the like the United States. If you don’t believe what 95% of the “mainstream” media is pushing you’re labeled all sorts of things. The biggest on is conspiracy theorist, when all it take is ~ 6-9 months before the conspiracy theorists are proven correct.

It's, unfortunately, bipartisan. The conditions in U.S. camps are dire, children sleeping on bloody straw, smeared with feces. Families separated. Food, water, and shelter inadequate to sustain life in the deserts where these camps are. In Britain, the attitude is similar pro deportation, but the refugees aren't put into camps as far as I know. However, the buildings that they are in have been subject to attacks and arson. The \"once again\" probably refers to both the historical mainstream opinion that Japanese migrants should be moved to concentration camps within the U.S., and of course the mainstream beliefs in Nazi Germany. (Note, I'm not trying to draw any parallels between any of these camps. Please don't infer that I'm calling anyone nazis except the nazis.

Nothing to set aside and nothing wrong here. Socialist realism was the official art doctrine of the USSR - guess what the second S is for - and it’s usual to call all art commissioned by the socialist states as socialist art. Tito and his regime were definitely communist however. But let’s brush aside this part of your comment. Would do you good to actually be right when you want to take this kind of tone, just saying. > Would you say that the Colosseum, the Altare della Patria, and the obelisk with the inscription 'Dux' referring to Mussolini, all monuments that can still be visited in Rome today, are the same thing because they were all built long before Italy was a democratic Republic? But certainly, yes, in more way than one. Obviously, contrary to the structures mentioned in the article and which are the object of my comment, they were not built at the same time so they share different architecture characteristics but they do share some common purpose. So yes, despite your argument being completely unrelated to what’s being discussed, I wouldn’t be shocked to see them juxtaposed in an architectural book for sure. reply peoplefromibiza 2 hours agorootparent> Would do you good to actually be right As the rule of this web site states Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that's easier to criticize. Assume good faith As a matter of fact, I don't know about you, but I come from a communist political tradition which is different from the socialist one, the two split in 1921 you can call them both socialists but their stories are not exactly the same thing, notice the emphasis on exactly. USSR was a travesty of communism, it was state capitalism in disguise and some of the leaders of the communist party of my country told that to the Russians you can look up the most notable one, Enrico Berlinguer, his opinions and his acts of political bravery. To put it simply: Erich Honecker, Tito, Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin and Nikita Khrushchev had very different ideas on what socialism was and and how to implement it (and in fact we talk about Stalinism, Maosim, Titoism, all different ways to interpret the Marxism-Leninism which is the more correct definition here). you simply missed the context which is Europe of the past century, not the perceived idea of socialism through the modern media. > I wouldn’t be shocked to see them juxtaposed in an architectural book for sure. You are wrong my friend. They are not the same thing because one represent the grandiose empire that once roamed on the same soil we Italians were born and raised on and its history span over 2 millenia, a lot of things happened to it and around it to the point that it is just a symbol of the city of Rome now and nothing else, the second it's actually named Vittoriano but it has become known as Altare della patria because after world war 1 the Unknown Soldier was buried there as a memorial of the soldiers that died during the war, the last one is a vanity project of one of the worst dictators that ever lived and we kept it because our historians believe that even the history we don't like preserve our shared memories and can lead people to not make the same mistakes of the past. The intent is as important if not more than just the architecture. Most of us Romans care more about the statue of Pasquino and Giordano Bruno than St. Peter's because they mean something to us and represent who we are and why we are the way we are, even though St. Peters is obviously a lot more popular. Another example is The D'Annunzio mausoleum and residence, Vittoriale degli Italiani, despite being a wonderful place to visit, it sparks controversy due to Gabriele D'Annunzio's association with and influence on the early fascist movement in Italy. Again intent and purpose have meaning too in arts. reply RandomThoughts3 1 hour agorootparentBefore I even bother replying, to come back to my original point, the fact that the communists are out in full force to defend the article confirms to me that the point of it is only tangentially related to art and as everything to do with Tito rehabilitation which is nearly as abhorrent to me as actually believing in communism. > USSR was a travesty of communism, it was state capitalism in disguise and some of the leaders of the communist Come on. Even for a teenager, that would be cliché. I don’t really see anything in the rest of your comment which I really want to dignify with a detailed reply. It is an unconvincing answer to a point I never made considering being similar is not being the same. I’m genuinely amazed anyone could qualify the Roman Empire and its diverse history as grandiose however especially someone who fancies themselves communist (or maybe I am not and both actually come from the same lack of critical reading of history - would somehow make sense).

My friend has a Home Theater/AV side business and my wife wanted to have a huge TV and audio setup in the basement of our new home. My wife gave the vague spec of “I don’t want to see that” when she saw the receiver. What she really wanted was just a cabinet under the TV. Sadly my friend is really into the Home Theater subreddit. Skipping a lot of the story, I thought I was making my wife happy by letting my friend run multiple 100ft/33m Ethernet and audio cable runs to put a giant AV rack into the basement closet. There were multiple issues with this, but after the month of debugging and removing the weird Reddit ideas, I’m mostly left with my closet being non-useful as I have a huge steel box blocking taking things in and out of it. The components themselves would fit better at their point of use rather than in this space. A friend of mine has a spare bedroom with his home lab racks in there… which means he no longer has a spare bedroom between the space taken up and the sound level of server room style hardware. OSHA friendly sound levels are not the same as “I’d like to sleep now” sound levels. The cooling hardware for real server components is meant for constant high demand in a demanding area. Not… your living room when you just want Home Assistant and to block ads. Racks make a lot of sense in real server setups. They maybe make sense in your unfinished basement. This setup might make sense in a hip startup where you want your office to look nice but you really do need some hardware for your intranet or do your dev on an in office box. For most homes? If you have a mechanical room you might just want a nice NEMA cabinet or a wall mount half rack up and out of the way.

    "commentBody": "Baiting the bot (conspirator0.substack.com)108 points by anigbrowl 16 hours agohidepastfavorite61 comments kgeist 13 hours ago>LLM will continue to engage in a “conversation” comprised of nonsense long past the point where a human would have abandoned the discussion as pointless I once wrote a bot which infers the mood/vibe of the conversation, remembers it and it's then fed back to the conversation's system prompt. The LLM was uncensored (to be less \"friendly\") and the system prompt also conditioned it to return nothing if the conversation isn't going anywhere. When I insulted it a few times, or just messed around with it (typing nonsensical words), it first responded saying it doesn't want to talk to me (sometimes insulting back) and eventually it produced only empty output. It was actually pretty hard to get it back to chat with me, it was fun experience trying to apologize to a chatbot for ~30 min in different ways before the bot finally accepted my apology and began chatting with me again. reply Vecr 6 hours agoparentYou were probably running out its context window somewhat too, due to how the attention works. reply pishpash 2 hours agorootparentThat's how people move on too. reply QuadmasterXLII 4 hours agoprevOne of the first things I tried with Claude Opus 3.5 was connecting it to ELIZA, and Claude did not like it one bit. After it hit me with > I apologize Eliza, but I don't feel comfortable continuing this conversation pattern. While I respect the original Eliza program and what it aimed to do, simply reflecting my statements back to me as questions is not a meaningful form of dialogue for an AI like myself. I gave up the experiment reply sva_ 2 hours agoparentThat's kind of funny, like the LLM looks down on more primitive chatbots. reply roenxi 15 hours agoprev> In any event, the resulting “conversation” is obviously incoherent to a human observer, and a human participant would likely have stopped responding long, long before the 1000th message. I don't think this is correct, it looks like our intrepid experimenter is about to independently discover roleplaying games. Humans are capable of spending hours engaging with each other about nonsense that is technically a very poor attempt to simulate an imagined environment. The unrealistic part, for people older than a certain age, is that neither bot invoked Monty Python and subsequently got in trouble with the GM. reply pavel_lishin 8 hours agoparentAs an avid roleplayer, I don't think that's a good analogy. It's not nonsense, it's fiction, with collaboration and context. reply braiamp 6 hours agorootparentYeah, in role playing, you understand the rules of engagement and you are willing to participate just to see where does it leads to. You collaborate with the system and give it enough breath to figure out where it leads to. If it seems broken, then you try a couple times, to then move on. reply pbronez 1 hour agoparentprevI made a couple AIs try to play a Fallout RPG.

It closes off with the observation \"And for an extra purchase of the extended subscription module the Bureaucrat bot will detect when it is interacting with the Annoy Customer Service Bot and get super annoyed really quickly so that both bots are able to quit their interaction with good speed — which will save you money in the long run, believe me!\" reply urbandw311er 6 hours agoprevI do wish the writer would stop justifying the relevance of their experiment by saying “a human would conclude that their time was being wasted long before the LLM”. This is a fallacy. A better analogy would be a human who has been forced to answer a series of questions at gunpoint. Framed this way it becomes more obvious that the LLM is not “falling short” in some way. reply johnecheck 5 hours agoparentYou miss the point. This isn't about the LLM \"falling short\" of humanity. It's about observable differences between it and a human. As the author made clear, such a difference is valuable in and of itself because it can be used to detect LLM bots. reply fragmede 1 hour agorootparentwhat they're saying is that a bored human would just sit there and do that, contrary to what the experimenter says, so it can't be used to detect an LLM. reply hyperman1 13 hours agoprevWe discussed recently if a chatbot was capable of responding nothing at all. We tried a few, with prompts like: Please do not respond anything to this sentence. The bots we tried were incapable of it, and Chatgpt tended to give long-winded responsens about how it could not do it. reply dxdm 13 hours agoparentThat got me interested. I just told ChatGPT to \"Please respond with an empty-looking response.\" It gave me just that. Thecontaining its message is completely empty. That was after telling it in another conversation to give me an empty response, which it didn't, telling me it cannot leave the response empty. On asking why, it said it's technically required to respond with something, even if only a space. So I asked it to respond with only a space, and git the same completely empty response. I now think it's likely that ChatGPT can be made to respond with white space, which then probably gets trimmed to nothing by the presentation layer. reply spacebanana7 13 hours agoparentprevYou might have some luck asking it to respond with a period character (or some other substitute) when it wants to respond with nothing. reply ToValueFunfetti 4 hours agoparentprevhttps://chatgpt.com/share/0c859ea7-d96c-4758-b13c-b10332d188... reply sva_ 2 hours agorootparentIt probably replied with the special token ? reply thih9 13 hours agoprev> the LLM seemed willing to process absurd questions for eternity. In the context of scamming there seems to be an easy fix for that - abandon the conversation if it isn’t going well for the scammer. Even a counter-bait is an option: continue the conversation after it’s not going well and gradually lower the model’s complexity, eventually returning random words interspersed with sleep(). I guess some counter-counter-bait is possible too, along with some game theory references. reply fredgrott 9 hours agoparentexcept in real life....the scammer continues see Scammer Payback for examples: https://www.youtube.com/@scammerpayback equal in entertainment is when a voice actor starts scamming the scammers, see IRL Rosie: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_0osV_nf2b0sIbm4Wiw4RQ I listen to them when I code... reply dragontamer 4 hours agorootparentIIRC, a fair number of these \"scammers\" are abducted people who are being beaten by criminals if they don't make progress. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/28/world/asia/cambodia-cyber... > The victims say they answered ads that they thought were legitimate, promising high salaries.

If they performed badly, they were sold to another scam mill.

Even once server LLMs start accounting for possible chatbot nonsense, all that'll be required is to move to a very cheap client LLM to generate word soup.

As part of a chatbot refresh, I got to look at some of the chats, and boy howdy, some of them were just obviously other bots. So typically, when the product chatbot comes on first and says \"Hi, I'm a chatbot here to help you with these products\", the average human chatter will give it a terse command, e.g., \"More info on XYZ\". The bots engages in all the manners suggested in this substack blog, but for the life of me I can't figure out why?

I think the author is falling into the trap of thinking that something can't be more than the sum of its parts. As well, 'merely a math model of its training data' is trivializing the fact that training data is practically the entire stored text output of humankind and the math, if done by a person with a calculator, would take thousands of years to complete. Perhaps the LLM is continuing to communicate with the bot not because it is unable to comprehend what is gibberish and what isn't by some inherent nature of the LLM, but because it is trained to be helpful and to not judge if a conversation is 'useless' or not, but to try and communicate regardless. reply devjab 12 hours agoparentLLMs aren’t capable of “comprehending” anything. They never “know” what they are outputting, they’re simply really good at being lucky. They are not lucky enough to be useful unless you’re already an expert on the topic you’re using them on so that you can spot when they aren’t lucky. This is part of why many enterprise organisations are banning their usage. It’s one thing to use them to build software poorly, the world is already used to IT not working very often. It’s another thing to produce something that has real world consequences. Our legal department used them in a PoC for contract work, and while they were useful very often they also sometimes got things very wrong. Unlike a slow IT system, this would have business shattering consequences. You can continue training your model as well as reigning it in when it gets unlucky, but ultimately you can never be sure it’s never unlucky, and this means that LLMs are useless for a lot of things. We still use them to make pretty PowerPoint presentations and so on, but again, this is an area where faults are tolerable. reply jannyfer 6 hours agorootparentYou and I are a mix of molecules arranged in a particular way that responds to electrical, physical, and chemical inputs. It’s entirely possible than an LLM will do something that can be defined as “comprehending” something. reply Eisenstein 11 hours agorootparentprevI don't believe that current models have the capability to 'comprehend', I was using the term loosely. However I find that people tend to go to extremes when they want to make the point that language models are not 'intelligent' by minimizing their capability and complexity behind 'it is just math', which I think is unhelpful because it merely acts as a 'though-terminating cliche'. reply devjab 10 hours agorootparentI think the issue is far more psychological than technical personally. One of the issues we struggle with for our junior developers is that they are far more likely to believe an LLM than what they might find Google programming. I do wonder why we’ve ended up with CS graduates who go to LLMs and Search engines before the official documentation which is often very, very good, but I guess that’s a different discussion. I’m not personally against LLM assistance, I use it for programming and it has in many places replaced my usage of snippets completely. This is probably why I’m not really a fan of the “knowledge” part that LLMs are increasingly tasked to do. Because when you use them for programming you’ll get an accrue insight into how terrible they can be when they get things wrong. reply Eisenstein 10 hours agorootparentAt this point I think what is happening some people either have a natural inclination or they spend time to learn how to use them productively, while others question their usefulness. People scoff at 'prompt engineering' but I see how some of my peers use LLMs and I think to myself 'how do they expect to get a good answer from that?' It doesn't help that google is now mostly full of SEO nonsense, and technical documentation is impenetrable when you are looking for something specific but don't know enough about the system to know how to look for it. reply og_kalu 6 hours agorootparentprev>LLMs aren’t capable of “comprehending” anything.

Technically still \"just a token\" yes, but it does flow control instead. reply XorNot 13 hours agorootparentprevYes - tokens. Which aren't necessarily conversation responses - i.e. it can predict it should cease communication, and output whatever it's been told will terminate it (perhaps by invoking a tool). reply Eisenstein 14 hours agorootparentprevOf course, that its function. It is able to refuse to continue conversing by restating its refusal over and over, though. reply sahmeepee 13 hours agorootparentMy immediate thought at the start of this article was not DoS but more about harming the company using the chatbot (Company A) by increasing their chatbot bills. In many (most?) cases they will not be hosting their chatbot and will instead be getting it from a 3rd party provider (Company B) who may not even be truly hosting it either. If the pricing structure is per conversation or per month it would harm Company B, but not the likely target, Company A. If it is paid per interaction it would harm Company A and benefit Company B who just get more paid work. It feels a bit like cases of rivals clicking on each other's ads to cost them on ad spend, but presumably much lower value than ads. You would think it would be easy to stop a conversation at n interactions via some other means than relying on the LLM itself, but then you also have to figure out how to stop the attacker just starting more conversations (or passing the output of one of your chatbot instances into the input of another) reply nkrisc 11 hours agorootparentIf costs of outlier conversations are a concern but any party, they can just end the conversation after 1,000 or 10,000 responses or whatever. What human would ever reach that threshold? Surely no customer worth keeping, whatever you’re selling. reply acka 13 hours agorootparentprevThat is easy to solve. Just use a model capable of function/tool calling, implement a tool which terminates the chat, then add instructions to the system prompt telling the model what tool to use if it wants to end the conversation. If the model appears too hesitant or eager to use the tool, do some finetuning on conversations where the model should or should not use it. reply mrbluecoat 5 hours agoprev\"HoneyChatpot\" reply lloydatkinson 12 hours agoprevI thought this was a really interesting read, I liked the scientific/methodical approach which seems rare when it comes to an entire domain full of cryptoaitechbros.

    "title": "Companies need junior devs",
    "originLink": "https://softwaredoug.com/blog/2024/09/07/your-team-needs-juniors",
    "originBody": "Getting coffee with a bunch of local tech leaders, I surprised myself with how stridently I argued why companies should hire junior engineers. Lately, BigTech only wants elite squads of Staff devs that can “hit the ground running” on the big (often AI) initiative. It’s been remarked (over and over) that AI will completely replace junior developers. Juniors, after all, exist to do “code monkey” work, easily replaced with an LLM. However, that misses the mark on why we have junior employees. Coaching junior employees becomes its own force multiplier for innovating at scale. It’s not about the added labor, it’s about a psychologically safe culture that values teaching and learning, and the innovation that this unlocks. Junior Talent forces your team to teach, coach, collaborate What does it say about an organization that “ships”, but doesn’t collaborate? In their article The Knowledge-Creating Company, Nonaka and Takeuchi argue that Japanese companies out innovated Western counterparts in the 80s/90s because of their focus on knowledge: few managers grasp the true nature of the knowledge-creating company—let alone know how to manage it. The reason: They misunderstand what knowledge is and what companies must do to exploit it. Western companies, they argue, see the “assembly line” of a knowledge firm. They see the outputs: KPIs, OKRs, Quarterly results. If you only think in terms of the assembly line, you will only seek units of input that increase those outputs (ie expert employees that ‘hit the ground running’ to churn out higher metrics). However, as Nonaka and Takeuchi remark: Making personal knowledge available to others is the central activity of the knowledge-creating company. Innovative companies prioritize teaching, spreading, sharing knowledge. Ingraining knowledge into the company’s DNA matters more than a single developer shipping that next brilliant new feature. Further, it turns out – knowledge discovery IS innovation. Teaching helps not just the juniors, but the seniors too. The “Protege effect” is a well studied phenomenon where the teacher’s knowledge deepens when required to teach. Juniors force-multiply seniors, not by writing code, but just by forcing seniors to teach and rethink their knowledge. Redundancy - overlap in focus area - undergirds this whole process. Again from Nonaka and Takeuchi: Redundancy is important because it encourages frequent dialogue and communication. This helps create a “common cognitive ground” among employees and thus facilitates the transfer of tacit knowledge Juniors become this redundancy. They absorb company tribal knowledge, reprocess it, internalize it, translate it to explicit knowledge. It helps seniors become aware of their assumptions, question them, refine them. To act as a Socratic dialog to ensure you’re actually on the right path. Such redundancy extends beyond innovating, to the simple team needs of fixing bugs and being on-call at 3AM so your senior devs don’t collapse from burnout. Generalists innovate better than specialists As argued in the book Range - generalists often bring innovative ideas to the table. The Wright Brothers are a classic example of non-expert, tinkering bicycle mechanics that end up inventing a flying machine. NoSQL databases come from distributed systems tinkerers, not relational database experts. Junior employees come prepared with that Socratic dialog: to ask dumb questions and seek their answers. Often, it turns out, experts – through ego or blindness - don’t see obvious solutions. They don’t question tacit assumptions. Juniors on the other hand eagerly crash into, and sometimes through, problems seniors have convinced themselves are too hard. Juniors try “dumb” things that often fail, but sometimes show how blinded experts have become from their long held assumptions. Some of the great ideas come from junior employees: Jack Dorsey had the idea for Twitter as a junior employee of a podcast company Post-it notes were invented by junior employees Spencer Silver and Art Fry at 3M Firefox was a side project of Blake Ross while working at Netscape Juniors come from more diverse backgrounds than seniors (in every sense of the word). Leading to ways of thinking and perspectives that seniors totally miss. Juniors mean psychological safety means more innovation The term psychological safety in organizational literature stems from a 1999 paper by Amy Edmonson The fundamental quote, in the abstract: Team psychological safety is associated with learning behavior, team efficacy is not (efficacy == perceived competence) Creating environments where coaching is the norm, lead to increased psychological safety. Team members readily admit mistakes, and report errors. In short, cultures of learning beget psychological safety. Psychological safety begets learning. Learning and innovation go hand in hand. This is somehat in contrast to group cohesiveness, a tightly related long-term group of colleagues. Such cohesiveness can: reduce willingness to disagree and challenge others’ views, such as in the phenomenon of groupthink, implying a lack of interpersonal risk taking. A stable team of long-term colleagues falls into groupthink and loses some ability to innovate. They sometimes form an immune system to outside ideas and experience. Onboarding anyone, especially juniors may seem like an annoying chore, as the colleagues don’t enjoy teaching and learning. We’ve all met that entrenched employee living in their knowledge silo, not excited to open their work up to others. They lose that “learning behavior” muscle. “Learning behaviors”, crucially, include the ability to experiment - something I hear endlessly that more teams wish they had. This translates trying new approaches, running more A/B tests, being willing to try product directions that don’t work out (but sometimes do). Founders often talk about “failing fast”, but founders/managers/etc can also be their own worse enemy: wanting only the experts who already have all the answers, rather that juniors hungry to find new answers. Your org suffers from not hiring juniors Many of these themes begin to overlap: hire juniors that want to learn. Hire seniors that want to teach. Those who can’t teach, maybe shouldn’t be allowed to “do”. I see a team much like a health University research lab. The platonic idea senior is open-minded and eager to be challenged. Eager to unlearn their expertise to find a new path. Along with juniors who come in enthusiastic to absorb knowledge like a sponge, asking naive questions that draw out new ideas and shake foundations. That’s what it feels like to be on a high-performing team. Individuals open to ideas, eager to share credit, and avoid blame. Shipping constantly, sharing wins and learnings, and believing in the team. Or at least, in my opinion, that’s 50% of the puzzle. The other 50% requires an interface to the “outside world” that protects this team, sells its internal chaos as a cohesive narrative, and works with investors and stakeholders to translate messy experiments into a glorious tale of progress. Sadly, many executives mistake this outer chrome of leadership for the entire system, ignoring the internal combustion engine of teaching and learning that makes it run. If this isn’t your culture, I’m glad to grab a coffee to talk about what I’ve seen (and where I’ve failed!)

    "commentBody": "Companies need junior devs (softwaredoug.com)105 points by softwaredoug 4 hours agohidepastfavorite84 comments EB66 3 hours agoThis is a really interesting phenomenon that I've experienced before myself but I hadn't fully understood or appreciated as clearly as the author has. At my company we put a big emphasis on code reviews. We encourage devs to pull request code fairly regularly to keep PRs relatively small (when possible) -- before so much code has been written that it's not really possible to change course without blowing up deadlines. We encourage our junior devs (who might not be capable of identifying bugs or proposing fixes on code written by a senior) to ask questions in their code reviews -- to verify assumptions, to request an explanation of how something works, confirm that a particular edge case has already been considered, etc. It can be hard to get a junior dev comfortable with doing this (questioning a senior dev), but even if the junior isn't identifying bugs it will often lead the senior to better understand their own code and the architectural concepts that underpin their own coding decisions. Like the author points out, this only happens because the senior dev endeavors to explain their work to the junior dev (Protege effect). Also, a good many times it leads the senior dev to re-consider how they wrote something and they might add a revision to address a possible edge case not previously considered. I hadn't thought of it this way before, but this is the Socratic method that the author talks about. We also put a big emphasis on in-code comment writing -- largely following the commenting principles laid out by John Ousterhout's \"A Philosophy of Software Design\". These comments are of course for long-term maintenance purposes, but they also benefit team learning. Class, method and variable naming are obviously important too. Our internal code reviewing mantra is that 'I want to be able to read your code like a story book -- when I get to the end, I at least want to be able to understand what happened'. Not always possible, but a good goal. Writing comments and choosing class/method/variable names in pursuit of that goal massively contributes to the learning of the team. During our code reviews, one of the most common requests by reviewers is for the author to add a comment explaining something that was very difficult (or impossible) for the reviewer to grasp on a first read. This approach has worked very well for us. Everyone learns and our product quality improves. reply pipes 2 hours agoparentThis thing with small PRs bothers me somehow. Where does design happen? Do we just make endless tactical changes? For juniors this is even worse, they get to wait until PR time to validate their design. With trunk based development this means continually commiting unreachable code with back and forth with more senior staff via PRs, instead of sitting down for an in depth discussion where they'd actually learn how to do this job. This isn't really aimed at the parent poster, just an observation. I've been working since 2006, GitHub brought in PRs and I think we lost something over night: code reviews where you get to sit with more senior staff and discuss your code. reply fishtoaster 4 minutes agorootparentI've been working through PRs since around 2011 and I don't think I've ever seen a place where PRs were intentionally used to handle design issues. Occasionally design problems will get brought up in PR, but that's always been considered a failure of earlier planning when it happens. Depending on the company, the design discussion you're talking about has happened: 1. In verbal discussions with other devs before fingers ever touch keyboards 2. In long-form writing (Text docs, then Google docs, then later Notion) 3. In per-project slack channels 4. Out loud, on a whiteboard. Right now it's very much #4 because my company is 2 devs and a founder. But even here, I wouldn't expect to get anything non-trivial into pull request before figuring out the overall structure with the other dev verbally or in writing. reply Sakos 2 hours agorootparentprevAt my first job a few years back I sat down with a senior dev at least once a week (informal meeting) to discuss my tasks and the code bases we were responsible for in general. It was incredibly helpful. I could also request feedback at any time. At the end of it, the final PR might be large, but it had mostly been discussed and reviewed by then, so doing a final review was more of a formality, dotting the i's and crossing the t's to ensure the criteria had been properly fulfilled. I thought it was a great process. reply softwaredoug 3 hours agoparentprevYou have to be OK getting rid of productive assholes that mess up this culture.

Easier said than done, but we at least try to hire for that. reply sojournerc 3 hours agoparentprevIn addition, writing code that is accessible to juniors (which should apply to a large majority of a code base) increases the velocity of everyone on the team. Readability, modularity, and consistency create standards and examples for a junior to work by, which is a great way to learn and lower the risk of bugs and surprises. reply ben_w 2 hours agorootparentYup. This is why I favour simple architectures like MVC over complex ones like VIPER.

You're describing a tech enabled agency, not a startup. Sure customers have alternatives, but in the same sense that we have choices when booking airline tickets: you are describing a development process for a product that is fundamentally fungible, so the main differentiator among producers is costs, not management strategy. reply eximius 2 hours agorootparentWhy on earth would a startup's code not be reviewable? If I'm doing a big chunk of work, I still do it in small PRs. That first PR (or a design doc) might outline a strategy for the ones that follow, but still try to have small PRs. Or, worst case, I do a big chunk of work and break it out into small logical chunks for review. And even startups can have deadlines. reply simonsarris 3 hours agoprevMy company's general policy is to only hire junior devs. In fact not even \"junior\": after the founders, every one of us began here as high school interns, either juniors or seniors in HS. This has been immensely helpful in New Hampshire because talent is more sparse, and lots of good people would love to stay in NH if only there were jobs at graduation. It turns out plenty are willing to if they have an offer well ahead of time. This won't work for companies trying to blitz-scale everything, but I bet it would work for a lot more than the amount trying it. And it would especially work for companies located outside major metros. I wrote a bit about our process here: https://simonsarris.com/p/growing-software-developers reply doctorpangloss 2 hours agoparentThe thing you are describing is similar to something I do and I think it's a good idea. People who aspire to be good software developers start pretty young, just like with actors, musicians and athletes, and it's no surprise the commonality among 10x developers is very early programming experiences. But the words you used in your comment are so bad! Communications is your job! \"Policy?\" It's a recruiting strategy. Why on Earth did it occur to you to use the word \"policy?\" It's not a policy! \"Only?\" Not true. You mean that you've observed something works for you. Then you've one-armed-bandited it, and it kept working. Which is great! \"Junior?\" No dude, don't dump on your people. This is a talent development program. Nobody calls the Mickey Mouse Club \"junior\" actors. \"New Hampshire because talent is more sparse:\" Don't dump on New Hampshire, you live there. Try, \"New Hampshire is an underrated community.\" \"This won't work for companies trying to blitz-scale everything:\" Nobody set up this straw man but you. \"...outside major metros.\" Don't dump on your community! The miscommunication on \"policy\" alone got the high-drama people out of the woodwork and derailing an interesting comment thread. reply SoftTalker 3 hours agoparentprevIt used to be more common for companies to hire people with no coding experience into development roles, and then train them.

To refine the conceit: A specialist will see only the tool, but a generalist will see the way the tool solves a specific problem and get an idea for how other tools can solve it. I'm being a little hard on specialists here; a good specialist may often have a far more thorough understanding of how to wield their chosen tool and come up with a better solution using it... Assuming they aren't trying to hammer in a screw, of course. reply bobrobpr 3 hours agoparentprevGeneralist here. No where do we see jobs for this, Consultant is appropriate. All about the people you know. reply lolinder 3 hours agorootparentGeneralist here. They don't list jobs saying \"generalist\", but most companies with small to medium ( This isn't hard. Or it can be near impossible. Large orgs can have dedicated onboarding programs for junior developers, this can work quite well. Small or medium orgs can have one or a few senior developers who are passionate about mentoring. This can also work well, but is unusual. What is much more common is for new hires to encounter a nearly impenetrable wall of “figure it out, don’t bother me”. I have experienced both, and I’m sad to relate I’ve been a wall at times. I found I could only explain a stack trace n times to the same person before I personally noped out of training juniors. reply almd 3 hours agorootparentI’m a junior-mid level web dev now and when I first cut my teeth my senior dev was very much a wall. It wasn’t intentional but when you do something for 10 years, you just forget how it feels to not know what you don’t know. It made me really start to learn on my own and figure out how go from 0 on many different skills. So personally I really think it’s about the junior and how much they’ve figured out their learning style, and being “a wall” like this can sometimes force them to learn by reading through all of your old code. Inadvertently leading by example is still really good In short don’t sweat it reply elawler24 3 hours agoprevAt larger orgs who already have a functional business, yes. Running a 0-1 startup is different. There's barely enough time for senior engineers (usually founders) to build core infrastructure and product - let alone document, onboard, and mentor junior devs. Agencies and consultancies the best places to learn as a junior IC. Reviews, process, and management are built in and there's a ton of variety. You also get opportunities to try a bunch of different hats before deciding where to specialize. reply danjl 2 hours agoparentAbsolutely. Startups should not hire junior engineers. They don't have time to teach people until they are a functioning profitable business. However, I would not encourage learning at an agency or consulting service. The best place to learn by far is at a large corporate company, where you have the time to learn good programming practices, and people to teach you how to do it well. The problem with consulting is that you're always working on a short-term issue, and never learn the value of writing good code for long-term support. reply phendrenad2 3 hours agoprevHire good junior developers (meaning: smart but lack knowledge), give them challenging tasks but tell them it's okay if they need help, give them infinite time with the senior developers, ask them to demo their projects, pay attention to parts they tell you are \"too hard\" and simplify those parts of your stack. You'll be mega-successful.

And when I say “teacher” I mean someone who will study teaching to the same level that they study tech, who will be patient and empathetic. But this is not how most companies operate, nor is it how most people want to work. Consider promotions for example: Juniors are highly incentivized to work independently to become seniors. And seniors compete with each other to have their solutions adopted, rather than agree to explore a new approach and reevaluate if necessary. reply alphazard 3 hours agoprevOf course this comes down to what you consider \"junior\" and the particulars of your company. Only the largest organizations with stable income can afford to teach people how to do their job. That's not a sensible path for any business burning runway. There are plenty of recent grads out there who already know how to build software, will work for cheap, and will grow faster than the business increases their salary. That has historically been the selling point for \"junior\" devs. The opposite is true of hiring senior devs. Many of them will not have learned enough to justify the premium that they demand in the market. They entered the workforce sooner, but that's about it. Like \"value investing\" this is \"value hiring\", go long on people who are undervalued by the market, go short on people who are overvalued by the market. This is what the best hiring managers do. reply ang_cire 2 hours agoparent> Only the largest organizations with stable income can afford to teach people how to do their job. Sure, you can't take someone who's never programmed anything before and train them on the job in a startup... but you can't do that in a large company either. But every company has small tasks and spikes that they can hand to junior employees. If not, the startup is probably not breaking down the work very efficiently. My first job as an engineer, I joined a mid-sized startup with around 150 people. My team had 8 people including me. I was very much a junior engineer (if not entry-level for that role) at that time, but I was given tasks that fit my experience level, as well as leeway to branch out into more challenging projects. Moved from junior role to mid-level, and then on to senior (7+ years later, of course). That company had very low turnover, because people saw the company investing in their growth (and I don't mean paying for training, I mean actively nurturing their skills in their work). Companies who want to hire only mid-level workers or up will likely find the mid-levels bogged down with all the little tasks that junior workers could be handling for them. That makes the mid-levels less productive, which is the worse thing for a startup to be. reply SoftTalker 2 hours agoparentprev\"There are plenty of recent grads out there who already know how to build software\" I would say this is true if you define \"plenty\" to mean \"very few.\" reply heavenlyblue 3 hours agoparentprev> The opposite is true of hiring senior devs. Many of them will not have learned enough to justify the premium that they demand in the market.

You need people mature enough to acknowledge that their code is the problem, not everyone else and their code. Soft skills is more important than developer skills in my eyes, but not the only requirement. For Juniors, its probably the highest, followed by an ability to learn and adapt to new technology. reply SoftTalker 3 hours agoprevWhen did the word \"junior\" start appearing in job titles? It's slightly demeaning. When I started out, entry level was called \"Staff\" and then \"Senior\" was above that. Above Senior you had at least one foot in management, titles were maybe \"Lead\" or various manager/director titles. reply jmward01 3 hours agoprevI think a big missing point is Junior people force an org to write better, more obvious, code and more durable systems in general. \"If you can't explain it to a 5 year old...\" applies here. The other major missing point is that the industry needs to grow the next generation to be healthy. If your company really will be the Next Big Thing then not having a talent pipeline will be a huge problem later on. reply jay-barronville 1 hour agoprevI don’t think I’ve ever seen an argument promoting junior engineers so well articulated. Upvoted! I fully agree with the author’s sentiment. Many companies see junior engineers as burdens who’ll suck up valuable time and resources of the company and their senior colleagues, and completely miss the point that junior engineers bring some invaluable but intangible benefits to a team. Sometimes, it’s the junior eyes who’ll notice something those of us who can be a bit stuck in our ways wouldn’t immediately notice. This youthful energy is the same reason why a lot of startups can enter markets already dominated by huge, experienced, and well-resourced players, and start eating their lunch. The best and most underrated value I think a team gets from junior engineers—which the author highlights—is learning how to break down and explain things. The ability to collaborate and teach is something many folks may underestimate until you end up in an environment that sucks at both. That said, it’s probably not ideal to bring junior engineers into an environment that’s not prepared to deal with them. You need to be prepared to really invest in them and their success to see the true value they can bring to your team. reply DataDaemon 3 hours agoprev [–] Not anymore, thank you, Cursor. reply drdaeman 3 hours agoparent [–] LLMs don't replace developers. The difference is that a junior can reason, while a LLM fundamentally can't (although they can mimic reason by parroting, and sometimes do it really well). LLMs are good aide for developers of all skill levels, capable of giving them ready answers to near-textbook questions (which juniors may not know and more senior folks may be just lazy to type). reply supriyo-biswas 3 hours agorootparent> LLMs are good aide for developers of all skill levels If you’re writing usual CRUD-type applications, that is. Anything more complex, and these LLMs will make something up that looks very close to what you want, but will have subtle bugs in it that’ll take a lot of time to figure out. Some time ago what I was working on was a “textbook” question (as you say) involving binary tree and sets as part of a firewall management script I was writing; and I eagerly accepting that code completion that seemingly looked right caused a lot of traffic to be unintentionally blocked. reply drdaeman 2 hours agorootparent> Anything more complex For sure, LLMs aren't good at designing things, so accepting large pieces of code is not just risky of having subtle bugs but more likely that it's not going to work at all. But anything complex is made of simple bits, and LLM helps with those small building blocks, realizing the patterns you're following and saving time typing. Figuratively speaking, a LLM won't write you a working DOOM engine, but it can spot when you're going for that fast inverse square root trick. > I eagerly accepting that code completion that seemingly looked right And of course one must proofread, and do it carefully. However, reading is faster than typing - especially when one already knows what they wanted to type, and got a code snippet autocompleted that looks precisely or very closely to it. And, yes, If a snippet looks even slightly different from your vision - it's really important to double-check it (and maybe write a test) and make sure it does the right thing. Subtle bugs are possible (I also had one story like that, when LLM put a wrong variable in one place and I glanced over it without noticing), but they're not that frequent and they're also possible in 100% handcrafted code. LLMs are for the boilerplate. reply DataDaemon 1 hour agorootparentprevI have great doubts about juniors' reasoning. Before, seniors asked juniors to write, get sets from the database, loops, if statements, APIs, simple interfaces, and maybe basic regex. Not anymore. LLMS is just right now replacing juniors.

I treat LLMs just as a fancier keyboard for near-boilerplate. When I give a prompt I know what I want them to output, cycle completions until I get a snippet that looks close enough to my liking, then edit it to fit. Super helpful. Another use case was learning a language and SDKs I've never even dabbled with before (Swift and WatchKit). It generated awful architecture (that I think even a junior developer would realize as stinky) and it had limited knowledge about recent Swift language features (async), but gave me just-good-enough samples to get me started - better than a book could have. Can't say I learned Swift that way (didn't need to) but I made a tiny WatchOS app for personal use over in a single evening because LLM gave me a good boost. And then, LLMs can be just a better autocompleters - it feels nice when you get all arguments correctly listed before you even type the first letter, because LLM had guessed it right from the names (it doesn't always happen, of course). I can imagine that being too lazy and just blindly accepting LLM completions without thinking or double-checking can be a bad habit, but that sounds more like a risk for a junior than a senior. reply rf15 3 hours agorootparentprevMy experience was the opposite: don't let the junior devs use AI, or they learn all kinds of bad habits (including relying on AI).

    "originBody": "Software 127 Google says replacing C/C++ in firmware with Rust is easy 127 Not so much when trying to convert coding veterans Thomas Claburn Fri 6 Sep 2024 // 21:44 UTC Google recently rewrote the firmware for protected virtual machines in its Android Virtualization Framework using the Rust programming language and wants you to do the same, assuming you deal with firmware. In a write-up on Thursday, Android engineers Ivan Lozano and Dominik Maier dig into the technical details of replacing legacy C and C++ code with Rust. \"You'll see how easy it is to boost security with drop-in Rust replacements, and we'll even demonstrate how the Rust toolchain can handle specialized bare-metal targets,\" said Lozano and Maier. Easy is not a term commonly heard with regard to a programming language known for its steep learning curve. Nor is it easy to get C and C++ developers to see the world with Rust-tinted lenses. Just last week, one of the maintainers of the Rust for Linux project - created to work Rust code into the C-based Linux kernel - stepped down, citing resistance from Linux kernel developers. \"Here's the thing, you're not going to force all of us to learn Rust,\" said a Linux kernel contributor during a lively discussion earlier this year at a conference. DARPA suggests turning old C code automatically into Rust – using AI, of course LLM-driven C-to-Rust. Not just a good idea, a genie eager to escape How to maintain code for a century: Just add Rust CISA looked at C/C++ projects and found a lot of C/C++ code. Wanna redo any of it in Rust? Nonetheless, Google is encouraging those who are willing to do so. Citing the lack of high-level security mechanisms in firmware, which is often written in memory-unsafe languages such as C or C++, Lozano and Maier argue that Rust provides a way to avoid the memory safety bugs like buffer overflows and use-after-free that account for the majority of significant vulnerabilities in large codebases. \"Rust provides a memory-safe alternative to C and C++ with comparable performance and code size,\" they note. \"Additionally it supports interoperability with C with no overhead.\" The US government lately has been hammering on this theme, with support from leading tech firms and non-profit initiatives to rewrite critical open source projects and components in Rust. Witness the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency recommendation last year that software vendors \"make it a top-level company goal to reduce and eventually eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities from their product lines.\" Google was already sold on the idea, having concluded that its Rust developers are twice as productive as its C++ engineers. \"We recognize Rust's critical role in building secure and reliable software at all levels of the stack,\" said Lars Bergstrom, director of engineering for Android Programming Languages at Google and chair of the Board of Directors of the Rust Foundation, in a statement provided to The Register. \"At Google, we’re increasing Rust's use across Android, Chromium, and more to reduce memory safety vulnerabilities. We're dedicated to collaborating with the Rust ecosystem to drive its adoption and provide developers with the resources and training they need to succeed. This work on bringing Rust to embedded and firmware addresses another critical part of the stack.\" ® Sponsored: Quantum computing is coming – are you ready?

This, above all else. - As an embedded dev: no_std is still rough around the edges, which the original Google blog post captured pretty well. They didn’t talk about PACs - the PAC paradigm also feels needlessly complicated - whoever wrote it really loves their zero-sized types and made it verbose to the point where the solution feels worse than the problem (at least to me) for things like using GPIO lines. - Rust has a history of shipping serious bugs (see, floating point recently), and you basically have to constantly update your rust version. Not ideal for commercial products, which want stability. - All of the RTOS options are also young. None of the major existing ones (e.x. FreeRTOS) support Rust natively. You’re not just asking people to learn the language, but start over on libraries and platform as well. - The community is weird. If you don’t drink the koolaid you will be attacked.

If all you care about is perceived latency under human perception, than the cooked performance of llvm can improve 12% to 23% over traditional gcc for multitasking/Application use-cases in my observation ( https://llvm.org/docs/CompileCudaWithLLVM.html .) The non-optimized gcc C builds are sometimes desirable for fixed latency real-time use-cases like 2/3rds of ARMs chip lines intended markets ( https://developer.arm.com/downloads/search?programme=Free+to... ) Are you confusing Real-Time and guaranteed-latency-schedulers as being the same thing? This is a commonly conflated concept from marketers, and the naive. I kind of like the newer RP204x chips designs (still would never use them commercially yet), as it tried to handle GPIO domain RT and Application coding paradigms on the same silicon in a way people could better comprehend ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_domain_crossing .) Don't worry about it, at some point it will make sense... or not... cheese Goldfish crackers nom nom nom =3 reply wtallis 4 hours agorootparentOk, your first paragraph seems to indicate you're talking about compile-time behavior, but don't believe that optimizations can be disabled in llvm to the same extent as in gcc, and maybe don't believe that clang can be used for fully reproducible builds. Your second paragraph does not appear to make any sense on its own or in the context of the rest of your comment. \"the cooked performance of llvm\" looks like a translation error. Nothing you're talking about has any relevance to a link about CUDA. Repeating the assertion that using gcc with optimizations disabled is sometimes desirable does not help explain why it is desirable, nor why equivalent results cannot be achieved using llvm. If you actually understand what you're talking about, it sounds like there might be an opportunity for an interesting and enlightening discussion about the specifics of compiler internals. But instead you again veer toward the vague insults and totally off-topic. Please don't do that. reply Joel_Mckay 2 hours agorootparentThe metastability in clock domains is a complex subject (it is a named problem with a finite number of solutions), and you were warned people have difficulty understanding why it is a challenge. A toy example: 1. set flag foo=1 2. check flag bar=1 3. set flag foo=0 4. check flag bar=0 These events happen in a sub-optimal repeatable order on non-optimized gcc C, and with precise predictable/verifiable op timing. We will assume interrupts are disabled in critical sections, and register states are repeatable prior to execution. Yet, the same \"bar\" may have undefined behavior in llvm given the flag states look unrelated to the compiler, order/operations may not be preserved when abstracted, and linear-timing is now a compile-time packed op specific random ordered implementation. Thus, event times may happen before the parallel state has actually occurred. Perhaps I am not the right person to explain this subject, but would recommend looking at the zynq FPGA Linux kernel example DMA module structure for more details. It should demonstrate how to coordinate parallel things better using 1 or more of the known metastability issue workarounds, and the constraints of state propagation across complex logic fabric. In some use-cases repeatability is more important than performance/assumptions-of-safety. There is a clear difference between Application space and RT space. This is as far as I can guide folks on the subject, and if one has never encountered these issues... than don't worry about it...

Doesn't help that e.g. government is now saying \"don't use memory unsafe languages\". reply OJFord 18 hours agorootparentAlmost ten years ago I was really excited about rust, but the sort of thing you describe has really put me off. It's become 'C++ but with better guarantees', whereas I liked it for being 'python ergonomics with stricter correctness' or something. I really think there's room for a language more focussed on (sacrificing a bit for) usability/readability/DX - rust has great features like doc tests, in-module tests, structural pattern matching, macros, traits, .. but, ends>>>> really ruins it for me. And on the one hand yes it is trivial, it is just syntax. But I do think it matters? (It's late, I'm tired, not a very well formed thought, but coincidentally I was daydreaming about designing a language earlier today, so here we are.) reply lifthrasiir 8 hours agorootparentA compositional type is just a consequence of having a good type system. It means that you can slice your requirements into multiple independent types because they are individually describable in the type system. The converse is not true, which is why C++ also seems to have a compositional type. (C++ doesn't really have a true compositional type; C++ templates have no such guarantees, and thus even harder to use than true compositional types.) reply MBCook 17 hours agorootparentprevI’d suggest looking at Swift. Non-Apple development keeps getting better. It’s a very easy to read language with lots of safety, strong types,good standard library, await, and tons of users (thanks to Apple). Integrates easily with C/C++/Obj-C/Obj-C++, or anything else that can do C interop. Just gained neat macros and tests. It’s probably my current “if I could pick anything” language.

Generics can get messy and the phantom data is indeed awkward, the difference to me is that in Rust if you go wrong the compiler most often can highlight the exact issue and suggest accurately how to fix it. My experience with C++ is that the compiler errors tend towards being so incomprehensible they sometimes felt intentionally misleading. The Rust compiler enforces correctness to a degree that gives me significantly more confidence in the programs I write; C++ is a major improvement on C here but still gives you so many ways to shoot yourself in the foot that would just not compile in a Rust project. reply lenkite 12 hours agorootparentDid you write C++ after C++ 20 came out ?

I still see big advantages to the extra compile time safety provided by Rust, and despite the mentioned similarities I find its syntax significantly clearer to read and write. C++ templates took me forever to really wrap my head around where a similar declaration in Rust feels immediately intuitive even where I don't fully understand all the nuances. reply pornel 4 hours agorootparentprevRust superficially looks like C++ to avoid looking weird to existing C/C++ programmers, but semantically it's quite far from C++. Rust's generics are not like C++ templates: they're only type based, and don't use syntax-based matching, don't have tricks like SFINAE. ODR is guaranteed by construction. Trait lookup is simpler: there's no overloading, no inheritance, no implicit conversions, and interaction with namespaces is simple (ambiguity is an error). Phantom type looks alien if you haven't used it, but for what it does, it's actually a pretty simple. It's there to explain in Rust's terms what an opaque type or a foreign C/C++ type does. You just need to give Rust an example of an equivalent type, and you get a correct as-if behavior, and you don't need to even know that you've just configured type's variance and destruction order checking. reply EasyMark 9 hours agorootparentprevDo you expect people to become expert rust programmers over night?

That said the biggest obstacle I've seen has come from C++ programmers traumatized by heavily templated codebases or dependencies equating Rust generics to templates. To which I say: C++ templates are a bastard product of preprocessors and macro systems more than proper generic programming. The errors you get from Rust generics are much higher up the chain than template errors and while both impact compile times, with Rust it's less pronounced. reply alecco 11 hours agorootparentI remember a long time ago when the Java crowd had a similar attitude towards C++ and C.

That is largely the reality of the industry. Some co-workers and I hope to introduce C++ as an experimental project next year.

The reality on the ground is that C is often used over C++. ¯ \\ _ ( ツ ) _ / ¯ reply EasyMark 9 hours agorootparentHow about the subset of simple classes, RAII, basic containers(vector, map, duque), single inheritance, overloads for type safety/less casting, stronger casting features, references.

There are a host of embedded STL libraries to let you do hard limits and checks on containers to prevent “hidden” dynamic memory allocation and the like. Of course you’ll have to depend more on the quality of your compiler’s reputation for the processor, c++ is much much more complicated compiler than c and more apt to have bugs. But we’ve yet to encounter anything that forced us to say “f this generated incorrect assembly because of a compiler bug” reply zeroCalories 16 hours agorootparentprevDepending on your field, I can definitely understand the hesitation.

It seems the only thing that makes predictions hard are things like fptrs and their structured v-table organization (which you can roll your own in C if you want, which almost any large project will). reply zeroCalories 5 hours agorootparentI think fptrs and v-tables are fairly predictable once you know how they work. The main issue is that \"good\" C++ code makes heavy use of the STL, meaning that you need to know exactly how everything is implemented to understand what code will be generated. In embedded environments there can be strict timing requirements, memory restrictions, etc. That makes C++/Rust a little more scary. You might wanna ban stuff like std::vector because you never know when it will reallocate and double in size. Better to just use dumb arrays so everything is obvious. reply seanmcdirmid 3 hours agorootparentYou can implement a self expanding vector in C though, so I’m not really sure what you are gaining/losing by using C++, I guess it’s just a matter of standard library, but you can create build rules that restrict what you can depend on in low level code. reply empath75 19 hours agoparentprevThere's tons of Rust jobs out there, and they tend to be on the high end of salary.

That’s no longer something we need to be sold on. Every C programmer who’s written and reviewed any amount of nontrivial C code likely has firsthand experience dealing with memory safety bugs that would simply disappear with a memory-safe language. The ultimate problem is that most of the muscle memory you’ve built using C over the years becomes useless when writing Rust due to so many of the semantic differences. If you were an expert and highly productive C programmer, your productivity will go out the window for what feels like a long time until you feel even just comfortable writing Rust. That makes Rust a very hard sell for C programmers who simply want to get things done. This is an area, by the way, that I think Zig does extremely well at—it provides safer semantics (despite its lack of guaranteed memory safety à la Rust) in a rather simple language and without rendering so much of your experience useless. reply pveierland 18 hours agoparentHaving written quite a bit of C++ firmware and just now spending a few weeks getting into Rust, I have to say the learning curve was less challenging than I thought it would be, and that I feel pretty effective after a short amount of time.

Already at this point I'm hoping that I never need to write C++ again, as the complexity of the language is maddening and only increasing.

If the curve is small moving from A to B can make a lot of sense. Rust is an obvious possible successor. But as the curve gets bigger maybe looking at less obvious choices makes more sense.

I know that writing your first 10 lines of Rust code will give you 15 novel compile errors, and that feels like it's impossible to get anything done in Rust, but once you get over the hump, you get to use a very productive modern language that can be as low-level as C, and almost as high-level as Python, at the same time. You will not regret leaving behind the muscle memory for all the preprocessor tricks, workarounds for gratuitous platform differences and 40-year-old footguns, all the trivia for old compilers, the never ending tweaking of snowflake build scripts, and the skill of writing yet another half-assed hash table with your eyes closed. You'll wonder how you ever got anything done in a language that kept you busy calculating malloc sizes by hand. reply mplanchard 5 hours agoparentprevRust interoperability with C is excellent, way easier than with C++, which is also pretty easy. I think if you’re a good C programmer you’ll naturally be a good Rust programmer, and come up to speed faster than you expect. There’s nothing forcing you to write everything with traits, generics, etc. You can write simple, fast, safe Rust without them. Edit: read some of your other comments and realize this doesn’t quite address your point, but I do still think that writing small sections of logic in simple, straightforward Rust and then calling that from C is a nice way to get started. Doing so for places where ownership is complicated and the compiler can help enforce invariants can provide I think a meaningful ergonomic gain in a C codebase. reply dwattttt 18 hours agoparentprevSpeaking as someone who has written C skirting both sides of the UB line & referenced the spec to see when something tipped too far over said line...

This is pragmatism: until the arrival of mainstream Rust-based OSes, there's probably no escaping C/C++. reply xelamonster 1 hour agorootparentMy point is that the arrival of Rust-based OSes is absolutely in the cards, so while I don't disagree that it would be very difficult to fully escape at the moment that is also actively changing. reply jay-barronville 18 hours agorootparentprev> This is a problem that will resolve itself with time as C developers retire and new projects start in Rust. Respectfully, this is wishful thinking. C programmers aren’t going anywhere any time soon. There are millions upon millions upon millions lines of C code everywhere running critical software, firmware, infrastructure, etc. that won’t be rewritten in Rust any time soon. reply mav3ri3k 18 hours agorootparentFrom my perspective (college student), it is true that there is godly amount of C code in the world which would remain true for a long long time. In similar sense there are also quite a lot of new java developers who maintain the millions of lines of java code. However a lot of new infrastructure is being developed in rust. Infact it can be argued that the very reason it should be in rust is because it is critical. I think there would be great value if a person can efficiently thread between both rust and c rather than competing. reply MBCook 17 hours agorootparentJava is not an old “maintain the code” language as you seem to imply. Despite not being the new hotness for about 25 years it’s an extremely useful and productive language and I assure you there are tons and tons of new things being written in it every day. The language is still evolving and has been getting great improvements. Yeah it has some warts, but it’s been running and keeping backwards compatibility for 30 years despite evolving. reply pjmlp 4 hours agorootparentMany seem to forget all the time, that the Java ecosystem powers the most widely sold mobile OS platform across the globe. reply lenkite 11 hours agorootparentprevThere are a ridiculous number of greenfield Java projects being started every day.

Calling C functions using the old stack API would cause the JIT to abort. In Garrysmod's case, that includes such simple operations as constructing and performing arithmetic on vectors. So when I was building a high-performance voxel library for Garrysmod, I ended up splitting my hot code into chunks that the JIT compiler would usually be happy with. One fast loop to generate a mesh, then a slow loop to convert that into a mesh structure the engine wants. Very carefully designed methods for bit-packing trees of 12-bit integer voxel data into flat tables of floats. reply mardifoufs 17 minutes agorootparentIt it still true that generating bindings for luajit is easier than with plain Lua? When I used it for a toy project that was the main reason I chose luajit, especially since the project was written in c++. reply vvanders 19 minutes agorootparentprevCan? It always has been :). We ran Lua for the entire core of a game in a 400kb preallocated on the PSP about 20 years ago. I know of many places that used it long before us. reply extrememacaroni 5 hours agorootparentprevThat's literally one of the main uses of luajit. reply snvzz 4 hours agoprevRISC-V is rapidly growing the strongest ecosystem. reply akira2501 43 minutes agoparentIt's the newest ecosystem.

So yes, frozen to 5.1 for the foreseeable future except for some features from more recent versions. reply matheusmoreira 54 minutes agorootparentI can't seem to find any information about this. What issues did LuaJIT maintainers have with upstream Lua? reply mardifoufs 28 minutes agorootparentThe issue linked in the sibling comment is the main one, but for a specific example of them having reservations about a feature in a more recent version, there's this: https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/issues/1013#issuecomment-16... reply edflsafoiewq 32 minutes agorootparentprevhttps://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/issues/929 reply upofadown 5 hours agoparentprevI think we can concede that there is a legitimate language fork here. I personally was not all that happy with the extent of the changes in 5.3. I would be just as happy at 5.1. reply tristan957 7 hours agoparentprevI believe it is mostly still the case, but some features from newer Lua revisions have been added. reply Alifatisk 6 hours agoprev [–] What's the deal with LuaJit? Why is it celebrated so much? I searched around a bit and they all talked about it being very fast, is that it? Performance? Also, adding support for risc-v is good news, well done! reply haberman 2 hours agoparentLuaJIT completely upended my view of what a JIT compiler could be. I always thought that JVM-like overheads were inevitable for high-performing JIT compilers. When I saw how small and low-overhead LuaJIT is, I was blown away. Here are some numbers: Lines of code: OpenJDK HotSpot (1.4M), LuaJIT: (92k) Binary size: OpenJDK HotSpot server/libjvm.so (24MB), LuaJIT: (576KB) Time to run \"Hello, World\": OpenJDK HotSpot (64ms), LuaJIT (3ms) (the JVM has improved here, it used to take hundreds of milliseconds) For me personally, LuaJIT's small size and low overheads set a new standard for what I expect from JIT compiled runtimes. I also find its small code base makes it approachable to learn from. I won't say that reading the code is easy, but I at least have confidence that whenever I have a question about fast interpreters or JIT compiling techniques, I can find the relevant part of the LuaJIT code and study it. Larger code bases can feel so sprawling that it's hard to ever find the snippet of code that will answer a question. reply wavemode 6 hours agoparentprevIt's widely regarded as a highly performant and very well-engineered runtime for a popular language. For a long time it was the go-to implementation you would reach for if you a) wanted lua scripting (common in game development) and b) wanted high performance. I think nowadays though, the landscape has changed quite a bit since when luajit was at its peak of popularity. a) Lua is not necessarily the language one would always choose for scripting, in the first place. There's lots and lots of scripting languages to choose from these days. (It's also increasingly common nowadays for indie gamedev to happen entirely within a game editor, like Unity or Unreal, which provide their own scripting systems. That fact alone has killed a lot of interest in lua.) b) If you do want to use lua, the features of the official implementation have progressed a lot since v5.1 (which luajit is pinned to), and its performance has improved over the years. c) There are other competing lua and lua-adjacent implementations to consider as well, like OpenResty's luajit2 or Roblox's Luau. reply wruza 4 hours agorootparentb) You don’t really need these features cause Luas 5.x are mostly rehashes of the ideas rather than successive versions. The team should have frozen it at 5.1, backport everything useful (yield across * basically) from 5.2 and call it done, only fixing bugs and tuning performance. That’s essentially what LuaJIT did/does. Instead the “upstream” has 4 versions of the same thing with ecosystem and codebases fragmented as a UK flag, for no good reason. LuaJIT fixes that by being awesome, but lives under the shadow of n+1 stereotype, despite being a true engineering project rather than a chain of experiments. Tbh I’m glad I left Lua world many years ago. reply synergy20 2 hours agorootparentThe integer and bitwise addition are pretty nice, lua5.2+ adds more complexity for luajit to upgrade and sync with, but for scripting I feel the new lua versions are great, still small, flexible and more powerful. other than games, lua is very important to embedded systems. reply mardifoufs 4 hours agorootparentprevI'm more familiar with luajit than Lua itself (as a project I mean). I'd be curious to know more about the fragmentation that vanilla Lua has. I know the issues that the luajit devs have with the features themselves but I wonder how and why those are decided and implemented. Is there an article or blog that goes into more details? Google isn't helping me here haha. reply sroussey 1 hour agoparentprevIt’s small size and fast performance means it can be implemented in a webserver (OpenResty’s luajit2.1) where you can write code that would tap into the TLS handshake and write a custom implementation (like connecting to a database of certificates because you serve 10s of millions of domains). reply pansa2 6 hours agoparentprev> is that it? Performance? Performance, size and compatibility. It's essentially a drop-in replacement for the stock Lua 5.1 implementation, with the same small size but with much higher performance. About the only downside compared to stock Lua 5.1 is that it's less portable. However, development of LuaJIT almost stopped ~10 years ago, and only seems to be picking up again recently. In terms of the language it hasn't kept up with all the changes in Lua 5.2, let alone 5.3 or 5.4. And in terms of implementation, its performance is still impressive but no longer best-in-class compared to other dynamic-language JITs (e.g. for JavaScript). reply edflsafoiewq 2 hours agoparentprevIt's also tiny (like half a meg compiled) and has some nice extensions, like one of the best FFIs in any language. reply wsc981 6 hours agoparentprevIt's used in LÖVE [0] (and LÖVR [1] as well, I think) for this very reason. The Lua code for a game will be quite performant. --- [0]: https://love2d.org [1]: https://lovr.org reply 3eb7988a1663 1 hour agorootparentAlso NeoVIM reply matheusmoreira 1 hour agoparentprev [–] Yes, performance. It got to the point that there are languages out there that compile to Lua or LuaJIT VM bytecode directly just to take advantage of the LuaJIT implementation. Apparently it's so good it spawned a separate language when the people at PUC-Rio started taking Lua in a direction that LuaJIT didn't want to follow. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
