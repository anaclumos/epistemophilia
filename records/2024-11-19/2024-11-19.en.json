Google now gets all of your browsing data, perfect for advertising. (If you ever doubt it, go check out Google Takeout. You'll be shocked at the amount of data you see there.) - They have special APIs and features that they get to use, and nobody else. Only because they own Chrome. [1] - They get to move forward with enabling and pushing features that allow for more advertising: see Manifest v3, FLoC. - Google specifically serves a worse version of Search on Firefox for Mobile. You have to get an extension to get the full experience. This isn't an isolated attempt. You can see more of the same thing with Android. - AOSP (the open source counterpart of Android) is now unusable. It doesn't ship with most essential apps, including a Phone app. In previous versions of Android, all of these were a part of AOSP. - Most third party launchers/stores struggle to implement features because they are only available for Google themselves. - The signing in with Google thing from above continues here too: you sign in to Google system-wide.

Here are more: - (jumping off of your second point...) Play Services does more than just handle stuff you sign into as a user -- it's also a dependency for everything from push notifications to screen casting. This actively poses issues building competing platforms, in that in order to give developers a path to shipping in your ecosystem you have to provide functioning alternatives to all of those ancillary features. The compatibility issue also impacts user adoption, and then the user adoption and the barren marketplace impact each other... Even the combined resources of Amazon and Microsoft weren't enough to overcome this. (Facebook did, but I'm also not sure forking the OS into a separate VR platform is necessarily the same thing.) - It also comes with integrity checking, so even if you do find a good third party image, and sideload Google packages, numerous things won't work unless you take part in a dumb arms race that ironically requires you to also root your device. By which I mean a feature that was originally built for banking applications is now used everywhere from streaming services (as an additional layer of DRM) to gacha games (for anti-cheat). This is actually the entire reason I dropped Pokemon Go, personally.

A very artificial arrangement where Google pay \"arms length browserco\" to maintain Chrome? reply throwaway2037 4 hours agorootparentYou raise some very important points. Specifically, this one: > browsers aren't really a self funding product I feel the same. I also feel the same about a modern C library and C compiler (and C++, if you like). They are essential to build any modern system and applications. Yet, those are also (mostly) no longer self-funding products. What do you think will happen if Google is forced to divest Chrome? reply wongarsu 2 hours agorootparentNetscape used to cost the equivalent of $100 inflation-adjusted dollars and was only forced to go free to compete with Internet Explorer. Now the genie can't be put back in the bottle, and anyone trying to sell you a browser would become irrelevant the same way Delphi's paid compiler lost out to free C compilers. Maybe you could carve out a niche that's willing to pay, the same way C# did before dotnet core. But for a mass product the best-case scenario would be something similar to today's Opera. However what it would do is open up the market to competition. Right now Google is spending a lot on Chrome development and Chrome advertisement. Opera and Edge both have given up on their own engines because they couldn't keep pace with Chrome development, and Firefox kept its engine but can't compete with Chrome's ad spend. If Chrome had to compete on a more even playing field there would be more room for diversity and competition. That could be a net positive, even if it makes Chrome worse. reply criddell 3 hours agorootparentprev> What do you think will happen if Google is forced to divest Chrome? The new Chrome company will struggle for a year or two then Apple will try to buy it but lose out after Oracle submits a higher bid. reply wongarsu 1 hour agorootparentOracle Chrome would remain free at first, but one year down the road all new versions would become free for home use but $50 per seat yearly for commercial use, with a clause that allows Oracle to enter your offices to audit your compliance at any time reply lenerdenator 58 minutes agorootparentprevIf the choice is no internet, forever, or giving Oracle money, I'm gonna live in 1990 from here on out. reply Suppafly 2 hours agorootparentprev>The new Chrome company will struggle for a year or two then Apple will try to buy it but lose out after Oracle submits a higher bid.

Mozilla is profitable too. But when Google is forced to stop paying browsers to use their search, it'll put Apple and Microsoft at an even wider advantage since they're the ones that can afford to push their own browsers at a loss... reply rileyphone 34 minutes agorootparentprevFirefox has made Mozilla billions over its lifetime by selling the default search engine rights to Yahoo and Google. Chrome, having a much greater user base, would demand a correspondingly higher fee (probably around $10b a year). Now, the other problem is there is no other search engine to compete with Google at that level, but that might change with independence of Chrome. reply baq 1 hour agorootparentprev> They are essential to build any modern system and applications.

My concern for a publicly owned utility is that the top talent won't want to work there. reply astrange 1 hour agorootparentMany of them have left Google (and competitors) and work for a consulting firm called Igalia that contributes to all browser engines. https://www.igalia.com/technology/browsers reply kergonath 16 minutes agorootparentprev> Currently, talented engineers flock to google to contribute their skills to making the best web browser. I don’t think these engineers have the right incentives, and their interest is not aligned with mine. I don’t really care what they do to Chrome and their efforts benefit me only indirectly. I am also not convinced by the \"best browser\" thing, even using it every day on my office computer. So, meh. I don’t care too much either way but I won’t lose anything if Google has to spin it off. reply marcyb5st 1 hour agorootparentprevThe way governments fuck up basically anything (with very few exceptions) IT related I would say no. Personal example: my name is Marcello and I had troubles applying for a permit online because names can't contain musical instruments (Cello in this case). Create a consortium or interested private entities but let's not give such an important piece of technology to governments where meritocracy is non-existent (also based on personal experiences). reply baq 59 minutes agorootparentI generally agree, I don't want this to be government-owned but since it can't be funded privately and is of great public value an utility-like contract would be in order. I don't see it happening with at least initially a stake from the government (maybe I'm wrong, will gladly be!) reply lenerdenator 55 minutes agorootparentprev> The way governments fuck up basically anything (with very few exceptions) IT related I would say no. Just wait until you have to justify IT expenditure to a for-profit corporation that isn't solely focused on technology. Government screws things up because it's (by design) slow. Business screws things up because f*ck your needs, we need to get a check to a retiree who never even worked here. reply lolinder 5 hours agorootparentprevAny potential buyer will have to be looking to use Chrome to accomplish the same kinds of synergies that Google is using it for, to get ahead in some adjacent market. Depending on the buyer that could be good for competition, at least in the short term, but it's not clear that it will be better for us as users. reply nfw2 47 minutes agorootparentHypothetically, why would some buyer using Chrome's monopoly to establish a market advantage in an adjacent domain be different than Google using Chrome's monopoly to establish a market advantage in an adjacent domain? reply niutech 7 hours agorootparentprevHow does splitting off Chrome as a separate company solve anything? They would still rely on Google for funding (like Mozilla) and being close friends they would do whatever Alphabet tells them to do. A better solution is to implement a bill like DMA in the EU to enforce competition among web browser vendors and fight monopolies. reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 15 minutes agorootparent> A better solution is to implement a bill Not that I disagree with the overall point, but this is something the DOJ does not do. They would just look at the current laws and decide who to prosecute based on their interpretation of events. reply verve_rat 5 hours agorootparentprevBut now Bing would have a chance of becoming the default search engine of the most used browser in the world. That's the difference. reply crazygringo 4 hours agorootparentBing is already the default search engine on the default browser of the most used OS in the world. If they're not competing well, then that's entirely their fault. Microsoft is not at any kind of disadvantage here. reply bee_rider 4 hours agorootparentI don’t think Bing is the default search engine for Android’s browser. I could be wrong though. Is it? That would be a surprisingly fair-minded move of Google. reply EasyMark 3 hours agorootparentBy context I’m pretty sure they mean Windows OS and not android, sometimes you have to take things in context. Depending on context one could easily argue that linux is the most common operating system depending on where you draw the line on operating system reply bee_rider 2 hours agorootparentI am pointing out that Windows is not the most common OS, and Android is. The original comment was saying that Google is able to perform anti-competitively because they control the most popular browser. The followup (which I responded to) is saying that the existence of Windows as the most popular OS, and Microsoft’s control over the default browser there, mitigates this anti-competitive potential. The fact that Windows is not the most popular OS (and that, in fact, the most popular OS is controlled by Google) undermines that argument. Linux is not the most popular OS in any context that includes doing searches with the thing, unless you include Android, but Android just uses Linux for the kernel mostly, and an OS is more than a kernel. reply nightski 1 hour agorootparentIt's the most common desktop OS. No one was confused by what the parent meant since Windows is not a mobile operating system and doesn't compete in that market. reply lukas099 34 minutes agorootparentI think it's fair for them to point out (however snarkily) that Windows is not the most popular OS. In the context of the discussion, I think it matters that there is another OS, Android, that is more popular. reply bee_rider 1 hour agorootparentprevBing and Google are competing in the market of search engines, not some device specific search engine market. reply echoangle 1 hour agorootparentprevEvery Linux distro just uses Linux for the kernel, right? What else is there? Init system and user space stuff isn’t Linux in any Linux distro either, because Linux is a kernel. The real thing that might make Android not a normal Linux distro is the heavy modification of the Kernel. reply bee_rider 1 hour agorootparentA Linux distro uses the Linux kernel by definition, I guess, so I think you are right about that. We could talk about distros in general, maybe Homebrew and Cygwin, if we didn’t want to define a distro as being a Linux distro. But I’m not sure what the point is. I’m not clear on what they meant by Linux. But if we use a definition of “Linux OS” that includes Android and is restricted to devices which people typically use to perform searches (aka consumer devices) (since that was the original topic), then Linux is mostly Android and it is a kind of pointless distinction to make. If we want to use some definition of Linux that precludes Android, and covers all devices that use the Linux kernel, then we have a bunch of servers, streaming boxes, smart lightbulbs, whatever. If we want to use a definition which is, like, what I think everyone means when they say Linux in the context of market share: GNU/Linux or BusyBox/other/Linux (I was hoping to avoid the GNU/Linux meme, but here we are), then that doesn’t have much market share. reply PittleyDunkin 6 hours agorootparentprevFrankly, who cares. The important part is that google doesn't own a browser. reply scarface_74 5 hours agorootparentIs the justice department then going to stop Google from using the open source Chromium project to create a new browser? reply PittleyDunkin 2 hours agorootparentIf they want to do their job? Yes. I expect there will be some material constraints that emerge in what browser features they're actually allowed to ship as shipping without a browser also seems to be anti-consumer. reply efitz 5 hours agorootparentprevAlmost certainly that would be part of a consent decree, which would prohibit Google from creating or controlling a browser for some period of time, and would include court supervision. reply kernal 1 hour agorootparentI find it hard to believe that any court could legally stop Google from developing a new browser if they were forced to sell Chrome. reply vundercind 13 minutes agorootparentAny court today? Maybe. Similar arrangements have been pretty common, though. reply scarface_74 5 hours agorootparentprevSo Google could also not ship a browser with Android devices? Chromebooks? reply placardloop 5 hours agorootparentSelling devices with a browser installed or available for installation is completely tangential to creating and/or controlling the development of said browser. reply scarface_74 2 hours agorootparentWould Google not be allowed to make any changes to the open source Chromium browser before installing it on its own hardware? reply kolinko 5 hours agorootparentprevYes. reply stavros 4 hours agorootparentprevYes, in the sense that me putting a gun to your head and ordering you to stay still isn't the same as me handcuffing you, because you can still physically move. reply binkHN 6 hours agorootparentprev> A very artificial arrangement where Google pay \"arms length browserco\" to maintain [a browser]? Sounds almost like Firefox. reply moffkalast 5 hours agorootparentGoogle to Mozilla: \"I'm gonna pay you 400M a year for antitrust to fuck off\" Seems like it didn't work though. reply wongarsu 2 hours agorootparentFirefox lost too much market share. And while some of that is due to bad leadership at Mozilla, Chrome running big advertising campaigns and Google advertising Chrome on their own properties (hints to download Chrome on Google Search, Drive, etc. when you visit with other browsers) were also a big driver. Google flew too close to the sun. reply binkHN 4 hours agorootparentprevMaybe it needed to be a cool billion. reply marcosdumay 3 hours agorootparentprevIt worked until they decided to unfairly compete with Firefox and get all the market share. reply maeil 2 hours agorootparentprev> browsers aren't really a self funding product They are, see how both Safari and Firefox, the 2nd and 3rd most popular browsers, have brought in tens of billions of revenue per year. Safari is immensely profitable, Firefox too would be if Mozilla wouldn't be run in an absurdly poor manner. > the user gains a huge amount of value by a browser being integrated into the OS, webviews in other applications, etc What is the huge value gain that e.g. Safari being integrated into MacOS is bringing me? Why couldn't webviews be backed by a browser of my choice? reply madeofpalk 1 hour agorootparent> Safari is immensely profitable The exact way Safari itself is immensely profitable is under scruity in this exact DOJ case! reply echoangle 1 hour agorootparentprevIn what way is Safari profitable? How is that even measured? Has any consumer in the last 10 years ever specifically paid for safari? Or do you mean the payments by google to be the default search engine? reply LgWoodenBadger 1 hour agorootparentIf Safari didn't exist, Google wouldn't be paying Apple ~$20-Billion a year to default Safari's search to Google reply echoangle 1 hour agorootparentWhy not though? Apple could still install Firefox and set Bing as the default search engine. Or even just Chrome, without selecting google. They don’t get the money for making a browser but configuring their browser in a specific way. That would work with any browser. reply lukas099 31 minutes agorootparentCan Apple force Mozilla to make Google the default browser in Firefox? reply astrange 1 hour agorootparentprevThat search isn't only in Safari, it's in the rest of the OS too via Spotlight. Similar for Windows. reply dismalaf 1 hour agorootparentprevMozilla literally gets paid by Google, and not sure how you can quantify Safari as being profitable on its own when it's the default for all Apple products and realistically, the only browser on iOS. reply fluidcruft 3 hours agorootparentprevSort of sounds like you are one step short of suggesting a browser is critical infrastructure. reply DeusExMachina 6 hours agorootparentprevThey could sell a lot of the data that Google now gets for free and uses for its ranking algorithms, like Clickstream sells data to SEO tools like AHrefs and SemRush. reply IX-103 5 hours agorootparentGoogle doesn't use Chrome data for Ads or Search. They're not allowed to based on the TOS, and also they have government regulators watching carefully to make sure they don't make a mistake like that. reply DeusExMachina 4 hours agorootparentA data leak from earlier this year suggested that they do, although there is no definitive proof. https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/31/24167119/google-search-al... reply placardloop 5 hours agorootparentprevThe regulators in question are pushing for divestiture of Chrome because they don’t believe that the current structure prevents using Chrome data, so it seems that Google did “make a mistake like that”. reply rawgabbit 3 hours agorootparentprevThe issue is who controls Chromium. I would create a non profit and staff it with a handful of maintainers. Their primary job would be to ensure safety and squash exploits. Their other job is to curate and approve pull requests from volunteers for enhancements. They should make it open source with the caveat if it is used for commercial purposes, there will be a licensing fee to pay for security enhancements, bug bounties, and the like. reply rollcat 2 minutes agorootparentSo more or less what Mozilla was supposed to be all along? reply kernal 1 hour agorootparentprevDo you think Google will continue to invest money and resources into the development of Chromium if they were forced to sell Chrome? I don't. The first thing I would do is close source the Chromium project and work on a new closed source browser to compete with Chrome. I also don't see Chrome surviving when all of the Google/Chromium developers have left. reply BeefySwain 6 hours agorootparentprev> browsers aren't really a self funding product Yeah... Because massive companies use them anti-competitively as a moat against other companies, and as a loss leader to enable massive data collection and vendor lock in. \"browsers aren't really a self funding product\" is a symptom of dysfunction, not the inevitable conclusion of a fair market. reply pjc50 4 hours agorootparentI'm not sure that software entirely obeys normal market theory. So much of it is zero-cost free. The synergistic effects are so strong that most users would prefer there to be The System, in which everything works together and there's no risk of incompatible choices. They don't necessarily care which system. The market in things like, say, file explorers is tiny. There's a few shell replacements (free), Midnight Commander and clones, and maybe over in the corner someone making a few thousand dollars a year from an Explorer replacement. reply marcosdumay 3 hours agorootparentprevWell, things with open source alternatives tend to fare badly when sold. reply eastbound 33 minutes agorootparentLike Jira vs Mantis? There are probably plenty of such examples. reply astrodust 1 hour agorootparentprevFirefox has made a mountain of money off of their tiny market share. Chrome as a company would instantly rake in billions. reply lofaszvanitt 7 hours agorootparentprevBrowsers should be developed by an intercountry nonprofit. Funded by all the countries' governments. reply homebrewer 6 hours agorootparentYou might have missed recent news about Linux maintainers being kicked off for reasons having nothing to do with Linux. This will not work across \"political borders\" because psychologically we're all still cavemen in need of a tribe to stick to, and a group of \"them\" to hate on. reply lofaszvanitt 6 hours agorootparentThat is your assumption. reply kube-system 4 hours agorootparentprevWe can't even get the world's governments to agree on what basic human rights are. reply dartos 7 hours agorootparentprevIt works out so well for the UN! reply marcosdumay 3 hours agorootparentprevYou can have country-specific nonprofits that cooperate; you can have consumer-rights nonprofits or free-speech nonprofits cooperating... The best thing about open source is that cooperating on it is very easy. reply water9 7 hours agorootparentprevProfit seems to be the biggest factor for efficiency reply PittleyDunkin 6 hours agorootparentProfit is, by definition, inefficiency. reply robertlagrant 4 hours agorootparentAt the end of the day every employee is the most granular bit of profit-making - I trade my time and zero money for money. 100% profit. If you removed the money you paid me could say you're being more efficient, but I don't know if that's a useful definition of efficient. Just as you could steal some raw materials and say you're being efficient. reply PittleyDunkin 2 hours agorootparentWell yes, if you find a way to generate value with no input costs, anything you charge people will be pure inefficiency and you'll be put out of \"business\" by the first person who gives this idea away for free. I'm not sure what sort of insight you can glean from this. reply madeofpalk 6 hours agorootparentprevIn what way? Google seems like the perfect example of profit obscuring inefficiency. reply thayne 1 hour agorootparentprevOnly in a highly competitive environment. But the browser market is not currently highly competitive. reply cyborgx7 6 hours agorootparentprevWhy is efficiency the guiding metric of our decision making? reply mrkramer 6 hours agoparentprevGoogle realized if they don't control the search distribution they gonna lose out sooner or later; which is kinda contradictory for them if they claim Google is the best search out there and that they are constantly improving it and that's why(they say), people choose it over other alternatives. But tbh distribution of your product/s is crucial. Just look at Microsoft and their internet strategy, they chose the other route; push their internet browser(IE) down their massive distribution pipe called Windows and then introducing their search engine to this massive userbase. Fortunately this didn't work out for them but unfortunately that worked out for Google. And now Google essentially controls the Web in the more than half of the world. reply Loic 5 hours agorootparent> Fortunately this didn't work out for them but unfortunately that worked out for Google. No, Google was better, then they used Chrome as an extremely powerful moat to protect their situation. Google at first was like magic compared to the Altavista of the time. reply adestefan 4 hours agorootparentIt wasn't just the search that was amazing. You would go to google.com and be presented with only a Google logo, 1 line input box, and 2 buttons. No portal, no news, no header, no login, no advertise with us, no punching monkeys. It was a refreshingly different take on the web at the time. reply sharpshadow 29 minutes agorootparentprevThat’s how I feel about Yandex lately. When it’s a struggle to find something on the common search engines, Yandex works like magic. It’s not that Yandex is particularly better in any way, it just chooses to not filter the content one is looking for. reply mrkramer 4 hours agorootparentprevYes but without Chrome, Google wouldn't have 90% search market share that they have today. They are completely dominating the WWW industry. reply pjc50 4 hours agorootparentI'm not convinced; early on they actually had a better product with better UI and better search results. reply thereddaikon 3 hours agorootparentGoogle won the search market on merit but they've maintained it with Chrome. Google search has been garbage for a long time and in the last few years it's gotten bad enough that even laymen are noticing it. reply bee_rider 4 hours agorootparentprevYeah. I have no data but my gut says, if anything, they couldn’t have gotten this bad at search without Chrome. reply jervant 4 hours agorootparentprevSurely making deals with companies like Apple and Mozilla to be the default search engine was a big part of building that market share. How many iPhone users bother to set a different search engine in Safari? reply attendant3446 1 hour agorootparentHow easy is it to set a different search engine in Safari (apart from a very few predefined options)? =) reply bee_rider 4 hours agorootparentprevIs that true? I seem to remember Google dominating search all the way back in 2010 (before Chrome really caught on). reply eastbound 27 minutes agorootparentprevWe all agree Google-the-search-engine is losing relevance (literally). So they should also lose their distribution channel, Chrome, because being nagged until you synchronize your Chrome profile and use their search engine is anti-competitive, on top of being pretentious from a less-relevant search engine. reply marcosdumay 3 hours agorootparentprevTBH, when Google did that, Apple was already threatening making it impossible for IOS users to use Google's services. reply madeofpalk 6 hours agoparentprevI don't disagree, but I'm also not sure what the alternative is. Who's going to buy Chrome that also doesn't suffer from the same anti-trust problems? Who would want to buy Chrome? Who would want to fund Chrome? What browser would Android ship? In one view I kind of like the idea that Google would have to shop around and 'buy' a browser for its OS (competition good!), but also that seems ridiculous and easy to fall right back into the same trap. reply coldpie 4 hours agorootparent> Who's going to buy Chrome that also doesn't suffer from the same anti-trust problems? Who would want to buy Chrome? Who would want to fund Chrome? Hmm. It's a good question, and I don't know the answer. I think there's a compelling argument that the problem is the scale of the harm. That is, even if the new owner has the same problems, the new owner won't also be the largest web company. So the problem still exists, yes, but becomes smaller. In particular having the #1 web browser strongly tied to the #1 web company has a lot of problematic dynamics that the #1 web browser being owned by the #25 web company doesn't. Maybe that company would be more open to forming beneficial relationships with the #2 and #3 web companies, for example. reply robertlagrant 4 hours agorootparentGoogle already funds Firefox and makes Chromium[0] as well, which seems like quite a lot of effort to go to as a single company in funding/enabling competition. Microsoft had to do far less to resolve their EU dispute: just give users other options for browsers on install of their OS. [0] Unless if today you take Chromium and make your own browser, and it still has all the stuff in about logins and tracking. reply madeofpalk 4 hours agorootparentWhen the DOJ asks to split off Chrome from Google, I presume that meant/included Chromium as well. They're basically the same thing. Why would Google continue to fund Chromium development without Chrome? reply snapcaster 6 hours agorootparentprevOpen source browsers already exist though reply madeofpalk 4 hours agorootparentWho pays for the development? Is the linux model viable for a browser? Open source browsers are either bad and non-competitive, or they're Firefox and still get criticism for being in the pocket of Google. reply PaulHoule 5 hours agorootparentprevMany forks of Chromium, yes. Most if the rest of them pass the “open source” test but would struggle on the “browser” side. reply whiplash451 5 hours agorootparentprevHow about this: sell the browser to the entreprise [1] and use the profit to offer the browser to the public for free, which in turns helps you secure a user base.

Every job that I worked in the last 10 years offers \"real\" Google Chrome on a Windows PC. I never considered that they would pay Google for it, but I guess Google could add a bunch of nice admin and security features that would be useful to mega-corps but retail normies don't care about. That is probably well-worth the 6 USD per month per user. In a modern corporate workplace, a huge amount of your day is spent using web apps... running in Google Chrome (or Electron!).

This is interesting question especially when companies are usually just use Chromium instead of creating new browser (not even making hard fork of Chromium). reply hodder 4 hours agorootparentprevThere doesn't have to be a buyer. They can spin it off as an independent company. Surely it can be a profitable enterprise on its own. reply madeofpalk 4 hours agorootparentSurely? I can't imagine Chrome by itself is a very profitable company.

The Google crawler is probably an even more effective tool in shaping the web standard. \"To be indexed by Google your page needs to comply with these requirements\" puts A LOT of pressure in everyone working in the web.

In my view it is, since you can't have a business or build connected hardware without an iOS app. And as for abusing that position for gaining market share, there are just too many examples starting with say, watches. reply ThePhysicist 8 hours agoparentApple doesn't have a similar position in any space though, or do they? In terms of market share they're not even the biggest player in the smartphone market, they sit below 20 % (the most profitable 20 % though). Google, in comparison, absolutely dominates the search and ad markets and sucks all oxygen out of them to keep any competition from springing up by controlling distribution and limiting choice. They e.g. paid vast amounts of money to Apple to make sure users don't get a free choice of search engine. If you wanted to compare the Apple Watch with this it would mean that Apple would make exclusive deals with all stores (online and IRL) selling watches so that consumers would only see Apple watches everywhere they go and would need to look in the basement or on an obscure subpage to find any watches from a different manufacturer. Clearly that's not the case. That said I'm not a fan of Apples walled garden either, I think this should be addressed (and in the EU it is being addressed).

If that's not a monopoly i don't know what is. reply ThePhysicist 7 hours agorootparentThe relevant market for them is smartphones and smartphone apps, and again, Apple doesn't have a monopoly there. Most markets have concentration effects and players that dominate the market to a certain degree, that doesn't automatically make them a monopolist, it depends on how they got there and what exactly they do to keep or build out their position in the market. By your definition Valve is a monopolist in the gaming market due to their size and dominance, but that's likely not true either. Anticompetitive behavior would be if they used their power to make it more difficult for people to buy Android phones e.g. by entering into exclusivity deals with cell service providers or electronics stores so that you could only find Apple products there (i.e. T-Mobile would only sell iPhones with their contracts and you wouldn't find any Android phones except in some small speciality shops out of town). That's what Google is doing in its markets among other things, i.e. pay tons of money to ensure all virtual store fronts are only stocked with Google products and everything else is hidden behind. Apple does of course show anti-competitive behavior to a degree, i.e. they purchase the entire production capacity of the most advanced semiconductor fabs to have exclusivity and preserve their edge, but again there are still other players in that market and competition still seems possible. If you want to compare that to what Google is doing in the search and ad space it would translate to them locking up almost all semiconductor suppliers in exclusivity contracts for 10 years so that no other company could ever build any advanced chips in large numbers. reply InsomniacL 6 hours agorootparent> The relevant market for them is smartphones and smartphone apps The relevant markets includes, but is not limited to that. > Anticompetitive behavior would be if they used their power to make it more difficult for people to buy Android phones Anti-competitive behaviour includes, but is not limited to that.

Amazon is genuinely not a bad monopoly (they have pushed down prices), but they are a terrible monopsony (basically destroying retailers that are not Chinese knockoffs), but monopsony protection laws are weak to non-existent world wide. 3. Apple - Apple is not a monopoly in nearly anything, which makes antitrust action against them very difficult. The EU has better laws around this, which has allowed them to force Apple to do the right thing in many cases (USB-C, opening up the App Store, although Apple complies in the worst ways possible, even though compliance has often been beneficial for them, like in the case of USB-C connectivity), but US laws are far too rigid to be able to really do much with them, as long as they are not monopolies. reply lesuorac 5 hours agorootparent> It’s hard to see where Amazon does anything to illegally use its monopoly Amazon literally uses the marketplace data to determine which products to make Amazon Basic versions of.

Changed the world. [4] People have a hard time remembering pre-iPhone days. Samsung literally copied the iPhone. A judge in South Korea, in Samsung's home jurisdiction even ruled that Samsung copied iPhone. Android would still be a failed camera operating system if it were for iPhone leading the way. * Kubernetes -- we lived just fine without it. * Chromium? Who cares. My life isn't any different with or without it. * Google Office? Aa cloud-based productivity suite? Nothing groundbreaking there, another competitor could have (and have) built the same thing. * Go programming language? Apple gave us Swift and Objective C -- languages that are used for software running on over a billion devices. Go is a niche language. If Go didn't exist, humanity wouldn't notice. We can have a difference of opinion on the relative merit of these details, but the idea that Google gave the _most_ to humanity is absolute nonsense. Amazon for example, empowered many small sellers around the world -- giving them access to a logistics network that would be impossible for a small business to recreate. Instead of selling on Main Street, sellers now can sell to literally any street in the world. I'm not the biggest fan an Amazon, however that being said, their contribution to humanity is enormous, especially in logistics. It has also changed publishing forever in ways that provide a significant benefit to independent authors -- many of whom have made careers out of self-publishing because of Amazon. I'm not a fan of Microsoft, but their contribution to humanity is undeniable. Excel is probably the most important piece of software ever written. I'm sure others can expand on Microsoft's contributions to humanity.

Without the extra capital none of the attempts would have happened. reply shakna 9 hours agorootparentI'm not sure I agree with you on innovation. One of the largest drivers of innovation, historically, has been war and desperation. In those circumstances, you generally can't afford to lose. So the idea of innovation needing the comfort of a soft landing doesn't really seem to fit reality. reply SpEd3Y 9 hours agorootparentI agree that war pushes innovation the most, but I assume you don't want humanity to be in constant state of war. So how do you get innovation in peace time? I would argue if you're in a very competitive market and you're margins are 1-2% you cannot afford to go for innovation. Bell Labs which arguably is one of the most innovative places in peace time was the result of the AT&T monopoly. Most innovation comes out of monopolies or excess capital in peace time. reply consteval 3 hours agorootparentPersonally, I think you have it backwards, hard competition breeds innovation. Large companies don't have to innovate so they don't. They coast, sometimes going many decades between major innovations. For example, Google doesn't have to change Chrome in any meaningful way to maintain (or even grow) it's market share. So, they don't. Browsers haven't changed much in a good decade and a half. That money is much better spent on marketing. reply sebstefan 6 hours agorootparentprevI'm still missing it We're not in a perfect competition environment ; profits are not to 0.

Microsoft gave us (counting only OSS and things they effectively gave away): 1. Microsoft Basic, the first language of a large number of developers in the 35+ age group. This was effectively given away which is part of why it was so popular (it was a small, fixed-price fee instead of the per-unit licensing) 2. TypeScript 3. C# and the CLR 4. Visual Studio Code 5. Since 2010 they've made large contributions to Open Source. Commercially they've also been strong competition to enterprise players like Oracle and IBM and of course have done a huge amount for gaming. Apple are narcissists, they're all take take take. They do, however, provide very strong competition which pushes other players to improve. reply SpEd3Y 9 hours agorootparentI agree. Love C#, VS Code and TypeScript. Microsoft changed a bit lately. But there's a lot of history with Microsoft and the recent CoPilot ripping off OSS code and blocking C# support in VS Code are still mudding the waters. reply Tepix 9 hours agoparentprevAll of these companies provide values, that's why they are so successful. In particular (as opposed to Google), Apple is giving us products where the user isn't just an entity that you try to get as much data from as you can.

It sounds like the end goal of this is to enrich other companies, not customers. And if the DOJ has their way, they want to crack open Google's vault of customer data and propagate it across the internet.

If Safari had Chrome’s market share and was throwing their weight around like Google does and Microsoft did with IE, it’d be the same argument and I’d also personally support forcing them to divest it. reply legitster 19 hours agorootparentSafari is the #2 browser behind Chrome. It's about 55% to 30%, so while Chrome has a larger market share, it's not an order of magnitude larger.

Llama 3.1 405B on Cerebras is by far the fastest frontier model in the world – 12x faster than GPT-4o and 18x faster than Claude 3.5 Sonnet. In addition, we achieved the highest performance at 128K context length and shortest time-to-first-token latency, as measured by Artificial Analysis. Llama 3.1 405B on Cerebras Inference highlights: 969 output tokens per second – 12x faster than best GPU result 240ms time to first token – a fraction of most APIs 128K context length support – highest recorded performance 16-bit weights – full model accuracy Q1 general availability at $6/M input tokens and $12/M output tokens Frontier AI at Instant Speed This year Cerebras pushed Llama 3.1 8B and 70B to over 2,000 tokens/s, but frontier models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3.1 405B have never exceeded 200 tokens/s on any GPU, ASIC, or cloud. As a result, developers have had to choose between second tier models that run fast or frontier models that run slow. Cerebras Inference fixes this. Responding to a customer request to show Llama 3.1 405B on Cerebras Inference at full 128K context, we deployed a instance that broke every record in output speed, long context performance, and time-to-first-token as measured by Artificial Analysis. Cerebras Inference generated 969 output tokens/s when given a 1,000 token prompt. This is the first time a frontier model is running at instant speed, allowing entire pages of text, code, and math to be complete in a flash. This result was 8x faster than SambaNova, 12x faster than the fastest GPU cloud, and 75x faster than AWS. When the input prompt was extended to 100,000 tokens, only six vendors returned a result with Cerebras being the only non-GPU vendor to complete the benchmark. Cerebras achieved 539 tokens/s – 11x faster than Fireworks and 44x faster than AWS. Best-in-Class Latency Time-to-first-token is perhaps the most important metric for real-world applications – it’s what users actually experience when interacting with AI. At just 240 milliseconds, Cerebras delivers the fastest time-to-first-token of any platform running Llama 3.1-405B. This is a fraction of what users experience with GPU-based solutions, where initial response times can stretch into seconds. The impact is dramatic: customers switching from GPT-4 to Cerebras Inference report a 75% drop in total latency, dramatically improving the user experience for voice and video AI applications where real-time interaction is crucial. Availability Cerebras Inference for Llama 3.1-405B is available in customer trials today, with general availability coming in Q1 2025. Pricing is $6 per million input tokens and $12 per million output tokens. Our output price is 20% lower than AWS, Azure, and GCP. Open Models Are the Fastest Models We’re proud to contribute to the Llama ecosystem and the broader open source AI movement. Thanks to the combination of Meta’s open approach and Cerebras’s breakthrough inference technology, Llama 3.1-405B now runs more than 10 times faster than closed frontier models, making it the perfect foundation for voice, video, and reasoning applications where minimal latency and maximum reasoning steps are crucial. Stay tuned for more exciting updates as we push the frontier of instant AI. James Wang Author posts Prev Next",

I’m struggling to get over 100 tok/s on my own Llama 3.1 70b implementation on an 8x H100 cluster. I’m curious how they’re doing it. Obviously the standard bag of tricks (eg, speculative decoding, flash attention) won’t get you close. It seems like at a minimum you’d have to do multi-node inference and maybe some kind of sparse attention mechanism? reply danpalmer 16 hours agoparentCerebras makes CPUs with ~1 million cores, and they're inferring on that not on GPUs. It's an entirely different architecture which means no network involved. It's possible they're doing this significantly from CPU caches rather than HBM as well. I recommend the TechTechPotato YouTube videos on Cerebras to understand more of their chip design. reply swyx 16 hours agorootparent> TechTechPotato YouTube videos on Cerebras https://www.youtube.com/@TechTechPotato/search?query=cerebra... for anyone also looking. there are quite a lot of them. reply accrual 15 hours agorootparentprevI hope we can buy Cerebras cards one day. Imagine buying a ~$500 AI card for your desktop and having easy access to 70B+ models (the price is speculative/made up). reply danpalmer 14 hours agorootparentI believe pricing was mid 6 figures per machine. They're also like 8U and water cooled I believe. I doubt it would be possible to deploy one outside of a fairly top tier colo facility where they have the ability to support water cooling. Also imagine learning a new CUDA but that is designed for another completely different compute model. reply trsohmers 12 hours agorootparentBased on their S1 filing and public statements, the average cost per WSE system for their (~90% of their total revenue) largest customer is ~$1.36M, and I’ve heard “retail” pricing of $2.5M per system. They are also 15U and due to power and additional support equipment take up an entire rack. The other thing people don’t seem to be getting in this thread that just to hold the weights for 405B at FP16 requires 19 of their systems since it is SRAM only… rounding up to 20 to account for program code + KV cache for the user context would mean 20 systems/racks, so well over $20M. The full rack (including support equipment) also consumes 23kW, so we are talking nearly half a megawatt and ~$30M for them to be getting this performance on Llama 405B reply danpalmer 12 hours agorootparentThank you, far better answer than mine! Those are indeed wild numbers, although interestingly \"only\" 23kw, I'd expect the same level of compute in GPUs to be quite a lot more than that, or at least higher power density. reply YetAnotherNick 12 hours agorootparentYou get ~400TFLOP/s in H100 for 350W. You need (2 * token/s * param count) FLOP/s. For 405b, 969tok/s you just need 784 TFLOP/s which is just 2 H100s. The limiting factor with GPU for inference is memory bandwidth. For 969 tok/s in int8, you need 392 TB/s memory bandwidth or 200 H100s. reply latchkey 7 hours agorootparentMemory bandwidth and memory size. Along with power/cooling density. Hence why you see AMD's MI325x coming out with 256GB HBM3e, but it is the same FLOPs as a 300x. 6TB/s too, which outperforms H200's, by a lot. You can see the direction AMD is going with this... https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/... reply Const-me 6 hours agorootparentprev> For 969 tok/s in int8, you need 392 TB/s memory bandwidth I think that math is only valid for batch size = 1. When these 969 tokens/second come from multiple sessions of the same batch, loaded model tensor elements are reused to compute many tokens for the entire batch. With large enough batches, you can even saturate compute throughput of the GPU instead of bottlenecking on memory bandwidth. reply meowface 10 hours agorootparentprevThank you for the breakdown. Bit of an emotional journey. \"$500 in the future...?

Have power requirements per operation been coming down rapidly, as other features have improved? My recollection from PC CPUs is that we've gotten many more operations per second, and many more operations per second per dollar, but that the power and corresponding cooling requirements for the CPUs have tended to go up as well. I don't really know what power per operation has looked like there. (I guess it's clearly improved, though, because it seems like the power consumption of a desktop PC has only increased by a single order of magnitude, while the computational capacity has increased by more than that.) A reason that I wonder about this in this context is that people are saying that the power and cooling requirements for these devices are currently enormous (by individual or hobbyist standards, not by data center standards!). If we imagine a Moore's Law-style improvement where the hardware itself becomes 1/10 or 1/100 of its current price, would we expect the overall power consumption to be similarly reduced, or to remain closer to its current levels? reply chaxor 11 hours agorootparentMooers law in the consumer space seems to be pretty much asymptoting now, as indicated by Apple's amazing Macbooks with an astounding 8GB of RAM. Data center compute is arguable, as it tends to be catered to some niche, making it confusing (cerebras as an example vs GPU datacenters vs more standard HPC). Also Clusters and even GPUs don't really fit in to Mooers law as originally framed. reply saagarjha 10 hours agorootparentApple doesn’t sell those anymore. reply chaxor 3 hours agorootparentAw man, are they selling only 4GB ones now? More seriously, even 16GB was essentially the 'norm' in consumer PCs about 15 years ago. reply dgfl 9 hours agorootparentprevNot really. These are wafer-scale chips, which (as far as I'm aware) were first introduced by Cerebras. Cost reduction for cutting-edge products in the semiconductor industry has historically been driven by 1) reducing transistor size (by following the Dennard scaling laws), and 2) a variety of techniques (e.g. high-k dielectrics and strained silicon, or FinFETs and now GAAFETs) to improve transistor performance further. These techniques added more steps during manufacturing, but they were inexpensive enough that they allowed to reduce $/transistor still. In the last few years, we've had to pull off ever more expensive tricks which stopped the $/transistor progress. This is why the phrase \"Moore's law is dead\" has been circulating for a while. In any case, higher performance transistors means that you can get the same functionality for less power and a smaller area, meaning that iso-functionality chips are cheaper to build in bulk. This is especially true for older nodes, e.g. look at the absurdly low price of most microcontrollers. On the other hand, $/wafer is mostly a volume-related metric based on less scalable technology and more conventional manufacturing (relatively speaking). Cerebra's innovation was in making a wafer-scale chip possible, which is conventionally hard due to unavoidable manufacturing defects. But crucially, such a product (by definition) cannot scale like any other circuit produced so far. It may for sure drop in price in the future, especially once it gets obsolete. But I don't expect it to ever reach consumer level prices. reply adrian_b 7 hours agorootparentWafer-scale chips have been attempted for many decades, but none of the previous attempts before Cerebras has resulted in a successful commercial product. The main reason why Cerebras has succeeded and the previous attempts have failed is not technical, but the existence of market demand. Before ML/AI training and inference, there has been no application where wafer-scale chips could provide enough additional performance to make their high cost worthwhile. reply dheera 11 hours agorootparentprevIt will also mean 405B models will be uninteresting in 3 to 5 years if we follow the curve we've been on for the past decades. reply int_19h 9 hours agorootparentI don't think they'll be uninteresting. They won't be cutting-edge anymore, sure, but much of the more practical applications of AI that we see today don't run on today's cutting-edge models, either. We're always going to have a certain compute budget, and if a smaller model does the job fine, why wouldn't you use it, and use the rest for something else (or use all of it to run the smaller model faster). reply initplus 12 hours agorootparentprevYeah you can see the cooling requirements by looking at their product images. https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cerebras_Prod... Thing is nearly all cooling. And look at the diameter on the water cooling pipes. Airflow guides on the fans are solid steel. Apparently the chip itself measures 21.5cm^2.

The Cerebras chip is fast because they use 700x more SRAM than, say, A100 GPUs. Loading the whole model in SRAM every time you compute one token is the expensive bit. reply killingtime74 15 hours agorootparentprevMaybe not $500, but $500,000 reply zackangelo 16 hours agorootparentprevAh, makes a lot more sense now. reply StrangeDoctor 15 hours agorootparentalso the WSE3 pulls 15kw. https://www.eetimes.com/cerebras-third-gen-wafer-scale-chip-... but 8x h100 are ~2.6-5.2kw (I get conflicting info, I think based on pice vs smx) so anywhere between roughly even and up to 2x efficient. reply parsimo2010 16 hours agoparentprevThey are doing it with custom silicon with several times more area than 8x H100s. I’m sure they are doing some sort of optimization at execution/runtime, but the primary difference is the sheer transistor count. https://cerebras.ai/product-chip/ reply coder543 16 hours agorootparentTo be specific, a single WSE-3 has the same die area as about 57 H100s. It's a big chip. reply cma 15 hours agorootparentIt is worth splitting out the stacked memory silicon layers on both too (if Cerebras is set up with external DRAM memory). HBM is over 10 layers now so the die area is a good bit more than the chip area, but different process nodes are involved. reply tomrod 13 hours agorootparentprevAmazing! reply simonw 14 hours agoparentprevThey have a chip the size of a dinner plate.

Can push the whole internet over that chip xD reply why_only_15 12 hours agorootparentThe number for that is I believe 1 terabit or 125GB/s -- 21 petabytes is the speed from the SRAM (~registers) to the cores (~ALU) for the whole chip. It's not especially impressive for SRAM speeds. The impressive thing is that they have an enormous amount of SRAM reply KeplerBoy 11 hours agorootparentprevThat's their on chip cache bandwidth. Usually that stuff isn't even measured in bandwidth but latency. reply pram 14 hours agorootparentprevI'd love to see the heatsink for this lol reply futureshock 13 hours agorootparentThey call it the “engine block”! https://www.servethehome.com/a-cerebras-cs-2-engine-block-ba... reply ekianjo 12 hours agorootparentprevwhat kind of yield do they get on that size? reply petra 12 hours agorootparentPart of their technology is managing/bypassing defects. reply bufferoverflow 12 hours agorootparentprevIt's near 100%. Discussed here: https://youtu.be/f4Dly8I8lMY?t=95 reply modeless 16 hours agoparentprevCerebras is a chip company. They are not using GPUs. Their chip uses wafer scale integration which means it's the physical size of a whole wafer, dozens of GPUs in one. They have limited memory on chip (all SRAM) and it's not clear how much HBM bandwidth they have per wafer. It's a completely different optimization problem than running on GPU clusters. reply why_only_15 11 hours agorootparentthey have about 125GB/s of off-chip bandwidth reply saagarjha 11 hours agorootparentDo they just not do HBM at all or reply why_only_15 6 hours agorootparentI'm not too up to date but as I recall there are a lot of weirdnesses because of how big their chip is (e.g. thermal expansion being a problem). I believe they have a single giant line in the middle of the chip for this reason. maybe this makes HBM etc. hard? certainly their chip would be more appealing if they cut down the # of cores by 10x, added matrix units and added HBM but looks like they're not going to go this way. reply boroboro4 15 hours agoparentprevThere are two big tricks: their chips are enormous, and they use sram as their memory, which is vastly faster than hbm ram being used by GPUs. In fact this is main reason it’s so fast. Groq has the speed because of the same reason. reply yalok 16 hours agoparentprevhow much memory do you need to run fp8 llama 3 70b - can it potentially fit 1 H100 GPU with 96GB RAM? In other words, if you wanted to run 8 separate 70b models on your cluster, each of which would fit into 1 GPU, how much larger your overall token output could be than parallelizing 1 model per 8 GPUs and having things slowed down a bit due to NVLink? reply zackangelo 16 hours agorootparentIt’s been a minute so my memory might be off but I think when I ran 70b at fp16 it just barely fit on a 2x A100 80GB cluster but quickly OOMed as the context/kv cache grew. So if I had to guess a 96GB H100 could probably run it at fp8 as long as you didn’t need a big context window. If you’re doing speculative decoding it probably won’t fit because you also need weights and kv cache for the draft model. reply qingcharles 14 hours agorootparentprevIt should work, I believe. And anything that doesn't fit you can leave on your system RAM. Looks like an H100 runs about $30K online for one. Are there any issues with just sticking one of these in a stock desktop PC and running llama.cpp? reply joha4270 11 hours agorootparent> Are there any issues with just sticking one of these in a stock desktop PC and running llama.cpp? Cooling might be a challenge. The H100 has a heatsink designed to make use of the case fans. So you need a fairly high airflow through a part which is itself passive. On a server this isn't too big a problem, you have fans in one end and GPU's blocking the exit on the other end, but in a desktop you probably need to get creative with cardboard/3d printed shrouds to force enough air through it. reply mikewarot 12 hours agoparentprevImagine if you could take Llama 3.1 405B and break it down to a tree of logical gates, optimizing out all the things like multiplies by 0 in one of the bits, etc... then load it into a massive FPGA like chip that had no von Neumann bottleneck, was just pure compute without memory access latency with a conservative 1 Ghz clock rate. Such a system would be limited by the latency across the reported 126 layers worth of math involved, before it could generate the next token, which might be as much as 100 uSec. So it would be 10x faster, but you could have thousands of other independent streams pipelined through in parallel because you'd get a token per clock cycle out the end. In summary, 1 Gigatoken/second, divided into 100,000 separate users each getting 10k tokens/second. This is the future I want to build. reply jacobgorm 8 hours agorootparentSee Convolutional Differentiable Logic Gate Networks https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04732 , which is a small step in that direction. reply seangrogg 8 hours agorootparentprevI'm actively trying to learn how to do exactly this, though I'm just getting started with FPGAs now so probably a very long range goal. reply mmaunder 15 hours agoparentprevNah. Try vLLM and 405B FP8 on that hardware. And make sure you’re benchmarking with some concurrency for max TPS. reply hendler 14 hours agoparentprevCheck out BaseTen for performant use of GPUs reply danpalmer 16 hours agoprevI'm not sure if they're comparing apples to apples on the latency here. There are roughly three parts to the latency: the throughput of the context/prompt, the time spent queueing for hardware access, and the other standard API overheads (network, etc). From what I understand, several, maybe all, of the comparison services are not based on provisioned capacity, which means that the measurements include the queue time. For LLMs this can be significant. The Cerebras number on the other hand almost certainly doesn't have some unbounded amount of queue time included, as I expect they had guaranteed hardware access. The throughput here is amazing, but to get that throughput at a good latency for end-users means over-provisioning, and it's unclear what queueing will do to this. Additionally, does that latency depend on the machine being ready with the model, or does that include loading the model if necessary? If using a fine-tuned model does this change the latency? I'm sure it's a clear win for batch workloads where you can keep Cerebras machines running at 100% utilisation and get 1k tokens/s constantly. reply qeternity 15 hours agoparentEveryone presumes this is under ideal conditions...and it's incredible. It's bs=1. At 1,000 t/s. Of a 405B parameter model. Wild. reply danpalmer 14 hours agorootparentCerebras' benchmark is most likely under ideal conditions, but I'm not sure it's possible to test public cloud APIs under ideal conditions as it's shared infrastructure so you just don't know if a request is \"ideal\". I think you can only test these things across significant numbers of requests, and that still assumes that shared resource usage doesn't change much. reply qeternity 14 hours agorootparentI'm not talking about that. I and many others here have spun up 8x or more H100 clusters and run this exact model. Zero other traffic.

Zero other traffic. You won't come anywhere close to this. 8x H100 can also do fine tuning right? Does Cerebras offer fine tuning support? reply danpalmer 13 hours agorootparentprevIn that case I'm misunderstanding you. Are you saying that it's \"BS\" that they are reaching ~1k tokens/s? If so, you may be misunderstanding what a Cerebras machine is. Also 8xH100 is still ~half the price of a single Cerebras machine, and that's even accounting for H100s being massively over priced. You've got easily twice the value in a Cerebras machine, they have nearly 1m cores on a single die. reply sam_dam_gai 12 hours agorootparentHa ha. He probably means ”at a batch size of 1”, i.e. not even using some amortization tricks to get better numbers. reply danpalmer 12 hours agorootparentAh! That does make more sense! reply colordrops 15 hours agorootparentprevRight, I'd assume most LLM benchmarks are run on dedicated hardware. reply LASR 16 hours agoprevWhat you can do with current-gen models, along with RAG, multi-agent & code interpreters, the wall is very much model latency, and not accuracy any more.

The \"Chain of Thought\" tools become way more useful when you can get when you can iterate 100x faster. Right now, flagship LLMs stream responses back, and barely beat the speed a human can read, so adding CoT makes it really slow for human-in-the-loop experiences. You can really get a lot more interesting \"thoughts\" (or workflow steps, or whatever) when it can do more, without slowing down the human experience of using the tool. You can also get a lot fancier with tool-usage when you can start getting an LLM to use and reply to tools at a speed closer to the speed of a normal network service. I've never timed it, but I'm guessing current LLMs don't handle \"live video\" type applications well. Imagine an LLM you could actually video chat with - it'd be useful for walking someone through a procedure, or advanced automation of GUI applications, etc. AND the holy-grail of AI applications that would combine all of this - Robotics. Today, Cerebras chips are probably too power hungry for battery powered robotic assistants, but one could imagine a Star-Wars style robot assistant many years from now. You can have a robot that can navigate some space (home setting, or work setting) and it can see its environment and behavior, processing the video in real-time. Then, can reason about the world and its given task, by explicitly thinking through steps, and critically self-challenging the steps. reply manmal 6 hours agorootparent> barely beat the speed a human can read 4o is way faster than a human can read. reply davidfiala 14 hours agorootparentprevImagine increasing the quality and FPS of those AI-generated minecraft clones and experiencing even more high-quality, realtime AI-generated gameplay (yeah, I know they are doing textual tokens. but just sayin..) edit: context is https://oasisaiminecraft.com/ reply sumedh 8 hours agoprevThey have a waitlist for trying their API.

There are two pieces to this: improving efficiency and improving flops. Improving flops is the most obvious way to improve speed, but I think we're pretty close to physical limits for a given process node and datatype precision. It's hard to give proof positive of this, but there are a few lines of evidence. One is that the fundamental operation of LLMs, matrix multiplications, are really simple (unlike e.g. CPU work) and so all the e.g. control flow logic is pretty minimized. We're largely spending electricity on doing the matrix multiplications themselves, and the matrix multiplications are in fact electricity-bound[1]. There are gains to be made by changing precision, but this is difficult and we're close to tapped out on it in my opinion (already very low precisions (fp8 can't represent 17), new research showing limitations). Efficiency in LLM training is measured with a very punishing standard, \"Model Flops Utilization\" (MFU), where we divide the theoretical number of flops the hardware could provide with the theoretical number of flops necessary to implement the mathematical operation. We're able to get 30% without thinking (just FSDP) and 50-60% are not implausible/unheard of. The inefficiency is largely because 1) the hardware can't provide the number of flops it says on the tin for various reasons and 2) we have to synchronize terabytes of data across tens of thousands of machines. The theoretical limit here is 2x but in practice there's not a ton to eke out here. There will be gains but they will be mostly focused on reducing NVIDIA's margin (TPU), on improving process node, on reducing datatype (B100), or on enlarging the size of a chip to reduce costly cross-chip communication (B100). There's not room for a 10x (again at constant precision and process node).

    "originBody": "Science How Scientific American's Departing Editor Helped Degrade Science When magazines like Scientific American are run by ideologues producing biased dreck, it only makes it more difficult to defend the institution of science itself. Jesse Singal11.18.2024 2:54 PM Share on FacebookShare on XShare on RedditShare by emailPrint friendly versionCopy page URL Media Contact & Reprint Requests (Illustration: Lex Villena) Earlier this week, Laura Helmuth resigned as editor in chief of Scientific American, the oldest continuously published magazine in the United States. \"I've decided to leave Scientific American after an exciting 4.5 years as editor in chief,\" she wrote on Bluesky. \"I'm going to take some time to think about what comes next (and go birdwatching), but for now I'd like to share a very small sample of the work I've been so proud to support (thread).\" Helmuth may in fact have been itching to spend more time bird watching—who wouldn't be?—but it seems likely that her departure was precipitated by a bilious Bluesky rant she posted after Donald Trump was reelected. In it, she accused her generation, Generation X, of being \"full of fucking fascists,\" complained about how sexist and racist her home state of Indiana was, and so on. \"Fuck them to the moon and back,\" she said of the dumb high school bullies supposedly celebrating Trump's victory. Whether or not Helmuth's resignation was voluntary, it should go without saying that a few bad social media posts should not end someone's job. If that were the whole story here—an otherwise well-performing editor was ousted over a few bad posts—this would arguably be a case of \"cancel culture,\" or whatever we're calling it these days. But Helmuth's posts were symptoms of a much larger problem with her reign as editor. They accurately reflected the political agenda she brought with her when she came on as EiC at SciAm—a political agenda that has turned the once-respected magazine into a frequent laughingstock. Sometimes, yes, SciAm still acts like the leading popular science magazine it used to be—a magazine, I should add, that I received in print form every month during my childhood. But increasingly, during Helmuth's tenure, SciAm seemed a bit more like a marketing firm dedicated to churning out borderline-unreadable press releases for the day's social justice cause du jour. In the process, SciAm played a small but important role in the self-immolation of scientific authority—a terrible event whose fallout we'll be living with for a long time. When Scientific American was bad under Helmuth, it was really bad. For example, did you know that \"Denial of Evolution Is a Form of White Supremacy\"? Or that the normal distribution—a vital and basic statistical concept—is inherently suspect? No, really: Three days after the legendary biologist and author E.O. Wilson died, SciAm published a surreal hit piece about him in which the author lamented \"his dangerous ideas on what factors influence human behavior.\" That author also explained that \"the so-called normal distribution of statistics assumes that there are default humans who serve as the standard that the rest of us can be accurately measured against.\" But the normal distribution doesn't make any such value judgments, and only someone lacking in basic education about stats—someone who definitely shouldn't be writing about the subject for a top magazine—could make such a claim. Some of the magazine's Helmuth-era output made the posthumous drive-by against Wilson look Pulitzer-worthy by comparison. Perhaps the most infamous entry in this oeuvre came in September 2021: \"Why the Term 'JEDI' Is Problematic for Describing Programs That Promote Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion.\" That article sternly informed readers that an acronym many of them had likely never heard of in the first place—JEDI, standing for \"justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion\"—ought to be avoided on social justice grounds. You see, in the Star Wars franchise, the Jedi \"are a religious order of intergalactic police-monks, prone to (white) saviorism and toxically masculine approaches to conflict resolution (violent duels with phallic lightsabers, gaslighting by means of \"Jedi mind tricks,\" etc.)\" You probably think I'm trolling or being trolled. There's no way that actual sentence got published in Scientific American, right? No, it's very real. But what really caught my eye was SciAm's coverage of the youth gender medicine debate. This is one of the few scientific subjects on which I've established a modicum of expertise: I've written articles about it for major outlets like The Atlantic and The Economist, and am working on a book. I found SciAm's coverage to not just be stupid (JEDI) or insulting or uncharitable (the Wilson story), but actually a little bit dangerous. I know, I know: We're not supposed to call mere words \"dangerous.\" Hear me out: The evidence for youth gender medicine—blockers, hormones, and (sometimes) surgery for minors to treat their gender dysphoria—is scant. We really don't know which treatments help which kids in which situations. Every major government or government-backed effort to look into this question, most recently the U.K.'s Cass Review, has come to this conclusion. The supposed leading professional organization, WPATH, is mired in scandal, with evidence from court cases strongly suggesting it has suppressed negative research results. One of the leading clinicians and researchers in the country admitted to The New York Times that she and her team suppressed negative research results (not the first time, I don't think). Rather than cover these important developments, Scientific American has hermetically sealed itself and its readers inside a comforting, delusional cocoon in which we know youth gender medicine works, beyond a shadow of a doubt, and only bigots and ignoramuses suggest otherwise. Over and over, SciAm simply took what certain activist groups were saying about these treatments and repeated it, basically verbatim, effectively laundering medical misinformation and providing it with the imprimatur of a highly regarded science magazine. This was a chronic problem at Scientific American. One article, to which I wrote a rebuttal for my newsletter, contained countless errors and misinterpretations: Most importantly, it falsely claimed that there is solid evidence youth gender medicine ameliorates adolescent suicidality, when we absolutely do not know that to any degree of certainty. As far as I can tell, every article SciAm published on this subject during Helmuth's tenure followed the exact same playbook of reciting activist claims — often long after they'd been debunked. Some of these articles might have done serious damage to the public's understanding of this issue. For example, SciAm ran a response to the Cass Review written by a pair of writers who were somehow able to issue a searing critique of the review despite having clearly never read it. They wrote that the document's problems \"help explain why the Cass recommendations differ from previous academic reviews and expert guidance from major medical organisations such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and the American Academy of Pediatrics.\" But part of the Cass Review's remit was to evaluate the strength of these exact pieces of expert guidance—the Cass Review explicitly explains why the WPATH and AAP guidelines are weak and untrustworthy. Anyone who read the document would have understood that. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the Cass Review argued that the WPATH and AAP guidelines were shoddily constructed, and SciAm published a response accusing the Cass Review of differing from the WPATH and AAP guidelines. That's the sort of error that can only occur in the context of lax editorial standards married to ideological certitude. People trust Scientific American. It's not out of the question that parents of trans or gender-questioning kids, who are (unfortunately) more likely to get their information on this subject from media outlets than from carefully conducted efforts like the Cass Review, will \"learn\" from SciAm that blockers and hormones are safe, effective, and likely to reduce suicidality—even as the jury is still out on all these claims. This false belief could prove disastrous for obvious reasons, and yet SciAm has had no qualms about spreading what can only be described as medical misinformation on this subject—something it decries when the sources and claims in question are right-coded. To be sure, Scientific American was not alone in its abysmal coverage of the youth gender medicine debate. The popular science show Science Vs, which bills itself as a swashbuckling effort to cut through politics and get to the truth of scientific controversy, repeatedly debased itself on this subject, and CNN took such a hard turn toward propaganda on gender medicine that it recycled the same false passage about the supposedly strong evidence base for youth gender medicine in dozens of its articles. The crisis of expert authority has many causes. But one of them is experts mortgaging their own credibility. When magazines like Scientific American are run by ideologues like Helmuth, producing biased dreck as a result, it only makes it more difficult to defend the institution of science itself from relentless attack. This lack of trust absolutely contributes to the sorts of dunderheaded, reactionary populism presently threatening America and much of Europe. If experts aren't to be trusted, charlatans and cranks will step into the vacuum. To mangle a line from Archer, \"Do you want a world where RFK Jr. is the head of HHS? That's how you get a world where RFK Jr. is appointed head of HHS.\" Going forward, Scientific American can right the ship by simply hiring an editor who cares more about science than progressive political goals. That doesn't mean the editor needs to be apolitical or that there's no role for SciAm to chime in on social justice issues in an informed manner, with the requisite level of humility and caution. It simply means that Scientific American needs to get back to its roots—explaining the universe's wonders to its readers, not lecturing them about how society should be ordered or distorting politically inconvenient findings.",

She's a professor (emeritus) at Harvard. The book is a history. It shows how the Coca-Cola Company turned to \"science\" when the company was beset by the obesity crisis of the 1990s and health advocates were calling for, among other things, soda taxes. Coca-Cola \"mobilized allies in academia to create a soda-defense science that would protect profits by advocating exercise, not dietary restraint, as the priority solution to obesity.\" It was a successful campaign and did particularly well in the Far East. \"In China, this distorted science has left its mark not just on national obesity policies but on the apparatus for managing chronic disease generally.\" Point being, the science that Coca-Cola propagated is entirely legitimate. But that science itself does not tell the whole, obvious truth, which is that there is certainly a correlation in a society between obesity rates and overall sugar-soda consumption rates. \"Coke’s research isn’t fake science, Greenhalgh argues; it was real science, conducted by real and eminent scientists, but distorted by its aim.\" \"Trust the science\" can thus be a dangerous call to arms. Here's the book, if anybody's interested. https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo221451... reply sitkack 37 minutes agoparentThis is how propaganda works, you don't spread falsities and untruths, but change the mix of what signals get amplified. reply hn_throwaway_99 13 minutes agoparentprevThere are few slogans I hate more than \"trust the science\", primarily because it aligns scientific results with faith, which is exactly what science is not about. Science is fundamentally about skepticism, not trust. Now, obviously that skepticism can be misused by some rando with no qualifications or even time spent researching telling you to be \"skeptical\" of people who have spent decades trying to figure shit out. What I really believe we should be teaching people is \"what are the incentives?\". That is, it's become very clear that many people are susceptible to provably false information, so we should train people to try to examine what incentives someone has for speaking out in the first place (and that includes scientists, too). This is why I hate most conspiracy theories - even if you take everything the conspiracy supposes at face value, conspiracists don't explain how their conspiracy is somehow kept so secret when tons of people involved would have extremely strong incentives to expose it. reply lazyeye 35 minutes agoparentprevI wonder how much of this same kind of manipulation/distortion is going on when we are told to \"trust the science\" with regard to climate change?

To me, based on the content and context, the main quote written by the departing editor the article cited was clearly an opinion (or editor's column) piece and not part of SciAm's science reporting. While this article didn't focus on it, the biggest factor when the editor-in-charge of a publication is biased isn't what is written but rather what never appears at all. An editor's curation and broad editorial guidance is subtle day-to-day yet has enormous impact over time. I've read accounts of newsroom reporters talking about editorial bias and it's remarkable how each individual biased decision is almost undetectable and, in fact, in some cases the biased editor may not even realize their bias is cumulatively shifting coverage. reply jjk166 44 minutes agorootparent> the biggest factor when the editor-in-charge of a publication is biased The editor-in-charge, and indeed every human being, is always biased.

I'm not a fan of Michael Shermer, but he claims SciAm demanded a complete revision of a column, and then later rejected one of his columns, right before getting rid of him entirely. So there's at least some rules about what opinions they're willing to publish, and that was under the previous editor-in-chief (as in the one before the one the article is about). The opinions that make it to press are curated, so if there's something off about them, the editors should be held responsible, and the op-eds don't have a different editor-in-chief than the main articles. > Who even reads editorials in a science magazine? I see no reason not to consider them as a significant part of the magazine's image.

This is commonsense science writing that even the plebs can understand. reply GMoromisato 55 minutes agoprevI'm conflicted about all of this because I gave up reading Scientific American when I felt it had become too political. But of course, you can't remove politics from science. Scientists are human and humans are political. When a scientist chooses an area to investigate, it is influenced by their politics. You can ask scientists to be factual, but you can't ask them to be non-political. It's not SciAm's fault that scientists (and science writers) are political. The root failure, IMHO, is that several professions, including scientists, journalists, and teachers have become overwhelmingly left-wing. It was not always that way. In the 80s, 35% of university employees (administrators+faculty) donated to Republicans. In recent years it has been under 5%.[1] I don't know the cause of this. Perhaps conservatives began rejecting science and driving scientists away; or perhaps universities became more liberal and conservative scientists left to join industry. Maybe both. Personally, I think it is important that this change. Science is the foundation of all our accomplishments, as a country and as a species. My hot take is that trust in science will not be restored until there are more conservative scientists. Sadly, I think restoring trust will take a long time. Maybe this change at Scientific American will be the beginning of that process. I certainly hope so. --------- [1] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01382-3.pdf reply quasse 37 minutes agoparent> Perhaps conservatives began rejecting science and driving scientists away There isn't even a \"perhaps\" about this.

It is still mostly just thorough coverage of developments in physics, biology, engineering, and other pretty uncontroversial science topics and this coverage has not 'gone downhill'. It is a lot of work to do good reporting of an area of science by talking to a range of experts in that area and SA still does good work here. Some topics are politicized, but that doesn't mean you just don't report on the science in those areas. Almost everyone who thinks 'SA used to be good now it is woke' are either revealing they don't read it or just don't seem to like how the consensus in an area of research might now conflict with their worldview. They do have an opinion section, like many journalism outlets, which sort of by definition have to be 'hot takes' (e.g. you don't publish opinion pieces that 99% of people will already agree with). Out of thousands it is seems hard to avoid having some bad ones (all major outlets seem to have opinion pieces that are dumb). Most of the flack they get seems to be from these dumb pieces, and it is sad that the entire brand gets tarred with it. You could argue that SA just shouldn't have opinion pieces at all, but ultimately opinion pieces are pretty good at drawing readers and SA is not a non-profit. Additionally, while there are some that overstep the research and are 'click-baity', some opinion pieces are thought-provoking in a valuable way. Nonetheless, perhaps it would be better to get rid of the opinions just to avoid hurting the reputation of the rest of the magazine, but running a journalism magazine is a tough business and it is easy for commenters on the internet to pop in and say stuff like this who don't actually have to run a magazine. I would rather they exist with occasional bad opinion pieces than not exist at all, as their coverage in general is still great. This guy seems to really not like their coverage of science around gender non-conforming individuals, though I don't see why I should trust his representation of the research over theirs as he seems to have an agenda as well. He then cherry-picks a few examples of some bad opinion pieces not written by their journalists that overstepped the research and then paints the entire outlet with it, and that is frustrating because most of the science coverage reporting is still excellent. reply spamizbad 5 hours agoparentThe author of this article very (in)famously re-launched his career as a writer (prior to GNC youth he wrote mostly culture pieces) by misinterpreting a scientific paper on the subject he now claims to be an expert on.

In my opinion, the author's assertion is correct; we've seen in the past that research failed to find how medication affects women in specific ways, because that research was based on the premise that people are largely the same, and thus failed to specifically test the effects on each gender individually.

If brain wiring can mismatch physiology, it demonstrably is not determinative of the biology the brain is attached to in any meaningful way. I understand the motivation for this denialism: most social institutions that segregate by sex are motivated by the practical effects of physiological sex-linked characteristics, brain wiring isn't a relevant criterion for determining \"sex\" for these purposes. It is currently impossible for the physiology to match the brain wiring in such case as a matter of science.

To put it another way: if modernism was actually true and science was an inherently objective process that produced universal truths, then why do we have persistent and ongoing replication crisises in multiple scientific disciplines? Our answer has to come from postmodernism: the current scientific establishment values the production of papers as a way to fill magazines, and people with agendas to push (e.g. the American sugar lobby) will fund the production of scientific papers that produce the answer they want.

It's a complicated topic with consequences for the framing and development of scientific knowledge. There's no reason to discredit scientific endeavor in totality because of that though, and, to be honest, those people are far more fringe in academia, for instance, than people realize.

For example, embracing more federal power compared to the Republican ideology of more state power. Which has nothing to do with science. It's more so caught up in the liberal cultural agenda. Which Democrats align with. A square is a rectangle but a rectangle is not always a square. I think _both_ conservatives and liberals have turned to postmodernist questioning of science. Just as conservatives question climate change science, liberals question biological sex science. Both are detriments to society and show how we're not exactly moving forward culturally.

[0] Barrier troops are soldiers in an army whose job it is to shoot at their own deserters. reply mindslight 2 hours agorootparentAs a libertarian whose thinking has gone through the whole spectrum of left-right and back again, the fundamental problem is that [pure] right libertarianism is inherently contradictory, despite its simplicity making it extremely attractive. A core principle of rightist thinking is an assumption that there is some bedrock of moral axioms, and as long as we follow them then the resulting situations must also be morally right by construction. This directly clashes with Gödel's famous results in logic, which show that complexity itself creates new logical contradictions. Rightest libertarians (eg the bulk of the Libertarian party, Constitutional fundamentalists, etc) are still running off the failed ideas from the 1910's that produced efforts like the Principia Mathematica. The way I've come to see it, left and right essentially correspond to two modes of reasoning, inductive versus deductive - they are both required to get anywhere worthwhile. The current highly divisive political environment is essentially making everybody think with only half their brains. This is both lucrative (it feels good to have lazy answers validated rather than criticized), as well as disempowering (it keeps individuals from agreeing on substantive political opposition to ever-growing corporate authoritarianism). reply drawkward 4 hours agoparentprevNow talk about the crowd size at Trump's first inauguration, and the birth of the term \"alternative facts\". reply thrance 4 hours agoparentprevLet's be real here, if there's one side that has an anti-science stance it's the republicans.

In any case, no one was advocating cutting out Algebra. The debate was about moving Algebra I from middle school to High School and removing Calculus from High School.

Inflation adjusted spending per student has increased by about 3X since then, and test scores have not improved, even falling in recent years. Financial aid for college has perversely led to vastly overinflated tuitions, while subsidizing many useless degrees. These problems are not a simple matter of funding. One need only at California's High Speed Rail project. Costs have soared from early estimates of $15B to now more than $130B+, despite almost no track being laid over the last 15 years.

We could spin up a theorem generator that just starts from mathematical axioms and exhaustively recombines them to create theorem after theorem. This would create facts, but the process would be almost entirely useless. A pure undirected \"search for truth and fact\" does very little for us. Researchers decide what problems to tackle. Funding organizations decide what research to fund. Researchers make choices about how to tackle these problems. Research labs are staffed depending on things like admission decisions and immigration decisions. Journals decide what papers to publish, not just on validity but on impact and novelty. Journals then charge money to access this research as part of a profit-driven business model. All of these human elements bend the \"search for truth\" and a failure to recognize these institutions and their many historical analogues just means that you miss out on some rather important understanding when interacting with the literature. reply tim333 3 hours agorootparentI still feel the ideal should be a search for truth, even if human institutions do the work.

    "title": "OpenStreetMap's New Vector Tiles",
    "originLink": "https://tech.marksblogg.com/osm-mvt-vector-tiles.html",
    "originBody": "OpenStreetMap's New Vector Tiles OpenStreetMap (OSM) has been hosting raster tiles of its dataset for much of its 20-year history. These maps have had their rules and styles defined ahead of their rendering and present the end user with static PNGs. Below is a screenshot of the area around the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. This week, OSM began hosting vector tiles in Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT) format. This allows for the end user to adjust the style and rendering rules as well as extract the underlying information within each of the tiles. Imagery should appear much sharper and switching the language of the labels should become possible. Below is the same area in Dubai but rendered with OSM's new vector tiles. The raster imagery OSM produced used larger iconography for points of interest (POI) but I suspect it is only a matter of time before the OSM community releases some spectacular and fine-tuned styles for the new vector tiles. This is the current iteration of the tiles rendering with a style sheet that I'll discuss in further detail below. The main OSM website still serves raster tiles but this web demo of the new vector tiles should work on most phones and desktop devices. In this post, I'll walk through visualising and analysing OSM's vector tiles. My Workstation I'm using a 6 GHz Intel Core i9-14900K CPU. It has 8 performance cores and 16 efficiency cores with a total of 32 threads and 32 MB of L2 cache. It has a liquid cooler attached and is housed in a spacious, full-sized, Cooler Master HAF 700 computer case. I've come across videos on YouTube where people have managed to overclock the i9-14900KF to 9.1 GHz. The system has 96 GB of DDR5 RAM clocked at 6,000 MT/s and a 5th-generation, Crucial T700 4 TB NVMe M.2 SSD which can read at speeds up to 12,400 MB/s. There is a heatsink on the SSD to help keep its temperature down. This is my system's C drive. The system is powered by a 1,200-watt, fully modular, Corsair Power Supply and is sat on an ASRock Z790 Pro RS Motherboard. I'm running Ubuntu 22 LTS via Microsoft's Ubuntu for Windows on Windows 11 Pro. In case you're wondering why I don't run a Linux-based desktop as my primary work environment, I'm still using an Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU which has better driver support on Windows and I use ArcGIS Pro from time to time which only supports Windows natively. Installing Prerequisites I'll use Python and a few other tools to help visualise OSM's data in this post. $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt install \\ jq \\ python3-pip \\ python3-virtualenv I'll set up a Python Virtual Environment and install some dependencies. $ python3 -m venv ~/.osm_mvt $ source ~/.osm_mvt/bin/activate $ pip install \\ \"leafmap[maplibre]\" \\ mapbox_vector_tile \\ morecantile \\ notebook I'll use DuckDB, along with its H3, JSON, Lindel, Parquet and Spatial extensions, in this post. $ cd ~ $ wget -c https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases/download/v1.1.3/duckdb_cli-linux-amd64.zip $ unzip -j duckdb_cli-linux-amd64.zip $ chmod +x duckdb $ ~/duckdb INSTALL h3 FROM community; INSTALL lindel FROM community; INSTALL json; INSTALL parquet; INSTALL spatial; I'll set up DuckDB to load every installed extension each time it launches. $ vi ~/.duckdbrc .timer on .width 180 LOAD h3; LOAD lindel; LOAD json; LOAD parquet; LOAD spatial; The maps in this post were rendered with QGIS version 3.40. QGIS is a desktop application that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. The application has grown in popularity in recent years and has ~15M application launches from users all around the world each month. OSM's Vector Tiles in QGIS You can view OSM's vector tiles, along with an example style sheet in QGIS by clicking the Layer Menu -> Add Layer -> Add Vector Tile Layer. Create a new connection and set its Style URL to: https://pnorman.github.io/tilekiln-shortbread-demo/colorful.json Then set the Source URL to: https://vector.openstreetmap.org/shortbread_v1/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt Below is what the connection UI should look like. Click OK and then Add to add OSM's vector tiles to your project. Below is a rendering of Dubai with the connection that was set up above. The style sheet is optional and without it, QGIS can still render the vector data, albeit with colours it'll pick randomly. The only issue I've come across is the rendering of iconography seems to be off. Other mapping tools can render the sprites for this style just fine but they appear as blurry black icons in QGIS for some reason. OSM's Vector Tiles in Leafmap I'll create a configuration folder for Jupyter Notebook and set a password. $ mkdir -p ~/.jupyter $ jupyter-notebook password The following will launch Jupyter Notebook. Note it'll run under your user's permissions and expose any files in its current directory or below to anyone who knows the password you set. I'll run the server from an empty folder as a safety precaution. $ mkdir -p ~/empty $ cd ~/empty $ jupyter-notebook \\ --no-browser \\ --ip=127.0.0.1 \\ --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=100000000 I'll open http://127.0.0.1:8888/ and type in the password I set above. I'll click the \"New\" button in the top right and pick \"Python 3 (ipykernel)\" to create a new notebook to work in. Below I'll render the area around the Burj Khalifa again. The POI icons render properly. import leafmap.maplibregl as leafmap m = leafmap.Map(style='https://pnorman.github.io/tilekiln-shortbread-demo/colorful.json') m Analysis-Ready Data Below I'll download a zoom-level 14 tile near the Burj Khalifa. I'll first get its tile x and y values from its approximate longitude and latitude. $ echo \"[55.27, 25.2]\" \\morecantile tiles 14 [10707, 7006, 14] I'll then use those values to build the tile URL and download its contents. $ wget https://vector.openstreetmap.org/shortbread_v1/14/10707/7006.mvt The following will convert the 114 KB MVT file into a 1.4 MB JSON file. $ python3 import json import math import mapbox_vector_tile # From https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/475398/ def pixel2deg(xtile, ytile, zoom, xpixel, ypixel, extent=4096): n = 2.0 ** zoom xtile = xtile + (xpixel / extent) ytile = ytile + ((extent - ypixel) / extent) lon_deg = (xtile / n) * 360.0 - 180.0 lat_rad = math.atan(math.sinh(math.pi * (1 - 2 * ytile / n))) lat_deg = math.degrees(lat_rad) return (lon_deg, lat_deg) open('7006.mvt.json', 'w').write( json.dumps( mapbox_vector_tile.decode( tile=open('7006.mvt', 'rb').read(), transformer=lambda x, y: pixel2deg(10707, 7006, 14, x, y)))) Below are the top-level keys for the tile. $ jq -S keys 7006.mvt.json [ \"addresses\", \"bridges\", \"buildings\", \"ferries\", \"land\", \"ocean\", \"pier_lines\", \"pier_polygons\", \"place_labels\", \"pois\", \"public_transport\", \"sites\", \"street_labels\", \"street_polygons\", \"streets\", \"streets_labels_points\", \"water_polygons\", \"water_polygons_labels\" ] I'll extract the POIs into their own JSON file and open it in DuckDB. $ jq .pois 7006.mvt.json \\ > 7006.pois.mvt.json $ ~/duckdb Below are the records where a cuisine value is present. .maxrows 10 SELECT geom, amenity, cuisine FROM ST_READ('7006.pois.mvt.json') WHERE cuisine IS NOT NULL;

    "commentBody": "OpenStreetMap's New Vector Tiles (marksblogg.com)263 points by marklit 6 hours agohidepastfavorite92 comments puddingvlaai 9 minutes agoI'm a bit conflicted with vector tiles. I haven't found a good combination of style and tile generator that provides the same level of detail as the original raster tiles provide. The article has screenshots that very much demonstrate this difference. The first screenshot has, for example, a lot of POIs (statues, shops, theaters, viewpoints), highways that are different when they are bridges, different colors for grass vs parks, different line widths for different highways, sports fields, building and neighbourhood names, arrows denoting one-way streets, building parts, and a lot more. The second screenshot has none of that, aside from a single trolly station and a single street name. I've tried a lot of vector styles (all openmaptiles styles, the base protomaps styles, all mapbox styles) and generators (protomaps, openmaptiles, mapbox). None of them come close to the amount of detail as the raster OSM tiles while still being as readable. I've never found anyone as bothered with this as I am. Vector styles are cool as they zoom and pan very smoothly, and their style is fairly easily editable. But, for any map where you actually want to see map data instead of using it as a base map for your own data, vector maps fall short. Maybe it is just because of computational limits. I can imagine that displaying the same amount of detail as the OSM raster tiles would require too many resources: both on the client side and for tile generation. It would be nice if OpenStreetMap would try to mimic their raster style closer, instead of providing just another low contrast, low detail base map. I hope this release of open vector tiles will facilitate more detailed vector maps! reply maliker 5 hours agoprevIt's been fascinating to watch the open source community build out vector map tile capabilities. I was doing some web GIS work back in roughly 2018, and Google/Apple's streaming vector maps performed like magic and something we would have loved to use if we could afford it. Shortly thereafter the core tech was available in open source, and then there were even free hosted solutions. Now our leaflet maps have great vector layers for free. Thanks open source! reply NelsonMinar 1 hour agoparentI'm a little surprised it's taken this long for OSM to get there, the basic technical pieces were available over a decade ago. I don't mean to complain about the free map service, it's excellent, and I recognize they focus more on the editing and data ownership. Serving is hard and expensive. Mostly I wonder how much MapBox's dominance for a few years disrupted other efforts. reply Firefishy 52 minutes agorootparentThe new stack has some unique feature like the vector tiles being minutely updated directly from OSM mapping changes. There are still issues to fix as it is still only a technical preview. reply zawaideh 3 hours agoprevThe other issue is that the arabic font is not rendering correctly in the vector version. It's rendering left to right (instead of right to left) with characters broken up instead of linked. reply sp8962 2 hours agoparentThe whole point of vector tiles is that the rendering is local and controlled by a style configuration (except for the tile schema) that can be changed. So the brokenness you are seeing is either in the style or the library that is rendering the contents locally. reply dnpls 1 hour agorootparentit looks like the selected font doesn't support arabic text, producing the disconnected characters. reply SSLy 2 hours agorootparentprevIndeed, but that is probably not going to help end users of apps. reply sp8962 1 hour agorootparentWell nobody claimed things are going to get simpler. It is difficult to beat raster tiles in that respect. vector tiles split up responsibility for what you get visually over multiple moving pieces with different provenance and operators. reply astrange 1 hour agorootparentFor Arabic specifically, different users want text to render differently, so you'd want to do it on the client if you can. (Some countries use Roman numerals and some use Arabic numerals for numbers. And by Arabic numerals I don't mean 1-9.) reply rafram 18 minutes agorootparentAll Arabic-speaking countries use Arabic numerals. Some use Western Arabic numerals (123) and some use Eastern Arabic numerals (١٢٣). Roman numerals are I, V, X, etc. reply lxgr 1 hour agorootparentprev> It is difficult to beat raster tiles in that respect. Intuitively, why can't the local vector rasterizer do whatever the server-side tile rasterizer does, especially if both are fully custom? reply wiredfool 1 hour agorootparentPartially because they're completely different stacks -- the client side is WebGL + Javascript, and the server side is whatever they've been doing for 15 years. They're probably missing a raqm/freebidi or something in the stack on the client side. reply lxgr 1 hour agorootparentAh, so the input into the client-side isn't OSM-like data (i.e. OSM XML or some high-level transform of that), but rather something closer to a vector graphics format like SVG? That makes sense then, thank you! reply maxerickson 1 hour agorootparentprevIt can, it's just that they typically don't, because they use an off the shelf data schema for the tiles and a library to handle the rendering. Having the data in tiles also complicates some things (where the renderer needs to consider merged tiles to get a similar result). reply kibwen 5 hours agoprevDoes this reduce the operating costs of hosting OSM-based maps, since presumably they require less CPU spent on rendering and vectors consume less storage/bandwidth? reply hamiltont 4 hours agoparentYes and No. No because the official OSM tile layer is heavily subsidized by Fastly (€720k last I checked) and rendering by AWS (€40k) Yes because technically it would use fewer resources thus easier on AWS+Fastly and also easier to self-host In last risk assessment I read closely(1) OSM noted \"If we lost [Fastly] sponsorship, we would likely cut off all third-party access to the standard tile layer and run a small number of Varnish servers.\" As I understand it, primary drivers for vectors was not cost more improving internationalization, generally enabling client-side rendering decisions, and driving a modern toolchain that would net multiple follow-on benefits I'm a bit behind, there is more recent info available at (2) 1.https://operations.osmfoundation.org/2024/01/25/owg_budget.o... 2. https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Finances reply treyd 2 hours agorootparentI wonder if it would be feasible to distribute tile data in a DHT. There is a single source of truth that could seed the DHT and users would share the load of serving the data. It'd have to be opt-in on individual nav devices for privacy and battery reasons, but anyone running their own OSM proxy would have an incentive participate. reply Borg3 1 hour agorootparentprevYet you forget that tiles based maps are plays very nicely even with simplest HTTP caching (even multiple layers of them). Compared to vector stuff that needs caches that are range requests aware, or some magic block storage. I somehow prefer to stick to tile based maps because caching, easy rendering and I also care about sat images, with cannot be vectorized. I think we need both of those. reply Symbiote 1 hour agorootparentThese are tile-based maps — vector tiles, rather than raster tiles. Any caching you do on raster tiles also works here. reply sp8962 3 hours agoparentprevNo, because you've been able to self host (or have somebody host them for you) vector tiles for a long time with very little effort, and yes that will somewhat offload processing to clients, and, more importantly allow many styling decisions to be made by the client (but not all). Static or infrequently updated vector tiles can be generated from OSM data by a number of tools, but those most popular right now are https://github.com/systemed/tilemaker and https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler The actual -new- thing is that the work Paul has done for the OSMF allows on the fly (aka in minutes) updates of the vector tiles. This is important for OSM contributors as a feedback mechanism and the main reason the OSMF operates the current raster tile service. What is currently a bit out in the open is which usage restrictions will apply to to using the vector tile service as, just as with the raster tile service, the intent is not to compete with or replace third party services and a vector tile service could potentially do that. reply jt_b 52 minutes agorootparent> Static or infrequently updated vector tiles can be generated from OSM data by a number of tools, but those most popular right now are https://github.com/systemed/tilemaker and https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler this is the first I've seen of these alternative tools compared to using Tippecanoe(https://github.com/felt/tippecanoe).

You have for example https://protomaps.com/ or https://openmaptiles.org/ or https://versatiles.org/ (random order). reply hyperknot 4 hours agoparentprevopenfreemap.org creator here. Yes, with vector tiles you are basically hosting static files, the server has nothing to do, except HTTPS encryption. Even gzipping is already done in the tiles. reply TrickyFoxy 3 hours agorootparentFor vector tiles osm.org this is not the case. They should be generated on the fly from the database to show mappers the current state of the map with minimal delay. Yes, the resulting results can be cached like static files, but much more work is done on the server. You can learn more about this in the blog of the developer who develops this tile server: https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/pnorman/diary/403600 p.s. current link to the demo page: https://pnorman.github.io/tilekiln-shortbread-demo reply hyperknot 3 hours agorootparentOP asked \"Does this reduce the operating costs of hosting OSM-based maps\". openstreetmap.org has a very complex setup for real-time updates, but in general, hosting OSM-based maps is much cheaper with vector tiles. reply Someone 4 hours agoprev> Imagery should appear much sharper and switching the language of the labels should become possible. I expect that to work sub-optimally. Label dimensions are far from guaranteed to stay the same if you change language, and label dimensions interact with map layout, even influencing what to show. If your labels grow larger, they may end up covering too much of the map or even overlapping. If they grow smaller, users may wonder why a city that was omitted before because of space constraints doesn’t show in the empty space created. reply maxerickson 4 hours agoparentThe starting case is anyway automatic positioning of the labels. Even on the raster tiles that have been in use for years. reply dheera 4 hours agoparentprevI hate it when city and street names disappear on Google Maps as you zoom in and out. Sometimes a street or business name only appears at one particular zoom level and not higher or lower. Just show the name of every street damnit. I don't care about crowding. Standing at an intersection staring at an unlabelled map is a useless map. reply PrismCrystal 4 hours agorootparentYounger generations are much less likely to navigate by comparing a map to the street names at an intersection. Instead, people navigate by searching for a particular destination and then following the line that the router generates. When Google Maps is a one-size-fits-all product, you can't blame them for choosing an approach like this. Fortunately, the OSM ecosystem lets you choose (or develop for yourself) whatever approach you prefer. reply hackmiester 4 hours agorootparentThat method just doesn't work in Manhattan, where due to buildings, you're lucky if your GPS is working, much less the compass to tell you which direction to face. reply PrismCrystal 4 hours agorootparentThe vast majority of Google Maps users are capable of using A-GPS data, they are not reliant on a clear GPS satellite signal alone. And Google’s A-GPS data for Manhattan is extremely detailed. Again, this makes sense for a one-size-fits-all product like Google Maps. reply astrange 1 hour agorootparentThat's not good enough, AGPS doesn't work near skyscrapers. The issue isn't that the signal isn't \"clear\", it's that it reflects off the buildings and the GPS receiver will get a clear but wrong signal. To correct this you need something like QZSS or accurate models of the buildings to compensate for it. reply c0nsumer 3 hours agorootparentprevOn a couple recent trips I ran into this when trying to figure out what river I was near / crossing. Multiple times I basically said \"lemme get a better tool for this\" and flipped to OsmAnd. Google Maps just basically/barely showed there was a channel of water and didn't show the name. reply dheera 3 hours agorootparentAlso not to mention while navigating Google Maps stupidly hides all the business names en route. I want to see every single business along my route, damnit, so that I know where I could possibly go to eat or stop for a rest along the way. The Google Assistant is also the most useless piece of crap ever. \"OK Google show me all the businesses on the map\" doesn't work, and neither does \"OK Google zoom in\" for that matter. Most useless UX ever. reply kevincox 3 hours agorootparentprev> Just show the name of every street damnit I don't know about every street. But if you zoom in all of the way then yes, every street more than slightly in the viewport should be labeled. I have the same problems with all sorts of things like lakes where you need to find the magic zoom level and map position that reveals the name. Some things are understandably harder, I don't necessarily need the Country, Province and City in every view of the map. But streets and lakes tend to not have much stuff inside of them so it seems obvious that when zoomed far in they should appear. reply DidYaWipe 35 minutes agorootparentprevOr when you zoom in and the names remain tiny and illegible. reply SoftTalker 2 hours agorootparentprevAnd zoom the label font size with the map size. I'm an old guy and cannot read the text on the map. Try to zoom in... the map zooms but the text stays the same size. Maddening. I don't recall offhand whether it's Apple or Google maps that do this. Maybe both. reply enriquto 4 hours agorootparentprev> Just show the name of every street damnit. But why? Google Maps is not a navigation aid. Its purpose is not to help you know the name of the street you are in. It's a tool for paying customers to steer you towards their shops. If all you need to do is follow a path towards a certain shop, they don't need to show you the names of the streets. reply astrange 3 hours agorootparentGoogle doesn't really optimize to show you ads. They're a monopoly and the voting shares are owned by Larry/Sergey; they have no intrinsic motivation to care about anything. If you want to be optimization-brained (don't, it's bad for you) they optimize for metrics that individual people make up and use to get promoted. They monetize the map other ways, like with the expensive API fees, but I wonder if they really care about it. Whenever I look at it for a few seconds I see something obviously sloppy, like misspelled POI names or people adding fake businesses at their apartment. reply LeifCarrotson 4 hours agorootparentprevGoogle Maps is a navigation aid that's also used to sell ads. People don't open the app to look at the ads. They open it to navigate, and if it can't be used for that purpose they won't open it at all. It is infuriating to me when a Wendy's ad is given more visual importance in color and size on the app than the actual place I want to find. But it doesn't seem to bother a lot of other people. Somewhere further in the direction of more advertisements is a point where a significant number of normal people will stop using Maps as a navigation tool, and somewhere further still is a point where more advertisements will become less profitable and will be rejected by even the developers. But we're nowhere near that point yet. Until then, I'll keep using a combination of Garmin Explore, OsmAnd, and Maps depending on how much I care about topo data, traffic status, reviews, search results, and ads. I'm setting up an Owntracks so I can replace the Timeline data that they're removing customer access to, and contributing to OpenStreetMap, but still using Maps. reply jayd16 2 hours agoparentprevWhy would you expect the layout algorithm to be significantly different? reply teraflop 2 hours agorootparentIt's not that the layout algorithm is different, it's that the algorithm tries to optimize the positions of text labels to get an aesthetically pleasing spacing, while preventing them from overlapping each other. If you keep the label positions the same, but translate the text, then the layout will have been computed with the wrong bounding boxes, and you will tend to get wrong spacing and unintended overlaps. reply boramalper 5 hours agoprevAlso see: OpenFreeMap — free OpenStreetMap vector tile hosting https://openfreemap.org/ reply lxgr 1 hour agoparentWow, this looks incredibly polished!

How does the new vector tile system handle performance on low-end devices with large datasets? reply sp8962 3 hours agoparent... it doesn't? One of the downsides of MVTs and the typical max zoom level of 14 is that that they do require more local resources than simply rendering a 256x256 bitmap. For OSM the question is naturally would a complete migration (aka turning off raster tile support) exclude any noticeable number of people from contributing. But right now that decision is still a long way off, the vector tile service hasn't even been integrated in osm.org yet. reply gregoriol 4 hours agoprevIs there a tool to capture vector tiles to raster files?

See Paris for example: https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/71525 The usefulness of being able to switch the language depends on the availability of translations of course. It might give editors an incentive to add more translations for place names. reply sp8962 3 hours agorootparentJust to nip this in the bud, OpenStreetMap in general doesn't contain \"translations\" it contains the exonyms that are commonly in use for geographic objects. Most of the time things only have a name in the local language so there will be no value for other languages in the OSM data. Transliterations are a bit of a grey area in this context, but are definitely more useful than actual translations which tend to be garbage. Further point: the data available in the vector tiles is defined by the vector tile schema and by far doesn't contain \"everything\". reply M2Ys4U 3 hours agorootparentprevIf there's a Wikidata QID associated with it then one can also use that to look up names in other languages reply maxerickson 4 hours agorootparentprevThe tiles aren't necessarily a 1:1 translation of the data. The official tiles will probably be close though. reply ajsnigrutin 1 hour agorootparentprevSure, but that's contained in the database, and then the tiles are generated that only contain one text (usually) in a png form).

There is still no good library which takes in a MVT tile and spits out the appropriate PNG or JPEG for rendering in via a tile base mapping engine. There is still no good cross platform mapping engine that can render vector tiles in a way that is easy to consume. There are certainly engines on specific platforms, but unless we use something like Leaflet or OpenLayers it is hard to make it work with native APIs on, say Windows, MacOs, Linux, iOS or Android without needing to adding a whole browser engine on top of your app. reply mxfh 2 hours agorootparentIf I would like to print vector-tile based maps to pdfs for handout's or something, is there any CPU renderer, server- or client-side that could output SVGs instead of rasterizing on GPU to bitmap at some point? I havent yet come across any renderer that would do this even partially, even before opening the whole can of worms that is text rendering. Closest thing I'm aware of might be ArcGIS Maps for Adobe Creative Cloud but would need something that's more like a library and preferably FOSS. reply InsertUser 20 minutes agorootparentRecent versions of QGIS support vector tiles in the MVT format (like these ones). So with a suitable style you should be able to create a layout using vector tiles and print. Assuming you meet the relevant attribution/license requirements for the various bits you choose of course. I don't think any usage policy has been published for these tiles yet. Unfortunately there are some translation issues with styles for MVT sources so you might need to do a bit of fixing if you don't want to go the route of a paid plan with MapTiler (third party provider) who have a plugin. There's also a list of \"print map\" generators of varying types here: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_on_Paper reply dvdkon 17 minutes agorootparentprevQGIS can do this.

    "commentBody": "Fair coins tend to land on the side they started: Evidence from 350,757 flips (researchgate.net)224 points by seanhunter 5 hours agohidepastfavorite118 comments acyou 1 hour agoThe paper looks like it has a large sample size, but it actually has a sample size of only 48 testers/flippers. Some of the videos of those testers show very low, low-rpm coin tosses, we're talking only 1-2 flips. Where they also flipped thousands of times, presumably in the same way. So there is actually a very small sample size in the study (N = 48), where testers that don't flip properly (low rpm, low height, few coin rotations) can affect the results disproportionately. Doesn't look like the study author backgrounds are particularly focused on statistics. I would presume with 48 authors (all but 3 of which flipped coins for the study), the role of some might have been more test subject than author. And isn't being the subject in your own study going to introduce some bias? Surely if you're trying to prove to yourself that the coins land on one side or another given some factor, you will learn the technique to do it, especially if you are doing a low-rpm, low flip. Based on the study results, some of the flippers appear to have learned this quite well. If the flippers (authors) had been convinced of the opposite (fair coins tend to land on the opposite side from which they started) and done the same study, I bet they could have collected data and written a paper with the results proving that outcome. reply salt4034 1 hour agoparent> testers that don't flip properly I think that's the point. It shows that people don't usually flip properly, leading to biased results. reply arandomusername 34 minutes agorootparentExcept that flipping a coin hundreds/thousands of time in a row is not a representive of how people will flip a coin a single time/few times. reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 38 minutes agorootparentprevIt shows that 48 people who have a potential bias in the study results flip in the way the study predicts. There is a [video presentation of the paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QjgvbvFoQA) which does a good job of explaining the inspiration for the study within the first few minutes. It sounds like what they were intending to study is the actual variance that is introduced, on average, by imperfections in throws conducted by humans. Unless that's mistaken, it's a fair point to consider the n=48 here. Did they discover an average that can be generalized to humans or just to those 48? reply chongli 34 minutes agorootparentYes and what immediately jumps out to me as a source of bias is that they asked this small group of 48 coin flippers to flip thousands of times each. I would’ve thought it would be obvious that when you ask people to do something thousands of times they might do it in a different (and biased) way than someone doing that thing only once. Get a hundred thousand people to flip a coin once each and then see what happens! reply fluoridation 1 hour agorootparentprevBut is that the case? The only way I've ever seen people flip a coin is by flicking it in the air with their thumb and either catching it or letting it hit a surface. I've never seen someone flip a coin like it was a die. reply tomrod 37 minutes agoparentprevActually, I think it's more sound to approach this with clustered standard errors. Basic intuition is similar, but the sample size is what it is per person, and your observations aren't independent across draws but are across people. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustered_standard_errors reply bambax 36 minutes agoparentprevThe real lesson is probably that if you're skilled enough, and/or train for long enough, you can influence the odds significantly without anyone ever noticing anything. reply binarymax 1 hour agoparentprev1-2 flips should just invalidate the toss. Anyone in a real scenario upon seeing this would call shenanigans. We need some minimum flippage for the toss to count. reply KwisatzHaderack 1 hour agoparentprev> only 48 testers/flippers I assumed they did these coin flips were done using a machine. But I guess they wanted to test if human flippers because they wanted to make claims about the human coin flip phenomenon. reply kybernetikos 54 minutes agorootparentBut if you get someone to flip a coin thousands of times for a boring reason, I would lose confidence that they are flipping in the same way a normal human would. reply its-summertime 55 minutes agoparentprev> the role of some might have been more test subject than author The reason is because it was used as incentive: > Intrigued? Join us and earn a co-authorship Per the linked youtube video. reply saalweachter 1 hour agoparentprevIf you are doing anything with human subjects, even something dumb like having them flip coins for an hour while recording the results, you need approval from your local ethics board. If you are doing self-experimentation, you do not. 48 \"authors\" is a bit extreme, but it's the norm to do some light human research with a half dozen authors as the subjects. reply seanhunter 5 hours agoprevThere's a nice presentation of the paper here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QjgvbvFoQA In essence the effect comes from \"precession\" - the tendency of the flip to not be purely vertical but to have some wobble/angular momentum which causes it to flip in such a way as to spend longer on one side than the other. Depending on the technique this will have a greater or lesser effect on the fairness of the coin toss, ranging from about p_same = 0.508 for the best technique to one person in the study actually exhibiting 0.6 over a large sample which is staggeringly unlikely if the toss was purely fair. In the extreme, it shows in the video a magician doing a trick toss using precession that looks as if it's flipping but does not in fact change sides at all, purely rotating in the plane of the coin and wobbling a bit. The video is quite a nice one for setting out how hypothesis testing works. reply yread 4 hours agoparentlink to the \"wobble flip\" trick https://youtu.be/-QjgvbvFoQA?t=325 reply pinko 1 hour agorootparentI think you accidentally linked to the same video as the parent comment...

I like the fact that they imply the importance of considering potential biases in seemingly random events. reply cgag 3 hours agoprevI wouldn't be surprised if there is something to it, but I suspected they didn't use legitimate coin flips (because it seems like a large amount of people can't really flip a coin), and looking at the videos confirms it, at least for the flips done by Bartos: https://osf.io/6a5hy/ They're very low RPM and very low time in the air. Nothing I would accept for any decision worth flipping a coin for. reply BiteCode_dev 3 hours agoparentThat's not tossing a coin, that's barely throwing it in the air. To me this kills the credibility of the entire study and of the authors. Sure, there may be something to it, but people will have a very different thing on their mind unless they check the video, which I wouldn't have done without your prompting. It's unlikely they don't understand how misleading it is. And somehow I have the intuition a proper coin toss will not exhibit the same properties. reply thrw42A8N 2 hours agorootparentIs it unlikely? If I didn't read your comment I wouldn't see any problem there. I never saw anyone flipping a coin in a different way. It's just not done much around me. reply BiteCode_dev 1 hour agorootparentIf you claim to do a research on coin tossing, the minimum is to be aware on how people toss coin. The whole purpose of tossing a coin is randomness, so of course you want high and fast. If the result was that no matter how high and fast you throw is you get this bias, it would have been interesting. But now you just say \"if you do things badly, things don't work\". reply ummonk 1 hour agorootparentNo, the whole point of the paper (and the physics model it is verifying) is to see what happens in normal human coin tosses. If you want to measure what happens specifically with high and fast coin tosses, then that’s an entirely different study to be done. reply philipov 1 hour agorootparentI don't know what a normal human coin toss is.

However, if most people flip coins like that, then the measurements are valid -- the conclusions are about what average people will do, not a perfect mechanical coin flip. Otherwise you're falling in the no true coin flip fallacy. reply Vecr 3 hours agorootparentYeah, if I'm actually forced to use a coin instead of a computer system, I try to ping the thing off the ceiling and at least one wall (not in that order).

Someone who runs well ahead of the crowd continues to do so seemingly even playing randomly with no thought into traditional poker theory. For example, if a strong pair starts off with a bad beat then it tends to continue that trend. The word trend doesn't mean its going to happen but that its likely to continue the past. When someone continues exploiting this trend they have seemingly \"broken\" the game, it no longer functions like a calculated game of odds and when somebody plays like a maniac (like in the first scenario i mentioned) there is seemingly no other defense than to wait until the trend breaks but no matter how seasoned a player is they cannot shake the past and its perceived likelihood of continuing. This effect is rampant in stock market as well when there is seemingly less \"random\" reinforcements and belief in the crowd which without fail has given rise to black swans/massive collective drawdowns of the world war causing variety. reply bgroat 3 hours agoprevThis has been commonly known by magicians for decades. I doubt that any single magician had conducted 350k flips, but I know I personally did ~2,500 to test the effect when I was a kid.

Apparently Diaconis presented a model which predicted about 51% preference for \"Same side\" and also did 2500 flips and said that about 250k flips would be needed to get 3 sigma of significance.

One of his teammates related to how he would watch guys shoot (usually during warmups) and count the rotation of the ball. Based on how many times the ball would rotate, he knew if it was going in or not and then would position himself to get the rebound. I would imagine OP did something similar. Watch the coin as its rotating and then grabbing it and then flipping to the side he predicted. reply noman-land 1 hour agoprevHaven't read the paper yet but this is so weird because when I was a kid I noticed this phenomenon myself. I noticed I could reliably flip a coin such that when it landed it would land on the same side as it was flipped from. I was getting like 80% accuracy and I didn't even know what I was doing to achieve it. I could just usually feel when I flipped it that I \"did it right\".

Can we think of this result as a mixture distribution of a fair 50/50 chance of it flips at least once, and a delta function that is 100% at the side it started on, if not flipped at all? reply vikingerik 2 hours agoparentSeems likely it would change. Here's another way to think about it: 0 rotations is more likely than 1 rotation, since there is a wider range of rotation speeds that lead to exactly 0 rotations than to exactly 1. Similarly, 2 flips is more likely than 3, 4 is more than 5, and so on. So you're always biased towards an even number of flips and the starting side. Take out the 0 case by your conditional, and you're left with 1 > 2, 3 > 4, 5 > 6, and so on, now biased towards an odd number and the non-starting side. reply matwood 27 minutes agoprevWhen I was a kid we played quarters (dating myself) a lot.

You said: > Flip it twice. Once to determine which side is up at second throw. Reverse to counter bias at start of second throw. Then flip again for final result. Suppose I'm throwing the coin using your technique and I want to favor heads. I hold tails up for the first throw, making tails more likely. Then as per your rule, I put heads up for the second throw. Now, heads is more likely. Choose the opposite starting face to make tails more likely. So, your technique does no prevent the coin tosser from being able to favor their desired outcome. reply outsidein 2 hours agorootparentThe paper is discussion regular people (not malicious people) tossing a coin, and under this precondition and assuming a fair (unbiased) coin.

If you get heads-heads or tails-tails, discard and start over until you get either heads-tails or tails-heads, which have equal probabilities (so you can say something like HT = \"heads\" and TH = \"tails\"). This works even if the coin lands heads 99% of the time, as long as it's consistent (but you'll probably have to flip a bunch of times in that case). reply simcop2387 3 hours agoparentIf anyone wants to look up why this might work, it's a Whitening transform [0].

You can test that by using a highly secure random number generator, e.g. /dev/random in Linux, to select the initial side. Keep track of that initial side, record the side it lands on.

If the coin was biased you'd expect it to land on heads more often regardless of what side it starts on. The coins land on the side they start on more often. reply japoco 3 hours agorootparent [–] No, first of all due to imperfections in the manufacture of real coins, there are actually no fair coins. Also the bias in the probability affects the first throw as well as all the rest. If your dataset is composed of first throws/rest of the throws, you’re going to see they are correlated. reply sigbottle 2 hours agorootparentI think you're missing the fact that you don't have to chain coin flips literally right after another. As the other commenter said, in between coin flips, use a highly secure PRNG to orient the coin randomly. This would correct for your bias (if true). reply zahlman 2 hours agorootparentprev [–] You're missing the point. A coin that is biased towards heads is one that would more often land on heads regardless of how you hold it when you start the flip. The study finding is that every coin is more likely to land on heads if you start it with heads facing up, and will also be more likely to land on tails, if you start it that way instead. This bias, while small, is greater than the typical observed bias due to imperfections in manufacturing. It's not about the \"first throw\" vs the \"rest of the throws\". It's about how you hold the coin when you go to flip it. That's what they mean by \"started\". reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "hyperfine 中文 A command-line benchmarking tool. Demo: Benchmarking fd and find: Features Statistical analysis across multiple runs. Support for arbitrary shell commands. Constant feedback about the benchmark progress and current estimates. Warmup runs can be executed before the actual benchmark. Cache-clearing commands can be set up before each timing run. Statistical outlier detection to detect interference from other programs and caching effects. Export results to various formats: CSV, JSON, Markdown, AsciiDoc. Parameterized benchmarks (e.g. vary the number of threads). Cross-platform Usage Basic benchmarks To run a benchmark, you can simply call hyperfine .... The argument(s) can be any shell command. For example: hyperfine 'sleep 0.3' Hyperfine will automatically determine the number of runs to perform for each command. By default, it will perform at least 10 benchmarking runs and measure for at least 3 seconds. To change this, you can use the -r/--runs option: hyperfine --runs 5 'sleep 0.3' If you want to compare the runtimes of different programs, you can pass multiple commands: hyperfine 'hexdump file' 'xxd file' Warmup runs and preparation commands For programs that perform a lot of disk I/O, the benchmarking results can be heavily influenced by disk caches and whether they are cold or warm. If you want to run the benchmark on a warm cache, you can use the -w/--warmup option to perform a certain number of program executions before the actual benchmark: hyperfine --warmup 3 'grep -R TODO *' Conversely, if you want to run the benchmark for a cold cache, you can use the -p/--prepare option to run a special command before each timing run. For example, to clear harddisk caches on Linux, you can run sync; echo 3sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches To use this specific command with hyperfine, call sudo -v to temporarily gain sudo permissions and then call: hyperfine --prepare 'sync; echo 3sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches' 'grep -R TODO *' Parameterized benchmarks If you want to run a series of benchmarks where a single parameter is varied (say, the number of threads), you can use the -P/--parameter-scan option and call: hyperfine --prepare 'make clean' --parameter-scan num_threads 1 12 'make -j {num_threads}' This also works with decimal numbers. The -D/--parameter-step-size option can be used to control the step size: hyperfine --parameter-scan delay 0.3 0.7 -D 0.2 'sleep {delay}' This runs sleep 0.3, sleep 0.5 and sleep 0.7. For non-numeric parameters, you can also supply a list of values with the -L/--parameter-list option: hyperfine -L compiler gcc,clang '{compiler} -O2 main.cpp' Intermediate shell By default, commands are executed using a predefined shell (/bin/sh on Unix, cmd.exe on Windows). If you want to use a different shell, you can use the -S, --shelloption: hyperfine --shell zsh 'for i in {1..10000}; do echo test; done' Note that hyperfine always corrects for the shell spawning time. To do this, it performs a calibration procedure where it runs the shell with an empty command (multiple times), to measure the startup time of the shell. It will then subtract this time from the total to show the actual time used by the command in question. If you want to run a benchmark without an intermediate shell, you can use the -N or --shell=none option. This is helpful for very fast commands ( /tmp/my_alias.sh hyperfine '. /tmp/my_alias.sh; my_alias' Exporting results Hyperfine has multiple options for exporting benchmark results to CSV, JSON, Markdown and other formats (see --help text for details). Markdown You can use the --export-markdownoption to create tables like the following: Command Mean [s] Min [s] Max [s] Relative find . -iregex '.*[0-9]\\.jpg$' 2.275 ± 0.046 2.243 2.397 9.79 ± 0.22 find . -iname '*[0-9].jpg' 1.427 ± 0.026 1.405 1.468 6.14 ± 0.13 fd -HI '.*[0-9]\\.jpg$' 0.232 ± 0.002 0.230 0.236 1.00 JSON The JSON output is useful if you want to analyze the benchmark results in more detail. The scripts/ folder includes a lot of helpful Python programs to further analyze benchmark results and create helpful visualizations, like a histogram of runtimes or a whisker plot to compare multiple benchmarks: Detailed benchmark flowchart The following chart explains the execution order of various timing runs when using options like --warmup, --prepare , --setupor --cleanup : Installation On Ubuntu Download the appropriate .deb package from the Release page and install it via dpkg: wget https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine/releases/download/v1.19.0/hyperfine_1.19.0_amd64.deb sudo dpkg -i hyperfine_1.19.0_amd64.deb On Fedora On Fedora, hyperfine can be installed from the official repositories: dnf install hyperfine On Alpine Linux On Alpine Linux, hyperfine can be installed from the official repositories: apk add hyperfine On Arch Linux On Arch Linux, hyperfine can be installed from the official repositories: pacman -S hyperfine On Debian Linux On Debian Linux, hyperfine can be installed from the testing repositories: apt install hyperfine On Exherbo Linux On Exherbo Linux, hyperfine can be installed from the rust repositories: cave resolve -x repository/rust cave resolve -x hyperfine On Funtoo Linux On Funtoo Linux, hyperfine can be installed from core-kit: emerge app-benchmarks/hyperfine On NixOS On NixOS, hyperfine can be installed from the official repositories: nix-env -i hyperfine On Flox On Flox, hyperfine can be installed as follows. flox install hyperfine Hyperfine's version in Flox follows that of Nix.

Is it, though? What I would expect a system like this to have, at a minimum: * Robust statistics with p-values (not just min/max, compensation for multiple hypotheses, no Gaussian assumptions) * Multiple stopping points depending on said statistics. * Automatic isolation to the greatest extent possible (given appropriate permissions) * Interleaved execution, in case something external changes mid-way.

Please see the discussion here: https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine/issues/21 > It just… runs things N times and then does a naïve average/min/max? While there is nothing wrong with computing average/min/max, this is not all hyperfine does. We also compute modified Z-scores to detect outliers. We use that to issue warnings, if we think the mean value is influenced by them. We also warn if the first run of a command took significantly longer than the rest of the runs and suggest counter-measures. Depending on the benchmark I do, I tend to look at either the `min` or the `mean`. If I need something more fine-grained, I export the results and use the scripts referenced above. > At that rate, one could just as well use a shell script and eyeball the results. Statistical analysis (which you can consider to be basic) is just one reason why I wrote hyperfine. The other reason is that I wanted to make benchmarking easy to use. I use warmup runs, preparation commands and parametrized benchmarks all the time. I also frequently use the Markdown export or the JSON export to generate graphs or histograms. This is my personal experience. If you are not interested in all of these features, you can obviously \"just as well use a shell script\". reply Sesse__ 1 hour agorootparent> This is not included in the core of hyperfine, but we do have scripts to compute \"advanced\" statistics, and to perform t-tests here: https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine/tree/master/scripts t-tests run afoul of the “no Gaussian assumptions”, though. Distributions arising from benchmarking frequently has various forms of skew which messes up t-tests and gives artificially narrow confidence intervals. (I'll gladly give you credit for your outlier detection, though!) >> Automatic isolation to the greatest extent possible (given appropriate permissions) > This sounds interesting. Please feel free to open a ticket if you have any ideas. Off the top of my head, some option that would: * Bind to isolated CPUs, if booted with it (isolcpus=) * Binding to a consistent set of cores/hyperthreads (the scheduler frequently sabotages benchmarking, especially if your cores are have very different maximum frequency) * Warns if thermal throttling is detected during the run * Warns if an inappropriate CPU governor is enabled * Locks the program into RAM (probably hard to do without some sort of help from the program) * Enables realtime priority if available (e.g., if isolcpus= is not enabled, or you're not on Linux) Of course, sometimes you would _want_ to benchmark some of these effects, and that's fine. But most people probably won't, and won't know that they exist. I may easily have forgotten some.

But I have not tried it on DBMS (e.g. like sysbench). Does anyone have a try? reply 7e 14 hours agoprevWhat database product does the community commonly send benchmark results to? This tool is great, but I'd love to analyze results relationally. reply rmorey 5 hours agoparentSomething like Geekbench for CLI tools would be awesome reply forrestthewoods 12 hours agoprev [–] Hyperfine is hyper frustrating because it only works with really really fine microsecond level benchmarks. Once you get into the millisecond range it’s worthless. reply sharkdp 8 hours agoparentThat doesn't make a lot of sense. It's more like the opposite of what you are saying. The precision of hyperfine is typically in the single-digit millisecond range. Maybe just below 1 ms if you take special care to run the benchmark on a quiet system. Everything below that (microsecond or nanosecond range) is something that you need to address with other forms of benchmarking. But for everything in the right range (milliseconds, seconds, minutes or above), hyperfine is well suited. reply forrestthewoods 2 hours agorootparentNo it’s not. Back in the day my goal for Advent of Code was to run all solutions in under 1 second total. Hyperfine would take like 30 minutes to benchmark a 1 second runtime. It was hyper frustrating. I could not find a good way to get Hyperfine to do what I wanted. reply sharkdp 2 hours agorootparentIf that's the case, I would consider it a bug. Please feel free to report it. In general, hyperfine should not take longer than ~3 seconds, unless the command itself takes > 300 ms second to run. In the latter case, we do a minimum of 10 runs by default. So if your program takes 3 min for a single iteration, it would take 30 min by default — yes. But this can be controlled using the `-m`/`--min-runs` option. You can also specify the exact amount of runs using `-r`/`--runs`, if you prefer that. > I could not find a good way to get Hyperfine to do what I wanted This is all documented here: https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine/tree/master?tab=readme-... under \"Basic benchmarks\". The options to control the amount of runs are also listed in `hyperfine --help` and in the man page. Please let us know if you think we can improve the documentation / discovery of those options. reply fwip 1 hour agorootparentprevI've been using it for about four or five years, and never experienced this behavior. Current defaults: \"By default, it will perform at least 10 benchmarking runs and measure for at least 3 seconds.\" If your program takes 1s to run, it should take 10 seconds to benchmark. Is it possible that your program was waiting for input that never came? One \"gotcha\" is that it expects each argument to be a full program, so if you ran `hyperfine ./a.out input.txt`, it will first bench a.out with no args, then try to bench input.txt (which will fail). If a.out reads from stdin when no argument is given, then it would hang forever, and I can see why you'd give up after a half hour. reply sharkdp 10 minutes agorootparent> Is it possible that your program was waiting for input that never came? We do close stdin to prevent this. So you can benchmark `cat`, for example, and it works just fine. reply anotherhue 12 hours agoparentprev [–] It spawns a new process each time right? I would think that would but a cap on how accurate it can get. For my purposes I use it all the time though, quick and easy sanity-check. reply oguz-ismail 11 hours agorootparentIt spawns a new shell for each run and subtracts the average shell startup time from final results. Too much noise reply PhilipRoman 11 hours agorootparentThe shell can be disabled, leaving just fork+exec reply sharkdp 8 hours agorootparentYes. If you don't make use of shell builtins/syntax, you can use hyperfine's `--shell=none`/`-N` option to disable the intermediate shell. reply oguz-ismail 6 hours agorootparentYou still need to quote the command though. `hyperfine -N ls \"$dir\"' won't work, you need `hyperfine -N \"ls ${dir@Q}\"' or something. It'd be better if you could specify commands like with `find -exec'. reply PhilipRoman 6 hours agorootparentOh that sucks, I really hate when programs impose useless shell parsing instead of letting the user give an argument vector natively. reply sharkdp 5 hours agorootparentI don't think it's useless. You can use hyperfine to run multiple benchmarks at the same time, to get a comparison between multiple tools. So if you want it to work without quotes, you need to (1) come up with a way to separate commands and (2) come up with a way to distinguish hyperfine arguments from command arguments. It's doable, but it's also not a great UX if you have to write something like hyperfine -N -- ls \"$dir\" \\; my_ls \"$dir\" reply oguz-ismail 5 hours agorootparent> not a great UX Looks fine to me. Obviously it's too late to undo that mistake, but a new flag to enable new behavior wouldn't hurt anyone. reply forrestthewoods 11 hours agorootparentprev [–] The issue is it runs a kajillion tests to try and be “statistical”. But there’s no good way to say “just run it for 5 seconds and give me the best answer you can”. It’s very much designed for nanosecond to low microsecond benchmarks. Trying to fight this is trying to smash a square peg through a round hole. reply sharkdp 8 hours agorootparent> The issue is it runs a kajillion tests to try and be “statistical”. If you see any reason for putting “statistical” in quotes, please let us know. hyperfine does not run a lot of tests, but it does try to find outliers in your measurements. This is really valuable in some cases. For example: we can detect when the first run of your program takes much longer than the rest of the runs. We can then show you a warning to let you know that you probably want to either use some warmup runs, or a \"--prepare\" command to clean (OS) caches if you want a cold-cache benchmark. > But there’s no good way to say “just run it for 5 seconds and give me the best answer you can”. What is the \"best answer you can\"? > It’s very much designed for nanosecond to low microsecond benchmarks. Absolutely not. With hyperfine, you can not measure execution times in the \"low microsecond\" range, let alone nanosecond range. See also my other comment. reply PhilipRoman 11 hours agorootparentprevI disagree that it is designed for nano/micro benchmarks. If you want that level of detail, you need to stay within a single process, pinned to a core which is isolated from scheduler.

    "originBody": "I’m a neuroscientist who taught rats to drive − their joy suggests how anticipating fun can enrich human life Published: November 11, 2024 8:21am EST Author Kelly Lambert Professor of Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Richmond Disclosure statement Kelly Lambert does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment. Partners University of Richmond provides funding as a member of The Conversation US. View all partners Rats will choose to take a longer route if it means they get to enjoy the ride to their destination. Kelly Lambert, CC BY-ND Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn Print We crafted our first rodent car from a plastic cereal container. After trial and error, my colleagues and I found that rats could learn to drive forward by grasping a small wire that acted like a gas pedal. Before long, they were steering with surprising precision to reach a Froot Loop treat. As expected, rats housed in enriched environments – complete with toys, space and companions – learned to drive faster than those in standard cages. This finding supported the idea that complex environments enhance neuroplasticity: the brain’s ability to change across the lifespan in response to environmental demands. After we published our research, the story of driving rats went viral in the media. The project continues in my lab with new, improved rat-operated vehicles, or ROVs, designed by robotics professor John McManus and his students. These upgraded electrical ROVs – featuring rat-proof wiring, indestructible tires and ergonomic driving levers – are akin to a rodent version of Tesla’s Cybertruck. As a neuroscientist who advocates for housing and testing laboratory animals in natural habitats, I’ve found it amusing to see how far we’ve strayed from my lab practices with this project. Rats typically prefer dirt, sticks and rocks over plastic objects. Now, we had them driving cars. But humans didn’t evolve to drive either. Although our ancient ancestors didn’t have cars, they had flexible brains that enabled them to acquire new skills – fire, language, stone tools and agriculture. And some time after the invention of the wheel, humans made cars. Although cars made for rats are far from anything they would encounter in the wild, we believed that driving represented an interesting way to study how rodents acquire new skills. Unexpectedly, we found that the rats had an intense motivation for their driving training, often jumping into the car and revving the “lever engine” before their vehicle hit the road. Why was that? Some rats training to drive press a lever before their car is placed on the track, as if they’re eagerly anticipating the ride ahead. The new destination of joy Concepts from introductory psychology textbooks took on a new, hands-on dimension in our rodent driving laboratory. Building on foundational learning approaches such as operant conditioning, which reinforces targeted behavior through strategic incentives, we trained the rats step-by-step in their driver’s ed programs. Initially, they learned basic movements, such as climbing into the car and pressing a lever. But with practice, these simple actions evolved into more complex behaviors, such as steering the car toward a specific destination. The rats also taught me something profound one morning during the pandemic. It was the summer of 2020, a period marked by emotional isolation for almost everyone on the planet, even laboratory rats. When I walked into the lab, I noticed something unusual: The three driving-trained rats eagerly ran to the side of the cage, jumping up like my dog does when asked if he wants to take a walk. Had the rats always done this and I just hadn’t noticed? Were they just eager for a Froot Loop, or anticipating the drive itself? Whatever the case, they appeared to be feeling something positive – perhaps excitement and anticipation. Behaviors associated with positive experiences are associated with joy in humans, but what about rats? Was I seeing something akin to joy in a rat? Maybe so, considering that neuroscience research is increasingly suggesting that joy and positive emotions play a critical role in the health of both human and nonhuman animals. With that, my team and I shifted focus from topics such as how chronic stress influences brains to how positive events – and anticipation for these events – shape neural functions. Rats hitting the road in their custom-made cruisers. Kelly Lambert, CC BY-ND Working with postdoctoral fellow Kitty Hartvigsen, I designed a new protocol that used waiting periods to ramp up anticipation before a positive event. Bringing Pavlovian conditioning into the mix, rats had to wait 15 minutes after a Lego block was placed in their cage before they received a Froot Loop. They also had to wait in their transport cage for a few minutes before entering Rat Park, their play area. We also added challenges, such as making them shell sunflower seeds before eating. This became our Wait For It research program. We dubbed this new line of study UPERs – unpredictable positive experience responses – where rats were trained to wait for rewards. In contrast, control rats received their rewards immediately. After about a month of training, we expose the rats to different tests to determine how waiting for positive experiences affects how they learn and behave. We’re currently peering into their brains to map the neural footprint of extended positive experiences. Preliminary results suggest that rats required to wait for their rewards show signs of shifting from a pessimistic cognitive style to an optimistic one in a test designed to measure rodent optimism. They performed better on cognitive tasks and were bolder in their problem-solving strategies. We linked this program to our lab’s broader interest in behaviorceuticals, a term I coined to suggest that experiences can alter brain chemistry similarly to pharmaceuticals. This research provides further support of how anticipation can reinforce behavior. Previous work with lab rats has shown that rats pressing a bar for cocaine – a stimulant that increases dopamine activation – already experience a surge of dopamine as they anticipate a dose of cocaine. The tale of rat tails It wasn’t just the effects of anticipation on rat behavior that caught our attention. One day, a student noticed something strange: One of the rats in the group trained to expect positive experiences had its tail straight up with a crook at the end, resembling the handle of an old-fashioned umbrella. I had never seen this in my decades of working with rats. Reviewing the video footage, we found that the rats trained to anticipate positive experiences were more likely to hold their tails high than untrained rats. But what, exactly, did this mean? Rat tails can signal how they’re feeling. Kelly Lambert, CC BY-SA Curious, I posted a picture of the behavior on social media. Fellow neuroscientists identified this as a gentler form of what’s called Straub tail, typically seen in rats given the opioid morphine. This S-shaped curl is also linked to dopamine. When dopamine is blocked, the Straub tail behavior subsides. Natural forms of opiates and dopamine – key players in brain pathways that diminish pain and enhance reward – seem to be telltale ingredients of the elevated tails in our anticipation training program. Observing tail posture in rats adds a new layer to our understanding of rat emotional expression, reminding us that emotions are expressed throughout the entire body. While we can’t directly ask rats whether they like to drive, we devised a behavioral test to assess their motivation to drive. This time, instead of only giving rats the option of driving to the Froot Loop Tree, they could also make a shorter journey on foot – or paw, in this case. Surprisingly, two of the three rats chose to take the less efficient path of turning away from the reward and running to the car to drive to their Froot Loop destination. This response suggests that the rats enjoy both the journey and the rewarding destination. Rat lessons on enjoying the journey We’re not the only team investigating positive emotions in animals. Neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp famously tickled rats, demonstrating their capacity for joy. Research has also shown that desirable low-stress rat environments retune their brains’ reward circuits, such as the nucleus accumbens. When animals are housed in their favored environments, the area of the nucleus accumbens that responds to appetitive experiences expands. Alternatively, when rats are housed in stressful contexts, the fear-generating zones of their nucleus accumbens expand. It is as if the brain is a piano the environment can tune. Neuroscientist Curt Richter also made the case for rats having hope. In a study that wouldn’t be permitted today, rats swam in glass cylinders filled with water, eventually drowning from exhaustion if they weren’t rescued. Lab rats frequently handled by humans swam for hours to days. Wild rats gave up after just a few minutes. If the wild rats were briefly rescued, however, their survival time extended dramatically, sometimes by days. It seemed that being rescued gave the rats hope and spurred them on. The driving rats project has opened new and unexpected doors in my behavioral neuroscience research lab. While it’s vital to study negative emotions such as fear and stress, positive experiences also shape the brain in significant ways. As animals – human or otherwise – navigate the unpredictability of life, anticipating positive experiences helps drive a persistence to keep searching for life’s rewards. In a world of immediate gratification, these rats offer insights into the neural principles guiding everyday behavior. Rather than pushing buttons for instant rewards, they remind us that planning, anticipating and enjoying the ride may be key to a healthy brain. That’s a lesson my lab rats have taught me well.

If you meet a cat on the street and it raises its tail like this, it will also probably come up to you. A cat that sweeps the tail back and fort, often with the end of it a bit jerky is probably afraid, angry, hesitant and does not want to engage. It should be left alone unless you want to feel the sharp end of those retractable razor blades. Cats also use the same patterns between each other. And interestingly some dogs use the same patterns too. Tiger puppies seem to do this also (as seen in documentaries). So, at least to me, there seems to be common 'language' to express feelings and interests between some animals equipped with tails.

As good as it sounds, I have my reservations about it showing \"that a fish has the cognitive capability to navigate outside its natural environment\". Rather it seems to me the fish is just swimming in the direction of the treat, as it would do _inside_ its natural environment, and the car translates that directional push - I don't see a real \"driving\" coordination in the sense of a motoric abstraction based on a learning of cause and effect. I doubt the fish are in any way \"aware\" of what's happening, or even that it's happening distinctly outside their environment. They're just swimming instinctively, adopting to what I imagine might a feel like a strong breaking current and a boop on the nose. Some might be more adept at this than others. After all they're captive animals that probably don't have much experience navigating challenging environments, not even aquatic ones. I highly suspect \"driving\" via levers or buttons like the rats do would be beyond of what can be reasonably expected from a goldfish brain anyway. As a kind of mental cross-check of the claim, I'd expect, say, a moth to be able to \"drive\" just the same way towards a light - and it would be pretty obvious there's no deeper cognition involved. reply crooked-v 12 hours agoparentprevMy armchair biologist thought is to wonder if there's a common thread of balancing (on water currents, air currents, slippery surfaces, etc) that translates into fairly easily understanding how to direct vehicles. reply grahamj 14 hours agoprevAmazing!

Self driving cars are not going to be rolled out that widely for a while. Also, moving away from car centric infrastructure doesn't mean that cars are getting banned. That's such a weird US centric take I see way too often. Here in the Netherlands, we arguably have some of the most bike and pedestrian friendly infrastructure in the world. Guess what, we also have a very well respected car infrastructure with high quality highways and connections. Focussing on other modes of transport isn't banning cars, it is making cars optional for those who choose to do so. Or worded differently, it gives people a choice.

I am glad to see them move to four cables though-- two + weights was a nice bit of math but not so great as physics. If you're looking at this, think hard about whether it's possible to cut a router template for what you want to do on a normal sized 2.5D CNC router. It's what I do and is good enough to build a business around. reply johnobrien1010 2 hours agoparentWhat business did you build around it? reply debatem1 1 hour agorootparentCustom forms for concrete pours. Also did a little bit of work making supports for plaster casting. I was never really able to sell the advantages to artists, but got some good side gig money for landscaping stuff. (Just to clarify: the business is wound down, but I personally still use the approach in art projects) reply buildsjets 3 hours agoprevThis looks like it provides an amazing amount of capability for the price, if it meets your needs. ($525 kit + $125 motor, saved you some clicking). For comparison I have an Avid 48x96 bed type CNC router that I am into for close to $10k. Obviously the more expensive machine has more cutting capability, but I am curious what the actual accuracy of this machine is. I am getting +/- 0.010” or so for large parts, cutting .032” thick aluminum 6061-T3. Probably doing better than that on wood due to lower cutting forces and less machine deflection. reply emilecantin 3 hours agoparent$125 motor? What are you talking about? The kit costs $525, and yes you need to supply a trim router (they recommend the Dewalt DWP611 which I paid $269 CAD for, but members of the community have successfully used other ones) which you might already have. You also need to build a frame, or add anchors to your shop floor. This can run you from a few tens of dollars for concrete anchors to $300+ if you want to build something fancier. reply buildsjets 2 hours agorootparentA Dewalt DWP611 costs me $128.99 USD with free shipping and it can be on my doorstop by 4AM. I’m sorry that you live in a country with an economy is managed such that that the same motor costs you more than double, but you are the outlier in this dataset. Maybe next year when the tariffs kick in, we in the US can be lucky enough to pay 269 USD for something that costs 129 USD currently. https://a.co/d/6LVfRAI reply emilecantin 1 hour agorootparentOh okay, you call routers \"motors\"; that's what threw me off. But yeah, price-gouging in Canada is nothing new; even factoring exchange rates it should be ~180 CAD. reply FlyingAvatar 15 hours agoprevI backed the original Maslow and also the Maslow 4, and recently a 4.1 upgrade. The creator is a really dedicated guy and the Maslow is a great CNC for those who cut sheets goods from wood (though folks have adapted it to other materials) and are OK with some tinkering. There is a decent sized community that supports the software as well. reply bradly 13 hours agoparentHow straight are its cuts? I've used traditional large 10'x5' woodworking CNCs and found them very challenging if not using them daily. reply FlyingAvatar 3 hours agorootparentI don't have direct experience with long, straight cuts in my use case, but based on what I have seen in the forums the Maslow 4 is pretty good at them. It has an auto-calibration feature that the original did not have which makes it much less finicky to dial in than the original Maslow. In the forums, I have seen people cutting cabinet parts with it, so I have to assume the straightness is acceptable, but it might be worth asking those who are using it for that purpose specifically. reply mhb 15 hours agoprevThis is what it actually does: https://www.maslowcnc.com/about-maslow4 reply throwaway81523 15 hours agoparentAha, a plunge router attached to a Roomba j/k ;). That page is very helpful. Hard to say what it's good for unless you're a dedicated woodwork buff. Otherwise a jigsaw seems like enough for a lot of this. reply cpwright 3 hours agorootparentThere was a Roomba equivalent company out there, which would have wheels that drive the motor around, but they never shipped. Maslow moves itself by pulling on belts on fixed anchor points. The Shaper Origin has you move the machine, and it makes corrections using machine vision to track its position. It will give you more accuracy than a Maslow; but at a much greater cost and more attention. A jig saw does not make as clean cuts as a router, and you need to have the workpiece suspend so the blade can go through the work. With a router, you can just have a spoilboard underneath. reply zharknado 13 hours agorootparentprevCapabilities that would be most impressive with a jigsaw: - 50mm of z-axis travel - Cuts in the center of a 4x8’ sheet of material - Repeatable cuts to a decent tolerance - Cuts made while you sleep reply diggan 6 hours agorootparent> - Cuts made while you sleep Can you leave the Maslow completely unattended?

Anyway, I want a machine like this that can paint. reply etskinner 6 hours agorootparentThere's a little bit of feedback: Each belt has a rotary encoder to track position, and the motors apply positive torque rather than positive position. This is in contrast to how stepper motors work on a 3d printer, for example. reply mhb 5 hours agorootparentprev> Anyway, I want a machine like this that can paint. https://youtu.be/osUTMnDFV30?si=wLUXKoyTDgfZELKu reply amelius 2 hours agorootparentHeh, nice, from the guy who also made a wacky hair cutting robot.

That would make it more user-friendly. reply jansan 12 hours agoparentprevI am confused. In some videos it is hanging vertically by two wires, but here it seems there are four wires and it works horizontally. Are people using both setups? reply emilecantin 5 hours agorootparentThere are 2 Maslow versions: V1 was hanging from 2 chains, and \"4\" is held from the 4 corners of the workspace, allowing it to be used both in the vertical and horizontal orientation. V1 also had the electronics & motors on the frame, while V4 moved everything on the sled itself. This enables the option for the \"frame\" to be basically just 4 anchors on your garage floor, which makes this a very flexible machine. reply linsomniac 4 hours agorootparentprevnearly vertical.

Horizontal is fine. reply xarope 10 hours agorootparentprevIn the about link (above), they do mention the frame: \"If you would like to build the frame shown in the video, that frame is 12' feet, by 2’ by 7’ tall.\" reply etskinner 6 hours agorootparentprevYes, they support either setup, vertical or horizontal reply penneyd 34 minutes agoprevFor a full sheet low cost CNC the v4 LowRider is hard to beat https://docs.v1e.com/lowrider/ reply KeplerBoy 9 hours agoprevI would love to see an opensource handheld cnc router akin to the shaper origin. https://www.shapertools.com/en-us/origin reply TKnab 4 hours agoparentThere is this https://www.compassrouter.com Repo here: https://github.com/camchaney/handheld-cnc Not at all associated with the project, just came across it the other day.

Discovered the Lowrider 3d printed CNC a couple of months back which better fit the bill for me to be able to store (printing gantry on a shelf, bed suspended from the ceiling!) so hoping soon that'll enable some of the projects I had in mind for the Maslow. reply jollyllama 5 hours agoprevA noble goal, but what is the tradeoffs on a home/small biz hacker setting up one of these vs. trying to pick up a comparable used solution? Existing CNCs can run for decades with the right maintenance. It's not my area of expertise but gcode seems pretty standard too. reply jkestner 4 hours agoparentI got the Maslow because I didn’t see any other solutions to let me cut a 4 x 8 sheet in a small space for that cost. reply cjaackie 10 hours agoprevI was skeptical of the safety of building this until I saw it was an off the shelf dewalt with special parts installed. It’s more reassuring that it’s core has been through rigorous testing by a reputable manufacturer. reply ynoxinul 9 hours agoprevClassic CNC routers use massive frame and rails to eliminate play. How is this thing supposed to be precise if it just hangs on four cables? reply emilecantin 5 hours agoparentCables are kevlar-reinforced belts and the machine knows how long they are and how much tension in on them so it's relatively easy to compute how much they'd stretch under most conditions. The frame these belts are mounted on still needs to be stiff, though. A concrete floor is a pretty good option. reply Animats 12 hours agoprevI saw something like this about ten years ago. It was vertical, instead of horizontal. The workpiece was set up on a big slanted easel, and the router unit was supported by only two cables, with gravity pulling it downward. The cable drives were fixed, rather than being on the cutting head, so the cutting head was just a router and a mechanism to push it away from the workpiece. Simple. reply hatsix 12 hours agoparentProbably the first version.

Looks it like comes with a 0.6mm nozzle, but optionally can put a 1mm nozzle on it. From what I remember of youtube reviewers, plenty of problems though, as the first of its kind. Hopefully they get fixed, but not sure you'd want to get it now if you just want to print. reply numpad0 12 hours agoparentprev1mm nozzles and long leadscrews are generally AliExpress available. Frame and Z-axis rigidity, vibration damping are going to be complicated, but super stretching an existing 0.4mm CoreXY to, say, 300x300x600mm, isn't that complicated in principle. reply wespiser_2018 11 hours agorootparentThe other issue is the heating element. As the nozzle size gets larger, the rate limiting factor is no longer the motion system and whatever adaptive control, but how fast you can melt the plastic. Most consumer 3d printers can't really take advantage of these large size nozzles, although you could print slowly and it'd still be cool! reply CarVac 7 hours agorootparentYou want a really long meltzone like a Chube hotend. reply imtringued 4 hours agoparentprevI hope you're prepared to spend thousands of dollars on filament. reply dyauspitr 15 hours agoprevI wonder if it’s possible to have a purely portable system like this.

It would need to correct for wheels losing traction, slope etc. reply WillAdams 15 hours agoparentWhat you are describing is the Goliath CNC: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2130625347/goliath-cnc-... didn't really make it over the long haul. The Shaper Origin seems more successful: https://www.shapertools.com/en-us reply hatsix 12 hours agorootparentShaper Origin took a genius approach. There's very little movement of the cutting head, and the machine itself is moved by the person. You get the precision of CNC, without the complexity of moving a machine that is heavy enough to push a cutter through wood over an uneven surface reply ano-ther 5 hours agorootparentprevI guess the wheeled approach quickly loses traction when trying to exert force. The Shaper Origin avoids that by being hand-pushed (with human-level force feedback and control). reply imtringued 4 hours agorootparentThe entire point of wheels is to provide as little rolling resistance as possible. The very idea of Goliath is contradictory. You want stiffness and rigidity, while also being free to move around. The only way their system could work is by having a vacuum clamping system with a movable gantry. reply emilecantin 2 hours agoparentprevThis one is relatively portable; everything is self-contained on the sled. It just needs four anchors points, and it'll auto-detect where they are in relation to each other during the calibration process. A lot of users just have 4 concrete anchors on their garage floor, and they put the sled away in a drawer somewhere when not in use. reply ranger_danger 15 hours agoprev> The included power supply will work with 110-240 volts. What about 100V for Japan? reply buildsjets 3 hours agoparentIt’s 2024. You can buy a voltage/phase converter off of aliexpress and convert any random input voltage and phase to any random output voltage and phase for a pretty trivial expense. I’m using a 5kW one to run a 208v 3 phase motor off of 220v one phase in my shop, it cost maybe $100 or so. reply mdaniel 13 hours agoparentprevI had no idea that was a thing - I guess the great thing about standards: so many to choose from :-( That being said, to the very best of my knowledge (all 30 minutes of surfing around their project site :-D ) they only recommend the Dewalt routers, but I'd bet it would work just fine with whatever local router you could get at your Japanese hardware store that is already set up for 100V reply hatsix 11 hours agorootparentThe Dewalt recommendation is pretty strong. The router needs to be the right size to be clamped into the machine. There are some people on the forums who have had luck adapting a proper CNC cutting head, but you won't find that down at your local hardware store. reply numpad0 12 hours agoparentprevIt's just a cheap brushed motor, it'll run at 100V just fine... reply Giorgi 11 hours agoprev [–] Very limited practical application. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
